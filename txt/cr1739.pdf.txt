IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Angola
On January 23, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Angola.
The oil price shock that started in mid-2014 has substantially reduced fiscal revenue and exports.
Growth was estimated to come to a halt in 2016, with the non-oil sector contracting by ½ percent
dragged down by the industrial, construction, and services sectors; industrial production, despite
the potential for import substitution, was constrained by shortages of imported inputs due to
limited availability of foreign exchange. Annual inflation was estimated to reach 45 percent by
end 2016—the highest rate in over a decade—reflecting higher domestic fuel prices, a weaker
kwanza, and the lagged effects of loose monetary conditions until the first half of the year. Nonoil primary balance in 2015-16 showed an improvement of 18 percent of GDP mainly through
spending rationalization. The current account deficit, which peaked at 10 percent of GDP in
2015, is projected to be halved in 2016-17, as imports continue adjusting to limited availability
of foreign exchange. International reserves are declining but remain relatively comfortable.
Meanwhile, a wide spread between the parallel and primary market exchange rates remains,
pointing to a significant imbalance in the foreign exchange market.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that the oil price shock that started in 2014 has substantially reduced
fiscal revenue and exports, while growth has stopped and inflation has accelerated. Directors
commended the authorities for taking steps to mitigate the impact of the shock, but urged further
measures to stabilize macroeconomic conditions and address more forcefully the dependence on
oil and diversify the economy.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Directors welcomed the significant non-oil primary fiscal consolidation to date, but stressed that
continued fiscal adjustment will be needed going forward to put public debt on a clear downward
path while supporting economic growth over the medium term. Directors urged concerted efforts
to contain the growth of the wage bill, improve the quality of public investment, continue
streamlining subsidies while expanding well-targeted social assistance for the poor, and
strengthen nonoil revenue, including by implementing a VAT in due course. They also
emphasized the need to clear domestic payments arrears and welcomed plans to restructure stateowned enterprises. Directors noted that adopting a medium-term fiscal framework would help
reduce the pro-cyclicality of public spending and improve investment planning.
Directors underscored that monetary and exchange rate policies should play a central role in
rebalancing the foreign exchange market. They welcomed the recent measures taken by the
central bank to tighten liquidity conditions, but saw a need to enhance the monetary policy
framework to better anchor inflation expectations and facilitate a transition to greater exchange
rate flexibility. Directors underscored that a more flexible exchange rate coupled with supportive
monetary and fiscal policies will be crucial in addressing foreign exchange market imbalances
while containing inflation. Directors urged the phased elimination of the exchange restrictions
and multiple currency practices.
Directors emphasized the need to preserve the health of the banking sector. They supported the
authorities’ efforts to strengthen the bank supervision and resolution frameworks. Directors
recommended conducting rigorous asset quality reviews, and welcomed the authorities’ actions
to ensure that weaker banks are recapitalized. They noted that the plan to restructure and
recapitalize the systemically-important state-owned BPC bank is an important step.
Directors stressed the need to address the effects of the loss of U.S. dollar correspondent banking
relationships (CBRs). They welcomed the high-level dialogue the authorities have been pursuing
with the home authorities of global correspondent banks to better understand regulatory
expectations around CBRs. At the same time, Directors noted that the central bank should step
up its data collection and analysis; develop contingency plans to mitigate the risks from, and
address the drivers of, the loss of CBRs; and further strengthen the prudential and AML/CFT
frameworks.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ reform agenda to tackle the constraints to economic
diversification including through infrastructure and human capital development. They
emphasized that these measures should be complemented by enhancing the business
environment and strengthening governance, including efforts to address corruption-related risks,
to foster private investment and inclusive growth.
Directors encouraged the authorities to address remaining gaps in the production of economic
data.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 23, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context and outlook: The oil price shock that started in mid-2014 has substantially
reduced fiscal revenue and exports, with growth coming to a halt and inflation
accelerating sharply. This has brought to the forefront the need to address more
forcefully vulnerabilities and dependence on oil, and to diversify the economy. The
authorities have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the external shock: an 18 percent
of GDP improvement in the non-oil primary fiscal balance over 2015-16, mainly through
spending cuts including the removal of fuel subsidies, has been implemented; and the
kwanza has been devalued against the U.S. dollar by over 40 percent since September
2014, with international reserves being used to smooth the depreciation. However, the
exchange rate has been re-pegged since April 2016 leading to an appreciation of the
kwanza in real terms, and further policy actions are needed to continue adjusting the
economy to the ‘new normal’ in the oil market and to return growth to a level consistent
with poverty reduction.
Focus of consultation: Discussions focused on policies to tackle macroeconomic
imbalances while promoting financial stability, economic diversification, and growth.
Key policy recommendations:










Target an overall fiscal deficit for 2017 of less than 2¼ percent of GDP, consistent
with an improvement in the non-oil primary fiscal balance by 1 percent of GDP.
Over the medium term, target an improvement in the non-oil primary fiscal balance
by 1 percent of GDP annually consistent with placing debt on a clearly declining
path. This could be achieved by mobilizing additional non-oil taxes, and reducing
current spending and increasing public investment while improving its efficiency.
Adopt an improved medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF), focusing on spending
rules and a well-designed fiscal stabilization fund to reduce spending pro-cyclicality.
Move to a flexible but managed exchange rate regime to urgently address
significant imbalances in the foreign exchange market, and develop a clear timetable
for removal of exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices.
Adopt a reserve money target consistent with the inflation objective.
Increase financial sector resilience by strengthening bank supervision, resolution and
AML/CFT frameworks, and closing or recapitalizing weaker banks.
Promote economic diversification by improving the business environment, and by
strengthening the role of the private sector in rebuilding infrastructure.

BACKGROUND
1.
Angola is a post-conflict country—decades of hostilities ended in 2002—with
significant infrastructure and human capital deficits. Oil receipts underpinned strong growth in
the last decade, but have also made the country vulnerable to oil revenue volatility. Progress was
made in reducing poverty rates from 54 percent in 2000 to 43 percent in 2008. However, inequality
has increased. Following elections in 2012, the government has embarked on a National
Development Plan (NDP) that puts priority on a large expansion of infrastructure spending to
support economic diversification and inclusive growth. However, spending is well below that
stipulated in the NDP. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for August 2017, and the top name of
the winning party’s list of candidates will become the next President of the Republic.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND
RISKS
2.

The economy has been severely affected by lower international oil prices:



Growth slowed to 3 percent in 2015, driven by a very sharp slowdown in non-oil activity to 1½
percent as the industrial, construction, and services sectors adjusted to cuts in private
consumption and public investment amid more limited availability of foreign exchange, and
agriculture underperformed its potential due to supply shocks. High frequency economic
activity indicators point to a deeper slowdown in 2016, with the business confidence reaching
all-time lows in the second and third quarters of 2016.



Inflation reached 41 percent in November 2016, year-on-year, reflecting a weaker kwanza,
higher domestic fuel prices, and loose monetary conditions until the first half of the year.



Fiscal policy was tightened. The overall fiscal deficit narrowed to 3¼ percent of GDP in 2015,
with the non-oil primary fiscal balance improving by 12¼ percent of GDP given large
reductions in spending on subsidies,1 goods and services, and investment. Budget underexecution in the first nine months of 2016 led to an additional improvement in the non-oil
primary fiscal balance, but an estimated 3 percent of GDP in domestic payments arrears
have accumulated.



The BNA tightened monetary policy recently. Base money contracted by 3 percent in
October 2016, year-on-year, from an expansion of 25 percent in May 2016, and banking

1

The Government has been implementing a well-designed fuel subsidy reform. On December 31, 2015, domestic
fuel prices were increased for the fourth time since September 2014. With this latest increase, subsidies on diesel
were fully eliminated and the price of diesel liberalized, adding this product to already liberalized gasoline, asphalt,
and light and heavy fuel oil prices. LPG and kerosene domestic prices were also increased on the occasion, but
remain subsidized at about 40 percent and 10 percent, respectively.

sector excess liquidity declined to ⅓ percent of GDP in November 2016, from 1½ percent of
GDP in May 2016. Short-term interest rates, however, remain negative in real terms.


The health of the banking system deteriorated driven by slower growth. The banking
system’s capital adequacy ratio declined to 18¾ percent in September 2016 compared to
19¾ percent in December 2015, while NPLs increased to 15¼ percent from 11½ percent
during the same period, reflecting lower ability of corporates to meet obligations as growth
slowed. Commercial banks have managed to contain a more significant deterioration of
financial stability indicators (FSIs) through increased provisioning and stricter underwriting
to mitigate credit risk, and some corporate loan restructuring. In September 2016, five
banks, including the systemically-important state-owned BPC, were undercapitalized and
needed to meet prudential requirements.



The external current account deficit widened, but net international reserves (NIR) remained
relatively comfortable at US$24¼ billion at end-2015. The external current account deficit
reached 10 percent of GDP in 2015, compared to 3 percent of GDP in 2014, as lower exports
were only partially offset by lower imports. The trade balance improved in the first ten
months of 2016, as lower exports were offset by a sharper import contraction. NIR declined
to US$20⅓ billion in November 2016, as the BNA increased its sales of foreign exchange
(forex) amid shortages in the market, financed in part by US$2 billion (with 2-5 year terms) in
Repo transactions, using some of its reserve assets (U.S. Treasury bonds) as collateral.2



Significant imbalances in the forex market remain. Despite a devaluation of the official
exchange rate against the U.S. dollar of more than 40 percent between September 2014 and
April 2016,3 and BNA’s increased provision of forex to the market in recent months, the
parallel-official exchange rate spread has remained high and volatile (190 percent in
November 2016),4 and the backlog of forex purchase orders in the banking system is
estimated conservatively at about US$3 billion.

3.
The outlook for 2016 is adverse. Growth is projected to have come to a halt, with the nonoil sector contracting by ½ percent dragged down by the industrial, construction, and services
sectors; industrial production, despite the potential for import substitution, is constrained by
shortages of imported inputs due to limited forex availability. Annual inflation is expected to reach
45 percent by end-2016—the highest rate in over a decade—reflecting higher domestic fuel prices,
a weaker kwanza, and the lagged effects of loose monetary conditions until the first half of 2016,
despite an improvement of 5¾ percent of GDP in the non-oil primary fiscal balance in 2016.

2

These transactions have no effect on the NIR level as the BNA’s loss of liquid assets—since securities used as
collateral are not liquid during the contract period—is offset by its cash borrowing. Consistent with STA
recommended methodology, however, gross reserves increase as a result of such transactions.
3

The kwanza has been re-pegged to the U.S. dollar since April 2016.

4

The parallel market rate should not be interpreted as the equilibrium rate as this is a very thin market with a narrow
subset of transactions in banknotes.

Linkages from the real sector to the financial sector are limited. As noted above,
commercial banks have been affected by the economic slowdown, leading to higher NPLs. The
private credit linkages from the financial sector to the real sector have become less significant
recently due in part to increased credit risk with banks in particular reducing consumer and
mortgage lending as well as reducing loans to mining and construction. Historically, the level of
credit to the private sector has been relatively low, with banks channeling to the private sector less
than a half of their domestic assets. As economic growth slows, banks are further tightening lending
standards and this may delay, at the margin, a recovery.
5.
Under the baseline scenario, the outlook for 2017 is slightly better, but subject to
downside risks. Growth would pick up to 1¼ percent in 2017, with the non-oil sector expanding by
the same magnitude due to higher public spending and better terms-of-trade. Inflation would
decline to 20 percent by end-2017, assuming tight monetary conditions, no further domestic fuel
price increases, and a stable kwanza. NIR is projected to decline further to US$17½ billion.
6.
Under the staff’s proposed adjustment scenario discussed below, growth is projected
to accelerate at a faster pace and inflation to decline to single digits over the medium term.
While slower in the near term, non-oil growth would increase over time reflecting, in addition to
improved terms-of-trade and the completion of several important projects, a more competitive real
effective exchange rate (REER)5 and a faster pace of implementation of structural reforms, including
a more forceful improvement in the business environment leading to increased private investment.
Inflation is projected to decline as monetary policy is tightened upfront more aggressively, returning
to the BNA’s annual inflation objective of 7-9 percent at the end of the projection period. Delaying
the needed policy adjustment measures until 2018—after a new government is formed following the
elections—is likely to increase the cost of adjustment and delay its future benefits.
7.
This medium-term outlook under the baseline scenario is not without risks and is not
the desirable outcome. Growth is projected to remain barely positive and below population
growth, inflation is expected to decline only gradually, fiscal space would be limited, and imbalances
in the forex market would remain. Angola faces the challenge of balancing the pressures from lower
oil revenue compared to 2010-13 levels and high demand for much needed improvements in the
country’s physical infrastructure and human capital and poverty alleviation. This will require a better
balance between current and capital spending rationalization, making fiscal consolidation more
sustainable over the medium term. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that Angola’s public
debt remains sustainable but is highly sensitive to shocks, including to the international price of oil,
real GDP growth, financial contingent liability, and the exchange rate.
8.
Risks are tilted to the downside (Risk Assessment Matrix). They include lower oil prices,
difficulties to control spending in the run-up to next year’s elections, continued imbalances in the
forex market, a sustained period of low growth with limited opportunities to address social needs,

global banks’ withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships (CBRs), delays in the
recapitalization of weaker banks, and slippages in the implementation of structural reforms.
9.
Spillovers: Outward spillovers to the region are generally limited given Angola’s marginal
trade and financial flows with countries in the region, although a few countries, such as the
Democratic Republic of Congo and Namibia, which border Angola, are being more affected by the
economic difficulties in Angola through cross-border trade. Although Angola is Portugal’s largest
export market outside the EU and several Portuguese banks are present in the Angolan banking
system through joint-ventures with local investors, the magnitude of these interests remain
relatively small if compared with the size of the Portuguese economy. On the other hand, inward
spillovers from China and Europe could be tangible if their economic growth significantly slows
down, putting further downward pressure on oil prices.

Authorities’ views
10.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s overall assessment of the outlook and risks.
But they expect growth to be stronger and headline inflation lower than staff’s baseline scenario.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
The oil price shock that started in mid-2014 has brought to the forefront the need to
address dependence on oil, diversify the economy, and reduce vulnerabilities. As a result of the
decline in oil prices, fiscal revenue and exports fell substantially, output growth came to a halt, and
inflation accelerated sharply. The policy steps taken to mitigate the impact of the external shock
have been significant, including an improvement of 18 percent of GDP in the non-oil primary fiscal
balance over 2015-16; and devaluation of the kwanza vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar by over 40 percent
since September 2014. However, further policy actions are needed to continue adjusting the
economy to the 'new normal' in the international oil market, including additional but gradual fiscal
consolidation over the medium term; greater exchange rate flexibility and tight monetary conditions
to address lingering imbalances in the forex market while restoring price stability; and supporting
greater diversification of the economy to strengthen resilience to future oil price shocks.
Vulnerabilities in the banking system also need to be addressed.

A. Fiscal Policy under the ‘New Normal’
12.
An overall fiscal deficit of the magnitude envisaged in the draft budget for 2017
would leave the economy vulnerable to lower-than-projected oil prices and heightened
concerns about public debt sustainability.6 For 2017, targeting an overall fiscal deficit of no more
than 2¼ percent of GDP that is consistent with an improvement of at least 1 percent of GDP in the
non-oil primary fiscal balance—in line with the gradual adjustment that would be needed over the

medium term to put public debt on a clear downward path—could be achieved through additional
spending rationalization. The following measures could be considered to achieve this objective: (i)
granting no wage increase (⅔ percent of GDP vis-à-vis the baseline scenario); (ii) using for deficit
reduction the wage bill savings from the ongoing biometric census of civil servants (up to ½ percent
of GDP); (iii) further rationalizing spending on goods and services (up to 1 percent of GDP); and (iv)
maintaining the execution of public investment in line with recent (lower) execution rates (¾ percent
of GDP).

Over the medium term, permanently lower oil revenue needs to be offset by
expenditure rationalization and higher non-oil revenue; and fiscal institutions need to be
strengthened to properly manage oil revenue volatility. Important steps have been already taken
in this direction, including the comprehensive program to gradually eliminate fuel subsidies and
reforms to strengthen non-oil revenue, including by enlarging the tax base; creating a single
revenue administration agency; strengthening tax inspections; and better enforcing real estate
taxation. The following additional policies and structural fiscal reforms would be needed to cement
medium-term fiscal sustainability:


Targeting a non-oil primary fiscal consolidation path of 1 percent of GDP annually over the
medium term which, under current assumptions regarding international oil prices, would be
consistent with eliminating the overall fiscal deficit by 2018 and placing debt on a clearly
declining path.



Strengthening the credibility of the Law on Public Debt by introducing an escape clause to
the 60 percent of GDP debt ceiling when the economy is subject to a large exogenous
shock, while introducing a transparent mechanism to ensure convergence over time to the
60 percent of GDP debt ceiling.



Strengthening the ongoing efforts to enlarge the tax base, improve tax inspections, and
better enforce real estate taxation; and introducing a VAT on January 1, 2019 (Box 1). If
implemented diligently, a VAT would provide a stable revenue source for the budget,

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANGOLA

reducing the budget's heavy dependency on oil revenue and shielding it better from oil
revenue volatility.


Using part of the additional fiscal space to expand well-targeted social programs for the
vulnerable and increasing infrastructure spending in line with absorptive capacity.



Reducing the wage bill as a share of GDP, as the size of the public administration is
streamlined and reformed by focusing on the efficient provision of public goods; aligning
wage increases in the public sector with productivity gains and performance indicators.



Adjusting domestic fuel prices to reflect increases (or decreases) in international gasoline
and diesel prices and taking into account movements in the exchange rate.7



Eliminating electricity and water tariff subsidies as ongoing investments increase the supply
of both products, while adopting lifeline rates to protect the poor.



Improving the quality of public investment through enhancing compliance of the public
investment management process with existing legislation; prioritizing and monitoring the
execution of projects; conducting ex-ante and ex-post project evaluations; improving
technical capacity to select and monitor projects; and developing a database of reference
prices to better assess the cost of projects.



Adopting an improved medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) focusing on spending rules
and a well-designed fiscal stabilization fund with clear deposit and withdrawal rules would
contribute to smoothing oil revenue volatility and reduce pro-cyclicality of spending in the
future. In addition, the MTFF should assess spending needs associated with maintaining and
running investment projects once those are completed, and investment projects should only
be approved and started if there is fiscal space for their (future) current spending needs.



Staff estimates that the domestic price of gasoline and diesel should be adjusted immediately by about 40 percent
to restore the authorities’ commitment to eliminate explicit (or implicit) subsidies to these products.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANGOLA

Box 1. Angola: Broadening the Tax Base
Angola’s tax base remains heavily dependent on oil revenues, that even after the oil price collapse, contributed 56
percent of total revenues. Key component of the non-oil revenue base is a consumption tax (IC) with a very narrow
base. It excludes the activities of the primary sector of the economy; the value added by the commercial sector, in
particular, the part of the value added to the manufacturing sector that corresponds to profit; and some services.
Although the standard rate of the IC is 10 percent, many products are subject to a reduced rate (2 percent), most
services are taxed at 5 percent, and other rates range from 15 to 80 percent. Moreover, there is a stamp duty
whose main incidence is on invoices.
The authorities are considering replacing the IC with a VAT. Possible reform could include: (i) the adoption of a
single positive VAT rate (with the zero rate applying exclusively to exports); (ii) the introduction of an excise tax;
(iii) the elimination of about 50 percent of the incidence of the stamp duty; (iv) a reform of the tax on property
transfers (SISA) to avoid double taxation; and (v) a very high threshold for the VAT (the equivalent in kwanzas to an
annual gross revenue of $250,000) since an existing law already excludes businesses with lower gross revenues
from keeping accounting procedures that are necessary to comply with VAT regulations, and because a high
threshold would facilitate the introduction and management of the VAT. Preliminary rough estimates suggest that
a VAT rate of 10 percent could yield about 2.5 percent of GDP in revenue to Angola.
Staff estimates that the VAT could be introduced as early as January 1, 2019 but it is important to ensure
appropriate preparation prior to implementation: the Tax Authority (AGT) needs to strengthen its institutional
capacity; AGT staff training and communication with taxpayers and other stakeholders will need to be improved.
Moreover, the VAT should only be implemented after new IT systems for customs and domestic tax administration
are put in place, tested, and prepared.

Authorities’ views
14.
The authorities did not dispute the need for fiscal consolidation over the medium
term, but stressed the urgent need in the near term to support growth after two years of
fiscal retrenchment. Consequently, a mildly expansionary budget for 2017 has been approved by
the National Assembly. They noted that public debt remains manageable and the needed increase in
infrastructure investment can be financed. At the same time, they are committed to scaling back
public spending from budgeted levels, if external funding is not forthcoming as projected. The
authorities remain interested in working closely with the Fund on fiscal structural reform, including a
VAT, although they believe a VAT may take up to four years to be introduced in Angola. The
authorities mentioned that they are in the process of closing 48 SOEs that are nonoperational and
privatizing 53 others. In addition, a restructuring plan for Sonangol was launched in June 2016 to be
implemented over 24 months. The newly appointed Board plans to refocus Sonangol on its core oil
and gas businesses while making the company more transparent and efficient.

B. Enhancing the Monetary Policy Framework
15.
Greater exchange rate flexibility supported by tight monetary conditions remains
critical to orderly address forex market imbalances and provide a nominal anchor to the
economy. The large imbalances in the forex market, if unaddressed, could lead to a disorderly
adjustment of the exchange rate, a sharp acceleration in inflation, and bank losses given the still
somewhat high level of dollarization in the economy. The external balance assessment (EBA) shows
that the REER was overvalued by 8 percent to 42 percent in 2015. The REER is projected to have

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANGOLA

depreciated by only 2 percent in 2016 and, absent a policy change, appreciate by 20-25 percent in
2017. Measures to help enhance the monetary policy framework with the aim of supporting a
smooth transition to a more flexible exchange rate regime include:


Adopting a managed float from a position of strength given the still relatively comfortable
level of international reserves. While the exchange rate may overshoot initially, it would
stabilize at a level consistent with correcting the estimated REER overvaluation, if supporting
fiscal and monetary policies are in place.



Unwinding the administrative measures adopted last year, including giving priority access to
forex purchases, as greater exchange rate flexibility is introduced. These restrictions have
encouraged misallocation of resources and exacerbated the scarcity of necessary imported
inputs, constraining growth and adding to inflationary pressures.



Shifting to a base money target consistent with the inflation objective and proactively
conducting monetary operations to achieve the target and anchor inflation expectations. In
particular, base money growth should be kept close to zero over the next several months to
break inflation expectations, bringing three-month T-bill rates to positive territory in real
terms.



Conducting monetary policy operations independently to bring credibility to the new
monetary policy framework.



Enhancing liquidity forecasting and management capacity, being more proactively engaged
in open market operations, and strengthening coordination with the ministry of finance to
mitigate the impact of fiscal operations on monetary conditions and facilitating the BNA to
achieve the base money target.

16.
Additional efforts to strengthen monetary policy are critical to enhance policy
effectiveness and contain vulnerabilities, including:


Narrowing the policy interest rate corridor to 500 bps to enhance traction of its monetary
policy decisions and make monetary policy more effective, and adjusting the interest rate
policy, as needed, to signal the policy stance to the interbank and T-bill markets.



Maintaining ongoing efforts to improve inflation forecasting and liquidity management,
including by lengthening the horizon of the daily liquidity forecasting exercise to a rolling
monthly period.

Authorities’ views
17.
The authorities agreed that monetary conditions should remain tight in coming
months, but considered important at the present time to preserve the exchange rate peg to
help contain inflation given the high pass-through of the exchange rate to prices. The

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

ANGOLA

authorities reiterated their strong commitment to bring inflation down quickly, noting that monetary
conditions were significantly tightened in recent months and inflation is already subsiding.

C. Strengthening Financial Stability
18.
Angola has also been adversely affected by the loss of U.S. dollar Correspondent
Banking Relationships (CBRs). Since December 2015, global banks discontinued the supply of U.S.
dollar banknotes and withdrew U.S. dollar CBRs with Angolan banks. The last remaining U.S.
correspondent bank which supplied access to two Angolan respondent banks are no longer able to
service their Angolan customers’ U.S. dollar cross-border payment needs. However, Angolan
respondent banks are still able to conduct their own portfolio, treasury, trade finance and some
credit card operations with their U.S. correspondent bank. Angolan subsidiaries of remaining global
U.S. banks are also able to service their Angolan corporate customer needs. These customers are
mainly Angolan operators of global oil, gas, and construction entities. Alternative payment channels
through greater use of nested U.S. dollar and euro CBRs has mitigated the adverse impacts so far,
but risk of losing these payment channels is high.
19.
There is an urgent need to fine-tune policy solutions to address the effects of a sizable
loss of U.S. dollar CBRs (Box 2). The impact on direct access to cross-border finance and payments
for both exports and imports in U.S. dollars could be significant, especially if nested CBRs were also
lost. Several measures could help address this issue:


Mitigating the drivers and risks arising from the loss of CBRs by the BNA stepping up its data
collection and analysis efforts (SWIFT data and BNA Questionnaire), enhancing dialogue with
the private sector and home authorities of global correspondent banks, strengthening the
prudential and AML/CFT framework particularly with regard to corruption-related risks, and
developing contingency plans in coordination with all stakeholders.



Continue to fine-tune policy solutions which may include as a last resort the BNA providing
temporary access to low-risk U.S. dollar transfers but also take into account the legal
constraints and risks to BNA's other key functions. Industry solutions remain the first-best
option. Greater use of nested CBRs will likely prove to be a short-term solution.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANGOLA

Box 2. Angola: Correspondent Banking Relationships Withdrawal
The decision to terminate CBRs in Angola is likely driven by a number of different factors operating concurrently.
For example, retrenchment by global banks since the global financial crisis has led to a reconsideration of the
geographical reach of their business models in light of changed global macroeconomic conditions, regulatory
demands, banks own risk management requirements and the perception of Angola as a higher risk jurisdiction,
including with regard to the proceeds of corruption, have all played a part in a withdrawal of direct U.S. dollar
CBRs.
Angolan respondent banks have responded to loss of direct U.S. dollar CBRs for their customers by finding
alternative payment channels, which has mitigated the adverse macro-financial impacts. There has been a greater
use of nested CBRs in U.S. dollars through intermediary banks in countries such as Portugal and South Africa. In
addition, there has been a much greater use of Euro CBRs for payment flows out of Angola. However, these
alternative payment channels while providing a short-term solution remain in danger of being withdrawn as
compliance concerns of global correspondent banks may not be fully met. Continued strengthening of the
Angolan supervisory and regulatory prudential and AML/CFT framework through addressing existing legal
deficiencies, including with regard to preventative measures for politically exposed persons, active enforcement,
including in conducting risk-based supervision of financial institutions, and better understanding between global
correspondent and Angolan respondent banks on information needs as part of a risk-based approach would
better tackle the perception of Angola as a higher risk jurisdiction.
The authorities have been actively involved in pursuing high-level dialogue with home authorities of global
correspondent banks to better understand regulatory expectations around CBRs. In that context work is underway
to strengthen supervisory and regulatory prudential frameworks and enforcement in line with regional and global
peers. In addition, there has been open public-private sector dialogue on addressing the withdrawal of CBRs and
strengthening AML/CFT frameworks through various local roundtables, workshops including one organized by the
BNA and Fund staff, and at regional groups. Work is also underway at the central bank through a regular data
questionnaire and analysis of CBR payment data with technical assistance input by the Fund to better understand
the nature, scale, and scope of CBR withdrawal to help fine-tune policy solutions.

20.
The banking system needs to be strengthened. While the banking system's solvency
indicators have been deteriorating only gradually they may not be fully reflecting the underlying
deterioration in part due to loan restructuring that is being extended also to some non-viable
companies (ever-greening). In addition, five banks are undercapitalized. It would be important for
the BNA to take the following measures:


Conducting rigorous asset quality reviews linked to stress tests on the largest thirteen banks
(covering about 90 percent of the banking system's assets) on an annual basis to help
identify forward-looking capitalization needs.



Requiring under-capitalized banks to implement action plans and closely monitor their
implementation. In particular, the two banks with negative equity could threaten confidence
on the banking system even though they are relatively small banks. Therefore, these banks
should be immediately recapitalized or resolved.



Bringing to conclusion as soon as possible the process of evaluating the loan portfolio,
restructuring management and operations, and recapitalizing the BPC. Also, the risk
management capacity of BPC needs to be upgraded to ensure that credit underwriting is
strengthened to avoid a repetition of unsustainable asset quality problems.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

ANGOLA



Investigating the extent to which banks are resorting to 'ever-greening' of loans and making
sure this practice is discontinued and bad loans are fully provisioned and written off early.



Strengthening the crisis preparedness scheme—such as the Emergency Liquidity Facilities
and other contingency planning—by completing Crisis Simulation Exercises. Attention needs
to be paid to assessing for operational effectiveness and limitations the emergency liquidity
facilities to support well managed, solvent banks during distress periods.

21.
The authorities have made steady progress on implementing the 2012 Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations especially on governance, supervision, and
resolution mechanism. Supervisory functions have been restructured with dedicated departments
for banking supervision, regulation, foreign exchange supervision, and consumer protection.
Regulations have been issued on consolidated supervision and on banks’ internal controls and
corporate governance requirements. A financial stability committee under the BNA has been
established with the publication of a Financial Stability Report.8 A risk oversight unit is being
established with further enhancements being made for on-site supervision and developments of a
new supervision and licensing manuals in line with a risk-based supervisory approach. The BNA has
also progressed work on aligning banks’ accounting and reporting practices with latest International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Additional work will need to continue to build supervisory
effectiveness with regard to implementation on consolidated supervision, systemic stability analysis,
and operationalization of prompt corrective action procedures and regulations on emergency
liquidity assistance and crisis preparedness.
22.
The authorities are making progress in strengthening the Anti Money Laundering and
Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. Angola was removed from the
Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) list of countries with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies in February
2016, as a result of the progress made in addressing technical items of the action plan agreed with
the FATF.9 The authorities are continuing to work with the regional FATF body (ESSAMLG) to address
the full range of issues identified in its mutual evaluation report. They should continue efforts to
strengthen the AML/CFT framework in line with the FATF 2012 standard, including with regard to
preventive measures on politically exposed persons and risk-based supervision of financial
institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions, ahead of the next AML/CFT
evaluation, tentatively scheduled in 2020.
23.
In addition to existing exchange measures, staff has completed its assessment of the
exchange measures introduced by the authorities during 2015.10 The operation of the priority
list for access to U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate and a special tax of 10% on transfers to
non-residents under contracts for foreign technical assistance or management services both give

rise to exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a). Additionally,
the lack of a mechanism to ensure that the effective exchange rates for transactions that take place
at the reference rate in place and the rate at which transactions take place in the foreign exchange
auction on that day do not deviate by more than 2 percent gives rise to a multiple currency practice
subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 3. Staff encouraged the authorities to remove
these, as well as the existing, exchange measures as soon as possible.
24.
A first-time safeguards assessment of the BNA was completed in 2010. The assessment
found that the BNA is subject to annual external audits by a reputable firm and has taken steps to
address the audit qualifications. Recommendations focused on strengthening governance and
transparency practices, internal audit, and the control framework in the reserves management area.
Since then some progress has been made in addressing safeguards recommendations. In particular,
the BNA has strengthened its internal audit function, and reconstituted its Audit Board. The BNA
published its annual financial statements of 2011 through 2014, but the 2015 audited financial
statements have yet to be published.

Authorities’ views
25.
The authorities agreed with staff’s analysis and recommendations. They are taking steps
to strengthen the banking sector. For example, they have named a new board of directors of BPC
bank and set aside up to 1½ percent of GDP to recapitalize it and clean its bad loan portfolio. They
also agreed with the need to enhance Angola’s AML/CFT framework to help address the concerns
that have contributed to the loss of all direct U.S. dollar CBRs. The authorities have requested
additional Fund technical assistance in this area.

economy while improving governance, and relying more forcefully on market-based allocation of
resources.
27.
The authorities have launched a program targeting sectors considered as having high
import-substitution and/or export-promotion potential. These programs are expected to be
financed through external credit lines contracted by the government that would then be channeled
(on-lent) to the private sector through the state-owned BDA bank. In its initial phase, this program is
facilitating the access of private companies, with the above-mentioned potential, to forex needed to
import intermediate and capital goods. It will be important to define well how project selection is
being conducted and take proper upfront account of risks of non-repayment of the resources that
will be on-lent. This program raises concerns given the potential fiscal cost that it could entail; it
should be temporary; and its progress and implementation should be more transparent, with its cost
disclosed in the annual budget.
28.
In addition, the authorities are implementing reforms to enhance the social protection
system. With the assistance of the EU and UNICEF, the authorities launched in 2015 the APROSOC
Social Protection Program, which aims to improve social assistance for the most vulnerable
population. It intends to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and impact of the national social
assistance interventions in Angola and to strengthen the capacity of the leading sector Ministry
(MINARS) to design and implement a social assistance agenda based on a new sectoral policy
framework. The government also aims to create a Single Social Registry to help identify and target
the poor.

Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities are confident that the measures being implemented to upgrade the
country’s infrastructure, improve its human capital, and strengthen the business climate will
allow the economy to diversify, making growth more inclusive. They have been investing
heavily on infrastructure. They expect two large dams to start producing energy in 2017 and have
started construction of the deep-water port of Cabinda. With the assistance of the World Bank, they
also plan to expand access to water supply and promote agriculture. They expected that the reforms
recently undertaken to facilitate opening a business—such as reducing its cost and timing—should
have been reflected in Angola’s rating in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Survey. The World
Bank continues to work closely with the authorities to help improve their doing business indicators.
The authorities also emphasized the need to accelerate and deepen reforms to promote
diversification. In this context, they have approved 23 targeted programs in the agriculture, industry,
fishing, geology, and telecommunications sectors but argued that their implementation has been
slow and so far only access to forex has been provided to companies.

E. Data Issues
30.
While data provided to the Fund are assessed to be broadly adequate for surveillance,
there is considerable room for improvement in the national accounts, including publication of
quarterly data, balance of payments, producer price indices, monetary statistics, and FSIs.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Significant efforts are needed to improve the quality and timeliness of fiscal data, including the
operational balance of all SOEs. The monitoring of domestic payments arrears should continue to be
improved. Improvements in the quality of economic and social data are essential to better inform
policy makers. In this regard, it will be very important to secure proper funding to INE so it can

The oil price shock that started in mid-2014 has substantially reduced fiscal revenue
and exports, with growth coming to a halt and inflation accelerating sharply. This has brought
to the forefront the need to address more forcefully vulnerabilities and dependence on oil and to
diversify the economy.
32.
Risks to the near term outlook are on the downside. They include lower oil prices beyond
those included in the baseline, difficulties to control spending in the run-up to next year’s elections,
continued imbalances in the forex market, a sustained period of low growth with limited
opportunities to address social needs, global banks’ withdrawal of CBRs, delays in the
recapitalization of weaker banks, and slippages in the implementation of structural reforms.
33.
The authorities have taken policy steps to mitigate the impact of the external shock.
An 18 percent of GDP improvement in the non-oil primary fiscal balance over 2015-16, mainly
through spending cuts including the removal of fuel subsidies were implemented. Public debt,
however, is projected to increase significantly to around 71½ percent of GDP, of which 19 percent of
GDP corresponds to Sonangol, by end-2016, and domestic payments arrears have re-emerged.
Clearing arrears and, over time, reversing this sharp debt increase will be critical. For 2017, targeting
an overall fiscal deficit of no more than 2¼ percent of GDP that is consistent with an improvement
of at least 1 percent of GDP in the non-oil primary fiscal balance—in line with the gradual
adjustment that would be needed over the medium term to put public debt on a clear downward
path—should be achieved through additional spending rationalization.
34.
In the context of more limited oil revenue, expenditure rationalization and improved
non-oil revenue will be essential. Fiscal deficits should be gradually reduced and over time a non-oil
primary fiscal consolidation path of 1 percent of GDP per year should be targeted to restore policy
buffers and ensure that part of Angola’s oil wealth is saved for future generations. This can be
achieved if concerted efforts are deployed in containing the growth of the wage bill, strengthening
non-oil revenue collections, including implementing a VAT, improving the quality of public investment,
eliminating electricity and water subsidies while expanding well-targeted social assistance for the poor.
35.
Monetary and exchange rate policies should play a central role in rebalancing the
forex market. In recent months, the BNA has appropriately tightened liquidity conditions by
increasing its policy rate, banks’ mandatory reserve requirements, and contracting annual base
money by 3 percent. The BNA has effectively fixed the official exchange rate since April 2016 but its
forex provision has not been sufficient to address needs. As a result, imbalances exist in the forex

market, as reflected in wide, albeit volatile, spread between the official and parallel markets
exchange rates. If unaddressed, this will likely undermine the official exchange rate as the basis for
price formation and inflation expectations, and lead to misallocation of resources in the economy.
Addressing this imbalance calls for greater exchange rate flexibility, moderate use of international
reserves to smooth out the depreciation of the kwanza, and tighter monetary policy supported by
fiscal adjustment to contain the effects of the weaker currency on inflation.
36.
The effects of the loss of U.S. dollar CBRs need to be addressed. The authorities have
been rightly and actively pursuing high-level dialogue with home authorities of global
correspondent banks to better understand regulatory expectations around CBRs. Mitigating the
drivers and risks arising from the loss of CBRs by the BNA stepping up its data collection and
analysis efforts, enhancing dialogue with the private sector and home regulators of foreign
correspondent banks, strengthening the prudential and AML/CFT framework, and developing
contingency plans in coordination with all stakeholders will be key to address this risk.
37.
Preserving the health of the banking sector is essential to allow the economy to
recover over time from the current slowdown. The BNA appropriately focused its efforts to
strengthen bank supervision. However, efforts should not be spared in further strengthening bank
supervision, resolution frameworks, and closing or recapitalizing weaker banks. In this connection,
the conclusion of ongoing asset quality reviews of the major banks and the recapitalization of the
systematically-important, state-owned bank, BPC, needs to be accelerated.
38.
Economic diversification is crucial to help Angola adjust to the ‘new normal’ in the
international oil market. After enjoying the benefits of high international oil prices for almost four
consecutive years, it will take time for the economy to adjust to lower prices. The authorities’ reform
agenda tackles a number of critical constraints to economic diversification by improving
infrastructure, in particular, in transport, energy, and water. Implementation of these initiatives will
be critical to improve competitiveness while making growth more inclusive. However, these efforts
should be complemented by investing also on human capital and more forcefully addressing
Angola's severe impediments to doing businesses. For example, simplifying the procedures for and
expediting the issuance of work visas is a priority for private sector development and attracting FDI.
39.
Angola’s macroeconomic data are broadly adequate for surveillance. Progress has been
made in improving the compilation and dissemination of statistics, but gaps need to be addressed,
particularly in national accounts, including publication of quarterly data, fiscal data, balance of
payments, producer price indices, monetary statistics, and FSIs.
40.
While the authorities have not requested Fund approval and staff does not
recommend approval, staff encouraged the authorities to set a clear timetable for the
removal of measures giving rise to the exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices.
41.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Angola be held on the
standard 12-month consultation cycle.

Share of oil exports was calculated as the average ratio of oil exports to total exports of goods and services during 201113. Currency depreciation was calculated as the change of the exchange rate between the country's currency and the U.S.
dollar between August 2014 and November 2016. Change in international reserves was calculated as the change in gross
international reserves in U.S. dollars between August 2014 and October 2016 (or the latest available data). Share of oil related fiscal revenue was calculated as the average ratio of oil-related fiscal revenue and total fiscal revenue during 201113. Non-oil primary fiscal adjustment was calculated as the percentage change in the non-oil primary fiscal budget (in
percentage points of GDP) between 2014 and October 2016 WEO projections.

Tighter and more volatile global financial conditions:
• Sharp rise in risk premia with flight to safety: Investors
withdraw from specific risk asset classes as they reassess
underlying economic and financial risks in large economies, or
respond to unanticipated Fed tightening, and increases in U.S.
term premia, with poor market liquidity amplifying volatility. Safe
haven currencies—especially the US dollar—surge creates balance
sheet strains for FX debtors.
• Reduced financial services by global/regional banks: Further
loss of correspondent banking services significantly curtails crossborder payments, trade finance, and remittances in emerging and
developing economies.

Persistently lower energy prices, triggered by supply factors
reversing more gradually than expected.

1 The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding
the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall
level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3
years, respectively.

monitoring the physical execution of projects; and
have removed projects in the pipeline that are not
complying with legislation.

Ongoing. An FAD TA mission on domestic controls
found that the vast majority of past IMF

Partially implemented. The official exchange rate has
depreciated by more than 40 percent since September
2014 but has been re-pegged since mid-April 2016. At the
same time, the exchange rate market imbalance remains
high with the parallel-official exchange rate spread
standing at about 190 percent in November 2016. The BNA
has tightened monetary policy, but short-term interest
rates remain negative in real terms and banking sector
excess liquidity stays volatile but trending down at ⅓
percent of GDP.
Not implemented. The BNA has not adopted a clear
monetary policy anchor while the BNA has been
strengthening its analytical capacity. For adopting the
monetary aggregate targeting regime, the BNA’s capacity
requires further progress. The IMF provided technical
assistance on the BNA’s inflation forecasting framework.
Ongoing. The authorities have made steady progress on
implementing the 2012 FSAP recommendations especially
on governance, supervision, and resolution mechanism.
However, additional work will need to continue to build
supervisory effectiveness with regard to implementation on
consolidated supervision, systemic stability analysis, and
operationalization of prompt corrective action procedures
and regulations on emergency liquidity assistance and
crisis preparedness.
Ongoing. The country successfully exited the Financial
Action Task Force grey list. However, the country has
recently lost its only remaining U.S. dollar CBR. There
remain further reforms required on the legal, supervisory
and regulatory frameworks.
Not implemented.

Ongoing. The authorities have been investing heavily on
infrastructure on energy, water, electricity, and agriculture.
It has also launched a targeted program for sectors
considered to have high import-substitution and/or
export-promotion potential. However, these efforts should
be complemented by investing also on human capital and
more forcefully addressing Angola's severe impediments to
doing businesses.

This includes disbursements in 2016 amounting to US$6.9 billion from China Development Bank (CDB) on-lent by the central government to
Sonangol. In net terms, this is equivalent to about US$3.8 billion given that part of this loan is to refinance existing debt.

The very high growth rate of reserve money in 2015 reflects the inclusion of a part of the deposit facilities at the BNA from February 2015 onward. If these amounts were
also included at the end of 2014, the growth rate of reserve money would have been 6 percent.

Appendix I. Angola: External Balance Assessment Update
Angola’s external position in 2015 was substantially weaker than implied by medium-term
fundamentals although, to some extent, this positon is being strengthened in 2016. Also, large
imbalances have emerged in the foreign exchange (forex) market amid lower export revenues. While
Angola’s still comfortable level of international reserves will help contain near-term balance sheet
risks, continued policy adjustment will be needed to strengthen the external position further. Gradual
fiscal tightening should be implemented, and greater exchange rate flexibility supported by monetary
policy tightening will be critical to orderly address forex imbalances, while structural reforms will be
needed to enhance external competitiveness.

A. External Balance Sheets
Angola’s net international investment position (NIIP) was positive at about 4 percent of GDP at
end-2015, primarily due to large level of official reserve assets. The negative contribution from debt
has been on the rise, reflecting increasing public sector external borrowing. Projected current
account deficits through the medium term in the context of low international oil prices means that
the NIIP will continue to fall although near-term balance sheet risks will remain contained due to
comfortable level of international reserves.

B. Current Account
Angola’s current account (CA) balance has deteriorated to a deficit of 10 percent of GDP in 2015,
reflecting the prolonged fall in international oil prices and limited non-oil exports. In particular, the
trade surplus shrank from 33½ percent of GDP in 2013, before the oil price decline, to 12 percent of
GDP in 2015 as the value of oil exports

Staff assesses that Angola’s 2015 CA was substantially weaker than the level consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. The External Balance Assessment Lite (EBA-lite)
estimates a cyclically adjusted CA norm of about 0.2 percent of GDP and a CA gap of about -8¾
percent of GDP.11 The adjusted EBA-lite (Oil EBA-lite), estimated based on a sample of oil
dependent economies,12 shows a relatively lower CA gap (about -7½ percent of GDP) with a CA
norm of about
-0.3 percent of GDP. The gap could narrow this year, to about -3 percent of GDP, due to the
expected improvement in the CA balance.

C. Exchange Rate and Competitiveness
Despite a sizable (22 percent) depreciation in the average nominal official exchange rate against the
U.S. dollar, the average real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated only 3 percent in 2015, due
to high inflation in Angola relative to its trading partners and depreciation of the currencies of other
trading partners against the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, the average nominal exchange rate in the
parallel market depreciated 70 percent, reflecting much reduced sales of forex by the BNA as a
result of the sharp drop in oil exports and restrictions imposed by the BNA, leading to the widening
11

The results should be interpreted with caution since a large portion of the gap reflects regression residuals.

EBA-lite estimates show that the average REER overvaluation in 2015 ranged from 8 percent, based
on the REER regression, to 42 percent, based on the CA regression. The Oil EBA-lite CA regression
result shows a higher REER overvaluation (54 percent) due to a lower elasticity of CA to changes in
the REER.13 The fact that all of the estimates point to overvaluation, albeit variations in the estimated
size of the overvaluation reflecting uncertainties in estimation methods, is consistent with a positive
spread between the parallel and official and market exchange rates, although the very large and
volatile spread probably reflects the fact that the parallel market is still thin. Despite a 39 percent, yo-y, depreciation in the official nominal exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, the REER depreciated
only about 4¾ percent, y-o-y, during January-October 2016 due to high inflation in Angola. While

The Oil EBA-lite method assumes a CA elasticity to REER of 0.14 compared to the 0.21 used in the standard EBAlite method.

The REER appreciated 20 percent between April and October 2016 as the nominal official exchange rate has been
fixed in the context of high inflation. During the same period, the parallel market exchange rate remained broadly
stable.

There are recent indications, however, that the authorities’ ongoing effort to arresting inflation
through controlling the growth of base money and increasing forex supply might have started to be
effective, as monthly inflation has been decelerating.
Other price-based and structural indicators of competitiveness also point to the need for REER
adjustment and structural reforms to improve external competitiveness. For instance, Angola’s
purchasing power adjusted (PPP) price is higher by 8-20 percent15 than the level predicted by its per
capita income relative to the U.S. per capita income.16 In addition, Angola’s competitiveness rank in the
2014-15 Global Competitiveness Report was lower than the average rank for sub-Saharan Africa and a
group of countries with similar economic structure as that of Angola, almost across the board, with the
exception of market size. Specific constraints to doing business, identified by the report,17 include access
to financing, inadequately educated workforce, inadequate supply of infrastructure, and corruption.

D. Capital Flows and Policy Measures
Angola’s CA deficit is financed largely by long-term borrowing, primarily by the public sector, and
foreign direct investment (FDI). A large share of the FDI flows to (from) Angola reflect liquidity

Other financial flows, such as portfolio investment, trade credits, and currency and deposits mostly
reflect investments of public sector funds abroad and banking sector activities for facilitating
international trade. Non-residents’ investment in Angola is limited to FDI and, most recently,
purchases of long-term government securities issued abroad as the country has virtually closed
capital account for other flows and due to limited investment opportunities. As a result of these, the
risk of reversal of capital flows in Angola is very limited.

In the context of the forex shortage, the BNA has introduced a number of measures since 2015,
including a priority list for access to forex at the official rate, a special tax on service payments to
non-residents for technical assistance and management services, and stricter limits on the amount
of foreign currency that travelers can take abroad. The priority list includes imports of food,
medicine, inputs for agriculture and industry, and the oil sector.

As of November 2016, Angola’s NIR stood at
US$20⅓ billion,18 which is 100 percent of the
standard IMF metric (down from 125 percent
at end-2015) and 110 percent of capitalcontrol-adjusted metric (down from 140
percent at end-2015).19 Angola’s heavy
reliance on oil exports, which constitutes
about 95 percent of total exports, means that
this ratio should be closer to the upper bound
of the adequacy range (150 percent).

Angola’s Sovereign Wealth Fund (FSDEA), which amounts to about US$4½ billion, is not included in NIR.

19

In the context of strict capital controls, the relevant metric for Angola is the capital-control-adjusted metric, which
has lower weight on broad money (5 percent compared to 10 percent in the standard metric), reflecting the lower
probability of capital flight under capital controls.

Safeguards Assessments:1 The first-time safeguards assessment, which was finalized in May 2010,
found that the National Bank of Angola (BNA) is subject to annual external audits by a reputable
firm, but the audit opinions were qualified. The assessment confirmed weak governance and
transparency practices at the BNA, including lack of timely publication of annual financial
statements. The assessment made recommendations to strengthen the control framework in the
reserves management and internal audit areas, and to enhance the legal framework and
independence of the central bank. Some progress has been made in addressing recommendations.
Outstanding key recommendations include: (i) amending the BNA Law to align it with best
international practices; (ii) implementing International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); and
(iii) resolving remaining audit qualifications. The audited 2015 financial statements have yet to be
published, as stipulated under the Safeguards Policy.
Exchange Arrangements: The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The de facto exchange
rate arrangement has been classified as ‘other managed’ since June 2015. However, the kwanza has
been re-pegged to the U.S. dollar since mid-April 2016. The BNA closely monitors exchange rate
fluctuations to maintain price stability in the economy and frequently intervenes in the foreign
exchange market by holding foreign exchange auctions and direct sales. The BNA receives foreign
currency from taxes paid by oil companies to the government, and also buys foreign exchange from
oil companies who make payments to residents for services provided to them in kwanza. The BNA
then sells the foreign currency to the market, with special focus on the oil and other priority sectors.
The official exchange rate of the kwanza vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar has declined by more than 40 percent
since September 2014. International reserves have been used to smooth the depreciation, declining by
US$6⅔ billion since September 2014, to US$20⅓ billion in November 2016 on a net basis. The BNA
publishes the auction results and respective reference rates.
Angola continues to maintain restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2. The
measures maintained pursuant to Article XIV are: (i) limits on the availability of foreign exchange for
invisible transactions, such as travel, medical or educational allowances; and (ii) limits on unrequited
transfers to foreign-based individuals and institutions. In addition, Angola maintains three exchange
restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Section 2(a) resulting from (i) the
discriminatory application of the 0.015 percent stamp tax on foreign exchange operations; (ii) the
operation of the priority list for access to U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate; and (iii) a special
tax of 10% on transfers to non-residents under contracts for foreign technical assistance or
management services.2 Angola also maintains three multiple currency practices that are subject to
approval under Article VIII, Section 3 arising from the lack of a mechanism to prevent potential
spreads in excess of 2 percent emerging (i) between successful bids within the BNA’s foreign
exchange auction; and (ii) for transactions that take place at the reference rate in place and the rate
at which transactions take place in the foreign exchange auction on that day, and (iii) the
discriminatory application of the 0.015 stamp tax on foreign exchange operations.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
ANGOLA—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of November 30, 2016
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. There are concerns
about data quality and timeliness and efforts are underway to strengthen the statistical base, including
through technical assistance from the Fund and World Bank.
Angola now has several regular and informative statistical publications, reflecting significant progress in the
provision of data and transparency in statistical reporting. Progress has been the strongest in the BNA and
recently in the National Institute of Statistics (INE). Both now provide and publish much more extensive data
on a timely basis. Data delivery and publication from the Ministry of Finance could be significantly improved.
Data postings on the Ministry of Finance website include detailed revenues from the oil sector and diamond
and reports on public finances with a certain lag.
National Accounts: INE has released the national accounts for Angola for 2002-13. This is the first issuance
of national accounts for Angola and includes annual data on output, expenditures, and income. The national
accounts include annual GDP in current prices and volumes using chained-linking based on 2002
benchmarks. The Ministry of Planning is expected to continue issuing preliminary estimates and projections
of annual GDP (output). A quarterly GDP series is in production and is expected to be finalized and
published in 2017. Other important data bulletins are published by INE, including quarterly bulletins on
business confidence, industrial production, and on merchandize trade. INE completed a national census
count for 2014. This was the first census in the four decades since independence. The census questionnaire
covered a substantial collection of information, mostly of a demographic and social nature.
Price Statistics: INE publishes monthly reports on consumer and wholesale price indices. The CPI index was
expanded to include consumer prices in all 18 provinces of the country. INE has started to develop import
and export price indices.
Government Finance Statistics: The timeliness and quality of government finance statistics needs to be
substantially improved. Revenue and expenditures are correctly recorded on accrual basis but some issues
persist when operations above- and below-the-line are reconciled. Of the utmost importance is that
consolidated and detailed fiscal data are published regularly (at least quarterly) in electronic format at the
Ministry of Finance web page. It would also be important to publish the data in excel—currently published
in PDF, rendering it difficult for analysis—and in nominal values (rather than percentage changes) and
updating the numbers as they are revised. Information on oil revenues is published monthly with great
detail but it would be more useful for analysts and stakeholders if it is published as a spreadsheet instead of
PDF images. A detailed report on the evolution of oil revenues is published on a quarterly basis but with
some lag. It would be important to start publishing data on non-oil revenue on a monthly basis. Thus far,
the Ministry of Finance reports on a “modified” GFSM 1986 by using an adjustor to reconcile numbers above

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANGOLA

the line (registered on an accrual basis) with those below the line (registered on cash basis). The Ministry of
Finance compiles annual and monthly data according to GFSM 2001 standard.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Data for the depository corporation survey and the balance sheet of the
BNA have been revised with the help of STA technical assistance. The data are now based on the new
standardized report forms. The BNA delivers data to the IMF on a timely basis. It also publishes
comprehensive data on its webpage on a monthly basis. The BNA also publishes other reports. These
include a quarterly inflation report as well as its annual report (summarizing monetary and macroeconomic
as well as inflation developments), and a six-monthly financial stability report (assessing the stability of the
financial system) but those publications are published with a long lag.
Financial Sector Surveillance: BNA data on financial soundness indicators are published on a monthly
basis. The quality of financial soundness indicators should be improved along with the recommendations
from STA technical assistance. The usefulness of the BNA’s Financial Stability Report could be enhanced by
being more up to date, as the last report was published in early 2015.
External Sector Statistics: The balance of payments and international investment position are compiled in
line with the recommendations of the sixth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual. These statistics
are compiled and disseminated annually, with a lag of about nine months after the reference period. A
technical assistance mission from STA on external sector statistics was conducted in November 2015. It
reviewed the implementation of the recommendations of previous TA missions and found that progress has
been made, especially regarding the automatization of the compilation process. The mission made
recommendations on the compilation procedures and the coverage and quality of the series to improve the
consistency between flows and stocks. The mission also confirmed the availability of quarterly information
already collected by the BNA for the great majority of the elements of the balance of payments. Data
coverage and timeliness remain major shortcomings. Also, coordination among statistical agencies and
source data suppliers needs to be addressed.
II. Data Standards and Quality
The authorities are committed to using the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS) to improve the
statistical system. Angola started participating in the
GDDS in January 29, 2004 and metadata were
posted on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By

Prepared by the staff of the International Monetary Fund

David Robinson and
Bob Traa

While the projected path of Angola’s public debt is sustainable under the baseline
scenario, stress tests show that it is highly vulnerable to shocks, including on real GDP
growth, the exchange rate, financial contingent liabilities, and the oil price. The gross
public debt-to-GDP ratio rose by 24¾ percentage points during 2015, to 65½ percent at
end-year, due to the fiscal deficit and effect of the exchange rate depreciation on foreign
currency denominated and indexed debt. This ratio is expected to increase to 71½ percent
at end-2016 given the projected fiscal deficit of 4 percent of GDP for the year and a more
depreciated exchange rate. Despite projected subdued real GDP growth, the gross public
debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline in 2017 mainly due to the projected real
exchange rate appreciation, and then stabilize at around 64 percent mainly due to
projected improvements in the fiscal balances. Angola’s gross external debt is projected to
decline to 39½ percent of GDP at end-2021, from 40½ percent of GDP at end-2015.

ANGOLA

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
Angola’s gross public debt is estimated at 65½ percent of GDP at end-2015. Public debt
statistics comprise the central government and (the external debt of) the state-owned oil and airline
companies (Sonangol and TAAG, respectively).1 There was a 24¾ percentage point of GDP increase in
gross public debt in 2015 relative to 2014, due to a fiscal deficit of about 3⅓ percent of GDP, the effect of
the exchange rate depreciation on foreign currency denominated and indexed debt stocks—which
accounted for 9½ percentage point of GDP increase in public debt. Net public debt (gross debt excluding
deposits of the central government at the BNA) stood at 54¼ percent of GDP at end-2015.2
2.
In 2016, Angola’s gross public debt is projected to have continued to increase, by
6¼ percentage points, to 71½ percent of GDP. This is driven by the projected fiscal deficit of
4 percent of GDP for the year and the effect of a more depreciated exchange rate on foreign currency
denominated and indexed debt stocks.
3.
The main assumptions underlying the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) are fully in line with
the baseline macroeconomic scenario outlined in the Article IV Staff Report. After negative growth in
2016, staff projects a very gradual increase in non-oil GDP growth until 2019 and stable but subdued
growth thereafter, reflecting improved terms-of-trade, a moderately improved business climate, and the
completion of several projects in agriculture and infrastructure. Inflation is projected to remain high in 2016
and then decline gradually. The non-oil primary fiscal balance is projected to improve only starting in
2018—due to projected higher public spending in 2017—to preserve debt sustainability given that
international oil prices are expected to improve but remain significantly lower than in 2011–13. The external
current account deficit would be reduced over the medium term due to fiscal retrenchment and higher oil
prices.
4.
Staff estimates public debt as a share of GDP to decline in 2017 due to the projected
appreciation of the real exchange rate,3 and to stabilize thereafter reflecting improvements in fiscal
balances, and despite projected subdued real GDP growth. As the government continues its fiscal
consolidation efforts, the debt ratio would stabilize at about 64 percent.4 This fiscal consolidation would be
achieved mainly through additional nonoil taxation and expenditure savings.

1

Sonangol’s external debt (14¼ percent of GDP at end-2015) is included in public debt given that Sonangol is fully
state-owned. Most of its debt does not carry an explicit government guarantee, but disbursements in 2016
amounting to US$6.9 billion from the China Development Bank (CDB), which were on-lent by the central government
to Sonangol, are explicitly guaranteed. In net terms, this was equivalent to about US$3.8 billion given that part of this
loan was used to refinance existing debt.
2

Part of central government deposits at the BNA, which include the oil funds, could be used to reduce financing
needs but under very strict conditions and with the approval of the President of the Republic.
3

The projected decline in the public debt ratio in 2017 is due to the still high expected inflation and the authorities’
commitment to maintain a stable nominal exchange rate.
4

The residuals from the contribution to changes in both public and external debt are mainly due to further projected
exchange rate depreciation of the kwanza in 2018-21 but at a slower pace than in 2015-16.

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANGOLA

5.
Angola’s moderate debt burden and gross financing needs can pose risks to debt
sustainability and leave debt dynamics highly vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks. Angola’s debt
ratio is projected to exceed in 2016 (but not in subsequent years) the debt burden benchmark for
emerging economies of 70 percent of GDP. Angola’s public gross financing needs are expected to be
slightly above the relevant benchmark of 15 percent of GDP in 2017 and 2019–20.
6.
Angola’s key macroeconomic variables forecast track record shows a relatively large median
error compared with advanced and emerging market surveillance countries in some years. This is
partly due to unforeseen developments, including volatility in either oil production or oil prices and swings
in agricultural production due to weather conditions. This also reflects the low level of diversification of the
economy and still weak fiscal institutions.
7.
The baseline debt path is vulnerable to various shocks, including on real GDP growth,
exchange rate, financial contingent liability, and oil price.5


Growth shock: If projected real GDP rates are lowered by half standard deviation (implying
lower real growth by about 4 percentage points in 2017 and 2018), the debt ratio would reach
72¾ percent of GDP in 2018 and stabilize thereafter at around 73 percent:6



Real exchange rate shock: A one-off real depreciation of 30 percent (45 percent nominal
depreciation) would alter the debt-to-GDP path significantly, with this ratio reaching 74¾
percent of GDP in 2017 before declining slightly to 74½ percent in 2021.



Combined shock: A combination of various (standard and non-standard) macro-fiscal shocks
would increase debt to 101½ percent of GDP by 2021.



Financial sector contingent liability shock: A one-time increase in non-interest expenditures
equivalent to 10 percent of banking sector assets would increase the debt-to-GDP ratio to
73½ percent by 2018 and stabilize thereafter around 74 percent.



Oil price shock: Given Angola’s high dependence on oil, an oil price shock representing a
30 percent drop in the projected price of the Angolan oil basket in 2017 was also considered.
Under this scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase in 2017 compared to the baseline and
stabilize at 66½ percent.7

5

The interest rate shock applied for Angola increases by 200 basis points rather than by the maximum real interest
rate over the last 10 years to exclude the outlier resulting from the 2008-09 global crisis, which distorts the impact of
the shock on public debt.
6

The real GDP growth is reduced by one-half standard deviation (rather than 1 standard deviation) for 2 consecutive
years to tailor this shock better to the new reality of the Angolan economy, which has been growing for more than a
decade and has seen the share of the less volatile non-oil (services dominated) sector increase.
7

The oil price shock shows only the direct impact of a decline in oil price on revenues in 2017. The price under this
scenario is US$32¼ per barrel.

1/ Public sector is defined as the Central government plus public companies.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ EMBIG.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
8.
Angola’s external debt is sustainable.8 External debt is expected to continue increasing in 2016
to about 43 percent of GDP from 40½ percent in 2015. The external debt trajectory is projected to decline
to 39½ percent by 2021 mainly due to declining current account deficits, and a slower pace of exchange
rate depreciation.
9.
Stress tests in the external DSA suggest that Angola’s external debt ratio is also sensitive to
shocks. Of the various standard shocks, the most significant is a real depreciation shock. The second most
significant shock is the non-interest current account shock, followed by the combined shock and growth
shock:


Real depreciation shock: A one-time real depreciation of 30 percent in 2017 would raise
external debt to 89 percent by 2021.



Non-interest current account shock: An increase in the current account excluding interest
payments by half a standard deviation in each year from 2017 onwards would raise external
debt to 70 percent of GDP by 2021.



Combined shock: A one quarter standard deviation shock to the real interest rate, the growth
rate and the current account would raise the external debt ratio to 60 percent by the end of the
projection period.



Growth shock: A permanent half standard deviation shock applied to growth would raise
external debt to 46 percent of GDP by 2021.

8

The external DSA is based solely on public sector debt, including two state-owned enterprises (Sonangol and
TAAG), due to lack of data on private sector external debt. The authorities are making efforts to collect private sector
debt data with the help of TA from STA.

Statement by Mr. Mkwezalamba, Executive Director for Angola and
Mr. Tivane, Advisor to Executive Director for Angola
January 23, 2017
1. Introduction
Angola has made commendable progress in addressing its post-conflict development
challenges, including gaps in basic infrastructure and limited human capital development,
needed to spur long-term growth. The implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and
structural reforms, over the past several years, yielded steady growth, improved socioeconomic indicators, and paved the way for continued improvements in institutions. Reaping
the benefits from the oil sector to upgrade the productive capacity required to diversify the
sources of economic growth is essential to reduce risks from commodity price swings. More
recently, the authorities have made significant adjustments in the macroeconomic policy mix
to withstand the adverse impact of the oil price shock, coupled with the sluggish growth in
emerging markets and tightening financial conditions. Going forward, they are committed to
advance the reform agenda to build strong macroeconomic fundamentals, accelerate
economic diversification, and strengthen policy institutions. They broadly concur with the
staff assessment and policy recommendations, appreciate the Fund’s continued engagement
and policy advice as well as the candid policy discussions during the 2016 Article IV
Consultation.
2. Recent Economic Developments
The Angolan economy is adapting to a “new normal” characterized by the lower commodity
price cycle since mid-2014. Given the country’s dependence on oil, economic performance
is intrinsically determined by oil price developments.
Economic activity stagnated in 2016, after growing at 3.0 percent in 2015, primarily driven
by the slowdown in the oil sector to 0.8 percent in 2016, from 6.4 percent in 2015. In
addition, the shortage of foreign exchange to finance imports of intermediate and capital
goods needed for production of nontradables, a weakening in private sector activity, and the
scaling back of public infrastructure investment weighted negatively on growth.
Inflation reached 41.2 percent in December 2016, year-on-year (y-o-y), largely driven by the
pass-through effect of depreciation of the local currency during the period of rebalancing of
the foreign exchange market. The heightened inflationary pressures in 2016 were also
induced by the lagged effects of the phasing out of fuel subsidies in 2015 and 2016. The
kwanza depreciated by roughly 60 percent against the U.S. dollar during the period 2015–
2016. To contain inflation pressures and gradually address imbalances in the foreign
exchange market, the Central Bank of Angola (BNA) raised its policy rate by 200 basis
points to 14 percent in June 2016, relative to January 2016. Likewise, the standing lending
facility rate was raised from 14 to 20 percent, and the standing deposit facility rate was
increased from 2.25 to 7.25 percent, over the same period. These measures contributed to
reducing the excess liquidity and preserving reserve buffers.

2

The fiscal policy stance for 2016 remained restrictive, given the urgency to accelerate the
pace of fiscal consolidation initiated in 2015. The supplementary budget for 2016 scaled back
public expenditures and concurrently protected the fiscal space for social programs. Further,
deficit-reducing measures were implemented, particularly, the phasing out of fuel subsidies
and rationalization of recurrent expenditures, mostly wages and goods and services. To
insulate the economy against oil price volatility and prevent the risk of debt distress, the
authorities agreed to take further actions aimed at achieving over the medium term a non-oil
primary fiscal consolidation path needed to rebuild fiscal buffers.
The external current account deficit is projected to narrow to 4 percent of GDP in 2016, from
10 percent of GDP in 2015, on account of weaker economic activity, while gross
international reserves are projected to remain at comfortable levels in 2016, at
US$ 22.7 billion (roughly 8 months of prospective imports), against US$ 24.4 billion in 2015
(11 months of prospective imports).
3. Medium Term Economic Outlook and Policy Priorities
The medium term economic outlook for Angola remains favorable although the balance of
risks is tilted to the downside. The key risks include the lingering low oil prices, slower
growth in emerging markets, and tightening financial conditions. These risks will be
mitigated through swift implementation of the recently launched program of action
(Programas Dirigidos) targeted at sectors with high import-substitution and export potential,
specifically agriculture, food processing, fisheries, and light manufacturing.
Economic growth is projected to pick up to 2.1 percent in 2017, driven by the recovery of the
oil sector and expected rebound in the non-oil sector, with growth rates estimated at 1.8 and
2.3 percent, respectively. The performance of the non-oil sector will be driven by accelerated
growth in sectors of agriculture (7.3 percent), manufacturing (4.0 percent), construction
(2.3 percent), and electricity (40.2 percent), which account for a substantial share of GDP.
The authorities’ growth projections for 2017 are slightly higher than those of staff on account
of different assumptions regarding the availability of financing for public infrastructure
investments to increase the capacity for power generation, particularly: (i) construction of
phases 1 and 2 of the Cambambe hydropower plant, with capacity to generate 960
megawatts; and (ii) construction of the Lauca hydropower plant, with a planned capacity of
1,320 megawatts.
Like most resource-rich nations, Angola’s main challenges over the next few years are
accelerating the pace of economic transformation and diversification, improving human
capital development, and strengthening institutions. To achieve this, the authorities approved
in January 2016, a Program of Action for Economic Diversification to withstand the oil price
shock and invigorate the implementation of the National Development Plan (2013–017),
which seeks to unlock the country’s growth potential and propel broad-based growth.

3
Fiscal Policy
The authorities’ medium term fiscal strategy seeks to foster fiscal consolidation and step up
the implementation of structural reforms to improve domestic revenue mobilization and
strengthen public financial management. The draft budget for 2017 approved by the National
Assembly on December 16, 2016 envisages an overall fiscal deficit of 6.7 percent of GDP,
and is consistent with the medium term objective of promoting growth, while preserving debt
sustainability. More specifically, over the short to medium term, the authorities will continue
the implementation of fiscal reforms aimed at diversifying the sources of non-oil revenues,
through measures aimed at widening the tax base, improving tax inspections, and better
enforcing real estate taxation. In addition, they will accelerate ongoing preparatory steps to
create an adequate institutional capacity and put in place appropriate IT infrastructure for the
introduction of VAT. Similarly, upgrading the institutional capacity for investment planning
and implementation, while improving the medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) will be
given primacy going forward. Further, the authorities will enhance the institutional capacity
for oversight of fiscal risks from state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and accelerate the program
of their restructuring and privatization, which includes closing 48 and privatizing 53 SOEs.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
The BNA policy priorities remain geared towards achieving price stability and rebalancing
the foreign exchange market. The authorities are conscious that further tightening in the
monetary policy stance while allowing greater exchange rate flexibility are essential to
safeguard macroeconomic stability. Nonetheless, given the economy’s structural rigidities
and its heavy reliance on imports, a gradual approach to achieve exchange rate flexibility is
desirable to prevent escalation of inflationary pressures. The BNA will continue to fine tune
its monetary policy framework to strengthen credibility, and step up the implementation of
measures aimed at improving the capacity for liquidity forecasting and management, and
upgrading macro-prudential regulations. As the economy improves, the authorities are
committed to take decisive steps to remove the restrictions on forex transactions. In addition,
further steps to improve effectiveness of monetary policy will be taken, in particular
narrowing the policy interest corridor to 500 bps to better signal the monetary policy
decisions and shifting to base money targeting to achieve the inflation objective.
Financial Sector Policy
Building a sound financial system and fostering financial deepening and inclusion are vital to
support the ongoing efforts to propel inclusive-growth and foster economic diversification.
To prevent the systemic risks arising from the deterioration in asset quality and lack of
compliance with the minimum capital requirements by systemic-important banks, the BNA
will continue to enhance the regulatory and supervisory frameworks and strengthen its crisis
management tools. In relation to this, the authorities have made significant efforts in
addressing the recommendations from the 2012 Financial System Stability Assessment
(FSSA). Specifically, they have: (i) completed the restructuring of BNA’s supervisory
functions with specific departments for banking supervision, regulation, foreign exchange
supervision, and consumer protection; (ii) created a financial stability committee within the

4
BNA; (iii) established a risk oversight unit; and (iv) are in the process of aligning the banking
system’s accounting and reporting practices with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IRFS).
In light of the risks stemming from loss of U.S. dollar Correspondent Banking Relationships
(CBRs), the BNA has taken swift actions to mitigate these risks and find long-term solutions.
Specifically, over the past months, the BNA intensified its data collection and analysis efforts
to ensure compliance with data provision on CBRs by the banking sector, and has been
actively engaged in high-level policy dialogue with global correspondent banks in order to
better understand the expectations and regulatory environment around CBRs. In this regard,
actions are currently underway to enhance the supervisory and regulatory prudential
frameworks and enforce mechanisms in line with international best practices. Further, the
BNA has been engaged in open policy dialogue with private institutions on measures needed
to address the withdrawal of CBRs and enhance the country’s AML/CFT framework as well
as increase awareness.
Structural Policies
Addressing the longstanding structural impediments to economic competitiveness and
accelerating economic diversification and transformation remain critical policy challenges
facing Angola over the medium and long term. Policy priorities in the structural front will be
centered on augmenting the fiscal space for growth-inducing expenditures, while enhancing
human capital development. In this vein, the authorities will step up efforts to quickly bolster
the non-oil sector through invigoration of structural measures to ease the binding constraints
to broad-based growth. They will also improve the business environment, including
accelerating the implementation of the new Business Law, the new Labor Law, and approved
decrees to facilitate startups, eliminate red tape, and unlock opportunities for small and
medium-scale enterprises (SMEs).
4. Conclusion
The Angolan authorities have made notable efforts to advance their reform agenda aimed at
withstanding the short-term vulnerabilities brought about by the protracted oil price shock
and improving economic resilience and competiveness. The policy adjustment efforts to
preserve macroeconomic stability and promote economic growth will continue, particularly
through increased fiscal space for growth-friendly public investments needed to reduce the
country’s dependence on the oil sector. To this end, continued Fund engagement and policy
advice remain critical in supporting the authorities’ development agenda going forward.
