IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Belarus
On September 2, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2016 Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Belarus.
Economic conditions in Belarus were volatile during much of 2015 and early 2016. The
economy contracted by 3.9 percent in 2015, with a similar performance in the first half of 2016,
hurt by domestic structural weaknesses and rigidities as well as external shocks. The exchange
rate depreciated sharply during 2015 and part of 2016. Real wages are down substantially
relative to 2014, and corporate losses are up. Unemployment has risen somewhat, though
remains at relatively low levels.
Tighter fiscal and monetary policies during much of 2015–16 have helped support
macroeconomic stabilization. The exchange rate has now stabilized and international bond
spreads have narrowed. Since the shift to a more flexible exchange rate regime in early 2015,
reserves have stabilized and, in recent months, begun to rise. The current account deficit is up
slightly this year, but down sharply from the level of several years ago. Headline inflation has
slowed in recent months, despite a sizeable hike in regulated utility tariffs in early 2016.
Vulnerabilities remain elevated. Credit to the private sector has slowed and banks’ asset quality
and profitability have weakened. This, together with a slow resolution of troubled loans, has
resulted in rising non-performing loans. Systemic liquidity risks are elevated as banks are highly
dollarized and carry an asset-liability mismatch in some key foreign currencies. Public debt has
risen, in spite of headline surpluses, in part due to rising realized losses in the state-owned
enterprise sector. External debt has also risen, and reserves remain low by international
standards.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
The economy is expected to contract further this year and next, reflecting still-weak balance
sheets and structural impediments. A subdued recovery is expected as of 2018, while over the
medium-term the potential growth would only increase to around 1¾ percent, limited by
negative demographics and, in the absence of deeper structural reforms, low productivity growth.
Inflation is expected to gradually fall to the high single digits over the next few years.
Key domestic risks to the outlook include the pace of implementation of the policy reform
agenda and uncertainties about the size of quasi-fiscal liabilities. On the external side, key risks
include persistently lower international energy prices or disruptions in energy price arrangements
with Russia. Corporate and bank balance sheets and household confidence remain sensitive to
any significant exchange rate movements, owing to high dollarization, currency mismatches,
limited access to foreign exchange liquidity, and significant annual gross external financing
requirements.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the measures taken by the authorities since early 2015 to stabilize
the economy and begin implementing institutional and structural reforms, in a context of difficult
economic conditions. Directors underscored, however, that sustained and far-reaching reforms
are needed to reduce macrofinancial vulnerabilities, rebuild buffers, and raise economic growth
and jobs prospects.
Directors highlighted the importance of deeper reforms to unlock growth potential. They urged
implementation of a comprehensive reform strategy for state-owned enterprises to improve
productivity and efficiency and reduce fiscal risks. This should include stronger corporate
governance and oversight and clearer mechanisms for addressing problem entities. They also
recommended identifying clear, evenly paced measures to achieve full cost recovery in the utility
sector by end-2018. Directors stressed that improving the business environment, including
through pursuit of WTO membership and steps to enhance product market competition, will be
crucial.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to strengthen the fiscal framework.
They noted that some easing is possible in the near term, given the deep recession and negative
output gap. This should be followed by a gradual medium-term fiscal consolidation to reduce
public debt while preserving space for enhanced social safety nets and capital expenditure. They
stressed the need to strengthen the debt anchor by encompassing government guarantees and
local government debt. They also recommended reflecting in the budget all quasi-fiscal support
to enhance transparency. Further pension reforms will also be important.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summing up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors urged a cautious monetary policy stance to preserve macroeconomic and financial
stability, including a tightening of monetary aggregates if needed. They welcomed the
authorities’ plans to gradually transition from quantitative targeting to inflation targeting in the
medium term. They underscored the importance of continuing to phase out directed lending and
price controls and ensuring that the prudential limits on interest rates are temporary. They
supported efforts to strengthen the central bank’s operational capacity and independence,
including through clarification of the primacy of price stability. Directors also welcomed the
elimination of multiple currency practices and the shift to a more flexible exchange rate. They
stressed the importance of maintaining exchange rate flexibility and rebuilding external buffers
as conditions allow.
Directors encouraged the authorities to implement the recommendations of the Financial System
Stability Assessment, including transitioning to independent and risk-based oversight of the
financial sector, implementing a comprehensive resolution strategy for nonperforming loans
combined with corporate restructuring, strengthening macro-prudential policies to mitigate
foreign exchange liquidity risks from dollarization, and designing a well-functioning financial
safety net. They urged follow up on any shortcomings identified by the asset quality reviews of
major banks. Directors emphasized that the Development Bank should maintain a limited and
well-targeted role.
Directors noted the authorities’ interest in a Fund-supported program and underscored the
importance of strong commitment at the highest level to consistent macroeconomic policies and
deep, market-oriented reforms.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: The economy is contracting, hurt by external shocks and domestic structural weaknesses
and rigidities. The authorities have taken some positive steps, including policies supporting
macroeconomic stabilization and structural and institutional reforms such as a shift to a more
flexible exchange rate. However, external sector weaknesses and negative macrofinancial
feedback loops centered around the deteriorating performance of state owned enterprises (SOEs)
are pushing up public and external debt, weakening the financial sector, and threatening stability.
Policy recommendations: A comprehensive, well-coordinated policy package is needed to support
macroeconomic stability, reduce vulnerabilities, and unlock growth potential.

 Real sector. Increase efficiency, market orientation, and competitiveness, and reduce quasifiscal drains by: (i) developing and implementing a comprehensive SOE reform strategy that
strengthens monitoring and diagnostics, phases out production targets, scales down
government directed lending, and strengthens corporate governance; (ii) implementing wellspecified measures to achieve full utility cost recovery by the end of 2018; and (iii)
strengthening the business environment.

 Fiscal policy. Strengthen and recalibrate fiscal policy by: (i) supporting well-targeted social
safety nets (SSNs) and preserving capital expenditures; (ii) bringing state support on budget
and quasi-fiscal loss estimates into debt projections; and (iii) medium-term fiscal consolidation
to safeguard debt sustainability and support external adjustment, including via wage restraint.

 Monetary and exchange rate policy. Facilitate stabilization and adjustment by: (i) maintaining a
monetary policy stance consistent with reducing inflation—while safeguarding financial and
external stability; (ii) gradually transitioning from monetary aggregate targeting to inflation
targeting; and (iii) maintaining exchange rate flexibility while seeking opportunities to rebuild
reserves.

 Financial sector policy. Strengthen financial sector stability and market orientation (drawing on
recommendations of the recent FSAP and results of bank diagnostic studies) by: (i) cleaning up
balance sheets and strengthening resilience of banks, including by rebuilding FX liquidity
buffers; (ii) strengthening financial sector frameworks, including for NPL resolution and shifting
to risk-based oversight; (iii) delimiting the Development Bank’s activities to efficiently
addressing market failures in priority policy areas, and (iv) employing macroprudential
measures to contain FX liquidity risks from dollarization.

CONTEXT
1.
The economy is suffering from deep recession. External shocks, including low oil prices
and the downturn in Russia, have exposed deep domestic structural problems, reflected in falling
productivity (Box 1). Policies during 2015–16 have supported macroeconomic stability and have
begun to address long-standing structural weaknesses discussed in past consultations (Annex I). But
vulnerabilities are increasing faster, marked by rising public and external debt (Annex II), weakening
corporate and bank balance sheets, and low reserves. Most senior officials agree that deep
institutional and structural reforms are needed, but express concern about their social impact and
about the government’s implementation capacity in areas such as SOE reform. Some official sector
stakeholders believe that the recession is due to ‘temporary’ external shocks and high interest rates
and argue that the new 2016–20 Government Action Plan is sufficient to revive growth prospects.

2.
Belarus has responded to past pressures with episodes of tight macroeconomic
policies, with structural weaknesses left largely unaddressed. In response to past
macroeconomic and financial pressures, the authorities tightened fiscal policy, restrained wages,
allowed exchange rate adjustment, and took some structural measures—mainly in the financial
sector as well as limited privatizations. But policies tended to relax after immediate pressures

abated, and deeper-rooted vulnerabilities persisted. In addressing the most recent economic
downturn, the authorities have undertaken more sustained stabilization efforts and demonstrated
stronger ownership of reforms. These include initiation of some significant measures to address
underlying vulnerabilities, though overall progress is still at an early stage and future reversals
cannot be ruled out.
3.
Belarus is seeking to deepen and diversify its external economic relations. Economic
ties with Russia remain strong (Figure 1), including through membership in the Eurasian Economic
Union (EEU), though disagreements over the pricing of energy imports from Russia are coloring
these good relations and creating risks. Belarus is also seeking to strengthen other external
economic linkages by leveraging its proximity to the European Union (EU) and growing ties with
China. The EU recently lifted most sanctions on Belarus, unlocking potential loans from the European
Bank for Restructuring and Development (EBRD) and European Investment Bank (EIB). Belarus is a
key way station on the China-led new Silk Road, bringing additional financial and logistics resources
to the economy. Belarus has revived WTO negotiations and intensified relations with International
Financial Institutions (IFIs). The World Bank is considering a policy loan.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The economy continues to contract (Figures2–4; Table 1A). Real GDP contracted by
nearly 4 percent in 2015, with signs of similar decline in the first half of 2016. Headline inflation has
slowed in recent months, but remains high relative to peers at 12.1 percent y-o-y as of end-June
2016 (text chart). Real wages are down and unemployment is rising amid corporate losses and
weakening balance sheets. Negative macro-financial feedback loops are taking their toll, with
implications for quasi-fiscal liabilities emanating from state-owned banks and the SOE sector.

The external sector remains fragile with diminished buffers. (Figure 5; Table 2). The
Belarusian ruble (BYR) lost 36 percent of its value against the USD (28 percent against a trade
weighted basket) in 2015, and a further 7½ percent against the USD through end-June 2016. The
current account deficit narrowed to 3.8 percent of GDP in 2015, amidst sharp import compression
and retention of energy export duties formerly repaid to Russia, but staff estimates the BYR remains
up to 10 percent overvalued (Box 2). Gross official reserves (US$4.3 billion at end-June 2016) are well
below standard adequacy metrics. Official reserves net of predetermined short-term net FX drains
are negative (text chart), reflecting significant FX-denominated domestic and foreign debt. Further
erosion in reserves has been avoided only by foreign exchange borrowing from Russia (US$0.8
billion) and the Eurasian Fund for Stabilization and Development (‘EFSD’, US$2 billion committed).
Despite this, spreads on Belarusian 2018 Eurobonds have halved from 1,000 bps in mid-2015 to
around 450 bps in July, roughly in line with similarly rated peers—reflecting a strong repayment
track record as well as credibility gains from stronger policies.

The banking system faces significant challenges. (Text chart). Capital adequacy ratios are

forbearance, evergreening, and diminished real sector repayment capacity, particularly among SOEs.
Bank profitability is being squeezed. Deposits have stabilized after a period of erosion that was likely
driven by depreciation and consumption smoothing. Banks also face significant challenges adjusting
to cuts in government directed lending and guarantees. Given the significant state presence in the
banking sector (state-owned banks account for about 65 percent of the banking system assets), any
needed recapitalization relating to the state bank-SOE nexus has implications for the budget.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS

staff’s adjustment scenario, deeper and faster reforms would initially push growth lower, mainly
due to lower domestic demand, but productivity gains and rising domestic demand would then

potential growth rate.

 Inflation is expected to reach 13 percent y-o-y by end-December—almost 1 percentage point
higher than last year—driven mainly by recent exchange rate depreciation and higher utility
tariffs. Inflation is projected to remain in the low double digits over the next three years under the
baseline scenario. Better policy implementation under the adjustment scenario would bring
inflation down to around 6 percent by 2020.
 The current account deficit is projected to widen by about 1 percent of GDP this year and then
narrow gradually in the medium term to 3–3½ percent under the baseline scenario. Under the
adjustment scenario, the current account deficit would significantly narrow to around ½ percent
of GDP by 2021, with higher reserve build-up. This reflects significant reforms, including to SOEs,
that could sustainably lower import demand and promote higher FDI and other capital inflows.
8.
Risks are tilted to the downside (Risk Assessment Matrix, Annex III). Belarus is prone to
external and domestic shocks and swings in confidence that macro-financial linkages could
propagate into crisis. Lower (higher) energy prices would erode (boost) growth and external stability.
Current energy price disagreements with Russia, if not resolved, could disrupt external and domestic
stability. In the event of significant renewed depreciation, corporate and bank balance sheets and
household (HH) confidence would weaken owing to high dollarization, currency mismatches, limited
access to foreign exchange liquidity, and significant annual gross external financing requirements in
the range of US$18 billion (35 percent of GDP). Risks to balance sheets would be heightened in the
event of slippages in domestic policy implementation. Quasi-fiscal liabilities are particularly
uncertain and could be higher (or lower) than estimated.
Authorities’ Views
9.
The authorities noted that external conditions have recently improved and their
stabilization and structural reform policies are bearing fruit. They expect the economic
contraction to ease more rapidly in 2016—with some in government expecting a return to growth—
and inflation to fall by more relative to staff’s baseline projections. They pointed to a number of
important recent reforms, including the shift to a flexible exchange rate regime, price liberalization,
and some SOE reforms.
10.
The authorities are more upbeat about medium-term economic prospects. They expect
much higher medium-term growth in the range of 5 to 6 percent. The authorities expressed greater
optimism about reform implementation and anticipated higher investment than under staff’s
baseline scenario. They expect stronger external sector performance, helped by expected lower
energy import prices from Russia but also higher foreign direct investment and strengthened
competitiveness. They noted the challenges (and benefits) of increased competition from
globalization, and remain firmly committed to both deeper external economic ties as well as to
policies consistent with maintaining social stability. They broadly agreed with the range of risks
identified by staff, but see their policies, taken together, as significantly contributing to risk
mitigation. They expect quick resolution of the energy pricing issue with Russia and view the risk of
persistently lower oil prices as somewhat less likely. They see lower risks from the SOE sector, having
provided substantial support to SOEs in 2015 and taken some measures to improve SOE soundness.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
Discussions covered the macroeconomic, financial, and structural policies needed to
support stability, reduce vulnerabilities, and strengthen economic growth and income
prospects. Staff recognized that some important stabilization and reform measures have already
been taken, but urged additional front-loaded and deeper structural measures to: (i) mitigate
significant and rising risks to sovereign, financial sector, and external stability; (ii) achieve higher
sustainable levels of medium-term growth and income; and (iii) provide well-funded and targeted
SSNs to mitigate the impact of reforms.

governance, including a recent decree that separates regulatory oversight and ownership and
establishes independent supervisory boards. Another recent decree has replaced production targets
with objectives of profitability, efficiency, and export competitiveness, though there is evidence that
some SOEs are still receiving production target instructions from line ministries. The authorities
report that some small SOEs are being prepared for privatization. Looking ahead, they hope to
attract minority-stake strategic investors for large SOEs, and pursue a mixture of ongoing
operations, restructuring, insolvency, and privatization for other SOEs. In terms of tangible results,
employment in larger SOEs has fallen about 12 percent over the past two years, but few SOEs have
entered insolvency or been privatized.
14.

Some other important real sector reforms are also underway:

 Price liberalization. Price controls were reduced from 28 to 18 percent of the CPI basket, down
from 49 percent in 2011. Price ceiling controls remain on pharmaceuticals and some staples, as
well as a price floor on vodka.
 Rationalization of HH utility tariffs. (Box 4). HH utility tariff increases in early 2016 raised utility
cost recovery by an average of nearly 10 percentage points, reaching about 58 percent. The
authorities are not planning further HH tariff hikes this year, but have committed to a mix of tariff
hikes and cost reduction (particularly in the heating sector) to achieve 75 percent cost recovery in
2017 and 100 percent cost recovery by 2018. However, at present the authorities’ plans lack
sufficient detail to be credible—particularly with respect to expected cost reductions. They plan
to launch a better-targeted social support mechanism this year to help offset the impact tariff
hikes on HHs.
 Improvements in the business climate. (Figure 6). The authorities have achieved some progress
in Doing Business indicators, having reduced administrative and licensing procedures for
businesses and simplified startup, tax administration, and ownership registration procedures.
Progress has also been made in reducing the tax burden on businesses. The government recently
expanded the mandate of the Trade Ministry to include antimonopoly enforcement (aiming to
ensure a more competitive environment where needed).
Staff Recommendations
15.
Staff encouraged the authorities to accelerate and deepen structural reforms. Staff
argued that more comprehensive, deeper, and faster reforms are needed to improve resource
allocation and competitiveness, to reduce fiscal, banking, and external risks, and to support higher
sustainable growth.
 Deeper SOE reform. The mission supported plans for a comprehensive SOE strategy, while
stressing the overarching goal of greater market orientation and efficiency. Drawing on recent
FAD TA, staff urged the authorities to: (i) establish a fiscal risk monitoring unit tasked to carry out
a comprehensive review of fiscal risks emanating from the SOE sector on an ongoing basis; (ii)
undertake an in depth inventory of SOEs to determine which carry out commercial as opposed to
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

government functions; (iii) incorporate all commercial enterprises; (iv) implement legislation
requiring all key SOEs to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); (v) further
strengthen SOE corporate governance, including by implementing the policy to separate
ownership and regulatory functions through centralizing ownership in a single coordinating
entity and strengthening the independence and capacities of SOE boards; and (vi) enhance and
strengthen the framework for restructuring SOEs, including by developing clear insolvency and
privatization criteria and procedures. The mission also urged close coordination of SOE
restructuring with financial sector reforms, notably treatment of bad loans, and stronger SSNs.
 Rationalization of the utility sector. Staff supported the authorities’ plans to improve utility
cost efficiency, but noted that further significant HH tariff hikes are unavoidable to achieve the
government’s objective of 100 percent cost recovery by 2018. Staff urged adoption of clear, timebound measures with contingencies should cost reduction efforts fall short. Increases in cost
recovery levels should be matched by pro rata reductions in budget and industry cross-subsidies,
coupled with better funded and well-targeted SSNs to protect the most vulnerable. The cost
recovery program should also include a clear framework to take into account changes in
international gas prices and exchange rates. Once full cost recovery is reached, a clear mechanism
for maintaining full cost recovery should be employed.
 Strengthening competition policies and the business climate. Staff supported the objectives
of the new antimonopoly agency, and urged a close look at product market liberalization,
including in SOE-dominated sectors such as transportation and agriculture. Staff also urged
prioritizing WTO accession negotiations, which could provide a key anchor for structural reforms.
Authorities’ Views
16.
The authorities agreed on the need for further structural reforms, but are still
considering the most effective path forward. They are now assessing the findings of the recent
IMF TA mission on SOE reform and recommendations from other international partners, aiming to
develop a robust SOE reform strategy by 4Q2016. They expressed some concern about
implementation capacity and how to best strengthen some key elements of the reform process such
as the insolvency process and bad asset management. However, the authorities believe that with
their current work plan and further effort to build technical capacity, they will successfully implement
a far-reaching restructuring of the SOE sector consistent with greater market orientation and
efficiency. Regarding utilities, they noted that firmly addressing inefficiencies and lowering costs
were important to help build public support for needed utility tariff hikes, and expressed strong
commitment to meet their cost recovery objectives. They agreed that implementing a rules-based
utility tariff adjustment mechanism was an important medium-term goal. The authorities also agreed
on the importance of WTO membership, including as a driver of reform, but expressed concern that
they would be asked to accept less favorable terms than Belarus’s EEU partners. They also noted
potential benefits from EEU member plans to further harmonize regulatory standards over time.

B. Fiscal Policy: Strengthening and Recalibrating
17.
Public debt sustainability risks are rising, despite headline fiscal surpluses. Public
debt—including public guaranteed debt (PPG)—has increased significantly from below 40 percent
of GDP in 2013 to nearly 54 percent in 2015 (Figure 7; Table 3), owing to sharp depreciation and
quasi-fiscal operations, including recapitalizations and called guarantees.1 Debt is expected to reach
nearly 70 percent of GDP in 2021 as quasi-fiscal liabilities are realized.

18.
The authorities have tightened fiscal policy and revamped their fiscal framework. Key
steps taken by the government in response to deteriorating revenues, external pressures, and
mounting debt include:
 Tightening the 2016 budget. Export taxes were increased on potash, oil, and fuel. Excise and
property taxes were increased and tax expenditure efficiency was enhanced by elimination of
preferential VAT tax treatment for transportation and telecommunication sectors. Budget
expenditures have been cut, mainly through compression of capital spending and a freeze in real
public sector wages that has partially unwound rapid increases in recent years (and helped ease
wage pressures in the non-government sector—see text chart). The authorities are also reducing
off-balance sheet directed lending. The authorities continue to hold earmarked funds in reserve
for strengthened SSNs, including for unemployment benefits and a better-targeted social
support mechanism to mitigate HH utility tariff adjustments. The overall fiscal stance is somewhat
looser this year, but is expected to tighten next year (text chart).
 Updating the fiscal framework. The authorities aim to implement a 3-year budgeting process
with strengthened accountability, beginning with the 2017 budget cycle. They have also set up a

somewhat complex web of fiscal objectives: (i) a general government balanced-budget—but
excluding a new nuclear power plant (NPP) project costing close to 18 percent of GDP over
roughly 7 years, financed by Russia; (ii) a medium-term public debt ceiling target of 45 percent of
GDP (including the NPP, but excluding guarantees and local government debt); (iii) a prohibition
on new issuance of government guarantees (excluding IFIs); (iv) a medium-term objective to

maintain state tax revenues below 26 percent of
GDP, which they view as more consistent with peer countries; and (v) reduction of the ratio of FXdenominated public debt service-to-reserves to 45 percent by 2020. These changes follow
important tax reforms in recent years, including a unified tax code and harmonization with IFRS.
 Reforming the pension system and embarking on other medium-term plans. The authorities
recently approved an important parametric pension reform—a gradual increase in retirement
ages beginning January 2017—and reindexed pension income to inflation rather than wages (Box
5). Staff expects these measures to broadly maintain fiscal balance of the pension system through
2022. The authorities are also planning further reductions in tax expenditures, drawing on FAD
TA, and steps to increase efficiency in goods and service expenditures.
Staff Recommendations
19.


Staff urged additional steps to reduce vulnerabilities and support reforms and growth.
Strengthen the debt anchor. Staff supported
the debt anchor, but recommended that it be
more broadly defined to include guarantees and
local government debt. Staff noted that an even
lower debt threshold would be advisable given
significant risks identified in the public DSA,
including a history of large macro-fiscal shocks
(text chart), but acknowledged a cushion from
significant government cash deposits.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

 Further strengthen the fiscal framework. Staff supported adoption of medium-term budgeting.
To complement the debt anchor, staff urged a more explicit adjustment rule, preferably an
expenditure rule based on a broader budget definition (while also looking to simplify the overall
set of objectives to enhance communication and credibility). Staff also urged more transparency,
including identification and regular monitoring of fiscal risks, explicit recognition of quasi-fiscal
liabilities, and bringing all forms of quasi-fiscal government support to the economy on budget.
Staff estimates that unrecognized quasi-fiscal liabilities are around 15½ percent of GDP, though
this estimate is subject to significant uncertainty. Staff expects to refine these estimates using
results from the ongoing bank AQR exercise, and as better SOE performance information
becomes available. Staff also pressed the authorities to undertake recapitalization of the central
bank (3 percent of GDP) in line with MCM TA.
 Near-term easing, medium-term consolidation. Some near-term fiscal easing is warranted
given recession and a negative output gap, but should be followed by cyclically adjusted fiscal
consolidation of about 0.5 percent of GDP annually over the next five years (based on wellspecified measures), versus the baseline. With a low fiscal multiplier (about 0.1–0.3 in the first
year)2, the modest growth impact of the proposed medium-term adjustment can be more than
offset by growth enhancing structural reforms. Such measures would bring PPG debt (including
NPP) around 55 percent of GDP by 2021, and below the

 Additional revenue and expenditure measures. Given
sustainability concerns, staff recommended that debt
reduction be given priority over the aggregate tax

possible revenue measures are shown in the text table. On the expenditure side, a sustained
effort to limit real public wage growth would provide both fiscal and competitiveness benefits.
Capital expenditures should be protected.
 Additional pension reform: Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to reform the pension
system. However, staff urged the authorities to: (i) continue reforms to close the pension gap
after 2022; (ii) take additional measures to free up fiscal space to lower the burdensome social
contribution rate (35 percent); and (iii) take complementary steps to enhance labor participation.
Authorities’ Views
20.
The authorities viewed their efforts to tighten the fiscal stance in 2016 as sufficient,
and were noncommittal regarding additional consolidation measures. They expressed concern
about the rapidly increasing debt level, but highlighted that they have adopted several measures to
bring debt down to the target level. They plan to include local government debt in their debt target
and to reduce issuance of domestic FX-denominated bonds. Regarding realization of quasi-fiscal
liabilities, the authorities noted a lack of fiscal resources. They argued that budget resources for SOE
and banking sector should not be provided ahead of more fundamental reforms and further clarity
about the size of the problem, and that central bank recapitalization could be achieved more
gradually. Regarding possible future fiscal measures, they noted that they do not see space to raise
property taxes, and that further increases in excise taxes should depend on profitability of
companies in the relevant sectors. With respect to pension reform, the authorities stressed the
importance of maintaining a fiscally balanced system, and are committed to making additional
modifications as needed to achieve this. They did not see room to lower the SSC rate at this time.

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy: Maintaining Stability
21.
The authorities have strengthened the monetary and exchange rate policy framework.
In 2015, the central bank (NBRB) replaced its crawling peg with a de jure managed floating
exchange rate regime and money aggregate targeting. The authorities established broad money as
the nominal target, and BYR base money as the operational target. Interventions in the foreign
exchange market are broadly rules-based, guided by a wide crawling band allowing smoothing and
opportunistic build-up of reserves. The authorities’ medium-term objectives are to: (i) reduce
inflation to 5 percent by 2020; (ii) rebuild reserves to a ‘safe’ level of US$10 billion (roughly
100 percent of the Fund’s ARA RAM metric); and (iii) gradually transition to inflation targeting. In
July 2016, the authorities redenominated the currency to help boost confidence, issuing new bills
(“BYN”) that dropped four zeros.3 A staff assessment concluded that Belarus has eliminated all

previously identified multiple currency practices (MCPs) and exchange restrictions subject to IMF
jurisdiction under Article VIII.4
22.
Monetary policy has been tight in 2015–16 (Figure 8; Table 4). Monetary aggregate
growth has been contained at levels broadly consistent with the authorities’ inflation objective for
2016 of 12 percent (while excess liquidity and credibility gains have allowed some reduction in the
interest rate corridor). The reserve requirement has been used as an instrument to address structural
liquidity in the banking system as well as the dynamics of money supply. Over the past two years,
the NBRB lowered overall reserve requirements and unified the rate on domestic and foreign
currency deposits at 7.5 percent.
23.
Domestic credit growth remains subdued, despite excess domestic currency liquidity
in the system and lower interest rates. This reflects both supply and demand factors: banks
remain risk averse given rising NPLs while corporate and HH balance sheets and incomes are
weakened and face dim near-term market prospects. These factors, combined with high
dollarization and the significant share of government directed lending have contributed to a weak
interest rate transmission mechanism. The authorities expect the ongoing reduction in directed
lending will help address this, but have also introduced prudential limits on lending and deposit
rates to guide the yield curve and help reset market premia more in line with gains in credibility
(Annex IV).

Belarus eliminated previously identified exchange restrictions arising from the requirement of an NBRB permit for:
(i) advance payments for imports and payments for imports with delivery outside of Belarus; and (ii) the multiple
currency practices arising from: (a) the potential deviation by more than two percent of the exchange rates in the
over-the-counter (OTC) market and the Belarusian Currency and Stock Exchange (BCSE); (b) the potential deviation
by more than two percent of the exchange rates in the OTC market and the BCSE exchange rate or the official
exchange rate with respect to the mandatory resale of unused foreign exchange by resident legal entities and foreign
exchange amounts subject to mandatory sale requirement; and (c) broken cross rates among the currencies for which
the NBRB establishes official exchange rates with monthly frequency with respect to the mandatory resale of unused
FX by resident legal entities and FX amounts subject to mandatory sale requirement.

Staff Recommendations
24.
Staff urged the NBRB to maintain its focus on lowering inflation, while safeguarding
external and financial stability. The NBRB’s monetary policy stance (aggregate money growth
target) for 2016 looks broadly appropriate, though further efforts (including structural reforms and
steps to enhance central bank credibility) will be needed to bring medium-term inflation down in
line with objectives. With respect to the recently imposed prudential limits on interest rates, the
mission urged the NBRB to: (i) undertake an impact assessment of the measures, including their
impact on new lending and on depositor behavior; (ii) treat these measures as temporary; and (iii)
rely primarily on macroeconomic stabilization and progress in reducing vulnerabilities in the real and
financial sector balance sheets to bring down market interest rates. The mission advised the NBRB to
stand ready to tighten money aggregates if imbalances and financial sector pressures re-emerge.
25.
To further enhance monetary policy effectiveness, staff recommended strengthening
NBRB operations and operational independence. Staff urged the authorities to: (i) amend the
NBRB statute to clarify the primacy of price stability; (ii) recapitalize the NBRB; (iii) strengthen
communications; and (iv) propose a transition timeline to an interest rate-based operational target
and then inflation targeting.
26.
Staff recommended that the authorities maintain exchange rate flexibility while
seeking opportunities to rebuild reserves. The flexible exchange rate remains an important shock
absorber, and interventions should remain limited to smoothing volatility and rebuilding reserves to
more adequate levels as conditions allow. Given balance-sheet vulnerabilities, the authorities were
advised to facilitate real exchange rate adjustment (and promote export competitiveness) through
structural reforms.
Authorities’ Views
27.
The NBRB broadly agreed with staff views on monetary policy. The central bank
considers the current tight monetary policy stance as appropriate for reducing inflation. The NBRB
noted it has been building credibility through firm implementation of the money aggregate target
framework. The authorities view a stronger interest rate transmission mechanism as a prerequisite
for adopting the policy rate as the operational target, and for the eventual adoption of an inflation
targeting regime. The NBRB noted that its operational independence is sufficiently ensured by the
Banking Code, combined with provisions on its independence from other ministries and wellspecified issues on which the NBRB reports to the Presidential Administration. In addition, draft
amendments to the NBRB statute are being prepared which will clarify price stability as one of the
main objectives.
28.
The authorities agreed on the importance of maintaining a more flexible exchange
rate regime, while aiming to rebuild external buffers. They emphasized that the exchange rate is
market-determined with rules-based FX interventions limited to smoothing excessive volatility or to
maintain financial stability in the face of sharp exchange rate depreciation. The authorities broadly
agreed with staff’s assessment of reserve adequacy. They are aiming for a steady buildup of reserves
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

over the medium term, though some counterparts noted that reliance on further external borrowing
to rebuild buffers would carry risks of its own. The authorities felt that the exchange rate had settled
to a level broadly consistent with fundamentals or even overshot, noting that the real exchange rate
was below its historical average. They saw current account deficits of 2 percent of GDP or below
being financeable by FDI inflows, which had historically averaged similar levels. The authorities
agreed with the emphasis on structural reforms to deliver external adjustment, noting that high
dollarization added to the costs of any further significant depreciation.

D. Financial Sector: Bolstering Stability and Market-Based Lending
29.
The financial sector is severely strained. (Figure 9; Table 5). The recent FSAP assessment
highlighted concerns about credit and FX liquidity risks, and financial stability frameworks (Box 6).
Credit risk is being reflected in increasing NPLs while provisioning rates remain low. Deposit outflow
has slowed, but deposits remain well below their 3Q2015 peaks. Banks’ net open foreign currency
positions are within tight prudential requirements, though FX liquidity coverage ratios are low
(reflecting mismatches in short-term assets and liabilities for some currencies). Recently introduced
measures to distinguish between revocable and irrevocable deposits are steps in the right direction.

30.
The authorities are taking some important steps to reduce financial sector
vulnerabilities. In 2015, they closed four small banks, removed 1.5 percent of GDP in bad assets
from state-owned bank balance sheets, and established a Financial Stability Department in the NBRB
to monitor macro-financial linkages and risks. They also held the first meeting of the recently
established the Financial Stability Council and engaged the EBRD to help divest two state-owned
banks. In 1H2016, the NBRB initiated Independent Diagnostics Studies (“AQRs”) of the top 9 banks.
Staff Recommendations
31.
Staff stressed the urgency of implementing further measures to bolster financial
stability and strengthen market-based intermediation. Staff urged follow-up on key FSAP
recommendations, in particular to:

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

 Strengthen bank financial resilience. There is an urgent need to transition to an independent
and risk-based oversight of the financial sector. A well-functioning financial safety net should be
put in place. Bank FX liquidity buffers should be enhanced, including through a gradual increase
in the FX component of reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits. An enhanced set of
macroprudential policies could help contain FX liquidity risk from dollarization. Once the results
of the AQR are known (expected in 3Q2016), the authorities should firmly address any needed
recapitalization and restructuring of banks.
 Strengthen the NPL resolution framework. Staff emphasized that the framework should be
comprehensive and well-coordinated with SOE reforms and cuts in directed lending. Designating
a single entity for bad asset management, possibly paired with a lead role in SOE restructuring,
would better mitigate fiscal risks compared to more piece-meal approaches. Staff recommended
that the framework include appropriate valuation of assets and a broad range of instruments—
including privatization, P&A, and out-of-court settlements—that allow for permanent solutions.
 Maintain a limited, well-targeted role for the Development Bank (DB). Staff recommended
that DB operations be limited to areas not adequately addressed by commercial banks, such as
longer-term SME lending and export-import financing on terms consistent with international
obligations and best practice. The mission suggested that further consideration be given to the
mandate of the DB, consulting with international partners, targeting areas of market failure and
consistent with priority government policies. It could also include financing of infrastructure
investment. Staff urged that the prohibition on retail deposits remain in place. The mission noted
that DB operations could also include government-directed lending, so long as it is consistent
with overall phase down planned by the government.
Authorities’ Views
32.
The authorities expressed their commitment to implement the recommendations of
the FSAP mission. They agreed with the key areas of importance highlighted in the FSAP report and
plan to develop an implementation road map. However, they expressed concern about the
recommended approach to improve foreign exchange liquidity buffers, specifically the proposed
distinction of reserve requirements for local and foreign currency deposits (with a higher
requirement for the latter), given implications for the current setup of monetary policy operations.
They noted that the distinction between revocable and irrevocable deposits introduced from April
2016 has contributed to improving banks’ funding bases. The authorities plan to continue efforts to
de-dollarize the economy. They highlighted recent progress in addressing NPLs, including the
imminent launch of an asset management company (AMC) to restructure bad bank assets as a part
of overall rehabilitation plan for the agricultural sector. If successful, the authorities indicated the
AMC could take on bad assets from other sectors. The authorities see a prominent role for the DB in
export financing, SME loans, and infrastructure investment financing, given their assessment of
market failures in those areas. They stressed that SME lending by the DB is conducted under a WBdesigned program or done with similar principles on market terms, and are important for enhancing

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

the share of private sector in the economy. The authorities noted that the provision of export
financing is in line with OECD rules.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
The authorities have taken some welcome steps to support stabilization and reduce
vulnerabilities, but more is needed. Faster and deeper progress on the reform agenda, particularly
in the closely linked SOE and financial sectors, is needed to reduce macro financial vulnerabilities
and raise growth prospects. Specific SOE sector measures should include developing and
implementing a comprehensive SOE reform strategy that strengthens monitoring and diagnostics,
phases out production targets, scales down government directed lending, and strengthens
corporate governance. More specific time-bound measures are needed to achieve full utility tariff
cost recovery by the end of 2018. Further steps should be taken to strengthen the business
environment, including through stronger competition policies and seeking WTO membership.
34.
Fiscal policy should be further strengthened and recalibrated. In the near-term, fiscal
policies should prioritize well-targeted social safety nets and support for structural reforms
(including SOE reform and recognition of contingent liabilities from quasi-fiscal activities). Over
2017-21, fiscal consolidation averaging about 0.5 percentage points of GDP per year is
recommended (including through wage restraint) to bring debt down to target levels over the
longer term while also providing resources for spending priorities (e.g., capital expenditures). The
fiscal framework should be strengthened by: (i) including government guarantees in the debt limit;
(ii) adding an explicit fiscal expenditure adjustment rule to achieve debt targets; and (iii) increasing
transparency and identification of risks in the budgetary process, including by bringing quasi-fiscal
items such as directed lending subsidies on budget.
35.
The current monetary policy stance is appropriate. The NBRB’s aggregate money growth
target for 2016 is consistent with inflation objectives. The recent lowering of the policy rate corridor
is consistent with both re-pricing of the risk premium—given credibility gains by the NBRB—and
with recent liquidity and inflation developments, amid tight credit to the economy. Prudential
measures aimed at lowering lending and deposit interest rates should be temporary, and should not
be enhanced in the near term until further assessment is made of the impact of these measures on
inflation pressures and the financial sector, including depositor behavior. To further strengthen
NBRB credibility and facilitate a transition to inflation targeting, the NBRB’s operational capacity and
independence should be strengthened. Staff welcomes the elimination of the previously identified
multiple currency practices and exchange restrictions.
36.
External stability should be reinforced by structural reforms and rebuilding buffers.
Maintaining exchange rate flexibility remains important as a shock absorber, with interventions
limited to smoothing volatility and rebuilding reserves as conditions allow. Given balance-sheet
vulnerabilities, the authorities should promote export competitiveness through structural reforms.
Pay down of public FX-denominated domestic bonds is desirable in the medium term to reduce FX

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

exposure and support de-dollarization, but will need to be gradual in order to protect the fragile
reserve position. Gradually strengthening bank reserve requirements on FX deposits is appropriate
for building better bank FX buffers.
37.
To strengthen financial stability and facilitate more market-based intermediation, the
main findings of the FSAP should be implemented. It is critical to transition to an independent
and risk-based oversight of the financial sector. Other important areas include: (i) strengthening
bank financial resilience, including by completing AQRs and increasing FX liquidity buffers; (ii)
designing a holistic and in-depth NPL resolution strategy alongside corporate restructuring and
phasing out directed lending; (iii) designing a well-functioning financial safety net; (iv) strengthening
macro prudential policies to contain FX liquidity risks from dollarization; and (v) maintaining a
limited, well-targeted role for the Development Bank, with operations primarily focused on areas not
adequately addressed by commercial banks.
38.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Box 1. Belarus: From Extensive to Intensive Growth
Past real GDP growth has been based on factor accumulation, with very high investment.
Between 1995 and 2008, growth was rapid, driven by very high investment. However, high growth
was not sustainable or effective—neither from a macro-perspective (it led to high current account
deficits), nor from a micro-perspective (the sharp expansion of the capital stock was increasingly
offset by falling efficiency levels). A change towards more intensive growth is needed with a much
larger role for efficiency increases. More reliance on market mechanisms would help in this, and
would address both macro and micro problems.

Box 2. Belarus: External Stability Assessment
Belarus’s external position is fragile in the wake of external shocks and deep recession.
Gross international reserves (GIR) ($4.3 billion at
end-June 2016) are equivalent to about (30)
40 percent of the ARA metric for (fixed) floating
exchange-rate countries—well below most adequacy
thresholds and below predetermined short-term net
FX drains ($5.9 billion). The authorities see GIR of
around $10 billion (100 percent of ARA metric for
floating exchange rates) as adequate. The level of
reserves stabilized following the central bank’s shift
to a more flexible exchange rate regime.
The net international investment position (NIIP)
reached -82 percent of GDP at end-March 2016. NIIP
remained unchanged in dollar terms during 2015,
but deteriorated by 20 percentage points of GDP
owing to exchange rate depreciation and recession.
The current account deficit (CAD), historically
volatile, has narrowed from 10 percent of GDP in
2013 to 3.8 percent in 2015. Import compression has
offset weak exports and the negative impact from
low oil prices—which contribute to negative
spillovers from Russia and erode comparative
benefits from energy imports from Russia that are
priced below world price levels.

EBA-Lite methodologies indicate a real overvaluation of up to 10 percent, still significant but
below previously reported estimates. The two approaches for Belarus show the CAD remaining
above estimated norms:
External sustainability approach. Under baseline growth prospects, a current account (CA) norm of
-0.2 percent of GDP would be needed to stabilize the NIIP at -60 percent of GDP by 2035. This
compares with an underlying CA of -3¼ percent of GDP (baseline projection). Applying CGER
elasticities to the resulting CA gap of 3.1 percent of GDP implies a REER gap of 8 percent.
CA approach. This approach estimates a CA norm of -0.1 percent of GDP (versus 2015 CA of -3.8
percent of GDP) based on a regression-based “fitted” value (-0.3 percent) and a policy gap (-0.2
percent) derived by: (a) making room for an annual increase in reserves of about $1 billion; and
(b) setting other policy variables to their actual 2015 values. Under the resulting CA gap of
3.7 percentage points of GDP, CGER elasticities imply a REER gap of 10 percent.

Box 3. Belarus: Baseline and Adjustment Scenarios, 2016–21
In 2016, the Belarusian economy is projected to contract by 3 (3½) percent under staff’s
baseline (adjustment) scenario, as domestic demand falls. (Figures 10 and 11). Inflation is
expected to rise, reflecting depreciation and seasonal factors.
Under staff’s baseline scenario, medium-term growth will remain tepid, with rising
vulnerabilities. Output will bottom out next year. Reforms being undertaken by the authorities
support a small upward revision of medium-term potential growth, to around 1¾, compared to
the 2015 Article IV estimate. Inflation will remain in double digits through 2018 as remaining
administrative regulation of the economy and energy cross-subsidies continue to distort prices.
Constraining factors include limited financing, weak terms of trade, negative demographics,
structural impediments, weak bank and corporate balance sheets, uncertainty surrounding high
macroeconomic vulnerabilities, muted growth prospects in key trading partners, and insufficient
resources to repeat investment-led domestic demand increases of past years. The public sector
will continue to rely on placement of FX-denominated paper with banks.
Under the adjustment scenario, real GDP growth will initially be weaker than under the
baseline scenario, but will then rebound to relatively higher levels. During 2016–17,
consumption and investment will be weaker as directed lending slows and real wages fall (though
cushioned by enhanced SSNs). This will be partially mitigated by an improving trade balance—
from import compression and some REER depreciation. Inflation is expected to remain in double
digits in 2016–17 due to utility tariffs hikes, price liberalization, and further depreciation. Over the
medium-term, growth is expected to rise to slightly above 4½ percent, before settling into a
longer term potential growth rate of around 3½ percent. Macroeconomic adjustment, positive
effects of structural reforms—including SOE and bank reforms to increase market orientation and
more market-based pricing—, and stronger corporate and bank balance sheets will create
conditions for increased competitiveness and sustainable higher growth. Total factor productivity
will rise, accompanied by more efficient resource allocation, higher quality investment, and
increased labor participation (from pension and other reforms). Competition policies, easier
access to credit, and private enterprise expansion in sectors such as agriculture, utilities, banking,
transportation, and healthcare—which have been traditionally dominated by the state—would
further support private sector development. Modernization, FDI, and trade liberalization
(including WTO accession) would allow export diversification away from commodity-dependent

Box 4. Belarus: Utility Tariffs and Cost Recovery
Household (HH) utility tariffs in Belarus remain below full cost-recovery levels and lower
than in regional peers. Below-cost pricing for HH utility services weighs on public and external
balances, encourages overconsumption and underinvestment in efficiency-enhancing measures,
and undermines competitiveness of industries that cross-subsidize HHs by paying above cost
prices.

Belarus’s proposed HH utility reforms are

increase the average cost recovery of all utilities from 48.5 percent in 2015 to 100 percent in
2018. So far in 2016, they have reached 58 percent, and plan to achieve 75 percent cost recovery
in 2017.
Sources: Belarusian and Ukrainian authorities; and IMF staff calculations.

The authorities are reinforcing SSNs to protect the most vulnerable HHs from the impact
of utility sector reforms. While the impact of utility reforms on HH expenditures will be
significant, the impact on the poorest is expected to be fully offset by a new targeted social
assistance mechanism, effective 4Q2016. The new mechanism will be funded from the budget
(with fiscal space generated by lower budget subsidies to utilities).

Box 5. Belarus: Pension System Sustainability and Reform Options
Belarus’s pension system is currently near balance, following policy measures in recent
years. Contributions from employers and workers roughly match payments to retirees. This
achievement is unusual in the region (many peers have imbalances), and reflects a series of policy
measures in recent years to maintain the balance despite negative demographics. These include
recent increases in the minimum eligibility period for a retirement pension from 5 to 20 years.

Further reforms before 2023 would create space to reduce the very high social security
contribution rate of 35 percent (29 percent for pension contributions; 6 percent for other social
programs). Measures could include: (i) gradual increases in male and female retirement ages to
65 and then link them to life expectancy; (ii) re-indexing benefits to inflation instead of wage
growth in the long-run (though retaining some mix for minimum pensions); (iii) continuing early
retirement reduction; and (iv) measures to incentivize labor demand for older age cohorts.

Box 6. Belarus: FSAP Key Findings and Recommendations
Systemic Solvency and Liquidity. Banking sector credit risk is very high, while FX liquidity risk is rising. Credit
concentration risk is large at individual banks and indirect credit risk from unhedged borrowers in FX remains a
concern. The main risk for systemic liquidity derives from high dollarization of deposits; liquidity stress tests reveal
significant pockets of vulnerability in FX positions. Legal, liquidity, and operational risks exist in the interbank payment
system. Direct cross-border contagion risks are large, especially from Russia. The insurance sector is exposed to
significant contagion risk, through investments in bank deposits and credit default insurance products.
Banking and Insurance Oversight. State ownership increases the complexity of achieving independent risk-based
financial oversight. The adjustment of prudential standards as a form of forbearance in the banking sector is eroding
market discipline. The lack of detailed requirements on corporate restructuring may result in understated problem
loans and evergreening. The NBRB should undertake AQRs on banks with significant differences between their IFRS
and local accounting standard provisions and impose Pillar 2 capital add-ons and other forward looking measures to
reinforce capital prudential measures. Bank and insurance oversight is constrained by lack of operational
independence. The risk management framework for financial market infrastructures needs a stronger legal basis, risk
scenarios, and links with central bank governance. The planned move of the supervision of the Development Bank
(DB) to the NBRB should be combined with adequate staffing capacity.
Systemic liquidity management. High deposit dollarization and limited access to FX liquidity poses significant risk.
The liquidity needs, especially in FX, are likely underestimated as term deposits are callable without penalty. The NBRB
should increase the reserve requirement rate for FX deposits required to be integrated in FX accounts, rather than in
local currency, and recalibrate mandatory liquidity indicators by currency to better reflect these risks.
Macroprudential policy and framework. The authorities should implement the planned creation of the Financial
Stability Council legally mandated for ensuring financial stability. The risk assessment framework should be enhanced,
including identification of unhedged FX debtors, and specific measures, such as increasing the risk weights on
exposures to unhedged debtors, should be considered to complement macroeconomic policies for de-dollarization.
Resolution of NPLs. A holistic and in-depth NPL resolution, hand-in-hand with corporate restructuring, is critical for
preserving financial stability. NPL resolution responsibilities should be delegated to an entity with wider powers for
debt and enterprise restructuring and with a broad menu of instruments. The legal framework governing
creditor/debtor relationships is comprehensive, but several laws and institutions need improvement. Non-judicial and
in-court procedures allow quite rapid recovery of NPLs but liquidation and rehabilitation proceedings are perceived
as ineffective.
Financial Safety Net. A comprehensive financial safety net is needed. The NBRB should be designated as responsible
for bank resolution. Resolution tools should be broadened. A new Emergency Liquidity Assistance facility to provide
collateralized emergency liquidity support to solvent banks is urgently needed. The Deposit Insurance Agency should
be able to provide funding for purchase and assumption transactions. The authorities should consider limiting the
amount of deposit insurance coverage and shortening the payout period, in line with international standards, over

Development Bank. Given the DB’s growing role in development finance, its mandate needs to be clarified and its
governance, risk management and supervision strengthened. Its focus should be limited to areas not adequately
served by commercial banks (e.g., export and SME financing). The DB should continue to be prohibited from taking
customer deposits and provide enterprise financing through whole sale lending to other banks. The DB could finance
viable infrastructure and longer term investment projects on the basis of competitive project selection and costbenefit analysis.

Annex II. Public and External Sector DSAs (Baseline Scenario)
Public debt sustainability risks have increased substantially, mainly reflecting potential further
depreciation and contingent liabilities risks related to bank and SOE recapitalization. Much of public
debt is in foreign currency, making it vulnerable to exchange rate depreciation. The recessionary
environment also poses significant challenges to meeting large gross financing needs. Under the
baseline scenario, public debt is projected to peak at just under 70 percent of GDP in 2021. Gross
financing needs are forecast to remain elevated over the medium term, at above 15 percent of GDP.
External debt is at elevated levels. It is projected to peak at 83 percent of GDP in 2017, and then to
very gradually fall (including under shock scenarios).

A. Background
1.
Public Sector Debt coverage. Belarus’s gross debt statistics cover the general government1
and government guarantees. At end-2015, gross public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt
amounted to 53.7 percent of GDP. Although the government has a large stock of assets, including
around 12 percent of deposits in the banking sector (the NBRB and commercial banks), a portion of
these deposits are in locked dollar deposits at the NBRB to offset FX reserves and directed lending,
and might not be sufficiently liquid. Therefore, this Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) focuses on
gross debt.2 Should some deposits be freed up in the context of reductions in directed lending,
there would be upside risks to this assessment.
2.
Exchange rate depreciation poses large fiscal risks and is the main factor contributing
to the deterioration of public debt

3.
Contingent liabilities are another major factor for the worsening debt dynamics.
Estimated realized liabilities reflect the government’s extensive involvement in economic activities, in
the form of direct activity, SOEs, guarantees, and directed lending. The deterioration of the
macroeconomic environment has put pressure on companies, including SOEs. Profit margins are

down and many enterprises are loss-making. As a result: (a) bank loans have become increasingly
non-performing; (b) a high ratio of public guarantees has been called; and (c) in some cases,
government has had to directly recapitalize SOEs. The baseline scenario assumes additional
realization of contingent liabilities of around 15½ percent of GDP over 2016–2021. There is an
additional need to recapitalize the NBRB (around 3 percent of GDP).

B. Baseline
4.
Macroeconomic assumptions. The assumptions underpinning the public sector DSA are
those of the baseline scenario. The recession that started in 2015 is projected to continue in 2016
and 2017 with a cumulative decline of around -7½ percent of GDP due to slowdown both from
external and domestic demand. Growth is projected to recover in 2018 and then to converge to its
potential growth rate of just over 1 ¾ percent of GDP in 2021. The assumed fiscal adjustment brings
the primary balance to 1.8 percent of GDP by 2021, which implies an improvement of 2.8 percentage
points of GDP during 2018–2021, partly reflecting completion of the nuclear power plant project.
Projected nominal interest rates on new borrowing are between 6 and 10 percent over 2016–21,
with the effective nominal interest rate at 6½ percent on average.3 In the baseline scenario, gross
debt remains elevated, approaching 70 percent in 2021. Gross financing needs are projected to
remain above the high-risk threshold of 15 percent of GDP on average over the medium term. By
the end of the projection horizon, the primary balance required to stabilize debt in the baseline
scenario is 1.8 percent of GDP.
5.
Past forecast errors. Forecast errors in growth have been mixed, while there is a tendency
of being pessimistic in primary balance forecasts in the past. The median forecast error for GDP
growth and the primary balance were at -1.1 and 1.4 percent, respectively, while inflation forecast
error is more in line with other countries’ forecast errors (except the 2011-13 period).
6.
Realism of projections. Belarus’s projected fiscal adjustment (an improvement of about 2
percentage points in the cyclically adjusted primary balance/GDP over the medium term) is in line
with other countries’ experiences, with a 3–year cyclically adjusted primary balance at the 27th
percentile among all surveillance countries.

C. Public Sector DSA: Shocks and stress tests
7.
Stress tests indicate that debt dynamics in Belarus are particularly vulnerable to
changes in the exchange rate.
Real GDP Growth Shock. The impact on the debt-to-GDP ratio of the 1 standard deviation
shock (4.8 percent) to real GDP growth is large. Real GDP growth rates become negative over
2017−18 with around 100 bps lower inflation each year. The primary balance worsens before
recovering in 2019; interest rates increase accordingly and remain high until 2021. In this



INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

scenario, gross debt increases above 90 percent of GDP in 2021 while gross financing needs
reach almost 30 percent of GDP.


Real exchange rate shock. The impact on the debt-to-GDP ratio of shock to exchange rate
(178 percent depreciation; the maximum achieved in the past decade) could result in an
increase of gross debt to 110 percent of GDP, while gross financing needs would reach 39
percent of GDP. This vulnerability is the result of rising debt dollarization. Foreign investors
hold a negligible portion of domestic government debt.



Real interest rate and primary balance shocks. These two shocks introduce interest rate
hikes starting from 2017, and a deteriorating primary balance in 2017–2018, in comparison
with the baseline. However, these two shocks do not change debt dynamics significantly.



Combined macro-fiscal shock. An additional combined macro-shock scenario pushes the
debt-to-GDP ratios to above 200 percent, with the largest contribution to the shock
stemming from the exchange rate. The macro-fiscal shock combines the growth and interest
rate shocks and a primary balance shock as in the standard examples in the stress tests,
together with the real exchange rate shock consistent with a maximum movement of the
real exchange rate over the past 10 years and a pass-through coefficient of 0.25. The effect
of these shocks on debt ratios and gross financing needs is large and reflects in particular
the sensitivity of debt to exchange rate shocks, which make the largest contribution to the
change in the debt path.

 Losses could translate into higher public debt,
including from direct state bailouts of strategic
SOEs, or indirectly through recaps of state-owned
banks with SOE-related losses.

 Further fiscal adjustment to achieve debt targets. Pursue
faster and broader structural reforms in the SOE sector to
improve monitoring (e.g., for SOE fiscal risk assessment),
governance, and performance.

5. Uneven domestic policy

Annex IV. Measures Affecting Interest Rates and FX Demand
1.
Nominal and real interest rates have been at elevated levels for a sustained period.
(Annex IV). Following the foreign exchange crisis and a surge in inflation in early 2011, the
authorities implemented a number of measures to stabilize the economy. These have included
tighter monetary and fiscal policies and a shift to a more flexible exchange rate regime. While the
inflation rate stabilized by mid-2013, monetary policy has been kept tighter in light of the
devaluation in early 2015. Real rates have remained significantly above the average prior to the
crisis: real lending rates for new loans in local currency (excluding concessional lending) have
averaged 20 percent for legal entities and 18.3 percent for HHs since 2013, compared to 5.3 percent
and 7.8 percent in Jan-2005-Mar-2011, respectively. Real interest rates for new term-deposits in
local currency averaged 11.0 percent for legal entities and 17.0 percent for HHs since 2013,
compared to 1.1 percent and 4.6 percent during the earlier period. Possible factors contributing to
the higher real rates in local currency are elevated inflation expectations including from depreciation
risks and weak policy credibility, and a weak monetary policy transmission mechanism.
2.
The monetary transmission mechanism has been constrained by high dollarization and
government directed lending. Foreign currency lending accounts for 38 percent of total credit to
the economy, and directed lending (in both local and foreign currencies) accounts for about
35 percent as of mid-2016. The share of non-directed lending in local currency declined to
18 percent compared to a peak of over 40 percent in early 2011, in part reflecting the significant
depreciation of the BYR. The interest rates for non-concessional loans have been driven up given
diversion of lending resources to government programs. On the funding side, interest rates on new
fixed-term deposits have gone through repeated cycles of surge and decline in recent years,
reflecting volatile exchange rate expectations.
3.
Beginning in 2015, the NBRB has implemented increasingly tighter recommendations
and administrative measures to create incentives to lower lending and deposit rates.9 These
measures rely on penalties for non-compliance, with a prudential element mixed in. These measures
have been only partially binding so far, and real interest rates remain significantly positive (Annex
IV).
 Lending rates. The NBRB has set lending rate thresholds that, if exceeded, trigger special
provisioning. For lending rates, the coefficients are set at 1.4 and 1 for HHs and legal entities. The
authorities say the measures are in part intended to mitigate incentives for high interest loans to
failing borrowers—and are coordinated with steps to free up credit space for non-concessional
borrowers by reducing directed lending.
 Deposit rates. The NBRB has also issued recommended limits on deposit rates that, if exceeded,
trigger higher required reserves. As of June 2016, the thresholds for fixed-term deposits in local

currency are set at 1 and 0.8 times the NBRB’s overnight credit rate for irrevocable and revocable
deposits over 6 months for HHs,1 and 0.8 and 0.6 respectively for legal entities. According to the
 authorities, they also create prudential incentives for attracting more stable time deposits by
allowing higher limits for longer term deposits.
4.
Administrative measures affecting FX demand. Corporate purchases of foreign currencies
can be made for limited purposes only, including for FX debt payments and imports. Corporates also
have a mandatory surrender requirement of 30 percent of corporate FX proceeds. The mandatory
surrender rate was temporarily increased to 50 percent in December 2014 in light of exchange rate
pressures, and was reduced to 40 percent in February 2015 and back to 30 percent in April 2015
(following the shift to a more flexible exchange rate).

The coefficient for irrevocable household deposits over six months will be reduced to 0.9 from August 2016.

1/ Public sector is defined as the augmented general government (including local government, Social Protection Fund, nuclear power plant spending) and guarantees.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ EMBI.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
8/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).

Statement by the Staff Representative on Belarus
September 2, 2016
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the
issuance of the Staff Report on August 11, 2016. This information does not alter the thrust
of the staff appraisal.
2.
Effective August 17, 2016, the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB)
lowered the refinancing rate and rates on liquidity provision instruments. The
refinancing rate was reduced from 20 to 18 percent and interest rates on standing facilities
and bilateral operations of the NBRB were reduced from 25 to 23 percent. The Board of the
NBRB noted slowing inflation, net supply of foreign exchange on the domestic foreign
exchange market, an improvement in deposit structure towards irrevocable deposits with
longer maturities, and other factors. They noted that lower interest rates will also help reduce
financial stability risks by improving the ability of non-financial organizations to fulfill credit
obligations to banks.
3.
The non-performing loans continue to increase. At the end of July 2016 the share
of NPLs in gross loans reached 14.3 percent relative to 13.4 percent at the end of June 2016
and 6.8 percent at the end of 2015.
4.
An independent asset quality review of nine banks has been completed. The
results are expected to be discussed by the Financial Stability Council.
5.
Effective August 5, 2016 the NBRB became the supervisor of the Development
Bank.

Statement by Mr. Canakci, Executive Director for the Republic of Belarus
and Mr. Misyukovets, Advisor to Executive Director
September 2, 2016
The Belarusian authorities appreciate the productive dialogue with the Fund staff during the
2016 Article IV Consultation. Since they agree with the staff’s assessment of macroeconomic
developments and their recommendations on economic and financial policies, we will elaborate
on the recent developments, the authorities’ policy response to challenges, and the prospects for
cooperation with the Fund.
Recent Macroeconomic Developments and Outlook
In 2015-2016, Belarus has been facing strong combined exogenous shocks, with adverse
global and regional events continuing to dampen economic activity in Belarus. In 2015, for the
first time in two decades, real GDP contracted by 3.9 percent. Ample supplies and weak demand,
especially for industrial commodities, contributed to the continued slide in most commodity
prices in 2015 globally and had a direct adverse impact on Belarus’ exports. The sharp decline in
oil prices in the second half of 2014 triggered a recession in Russia, Belarus’ main trading
partner, and contracted demand for manufactured goods, including trucks, agricultural
machinery, tractors and metal products. During 2015, exports of goods to Russia fell by 31.5
percent year-on-year in dollar terms. The economic crisis and the conflict in Ukraine, the second
largest trading partner for Belarus, resulted in a 38 percent drop in exports, while Ukraine’s share
in Belarus’ total merchandise trade continued to shrink. Overall, exports and imports of goods
and services declined drastically in dollar values, by 24.2 percent and 25.4 percent, respectively,
although the trade balance in 2015 was moderately positive at 0.3 percent of GDP.
The efforts to address inflationary pressures by containing liquidity, credit and wage
growth helped keep inflation contained, but it remained in double digits and reached the
projected 12 percent in 2015, fueled by the need to increase regulated utility and public transport
tariffs, fiscal revenue enhancing measures, and rubel depreciation. After a spike in early 2016,
inflation had been decelerating steadily since March and, for January-July 2016, it reached 7.8
percent, with the resulting annualized inflation of 12.4 percent nearing the authorities’ 2016
target of 12 percent.
Fiscal policy continued to be prudent despite persistent pressures from lower-than-projected
growth rates, declining external trade, and deteriorating financial performance in the real sector.
Nevertheless, the general and central government budgets in 2015 reported a surplus of 1.5
percent and 1.7 percent of GDP, respectively, as a result of stringent fiscal policy measures.
Adverse developments continue to strongly impact fiscal performance, but the authorities firmly
aim at maintaining a budget surplus. As a result of robust fiscal consolidation, the general and
central government budgets in January-June 2016 reported a surplus of 1.6 percent and 1.5
percent of GDP, respectively.
Owing to tighter macroeconomic policies, the current account deficit narrowed consistently
from 10.4 percent of GDP in 2013 to 6.9 percent of GDP in 2014, and to 3.8 percent of GDP in

2
2015. In January-June 2016, the current account deficit amounted to $1.5 billion, somewhat higher
than in January-April 2015 ($0.9 billion). The current account deficit for the entire year 2016 is
estimated at up to 5 percent of GDP. Following the protracted global commodity price trend,
exports of goods in January-June 2016 contracted by 18.8 percent and imports dropped by 13.0
percent compared to the same period a year earlier. Overall, the turnover of external trade in goods
and services in January-June 2016 declined by 13.6 percent in dollar terms, with a slight deficit of
trade in goods of $148.7 billion, mainly due to the decline of export prices despite the 1.2 percent
growth in export volume compared to the first six months of 2015. Excluding the trade in energy
products and potash exports, the foreign trade balance improved by $418 million, or 1.9 percent
of GDP.
The economic outlook is subject to uncertainty. The recession has continued in 2016, driven
by subdued oil prices, weak demand for Belarusian exports, and structural bottlenecks. In
January-June 2016, GDP dropped by 2.7 percent compared to the same period in 2015, although
month-on-month data shows signs of a bottoming out and a gradual slowdown of the decline,
indicating an improvement towards year-end. Although a recovery into positive territory in 2016
is unlikely, real GDP may contract by about 2 percent in 2016 in the absence of further shocks.
Despite some recovery of oil prices, public finances and external balances are under strain, while
continued oil and commodity price volatility clouds the outlook. The level of international
reserves remains low, enough to cover about 1.7 months of imports. The deteriorating terms of
trade and subdued domestic demand put pressure on corporate finances, increasing the number of
unprofitable operating enterprises. Non-performing loans rose to 14.25 percent of total lending at
end July 2016, from 6.8 percent at end July 2015, mainly due to the recession and exchange rate
depreciation. Real wages declined by 3.9 percent as compared to January-June 2015, suggesting
a deterioration of household welfare. Unemployment increased to 1 percent in 2015 from 0.50
percent in 2014 and, as of July 1, 2016 stood at 1.1 percent.
Policy Response
Strengthening policy action is of critical importance. External uncertainties necessitate
enhancing the flexibility of the economy to adjust to external shocks and ensuring the effective
distribution of resources. The authorities are in the process of implementing a set of policies
aimed at safeguarding and strengthening economic stability based on sound macroeconomic
management to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn and at creating conditions for
sustainable growth. As in 2015, the macroeconomic framework hinges on a tight monetary and
fiscal stance, exchange rate flexibility, market-determined credit supply, and productivity-based
wage dynamics. Restoring sustainable growth in the medium term will require broad-based
structural reforms.
Fiscal policy has been instrumental in addressing shocks. Decisive revenue enhancing
measures were taken for the 2016 budgeting through broadening the tax base, raising the rates
for certain taxes, and eliminating tax concessions. However, the continued negative effect of
macroeconomic conditions driven above all by external factors, such as the world oil price
decline and the depreciation of the Russian ruble, necessitated further steps to be taken to collect
additional revenues and reduce the dependence of revenues on external demand for raw
materials. On the expenditure side, substantial debt service payments were incurred due to

3
significant external debt liabilities and the depreciation of the BYN. Nevertheless, the
authorities’ policy action, including at the regional level, have helped sustain fiscal performance
and led to a general government budget surplus, even as the economy contracted. Overall, in the
first six months of 2016, the authorities implemented strong fiscal consolidation measures in the
total amount of BYN 2 billion, reserved and deferred spending for a total of BYN 1.6 billion, or
5.6 percent of expenditures. Mindful of the demographics and the need to maintain a fiscal
balance of the pension system, the authorities launched a pension reform, with a gradual increase
of the retirement age for men and women by three years during the next six years.
Monetary policy is firmly aimed at slowing down inflation. To achieve this objective, the
authorities, in line with the Fund’s recommendations, keep tight control over money supply and
will limit broad money growth in 2016 to below 18 percent (December-on-December) against 41
percent in 2015. Policy rates remain positive in real terms. Deposit interest rates are kept
positive, and lending activities are managed using standard market toolkits. In the context of
price liberalization – including the prices of natural monopolies – inflation will stay in double
digits in 2016, but the authorities are confident that monetary targeting will allow for bringing
inflation down to single digits from 2017 and to 5 percent by 2020. In the medium term, the
authorities plan to transition to inflation targeting.
A managed floating exchange rate regime is in place as a step toward a full float as the
ultimate goal. Limited interventions of the National Bank in the foreign exchange market
resulted in a net purchase in an effort to build up international reserves, while the rubel
depreciated in 2015 by 36 percent against the basket of currencies. A notable depreciation of the
real effective exchange rate of the rubel contributed to price competitiveness of the Belarusian
merchandise. The achieved stability allows the authorities to lower surrender requirement for
exporters from 30 percent to 20 percent from September 1, 2016, and to announce the further
liberalization of the foreign exchange market. Coupled with measures to contain wage growth
and fiscal consolidation, the new exchange rate regime triggered a rapid reversal of the market
sentiment – in January-July 2016, net sale of foreign exchange by households amounted to $886
million. Trade in foreign exchange by corporate market participants was balanced, with sales and
purchases of $8.9 billion each. As confidence rebounded markedly, the rubel depreciated
moderately in 2016 and created conditions for a redenomination of the national currency unit.
Banking supervision is continuously strengthened. Keeping the share of problematic assets at
an economically safe level will continue to be achieved through further limitation of credit and
foreign exchange risks, including on the basis of comprehensive assessments of borrowers’
financial positions. Nevertheless, the banking system has a certain capital resource: as of
August 1, 2016, the actual regulatory capital adequacy ratio was at 17.1 percent, with the
requirement of 10.625 percent accounting for the conservation buffer. Banking supervision pays
increased attention to banks’ corporate governance and risk management systems. In order to
strengthen equity and liquidity management, Basel III capital requirements have been adopted
this year, and work will continue to comply with Basel III liquidity requirements. In April 2016,
a joint IMF/World Bank mission completed an appraisal for Belarus under the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP). The FSAP team assessed progress in achieving compliance with
international banking sector supervision standards and noted the accomplishments in establishing
an integrated bank supervisory process. In line with staff’s recommendation, an independent

4
asset quality review of the largest banks has been completed to inform practical steps to
strengthen financial sustainability of the banking system.
Structural reforms are key to regaining competiveness and diversifying the economy. The
Roadmap for Structural Reforms, prepared jointly with the World Bank, supported the
authorities’ intention to safeguard achievements of macroeconomic stabilization and address
structural constraints. To this end, a number of relevant policy measures have been implemented,
such as the abolition of price controls over socially important goods and tighening of conditions
for government directed lending and long-term financial assistance to state-owned enterprises
(SOEs). In April 2016, the Government approved an Action Program for 2016-2020 geared
toward regaining competitiveness, reducing vulnerability to developments in the external
environment, and promoting economic growth in a sustainable manner.
Progress has been made with improving corporate governance of SOEs by replacing the
system of hard quantitative targets with indicative ones and by setting profitability and efficiency
as primary objectives for SOEs. Progress with the actual privatization of SOEs, however, has
been limited, primarily reflecting low investors’ demand, but the authorities are moving ahead
with the sale of small- and medium-sized SOEs. In June 2016, an international competition was
announced to attract investors for two of the eight companies under the pilot project; ten more
enterprises will be selected for privatization. The authorities appreciate the Fund’s recent
technical assistance on SOEs, and work is in progress on integrating staff’s recommendations on
strengthening SOE oversight and governance in their program documents.
Creating a liberalized market and developing an enabling regulatory framework for
private sector development is one of the key objectives. Continuous efforts are being made to
improve the business climate and regulatory quality, aiming at ensuring consistent, predictable
and efficient enforcement. Progress in this area led to Belarus’ World Bank’s Doing Business
ranking moving from 57 in 2015 to 44 in 2016; further reforms have been identified by the
World Bank staff for the upcoming Doing Business Report 2017. Cross cutting work to improve
the business climate will be accompanied by catalytic reforms to accelerate the development of
the SME sector.
The utility tariff reform is high on the agenda. Given the high social sensitivity of reforms in
the sector aimed at reaching full cost recovery by end 2018, a phased approach has been chosen.
The authorities raised the utility tariffs in January 2016 to reach an increase in cost coverage by
10 percentage points. The next steps were to review the costs of utility companies based on an
earlier pilot project in the sector and to develop a strong social safety net, including putting in
place a social assistance scheme to target the most vulnerable segments of the population during
subsequent tariff increases. As a result of the rationalization of costs associated with the
provision of utility services to households, cost coverage in 2016 will reach at least 50 percent,
and the non-cash household subsidy system will be operational by October 2016.
External Partnerships
Enhancing the cooperation with international partners is essential to ensure that reforms
are mutually reinforcing and irreversible. The World Bank Group’s continuous engagement

5
has been highly instrumental for informing the implementation and design of ongoing and
planned reforms. The Bank’s financial support for enhancing competitiveness and private sector
development is in the Bank’s lending pipeline for Belarus. The Bank’s analytical and advisory
services and technical assistance programs included a Roadmap for Structural Reforms in March
2015 and four other major reports covering key aspects of structural reforms, including SME
development, insolvency reforms, labor markets, regional development, governance of SOEs,
and WTO accession. An extensive advisory work on public financial management was supported
by the Bank’s lending operation to help strengthen policy alignment of the budget, improve
budget transparency, and lay the foundation for putting in place an Integrated Financial
Management Information System. With a €471 million current portfolio of projects, the EBRD
has recalibrated its operations in Belarus to focus more on bringing new investors for private
sector development and facilitate public-private partnerships under the recently adopted PPP law.
There is a regular dialogue with the EU and bilateral partners on structural reform and
governance issues. Belarus has also intensified its efforts to move ahead with the WTO accession
negotiations. Belarus entered into a new program with the Eurasian Fund for Stabilization and
Development (EFSD), which incorporates policy action across the macroeconomic stabilization
and structural transformation spectrum, and has successfully completed two reviews under the
EFSD’s $2 billion financing facility.
A Fund-supported program for Belarus would play a catalytic role in pursuing the reform
agenda. The Fund’s responsiveness is very much appreciated. The authorities have benefitted
from intensive technical assistance and regular consultations with the Fund staff and are
committed to implementing the Fund’s policy advice. The authorities’ responses to past policy
recommendations were broadly consistent, as is well described in the staff report. A Fundsupported program would help solidify the gains of the adjustments and contribute to building
strong macroeconomic fundamentals. A program with the Fund would also send a strong positive
signal to the general public and international business community. Given that Belarus has
advanced appreciably in macroeconomic stabilization and that the structural agenda is currently
being mainstreamed in the national social and economic development program, the authorities
reiterate their strong commitment to reforms and look forward to reengaging in negotiations on a
Fund-supported program.
