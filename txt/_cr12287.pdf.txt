STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 27, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: Ethiopia pursues a public sector-led growth strategy that focuses on
promoting growth through high public investment supported partly by low nominal
interest rates. While the strategy has contributed to robust economic growth in the
past, recent developments indicate a buildup of vulnerabilities which need to be
addressed in order to sustain this growth performance.
Growth prospects: While inflation remains high (21 percent at end-2011/12), real GDP
growth, which is estimated at around 7 percent in 2011/12 and is projected to decline
to 6.5 percent in subsequent years under the continuation of current policies, is still
robust.
Policy mix: The discussions focused on policy options to sustain strong growth and
the current disinflation process and to address emerging risks and vulnerabilities. Staff
recommendations centered on achieving low inflation, maintaining financial sector
stability, increasing the role of the private sector in economic activities, and managing
risks associated with the current public investment plan. Staff supported the monetary
and fiscal policy stance to bring inflation down and emphasized the need for
continuing the fight against inflation, in particular by maintaining the policy of no
central bank financing of the budget. Immediate activation of the treasury bill market
for liquidity management and raising of interest rates is recommended for proactive
monetary policy implementation, and to support domestic savings mobilization efforts
for financing investment under the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP). Easing of
restrictions on private banks would also help promote financial deepening and
facilitate the realization of the GTP objectives.
Risks: The planned significant domestic financing of the GTP could result in a
deceleration of medium-term growth and a buildup of vulnerabilities absent the
necessary policy adjustments. Other risks arise from the uncertain prospects for the
global economy, which could affect the GTP objectives. Additionally, challenges related
to realizing domestic financing of the GTP remain.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

BACKGROUND
1.
Ethiopia is pursuing a public sectorled development strategy that focuses on
promoting growth through high public
investment facilitated partly by low
nominal interest rates. The strategy calls for
government directed economic policy, with a
dominant role for public enterprises in
infrastructure development. Within this
development strategy, the authorities adopted
a 5-year Growth and Transformation Plan
(GTP) in November 2010, which aims to attain
high GDP growth (an average annual rate of
over 11 percent) and achieve the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs).1 Among its
strategic pillars is an emphasis on agriculture,
promotion of industrialization, and investment
in infrastructure.

macroeconomic imbalances have
resurfaced. Inflation rose above 40 percent in
August 2011 from 10 percent in
November 2010 and resulted in highly
negative real interest rates and an overvalued
real exchange rate. Federal government
budget execution and monetary policy were
tightened later in 2011 and as some special
factors contributing to the surge in inflation—
including the after effects of birr devaluation in
September 2010, international commodity
price increases, and drought—began to
subside, inflation, though still elevated, is now
on a declining path (Figure 1). However, other
risks and vulnerabilities related to the
financing model of the large public investment
projects are now emerging.

2.
The strategy has contributed to
lifting economic growth, and Ethiopia has
been making significant progress in all
areas of the MDGs (Table 1). Robust growth
in the recent past and pro-poor focus of the
government budget have resulted in
significant poverty reduction: the authorities’
preliminary estimates indicate that the poverty
head count declined from 38.7 percent in
2004/05 to 29.6 percent in 2010/11.

4.
The recommendations from the
2011 Article IV consultations have only
been partially implemented. The authorities
implemented the base money nominal anchor;
however, positive real interest rates are yet to
be realized and little was done to reinforce
liquidity management at the National Bank of
Ethiopia (NBE). Similarly, little progress has
been made on structural reforms to liberalize
the foreign exchange and trade regimes, or
improve the business climate. The authorities
continue to put much emphasis on improving
physical infrastructures such as road and
electricity supply, which they believe would
help improve business climate.

3.
However, after the second and final
Exogenous Shocks Facility review was
completed in November 2010,
1

The macroeconomic objectives and planned
investments in the GTP are discussed in the Joint Staff
Advisory Note (IMF Country Report, No. 11/303). The
authorities published the Annual Progress Report for
2010/11 in March 2012. The financing plan in the
original GTP was only indicative, and the authorities
are mindful of the implications on debt sustainability
in implementing the plan.

5.
The 2012 Article IV discussions
focused on policy options to sustain the
robust growth rate and the current
disinflation process and to address
emerging risks and vulnerabilities in the
system. The mission’s recommendations

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

focused on achieving low inflation, appropriate
pacing of scaling up public investment,

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

financial sector stability, and increasing the
role of the private sector in economic activities.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Economic Developments
6.
The authorities’ determination to
reduce inflation has been paying off,
though some challenges remain. Inflation
has decelerated to 21 percent in June 2012
from the recent peak of about 40 percent in
August 2011, reflecting a tight monetary policy
stance and a slowdown in food inflation
(Figure 1). Despite this achievement, inflation
remains high and nonfood inflation continues
to hover around 20 percent. Absent the
significant public sector spending to achieve
the GTP objectives the pace of inflation decline
would have been sharper. According to the
authorities, the slow pace of inflation decline
reflects instead supply side constraints.
Although economic activity has been affected
by high inflation, real GDP growth in 2011/12
is estimated at around 7 percent; this is a
robust performance given the weakness of the
global economy, and is above the average
growth for sub-Saharan African countries. 2
Domestic credit grew by 41 percent year-onyear at end-April 2012, driven by a sharp rise
in public sector borrowing to finance large
infrastructure investment projects, contributing
to an increase in broad money by 30 percent.
7.
The authorities have been
implementing their national accounts
improvement action plan.3 A recent
AFRITAC EAST mission found commendable

2010 Article IV mission.

progress in improving the compilation
methodology. Additional efforts by the
authorities and the IMF staff are expected to
help reconcile the historical differences
between official GDP statistics and the staff
estimates.
8.
Although federal government
budget execution has been tight given the
objective of supporting inflation reduction,
the public sector as a whole has been
providing strong fiscal impulse (Figure 1). In
the first 10 months of 2011/12, federal
government revenue grew by 51 percent while
total expenditure including transfers to
regional governments grew only by
30 percent; the overall deficit was 0.8 percent
of annual GDP compared to 2.3 percent in the
budget. However, the public sector (including
state-owned enterprises) as a whole has been
providing strong fiscal impulse based on its
borrowing from the state-owned Commercial
Bank of Ethiopia (CBE). A sharp rise in regional
government deposits at CBE, a drawdown of
excess reserves, and a lowering of reserve
requirement in January 2012 contributed to
the funding.4
9.
Implementation of the base money
nominal anchor has been instrumental in
reducing inflation. Annual base money
growth at end-April 2012 slowed to
1.3 percent as the central bank has ceased

The authorities are trying to understand the large
build up of regional government deposits with CBE.

providing new direct credit to the government
since July 2011 and has been selling foreign
exchange (FX) reserves in recent months to
achieve a base money contraction target of
4 percent for the fiscal year (Figure 1).
However, as some banks significantly drew
down their excess reserves and started having
difficulty maintaining the required reserves,
NBE lowered the reserve requirement ratio in
January 2012. The lowering of the ratio from
15 percent to 10 percent has weakened the
tightening effect of the base money
contraction. Broad money at end-April 2012
grew by 30 percent year-on-year on account
of strong credit growth to public enterprises.
10.
The real effective exchange rate has
been appreciating, an indication of loss of
competitiveness and a cause of concern for
external stability. After the large devaluation
of September 2010, and as a result of high
inflation, the real effective exchange rate
(REER) in May 2012 reached the highest level
since March 2009 and is overvalued in the
range of 11–23 percent according to the
assessment based on the IMF’s Consultative
Group on Exchange Rate (CGER) methodology.
Survey-based indicators also suggest that high
costs of doing business are undermining
competitiveness. (Figure 1 and Annex I).

11.
Foreign exchange reserves were
significantly run down as a result of foreign
exchange sales to sterilize liquidity. Gross
official reserves in April 2012 decreased by
almost $1.2 billion to 1.8 months of projected
imports for 2012/13 from its peak in
September 2011. In the absence of an active
treasury bill market, FX reserves have been the
primary monetary policy tool to affect the level
of liquidity. Reserve adequacy analysis
indicates that higher months of imports
coverage are recommended given the
exchange rate regime in Ethiopia (Annex II).
12.
The improvement of current account
balance in 2010/11 is reversed due to a
strong growth of imports in 2011/12. The
current account recorded a small surplus in
2010/11 owing to a decline in imports of
capital and consumer goods, which appear to
reflect some front loading of imports in the
previous year. Foreign investors in the targeted
sectors that receive government support
contributed to a diversification of exports.
Despite a continued robust performance in
export of goods and remittances in 2011/12,
strong consumer goods imports and the
deteriorating service balance in the first half of
the period, moved the current account into a
deficit. Notwithstanding these improvements,
large errors and omissions recorded in
2011/12 need to be addressed.

B. Outlook
13.
Growth is projected to decelerate in
the medium term. This is largely attributed to
the limited opportunities for the private sector
to leverage the large public investment to
further raise growth. In view of these
developments, and based on continuation of
current policies, staff project real GDP growth
to moderately decline to 6.5 percent in the

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

medium term (Box 1 and Table 3). On the
external side, solid increases in goods exports
are expected, supported by growth of
emerging sectors. Vulnerabilities remain,
however, as the prospects for the world
economy are uncertain and the REER is
overvalued.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

Box 1. Ethiopia: Growth Accounting
The official statistics registers remarkable economic
growth in Ethiopia in the last 8 years. The real GDP
growth has remained above 10 percent since
2003/04 when the Ethiopian economy recovered
from a severe drought in 2002/03.

For Ethiopia, existing literature finds TFP growth
between 0 to 1.4 percent until the early 2000s. For
other countries, studies find TFP growth of
1.6 percent for OECD countries, 0.5–1.6 percent in
East Asia and 1.4–4.6 percent in China in 1984–94.

A growth accounting applied to Ethiopian data
reveals two underlying features (Table below). First,
large part of the growth was driven by large capital
investment in the public sector. Capital stock grew,
on average, by 10.8 percent, which by far exceeds
capital growth rates for sub-Saharan Africa in the
1980s (2.0 percent) and even East Asian countries in
the 1980s (8.9 percent) where the growth was highly
capital intensive.

Several factors that normally support high TFP were
absent in Ethiopia. These factors include: initial
human and physical capital conditions, terms of
trade and openness, good macroeconomic
environment, such as low inflation, competitive real
exchange rate, low government consumption, high
international reserve coverage, and low external
debt.

Second, the official statistics implies long-lasting
rapid productivity growth between 2006/07 and
2010/11, the average contributions to the growth
are estimated at 2.6 percent from the labor and
3.2 percent from the capital, implying total factor
productivity (TFP) growth of 5.2 percent. The
estimated TFP growth is high both by the Ethiopian
historical standard and the cross-country
comparison.

Real GDP growth (official)
Real GDP growth (IMF estimates)

High implied TFP productivity growth in Ethiopia
seems therefore implausible, suggesting an
existence of problems in the official growth
estimates. Possible issues include remaining
weaknesses in national accounts compilation
methodologies and the accuracy of the source data.
With moderate TFP growth, reflecting the factors
that are less supportive for Ethiopia, moderate real
GDP growth would be expected over the medium
term.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

C. Risks
14.
There are near-term downside risks
(Table 2). Key risks arise from the uncertain
prospects for the global economy that could
lower export prices and from domestic
policies. Although the crisis in Europe has had
little spillover to the Ethiopian economy to
date, a worsening of the crisis could reduce
demand for Ethiopian exports and lower
export prices and result in shortfalls of aid
flows, lower remittances, and limited financing
for infrastructure investment in the GTP. On
domestic policies, the planned significant

domestic financing for large public investment
projects of the GTP could result in a further
buildup of vulnerabilities. Other key risks
include: (i) entrenched inflation expectations
and a return to monetary expansion in the
context of limited active use of monetary
instruments; (ii) weather related shocks,
particularly the late onset of the rainy season
and possible drought returning to the Horn of
Africa; and (iii) a further deterioration of the
restrictive business environment.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: PROMOTING GROWTH AND
REDUCING VULNERABILITIES
15.
Ethiopia aims to sustainably raise
growth in line with its goal to reach middle
income levels by 2025, while maintaining
macroeconomic stability. The government’s
objectives for 2012/13 are to sustain the
robust economic performance and to lower
inflation further to single digits by the end of
2012. For the medium term, the authorities
target growth at around 11 percent a year and
inflation at single digits in line with the GTP. To
achieve these objectives, authorities’ current
policies promote high public investment
supported partly by low nominal interest rates
and a tight monetary policy, which has relied
so far on two instruments—FX sales and no
NBE financing of fiscal deficit, with the latter
planned to be reversed in 2012/13.
16.
On the basis of a continuation of
these policies, staff baseline scenario
expects a deceleration of medium-term
growth and a building up of vulnerabilities
on both domestic and external fronts. The
vulnerabilities relate to: limited use of available

monetary policy instruments (securities) to
control inflation; low foreign reserve levels; a
possible reinforcement of systemic risks
associated with the dominant state-owned CBE
and its increasing exposure to public
enterprises; large accumulation of debt by
public enterprises; and crowding out of the
private sector—all of these being associated
with the authorities’ policy choices. Some
adjustments in macroeconomic and financial
policies would therefore be needed to mitigate
these vulnerabilities as discussed below.
17.
The discussions focused on
prioritized recommendations which aim at
improving macroeconomic performance
and mitigating vulnerabilities without
fundamentally altering the country’s
development model. These include
(i) maintaining financial sector stability;
(ii) keeping inflation under control to eliminate
highly negative real interest rates and
exchange rate overvaluation; (iii) creating
space for an increased private sector’s role in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

the economy; and (iv) achieving higher foreign
reserve coverage.
18.
Given the development model and
based on these recommendations, staff
developed an alternative scenario that aims
at safeguarding macroeconomic stability
and reducing vulnerabilities, while
preserving strong growth (Table 7). Under
staff’s alternative scenario, the growth rate is
projected to rise to 8.5 percent in 2016–17
through appropriate pacing of scaling up
public investment; a larger private sector

participation; inflation would decline further to
6 percent by 2014; real interest rates would
turn positive, expanding the deposit base; the
exchange rate would become more
competitive; and FX reserves would recover to
the 3.2 months of imports at the end of the
projection period. This scenario assumes that
the 27 percent NBE-bill requirement would be
modified through a dialogue with private
banks (Box 2) and private sector access to
credit from the banking system would
increase.

A. Monetary Policy
19.
The authorities’ efforts resulted in
inflation reduction. Following the
implementation of the base money nominal
anchor policy, base money contracted by
about 9 percent over the first 10 months of
2011/12. Supported by a slowdown in global
food and fuel price inflation, the
contractionary base money policy has been
instrumental in the recent decline in inflation
to 21 percent in June 2012. The policy of no
NBE financing of the government and
significant sales of foreign exchange were
deployed to achieve this outcome.
20.
The NBE’s direct financing of the
government is expected to resume in
2012/13. This policy reversal could raise
inflationary expectations, which are still high,
and hamper authorities’ efforts to bring
inflation down.
21.
Going forward and absent additional
active use of other monetary policy
instruments such as flexibly priced
securities, sustaining inflation reduction will
be challenging. Absent additional active use
of other monetary policy instruments, the
planned NBE budget financing for 2012/13 will

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

leave FX sales as the only active instrument for
liquidity management. In this context, the low
level of FX reserves which are under two
months of import cover projected in 2012/13
makes the monetary policy stance less
credible, especially in the context of changing
money demand conditions.
22.
A proactive liquidity management
(e.g., use of treasury bills) will be important
to contain the risks of inflation resurging.
This would facilitate matching money supply
to money demand, encourage the
development of the money market, and
through a response by the broader interest
rate structure support domestic mobilization
of resources by the financial sector. Staff
expects that the pace of inflation reduction will
be slower than anticipated by the authorities
(Table 3).
Authorities’ views
23.
The authorities share staff concerns
regarding high inflation but view last year’s
pick-up in inflation as only weakly linked to
monetary policy. Instead, they attribute the
pick-up to imported inflation given the rise in

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

international commodity prices last year. They
believe that the planned NBE budget financing
would be consistent with the demand for base
money. They also argue that low nominal
interest rates are necessary to finance public
investment and only aim to have real rates

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

near zero over time: flexible pricing of
securities for the conduct of monetary policy
will be considered when single-digit inflation is
firmly achieved. If money demand conditions
were to change direct instruments would be
used.

B. Financial Sector Policy
24.
The country’s banking sector
comprises 16 banks, including a dominant
state-owned bank, CBE, whose assets
represent about 70 percent of the sector
total, as of April 2012. The remaining
15 banks, mainly private, together account for
the remainder. The authorities’ development
strategy is based on directed lending mainly to
public enterprises via CBE and, to some extent,
government targeted private sector activities
via the government-owned Development Bank
of Ethiopia (DBE). This policy, combined with
the current high inflation, and negative real
interest rates, results in a significant transfer of
resources from creditors (savers) to borrowers,
especially the public sector.
25.
The NBE directive introduced in
April 2011 is having tangible impacts on the
banking sector, including maturity
mismatch and less profitability.5 The
requirement on private banks to purchase NBE
bills equivalent to 27 percent of any new loans
appears to have a sizable negative impact on
private banks’ intermediation activities (Box 2).
The requirement also has the potential of
creating maturity mismatches as private banks
collect savings at two to three-year maturity
5

The directive requires private commercial banks to
hold 27 percent of the gross loan extension
(irrespective of the tenor) in a 5 year NBE bill at an
interest rate of 3 percent per annum while deposit
rates are around 5 percent.

and even shorter in some cases, but have to
freeze these resources for five years at rates
lower than cost of funds. There is also a risk
that as the profitability of private banks
reduces on account of less intermediation
because of this directive, they could raise
noninterest income charges such as fees and
commissions to recoup these losses, further
impacting negatively on the private sector.6
Staff proposed that appropriate pricing of NBE
bills and changing the basis for the allotment
from gross to net disbursements should be
considered.
26.
Financial soundness indicators
provided by the authorities do not point to
immediate concerns, but vulnerabilities
appear to be building in the sector. The
banking sector overall is well capitalized and
the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) for the sector
has consistently been around 18 percent over
June-2008—June-2011 well above the
regulatory 8 percent minimum (Table 8).
However, in less than a year the ratio sharply
declined from 18.1 percent (June 2011) to
13.6 percent (March 2012), possibly reflecting
6

The directive does not have any direct effects on
liquidity for the banking sector. The liquidity absorbed
through the issuance of the NBE bills is re-injected into
the system via DBE, where the proceeds are
transferred for on-lending to finance government
targeted private sector activities. The NBE bills are
illiquid as they are not tradable since banks are
required to hold them to maturity.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

Box 2. Ethiopia: Assessing the Impact of the 27 percent NBE Bill Requirement on Private
Banks
In April 2011, the Ethiopian authorities issued a
directive requiring private banks to purchase NBE
bills equivalent to 27 percent of any new loan
disbursements. These bills have low-interest earning
of 3 percent and a maturity of 5 years.
The 27 percent NBE bill requirement has the
potential of crowding out private sector
financing. To highlight this possibility, an illustrative
numerical scenario is considered where the initial
fund available to a bank for its intermediation
activities is birr 1.27 million (Box Table 1). Out of this
fund, the bank is assumed to disburse a one-year
loan in the amount of 1 million birr at the current
lending rate of 9 percent and purchase NBE bills of
0.27 million birr as required. After one year when this
loan is paid back, the total loanable fund available to
the bank (birr 1,098,100) would be the loan repaid
plus the interest it generated, plus the interest
accrued on the NBE bills. Out of this fund, the bank
can extend the maximum of birr 864,676 and is
required to purchase additional NBE bills of birr
233, 463, with the stock of NBE bills rising to birr
503,454.

Renewing such an operation every other year over
five years would reduce the fund available for
lending by the bank to birr 590,677 in the fifth year,
while the stock of NBE bills rises sharply to birr
1,045,748 (Box Table 1), suggesting a significant
crowding out of private bank lending to the private
sector. It is also an indication that the allocative role
of private banks is being taken over by the
government, raising the issue of the efficiency of
such an allocation. If private banks were to try to
circumvent this heavy penalty, by issuing one long
term (5 years) loan and to comply with the
27 percent only once, it would put the financing of
the DBE—which relies on the proceeds of the
27 percent NBE bills—at risk.
The requirement also has the potential of
creating maturity mismatches. Private banks
collect savings mostly at two to three-year maturity
and even shorter in some cases. Fulfilling the
27 percent requirement means that they have to
freeze these resources for 5 years, creating a clear
maturity mismatch.

an increase in risk-weighted assets driven by
the high domestic credit growth to finance
public entrerprises. The authorities are yet to
provide an explanation behind the decline in
the solvency ratio. Non-performing loan ratio
standing at 1.8 percent as of March 2012
appears unusually low, especially given the
strong domestic credit expansion. The
aggregate loan-to-deposit (LTD) ratio, which
has remained within prudent bounds at above
80 percent over June-2008—June-2011, has
now jumped to more than 92 percent in
March 2012, raisig the need to strenghten
oversight. Similarly, the ratio of liquid assets to

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

total assets, which has consistently been above
30 percent over June-2008—June-2011,
declined to 19 percent in March 2012. The
sharp decline in CAR and the liquidity ratio,
and the sharp jump in LTD could reflect
warning signs that vulnebilities might be
building in the sector. Staff did not have access
to sufficient data to fully assess the reported
financial sector indicators.
27.
Recent developments in the banking
sector require continued close scrutiny by
the NBE. Ethiopia’s financial sector policies
mirror the country’s development strategy.

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

These policies have so far delivered robust
economic growth and the NBE is
strengthening its oversight of the financial
sector to ensure its stability. However, recent
developments such as the increasingly
dominant market share of CBE and its growing
exposure to large public enterprises, and the
impact of the 27 percent requirement on
private banks, suggest a need for a closer
scrutiny of the banking system. It would be
important to undertake a diagnostic of the
sector to better assess potential vulnerabilities
that might be building up even in the context
of the authorities’ ongoing implementation of
measures in the sector. An assessment such as
under the Bank-Fund Financial Sector
Assessment Program would be helpful to this
end. The authorities have a long-standing
opposition to a Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP), and the mission’s attempt to
obtain banks’ balance sheet data in order to
undertake a banking sector diagnostic—which
could be useful in coming up with specific
recommendations—did not succeed. Thus,

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

substantial information gaps on the health of
the financial sector remain.
Authorities’ views
The authorities do not share staff concerns
about the financial sector. They disagree with
staff assessment of the impact of the
27 percent NBE bill requirement arguing that
private banks remain overall highly profitable.
In addition, the authorities indicated that NBE
is vigilant in taking actions to mitigate any
risks that would emerge. These actions include
training of staff on risk based supervision,
implementation of World Bank financial sector
capacity building recommendations, quarterly
stress testing of banks, close supervision of
CBE given its systemic importance and
exposure to large public enterprises, and
benchmarking of the CBE operations to those
of international banks. They saw no need for
an assessment such as under the FSAP for at
least two years and until capacity building
exercise being undertaken is completed.

C. Fiscal Policy
28.
Spending by the public sector is
contributing to increased vulnerabilities.
Some of the large infrastructure investments
are financed domestically, causing inflationary
and balance of payments pressures, possible
systemic risks in the banking sector, large
accumulation of public debt, and crowding out
of the private sector. This suggests the need to
start monitoring the operations of the
consolidated public sector to assess the overall
fiscal stance. Currently the only available timely
indicator is credit from the banking system in
the monetary survey.
29.
The 2012/13 government budget
focuses on sustaining growth, lowering

inflation further, mobilizing revenue, and
spending on pro-poor projects. The revenue
target is within reach with the continuation of
administrative efforts. Total expenditure is
projected to grow slower than nominal GDP,
but poverty-related spending as a share of
GDP will be maintained. The projected overall
fiscal deficit is 2.9 percent of GDP, an increase
from 2.3 percent in 2011/12, because of a
change in the donor-funded Protection of
Basic Services from a grants-based project to a
loan-based one. About half of the deficit is
financed domestically, including central bank
financing of 1.0 percent of GDP.

A panel regression analysis with data for 15
emerging African countries indicates that an increase
in the share of agricultural GDP by 1 percentage point
would lower the tax-to-GDP ratio by 0.27 percentage
point and an increase in the share of imports in GDP
by 1 percentage point would raise the ratio by
0.19 percentage point.

31.
An improvement in public financial
management should support further
strengthening of the social impact of
government spending. This is important
because, given the Ethiopian economy’s
vulnerabilities to large exogenous shocks such
as food price increases and droughts,
strengthening the existing social protection
mechanism is essential to preserve the gains
towards the MDGs. The implementation of
program-based budgeting (PBB), which started
in 2011/12 with the federal government, has
proven effective in improving allocation
efficiency and performance monitoring. The
challenge, however, is to introduce the PBB to
regions where the capacity constraints remain.

The Integrated Financial and Management
Information System is being piloted in several
federal and regional bodies. The pilot will end
by August 2012, and a rolling-out strategy will
be developed subsequently. The government
has been putting in place a strong control on
its cash flows.
Figure. Selected Emerging African
Countries: Factors Affecting the Tax-to-GDP
Ratio

30.
Fiscal structural reforms need to be
accelerated to achieve the GTP fiscal
objectives. The revenue administration reform
supported by IMF technical assistance, with the
focus on key priority areas, should help
maintain the moderate increase in the tax
revenue-to-GDP ratio. However, going by the
current trend, achieving the GTP target for the
tax revenue-to-GDP ratio of 15 percent would
require additional efforts, such as a major
improvement in taxpayer compliance. A
comparator analysis suggests that Ethiopia’s
relatively low tax-to-GDP ratio reflects a larger
share of agriculture (particularly small scale,
noncommercial farms) and less openness.
Stronger tax administrative efforts by Ethiopia
would therefore be needed to overcome these
constraining factors and catch up with the
comparators in raising tax revenue.7

Bank, World Development Indicators database.

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

Authorities’ views
32.
The authorities see vulnerabilities
related to the high public sector spending
as manageable. In their view, monetary and
financial sector policies are adequate and
priority investment projects should continue.
They acknowledge difficulties in monitoring
the operations of the consolidated public
sector, given the capacity and data constraints
in terms of timeliness and coverage. They

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

consider their focus on revenue mobilization
through administrative improvements as
appropriate and expect that these would
deliver the necessary revenue increases. They
also noted that public financial management
reforms would need to be appropriately paced
and sequenced given the capacity constraint.
Continued technical assistance from the IMF
and other development partners is necessary
to support their efforts.

D. External Policy
33.
Foreign exchange reserve sales were
used for liquidity sterilization, and are likely
not to recover given the substantial imports
needs to finance GTP investment.
Substantial FX sales have led to significant
decline in FX reserves, which currently stand at
about 1.8 months of imports. Higher inflation
in 2011/12 has contributed to an appreciation
of REER. Going forward the real appreciation
needs to be reversed in order to reduce
vulnerabilities and restore competitiveness of
the economy. The premium between the
official and parallel market exchange rates
recently widened possibly reflecting
unsatisfied demand at the official exchange
rate which according to NBE is not the case as
all formal demand was met at this rate.
However, staff did not receive sufficient data
to analyze or underpin these developments.

Buildup of foreign exchange
reserves from currently projected
1.8 months of import cover at end-2011/12
to above 3 months will be required in the
coming years to provide a buffer against
potential exogenous shocks. An analytical
assessment suggests that an optimal
precautionary level of FX reserves for Ethiopia
is even higher, estimated at 7.1 months of
prospective imports (Annex II). Maintaining an
adequate stock of safe and liquid assets will be
critical, especially in the current volatile global
environment notwithstanding the low financial
returns on FX reserves. This would also call for
some flexibility in the nominal exchange rate.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

Authorities’ views
35.
The authorities shared the view that
building up foreign exchange reserves
would be desirable, but did not plan to do
so immediately. The priority now is to fight

against inflation through FX sales, and will
accumulate the reserves once inflation is
stabilized. In addition, they see a high
opportunity cost of holding foreign exchange
reserves given the returns in highly profitable
infrastructure projects.

E. Unlocking the Growth Potential Through Structural Reforms
36.
Ethiopia’s track record of growth
and poverty reduction in recent years is
solid. Growth in Ethiopia has been robust
compared to other Sub-Saharan African
countries. According to the authorities the
decline in poverty likely reflects the
development in the economic and social
sectors and better implementation of welfare
program such as the productive safety net
program.8
37.
Despite this remarkable
performance, achieving the authorities’
own goal of reaching middle-income status
would require sustaining such a
performance and even some acceleration of
growth. However, the disruptions to the
supply-side from stiffer licensing regulations,
high inflation, and most significantly from
recent NBE directive which constrains private
sector credit weigh on the short and mediumterm growth outlook. More broadly, business
climate indicators highlight structural
weakness that could undermine
competitiveness. In the World Bank’s Doing
Business Survey, Ethiopia stands at 111 out of
183 countries in 2012, moved down from
97 out of 179 countries in 2007.

8

The authorities are undertaking detailed poverty
analysis in order to underpin the factors explaining
poverty reduction.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

38.
Structural reforms aimed at
promoting inclusive growth are critical for
sustaining high growth and making further
progress in achieving the MDGs. Inclusive
growth over an extended period is vital for
progress towards poverty reduction and the
MDGs. Inasmuch as inclusiveness encompasses
equity and equality of opportunity—in terms
of access to markets, resources, and unbiased
regulatory environment for businesses and
individuals—policies should be geared
towards a longer-term perspective. They
should focus on providing incentives for the
emergence of a wide range of activities
capable of creating jobs for high-skilled and
low-skilled workers alike. The authorities would
need to: (i) develop and implement with the
assistance of key donors, including the
International Labor Organization a growth
strategy that is anchored on improving
productivity and creating new employment
opportunities; (ii) undertake deep reforms
aimed at creating a business-friendly
environment, in particular by strengthening
the judiciary and the regulatory framework,
land registry and promoting access to
financing; (iii) consider structural
improvements to alleviate credit constraints
and trade related restrictions; (iv) continue the
privatization of commercially-run enterprises;
and (v) provide opportunities for the private
sector to leverage the large public investment.

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

Authorities’ views
39.
The authorities recognized the
importance and need for continuing
inclusive growth. They noted the emphasis on
agriculture—a labor intensive sector—as a

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

strategic pillar in the GTP. They underscored
that they are promoting the development of
non-traditional export sectors such as flowers,
leather products, and textile. They noted that
they are already pursuing privatization of
commercially-run enterprises.

F. Managing Debt and Risks Associated With the Current Public
Investment Plan
40.
Public sector debt is increasing as
the government implements its public
sector-led growth policy. The
implementation requires large public sector
borrowing and domestic resource
mobilization. Staff noted that at the current
negative real interest rates, mobilizing
additional resources through the financial
sector to facilitate GTP financing will be
difficult to achieve and there is a risk of a
reversion to monetary financing or excessive
non-concessional borrowing (Box 3).
41.
Based on staff’s macroeconomic
projections and authorities’ external
borrowing plans, Ethiopia maintains a low
risk of external debt distress. It is important
to note that this scenario assumes that the
government maintains the amount of new
external loans, particularly nonconcessional
ones, as currently in the pipeline for the next
few years. The ongoing large public
investment projects rely heavily on domestic
financing which would lead to a large
accumulation of public debt and crowd out the
private sector. In this context, the
macroeconomic model (presented during the
mission) designed to analyze the impact of
scaling-up public investments with a mixture
of financing options could be a useful tool to
better understand the risks involved and

promote dialogue among the authorities on
appropriate types of financing and levels of
public infrastructure investments.
42.
Expanding the scope of the
monitoring of public debt will be needed to
manage risks associated with rapidly rising
domestic debt of major public enterprises.
The debt sustainability analysis that was
conducted during the Article IV mission
showed that Ethiopia would remain at a low
risk of external debt distress. Maintaining the
low risk of external debt distress is the current
focus of the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Development. However, the authorities are
encouraged to develop a comprehensive debt
management strategy and to monitor
domestic and external public sector debt more
comprehensively. Monitoring the whole
operations of the consolidated public sector,
including contingent liabilities arising from
financial transactions among public entities
and their potential implications for the budget,
would be desirable. Given the capacity and
data constraints including timeliness and
coverage, an immediate focus on monitoring
at least consolidated public debt should be a
priority. Staff supports the authorities’
intention to request technical assistance from
World Bank and the IMF in developing a
medium-term debt strategy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

Box 3. Ethiopia: Financing of Public Investment
Background
Under the Growth and Transformation Plan,
Ethiopia is aiming for an ambitious growth
objective supported by a scaled-up public
investment plan. Large part of investment will be
carried out by public enterprises, most notably
Ethiopian Electricity Power Company (EEPCO),
Ethiopian Telecom Company (ETC) and Ethiopian
Railway Company (ERC).
Public investment depends largely on nonmarket mode of financing. External financing relies
on loans from multilateral and bilateral official
creditors as well as commercial loans from nontraditional creditors. Domestic financing relies on
borrowings from state-owned Commercial Bank of
Ethiopia and Development Bank of Ethiopia. Even
though new government securities are being issued,
their terms do not reflect market conditions.
The mode of financing reflects both Ethiopia’s
development strategy and the constraints. The
development strategy is characterized by state
control of financial flows and pricing. Government
securities market is not active. External concessional
borrowing is not enough or not available for key
projects.
Recent developments
The authorities have been cautious in contracting
of external commercial loans, but external
financing need is strong. EEPCO and ETC have
contracted commercial loans and suppliers credits
mostly from China, for which government
guarantees have been provided. ERC recently signed
contracts with Chinese and Turkish companies for
projects whose total size is about 6 percent of
2012/13 GDP. The Ministry of Finance and Economic
Development (MOFED), whose stated objective is to
maintain a low risk of external debt distress, has full
control and monitoring of these loans.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Domestic borrowings by public enterprises are
increasing rapidly. Building of the Renaissance
Dam, which is estimated to cost 10 percent of
2012/13 GDP according to the authorities, is being
given a high priority. EEPCO’s investment plan shows
an increasing reliance on domestic borrowing.
Absent supporting reforms, the government’s
measures to mobilize additional domestic
resources are unlikely to generate sufficient
additional financing relative to the large
financing need. The measures include issuance of
new government securities and branch expansion by
the state-owned bank CBE. Reforms that support
sustainable mobilization of long term savings are
crucial.
Expanding domestic borrowing will give rise to
vulnerabilities. Increasing domestic financing of
public investment projects would create a rapid rise
in domestic debt of major public enterprises, crowd
out private sector activities, and exert a balance of
payments pressure from substantial import needs.
Even though these borrowings may not be
government guaranteed, they could become a
source of contingent liabilities which could have
significant macroeconomic implications.
Way forward
Within the authorities’ development strategy,
adjustments are required for the mode and pace
of financing and improvements in debt
management are needed. Achievement of real
positive interest rates is important for mobilizing
more domestic financing. Sustainable forms of
financing for DBE lending to priority sectors—such
as issuance of bonds/long-term securities —should
be considered. In addition, the expanding the
coverage of debt monitoring and reporting by the
MOFED is important to ensure sustainability of debt.
To this end, developing a medium-term debt
strategy would be helpful.

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

Authorities’ views
43.
While recognizing the challenges of
financing the GTP, the authorities indicated
that several measures are being introduced
to address these challenges. These measures
include issuance of new government securities,
a new private pension scheme, and branch
expansion of by the state-owned bank CBE to

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

mobilize additional domestic resources. They
acknowledged that raising domestic financing
for the Renaissance Dam—a flagship project
for the country estimated to cost 10 percent of
2012/13 GDP—is a challenge but underscored
that this project is a high priority and other
projects could be postponed if needed to
complete the dam project.

OTHER ISSUES
44.
Data provided to the Fund are
broadly adequate for surveillance, albeit
with notable shortcomings and delays. In
addition to the financial sector data gaps
discussed above, fiscal and BOP statistics
require improvements. 9 Official GDP growth
rates imply productivity increases that appear
implausible, suggesting an urgent need to
reconcile the historical differences between
official GDP statistics and the staff estimates
and to ensure accuracy of source data.
Addressing these issues would be important
for proper assessment of the level of economic
activities. Staff welcomes ongoing efforts to
strengthen capacity for improvements in
macroeconomic statistics and encourages the
authorities to complete the implementation of
their national accounts action plan, for which
Fund TA has been provided.

For fiscal statistics, timeliness of the reporting of the
consolidated general government operations,
reconciliation of government operations with the
corresponding monetary account data, and coverage
of the public sector need improvement. The existence
of large errors and omissions in the BOP point out to
data collection challenges which need to be addressed
through better surveys of international transactions.

current international transactions that are
not consistent with Article VIII.10 A
unification of the official and parallel exchange
markets would free up significant efficiency
gains. Staff also reiterated the need to clarify
the terms of the 2006 China EXIM Bank
Framework agreement to ensure its
consistency with Ethiopia’s commitments
under the Articles of Agreement. The
authorities did not provide a clear explanation
on these outstanding exchange restriction
issues. They maintain, however, that the
agreement with China is consistent with the
obligations to the Fund.
46.
Ethiopia has yet to bring its antimoney laundering/combating the financing
of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime into line
with international standards. Since
June 2011, Ethiopia has been listed by the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) among the
jurisdictions with strategic AML/CFT
deficiencies that have not made sufficient
progress in addressing them. If not improved,
heightened due diligence may impede access
to global financial markets. The World Bank
has been discussing a technical assistance
program with the authorities to address

first quarter of 2013.
47.
WTO accession negotiations are
ongoing. Since the submission of the
Memorandum of Foreign Trade Regime in
2006, three rounds of Working Party meetings

took place and the fourth is scheduled for
September 2012. The authorities are aiming to
conclude negotiations by the end of the GTP
period (2014/15), but they recognize
difficulties in committing to the level of
liberalization demanded by the Working Party
member countries, particularly in service
sectors.

STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
Ethiopia’s economic growth
performance has been robust. This has been
achieved through the authorities’public sectorled development strategy that promotes high
public investment supported partly by low
nominal interest rates.
49.
However, macroeconomic
imbalances have resurfaced, with high
inflation, resulting in highly negative real
interest rates and an overvalued real
exchange rate. The authorities’
implementation of the base money nominal
anchor—combined with the phasing out of the
effects of international commodity price
increases and drought—has put inflation on a
declining path, though it remains elevated.
Other risks and vulnerabilities related to the
financing model of the GTP are also emerging
in the system.
50.
The authorities are encouraged to
consider policy adjustment aimed at
addressing the macroeconomic imbalances
and mitigating the vulnerabilities. Staff
recommendations centered on achieving low
inflation thereby eliminating highly negative
real interest rates and exchange rate
overvaluation; higher foreign reserve coverage;
maintaining financial sector stability; increasing
the role of the private sector in economic

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

activities; and managing risks associated with
the current public investment plan.
51.
Appropriately pacing the scaling up
of public investment will be required. This
would help mitigate vulnerabilities arising from
the large and front-loaded public investment
plan and offer opportunities for the private
sector to leverage the large public investment.
52.
The authorities are commended for
the implementation of the base money
nominal anchor and encouraged to take a
more comprehensive approach in
addressing the rising macroeconomic
imbalances. The implementation of the base
money nominal anchor has so far been
instrumental in bringing inflation down, but
only relied on two instruments—no central
bank financing of the budget and FX sales.
Staff urges the authorities to immediately
activate the use of securities (treasury bills) for
liquidity management to facilitate monetary
policy implementation by starting to raise
nominal interest rates, which, combined with
declining inflation, will bring real interest rates
close to zero. Raising interest rates would also
support domestic savings mobilization efforts
that are essential for financing investment to
achieve ambitious objectives in the GTP.

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

53.
The monetary and fiscal policy
stance to bring inflation down needs to be
maintained. In this context, staff is concerned
about the reversal of the no central bank
financing of the budget policy, which could
lead to entrenched inflation expectations. This
may send a negative signal on government’s
commitment to lower inflation. Staff urges the
authorities to reconsider their planned
government borrowing from the NBE in
2012/13.
54.
The authorities are urged to start
building FX reserves. Staff raises concerns
about the sustainability of the FX sales as a key
monetary policy instrument as FX reserves in
months of imports have declined, and advises
the authorities to begin gradually building FX
coverage to about 3 months of imports mainly
through some flexibility in the exchange rate,
which will improve the current account
balance.
55.
The authorities are encouraged to
continue the momentum of revenue
administration reforms and accelerate
reforms in public financial management to
achieve the GTP fiscal objectives. Effective
implementation of the technical assistance
recommendations is a key in this regard. Given
the limited prospects for realizing the GTP
revenue targets which are currently lagging
behind, it would be desirable to define an
expenditure contingency plan to be put in
place.
56.
An assessment such as under the
FSAP is recommended given the fast
evolving economic environment and
financial sector’s closer linkages with the
real sector created by the financing needs
of the GTP. For the stability of the financial
sector, it would be important to understand to
what extent vulnerabilities are building up in

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

the system even in the context of the
authorities’ ongoing implementation of
measures to strengthen the sector.
57.
Easing of restrictions on the private
banks would help promote financial
deepening and facilitate the GTP financing.
Without abandoning the NBE bill directive of
April 2011, staff urges a dialogue with private
commercial banks to identify ways to make the
financing of long term projects—the key
objective of the directive—effective and
sustainable, while preserving the viability of
private banks. Specifically, appropriate pricing
of NBE bills and changing the basis for the
allotment from gross to net disbursements
should be considered.
58.
The authorities are commended for
their achievements in reducing poverty and
are urged to continue and strengthen the
policies for inclusive growth. The poverty
reduction strategies have achieved important
results and the government’s focus on propoor expenditure has been paying off in terms
of improved social indicators. Staff, however,
underscores the necessity for the authorities to
undertake structural reforms aimed at
promoting inclusive growth by providing
incentive for the emergence of a wide range of
activities capable of creating jobs for highskilled and low-skilled workers. This is
instrumental for further progress in achieving
the MDGs.
59.
The authorities are urged to seek the
support of their international partners to
develop a medium term debt management
strategy which comprehensively covers
both domestic and external debt.
Monitoring all operations of the consolidated
public sector, including contingent liabilities,
will be important for effectively managing the
risks associated with rapidly rising domestic
debt of major public enterprises.

60.
Further improvement in data quality
is needed. There are significant financial sector
data gaps and fiscal and BOP statistics require
improvements, consolidated public sector
(including public enterprises) data would be
desirable for a proper assessment of the fiscal
stance. Staff urges the authorities to continue
working with the IMF to reconcile staff’s
estimates with the official GDP growth rates,

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

which currently imply productivity increases
that appear implausible.
61.
Staff recommends that the next
Article IV consultation with Ethiopia be held
on the 12-month consultation cycle. This is
in accordance with the decision on
consultation cycles, Decision No. 14747(10/96) (9/28/2010).

Table 2. Ethiopia: Risk Assessment Matrix
Source of Risks

Relative Likelihood

Impact if Realized

Medium

The impact of such an intensification
would include, falling commodity prices
and higher risk aversion. Specifically, it
would reduce demand for Ethiopian
exports and lower coffee prices, and also
result in shortfalls of aid flows, lower
remittances, and limited financing for
infrastructure investment in the GTP.

Medium

A global economic downturn would lead
to a sharper commodity price decline
with a sharper negative impact on
Ethiopian exports. It would result in
severe shortfalls of aid flows, and a
drastic decline in remittances. The
financing of the GTP would be
jeopardized with significantly lower
growth.

Low

FDIs from China, which have been rising
rapidly across sectors, could decrease,
slowing development of newly emerging
export sectors, like textile and leather
manufacturing. Major infrastructure
investments, particularly in power,
telecom, and roads, may not be fully
financed, delaying the implementation of
the GTP.

Strain on the state-owned
Commercial Banks of Ethiopia
resulting from increased domestic
financing of GTP

Medium

Given the systemic importance of CBE
(70 percent of total banking sector
assets), it would slow down the entire
Ethiopian economy, resulting in
significant deceleration of medium-term
growth and a buildup of further
vulnerabilities on both domestic and
external fronts.

Lack of sufficient financing for GTP

Medium

Lower growth.

Medium

Commodity price fluctuations affect both
export price (coffee) and import price
(fuel and wheat) in Ethiopia. It is likely
that the negative impact from import
price increase outweighs the benefit
from export price increases.

Strong intensification of the euro
area crisis

A global economic slowdown

Sharp slowdown in China

International commodity price

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Annex I: Exchange Rate Assessment
The exchange rate assessment based on the
IMF’s CGER methodology suggests that
Ethiopia’s real effective exchange rate (REER) is
overvalued in the range of 11−23 percent in
mid-2012 (Figure I.1). The CGER involves three
standard approaches: (i) the macroeconomic
balance approach, (ii) the equilibrium REER
approach, and (iii) the external sustainability
approach. The estimates indicate increased
overvaluation compared to the assessment of
8−11 percent in the 2011 Article IV
consultation.
The macroeconomic balance approach
indicates the REER depreciation of 11 percent
is required to close the gap between the
underlying current account projection and an
estimated equilibrium current account balance.
The current account balance is projected to be
6.1 percent of GDP in 2011/12, while its
medium-term forecast is 6.0 percent of GDP.
By removing temporary factors, an underlying
current account deficit is estimated at
6.1 percent of GDP1. It is compared to the
estimated equilibrium current account balance
norm, obtained from a panel regression. The
current account deficit norm for Ethiopia is
estimated at 5.1 percent of GDP, mainly
reflecting continued aid inflows and net import
of oil to support growth. With the estimated
elasticity of the current account with respect to
the REER of -0.1,2 an exchange rate
depreciation of 11 percent is necessary to
close the gap.

1

The underlying current account deficit is obtained as
the average of the estimate of 2011/12 current
account balance, the current account balance forecast
for 2016/17, and the Hodrick-Prescott filtered series.
2

The elasticity is calculated using Ethiopia’s export and
import share in GDP and the volume elasticities
suggested in Isard and others (2001).

The equilibrium real exchange rate approach
shows the overvaluation of 11 percent from an
equilibrium REER estimated with medium-term
fundamentals. The model suggests a stable
path of the equilibrium REER reflecting minor
deteriorations in terms of trade and slightly
improved government consumption. However,
the actual REER deviates from the equilibrium
level and is overvalued by 11 percent in 2012.
The external sustainability approach suggests a
higher level of overvaluation estimated at
23 percent. The approach calculates the
current account balance that would stabilize
the net foreign asset (NFA) position at an
appropriate level. With projected nominal
growth of 14.7 percent in Ethiopia, the
underlying current account deficit of
6.1 percent would result in a long-run NFA
position equal to -48 percent of GDP. To
sustain the NFA position at the average of the
past five years (-31.3 percent of GDP), the
current account deficit should be 4 percent of
GDP. To close the gap from the underlying
current account deficit, the REER needs to
depreciate by 23 percent.
Business climate indicators also highlight
structural weakness that could undermine
competitiveness. In the World Bank’s Doing
Business Survey, Ethiopia stands at 111 out of
183 countries in 2012, moved down from
97 out of 179 countries in 2007. Compared to
the SSA average, Ethiopia shows strength in
the ease of paying taxes and enforcing
contracts. On the other hand, weakness is
found in a number of areas including
registering property, getting credit, protecting
investors, trading across borders. In some
areas, especially on the access to credit and
the trading costs, Ethiopia’s rank dropped
significantly in the last five years. Structural
improvements in these areas can help reduce
the cost of doing business and strengthen
Ethiopia’s external competitiveness.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Annex II. Reserve Adequacy Assessment
Ethiopia had been accumulating foreign
exchange reserves since 2008 when the
country faced world commodity price surges
and the global recession and with Fund
support1, but the trend reversed in 2011 as a
result of foreign exchange reserve sales to
control domestic liquidity. Foreign exchange
reserves decreased from a peak at about
US$3.5 billion in September 2011 to about
US$2.3 billion (1.8 months of prospective
imports) in April 2012. The current level is well
below the commonly-used rule of thumb of
3 months of import cover, potentially putting
external stability at risk. This annex analyzes
the optimal level of foreign exchange reserves
for Ethiopia by applying standard metrics and
a new analytical method that takes into
account possible adverse external shocks.
The Ethiopian economy is exposed to various
exogenous shocks, such as volatilities in the
terms of trade, export demand, and aid
inflows, suggesting a need for an adequate
level of foreign exchange reserve to smooth
adjustment. Ethiopia’s major exports are
agricultural goods and commodities (notably,
coffee and gold) whose international prices
fluctuate greatly and whose outputs are
affected by periodic significant droughts. Risks
of fuel price increases or global downturns can
also adversely affect the trade balance, given
Ethiopia’s dependence on petroleum imports
(5 percent of GDP). In addition, although
capital account transactions are limited in
Ethiopia, aid inflows have been large (about 5–
7 percent of GDP) and volatile.

Traditional measures of reserve adequacy
provide mixed evaluations for Ethiopia. The
most commonly used rule of thumb is reserves
equivalent to 3 months of prospective imports
of goods and services. It represents the
number of months a country can support if all
external inflows were to cease. In Ethiopia,
reserve coverage has stayed below the
threshold since mid-2005. Another often used
metric is a ratio of foreign exchange reserve to
broad money, which captures the potential for
capital flight and is an appropriate measure for
countries with a pegged exchange rate.
Wijnholds and Kapteyn (2001) argue that the
minimum for countries with a managed float
regime could be 10–20 percent of broad
money.2 In Ethiopia, the ratio was 23 percent in
April 2012, which is above a suggested
threshold. However, the relevance of the latter
measure is limited because Ethiopia has a
closed capital account and the possibility of
capital flight is limited.
Dabla-Norris and Others (2011)3 proposed a
new methodology to assess the optimal
precautionary reserve holdings for low income
countries considering country characteristics
and fundamentals. The methodology
calculates a crisis mitigating benefit of reserve
holdings by calculating the likelihood and the
cost of a crisis for given policy fundamentals,
exchange rate regime, and assumed external

shocks. A crisis is defined as a sharp drop in
absorption per capita. The benefit is compared
to the cost of holding reserves, which is
typically measured by a difference between
domestic and foreign real interest rates.
This methodology suggests the optimal
amount of foreign exchange reserves for
Ethiopia is equivalent to 7.1 months of imports
(US$9.5 billion). The benefit maximizing
amount of reserve is calculated with the
following assumptions. Policy fundamentals,
i.e., government fiscal balance and CPIA, are
set at the average of 2005/16–2010/11. The
shock variables include global growth, terms of
trade growth, the FDI to GDP ratio, and the aid
to GDP ratio. Their bottom 10 percentiles
during 2005/06–2010/11 are used. In the
absence of market determined interest rates,
the results are evaluated with setting the cost
of holding foreign exchange reserves at
5 percent that is a middle point of the range of
the marginal product of capital in low income
countries in the literature.4 5 With these
assumptions, the implied optimal reserves are
equivalent to 7.1 months of imports for
Ethiopia where de facto exchange rate regime
is crawling peg. If Ethiopia refrained from
interventions and would allow the exchange

4

Domestic real interest rates are highly negative in
Ethiopia, implying a low cost of holding reserves. On
the other hand, a return on public investment –
another measure of opportunity costs of holding
reserves – can be high. The results are evaluated at
4 percent drawing on Caselli and Freyer (2007) that
suggest a 3–8 range for the marginal product of
capital in low income countries after correcting for
reproducible capital and relative price of capital goods.
See Caselli and Freyer, 2007, “The Marginal Product of
Capital,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, 122,
pp. 535–568.

The authorities recognize that the returns on public
investments in Ethiopia are high.

rate to float, the optimal reserves would be
lowered to 2.7 months of imports.
The overall results suggest Ethiopia should
accumulate a larger amount of foreign
exchange reserves to mitigate the potential
adverse impact from external shocks. If
Ethiopia maintains the crawling peg without
devaluation, despite a significantly overvalued
real effective exchange rate (see Annex I), the
reserves would serve an important role in
preventing an external payment crisis. Given
the trade volume growth has been on rise in
recent years, it could be difficult to keep up
with the optimal amount to maintain the
exchange rate regime.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By

Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf
and Elliott Harris (IMF)
and Jeffrey D. Lewis
(IDA)

Prepared by the International Monetary Fund and the
International Development Association

Based on the Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Analysis (LIC DSA) framework,
Ethiopia’s risk of external debt distress remains low. The public DSA suggests Ethiopia’s
overall public sector debt dynamics are sustainable under the baseline scenario but
vulnerable under several alternative scenarios. Public sector debt ratios are projected to
rise in the medium term, suggesting that close monitoring of borrowing by public
enterprises remains a necessity. Maintaining the growth of exports through diversification
of the export sector, developing a medium-term debt strategy for the public sector, and
limiting non-concessional borrowing remain keys to maintaining a low risk of external
debt distress.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

BACKGROUND AND KEY FINDINGS
1.
The last Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA), prepared in August 2011, concluded
that Ethiopia was at a low risk of external debt
distress. Ethiopia reached the completion point
under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC)
Initiative in 2004 and benefited from debt relief
under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)
in 2006. In recent years, public and publicly
guaranteed (PPG) external debt rose rapidly and
reached 23 percent of GDP at end-2010/11.1,2 The
share of commercial loans in total PPG external
debt at end-2010/11 was 28 percent.3 Domestic
public debt consists of short-term treasury bills
and public enterprises bonds, both carrying low
interest rates. There is no foreign exchange
denominated domestic debt.
2.
Ethiopia remains at low risk of external
debt distress in 2012. The present value (PV) of
PPG external debt declined from 15.3 percent of
GDP as projected in the 2011 DSA to 13.6 percent
of GDP, reflecting higher-than-projected inflation
and smaller than-projected currency depreciation.
The ratio of PV of PPG external debt to exports
1

The Ethiopian fiscal year runs from July 8 to July 7.

2

While Ethiopia has received debt relief from most of
its creditors, it has not been able to reach agreement
with bilateral official creditors from Bulgaria, Libya, and
FR Yugoslavia and commercial creditors from Italy,
former Czechoslovakia, and FR Yugoslavia whose
outstanding loans (US$378.8 million) accounted for
7.0 percent of the debt stock in 2009/10. HIPC terms
are assumed for these loans. Negotiations with Russia
on outstanding loans (US$161.6 million) are at an
advanced stage, and debt service on these loans is
excluded from this DSA.
3

Ethiopian Airlines (EAL) debt is excluded from PPG
debt, because, although owned by the government, it
is run on commercial terms. EAL enjoys managerial
independence, borrows without any government
guarantees, publishes annual audited reports and has
a sizeable profit margin.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

remains broadly the same at around 97 percent.
The inclusion of workers’ remittances significantly
lowers the baseline average of the debt-toexports ratios in the projection period
(2011/12−2031/32) by 20 percentage points.4
There is no breach of any indicative threshold in
either case, excluding or including workers’
remittances.5 Consequently, the current DSA
follows the practice prescribed in the LIC DSA
framework and focuses on the baseline without
remittances in the following analysis.
3.
The current DSA assumes lower
concessional loan disbursements, particularly
from International Development Association
(IDA), and higher nonconcessional external
loan disbursements between 2013/14 and
2019/20. A decrease in projected concessional
loan disbursements by multilateral creditors has
contributed to improvements in the external debt
sustainability indicators although it implies a lower
4

Based on the 2011 Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) score, Ethiopia is classified as a
medium performer. The thresholds for the debt
burden for medium performers are 150, 40 and 250 for
the PV of debt to exports, GDP, and revenue,
respectively; debt service thresholds are 20 and
30 percent of exports and revenue, respectively. In the
scenarios that include workers’ remittances, the
thresholds were revised recently, and the
corresponding threshold for PV of debt to exports and
remittances is 120 percent (compared to 135 in the
2011 DSA) and is 16 percent for debt service to
exports and remittances (compared to 18 percent in
the 2011 DSA); the PV of debt to GDP and remittances
is 36 percent.
5

Consistent with the approach described in the 2009
debt sustainability framework review, workers’
remittances are accounted for because they have
proven to be a reliable source of foreign exchange for
Ethiopia, even through the crisis. They materially lower
the debt and debt service ratios and their profiles, and
threshold breaches associated with their exclusion are
not protracted.

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

grant element on new borrowing throughout the
projection periods (Text Table 1). Disbursements
of some nonconcessional loans were delayed,
resulting in a decline in 2011/12 and 2012/13. This
DSA (2012) assumes disbursements of about
US$523 million in nonconcessional loans a year in
the next three years and US$643 million on
average over the projection period (2012−32)
with a peak of US$968 million in 2015/16.6 Over
the time horizon of the DSA, 53 percent of new
external loans are assumed to be concessional on
average. Average maturity on all new external
loans is assumed to be 28 years while new
nonconcessional loans are assumed to carry a
maturity of 12−13 years. Average interest rates on
new external loans are assumed at 3.2 percent
over the horizon, and interest rates on new
nonconcessional loans are assumed to be in the
6−7 percent range.

4.
Some of the large public investment
projects by state-owned enterprises could
pose risks to Ethiopia’s debt risk rating and
overall public debt sustainability. The stateowned power company, the Ethiopia Electricity
Power Company, is undertaking several large
investment projects. Most rely on external
assistance and loans (including both concessional
and nonconcessional) while the Renaissance Dam
project, estimated by the authorities to cost
10 percent of 2012/13 GDP, is intended to be
entirely financed domestically. The Ethiopian
Railway Corporation recently signed contracts
with Chinese and Turkish companies for projects
whose total size is more than US$3 billion, or
6 percent of 2012/13 GDP. It would be prudent
for the authorities to formulate a medium-term
debt management strategy and to start
monitoring the overall debt (including external
and domestic) of the consolidated public sector.

6

Ethiopia is subject to the IDA Non-Concessional
Borrowing Policy (NCBP). In 2011 and 2012, the
authorities have requested a ceiling on
nonconcessional borrowing of US$1 billion a year
under IDA’s nonconcessional borrowing policy
framework (see IDA’s Nonconcessional Borrowing
Policy: A Progress Update, April 2010). In the absence
of an IMF program, IDA could establish an NCB limit if
consistent with the maintenance of low debt
vulnerabilities and if the planned investments are
critical and growth-enhancing. A request to establish
such a limit has to be made by the authorities; the
World Bank Board would then be informed of the
decision per the NCBP. This DSA suggests a
nonconcessional borrowing limit of US$1 billion a year
for 2012/13−2015/16 to maintain a low risk rating.

MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
5.
The medium-term macroeconomic
outlook remains broadly in line with the
assumptions of the 2011 DSA (Box 1). Real
GDP growth in 2012/13 is revised upward from
6 percent in the 2011 DSA to 6.5 percent,
reflecting stronger activities mainly led by public
infrastructure investment, but the projected long-

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

run GDP growth rate is maintained at 6.5 percent.
Inflation was higher than projected in 2011/12,
but is projected to reach the same long-run rate
as in the 2011 DSA on account of the
governments’ commitment to inflation reduction.
Nominal GDP in US dollars is higher because of
the inflationary effect of the initial periods.

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

6.
Robust export growth is projected to
continue, a key assumption for maintaining a
low risk rating. Despite further real exchange
appreciation since the 2011 DSA, export growth
has been strong, partly reflecting developments in
commodity prices. In the medium-to long-run,
export growth would be supported by

diversification of the export sector as emerging
export industries expand, funded by foreign direct
investment, and service exports including
electricity grow albeit at a slower pace than
projected in the 2011 DSA. Overall, exports of
goods and services are projected to remain
broadly the same as in the 2011 DSA.

Box 1. Ethiopia: Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario
Real GDP growth is projected to slow to
6.5 percent in 2012/13 and to remain at that rate
during the projection period. This assessment
contrasts with the government’s growth ambitions
in the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) and
reflects the poor business environment giving
limited space for private sector growth on account
of crowding out by public sector borrowing.
Inflation is projected to fall to 9 percent by the end
of 2012/13 and to stay at that level in the long run.
The primary balance of the public sector is
projected to record a large deficit initially
(averaging 3.8 percent of GDP in 2012−17)
reflecting investment by public enterprises, but it is
expected to converge to a modest level in the long
run (averaging 0.8 percent in 2018−32).
The external current account deficit (before official
transfers) is expected to deteriorate from
5.2 percent of GDP in 2010/11 to 10.1 percent of
GDP in 2011/12 and 11.5 percent of GDP in
2012/13, but improve to 8.5 percent of GDP in the
long run.

Exports of goods are projected to grow by
11.3 percent in 2012/13, slowing from 37.1 percent
in 2010/11 and 16.9 percent in 2011/12. Higher
commodity prices, especially in gold and coffee,
largely accounted for recent rapid export growth.
Large foreign investments in the targeted sectors
that receive government support are expected to
contribute to export growth, and export volume
growth is projected at around 10 percent over the
DSA horizon. Exports of services are projected to
grow at a slower pace than in the 2011 DSA on
account of delays in electricity generation projects.
Imports of goods and services are projected to
increase in the near term (15 percent for goods
imports and 10 percent for service imports in
2012/13) on account of substantial import needs for
public infrastructure projects.
Workers’ remittances have increased strongly in
recent years and reached almost 8 percent of GDP in
2010/11. Although remittances in 2011/12 and
2012/13 are projected to remain at the same level in
absolute terms, they are expected to start growing
as the global economy recovers.
Foreign direct investment (FDI) is projected to
increase gradually to a long run yearly average of
4.5 percent of GDP from 3.1 percent in 2011/12 on
account of policies to promote large scale FDIs.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline Without Remittances
7.
Under the baseline scenario, the PPG
external debt indicators will rise in the next
several years, but will remain well under the
relevant indicative thresholds. The PV of PPG
external debt in percent of GDP declined in
2011/12 by 2 percentage points to 13.6 percent
because of high inflation and overvalued currency;
but it is projected to start rising in 2012/13 to a
peak of 17.5 percent of GDP in 2016/17, reflecting
the assumed steady increase in new loan

disbursements. The PV of debt in percent of
exports increased in 2011/12, and despite
continued strength in exports, it is projected to
continue increasing, peaking at 106.8 percent in
2016/17. The debt service-to-exports ratio also
remains well below the relevant threshold
although it keeps rising to a peak of 8.6 percent in
2018/19, reflecting servicing of non-concessional
loans by public enterprises.

B. Sensitivity Tests Without Remittances
8.
Under the historical scenario, the debt
stock indicators would be lower than under
the baseline scenario in the short term but rise
above those of the baseline scenario over time.
The scenario reflects significantly higher nominal
GDP and export growth (than in the baseline)
which works to drive the debt ratios down. It also
reflects larger net debt creating flows (than in the
baseline) which work to drive the debt ratios up.
The dynamic path under the historical scenario is
determined by these two offsetting forces. As a
result, the PV of debt to GDP would fall by
2.4 percentage points in three years, but would
begin to rise afterward, reaching a peak of
12.1 percent. Similarly, the PV of exports would
fall by 24.7 percentage points in five years, but
then rise to reach the peak of 72.9 percent.

9.
Without remittances, no stress test
breaches the indicative threshold for the PV of
PPG external debt to exports over the forecast
horizon. The 2011 DSA results highlighted that
Ethiopia’s debt sustainability was most sensitive to
the terms of new public sector borrowing and
export value growth, and two stress tests
breached the threshold. The 2012 DSA did not
find such vulnerability: even in the most extreme
case in which new public sector external loans are
secured on less favorable terms (i.e., a 200 basis
point increase in the interest rate), the PV of debt
to export ratio would peak at 142.6 percent in
2020 relative to the threshold of 150 percent. The
scenario in which export growth is slower than the
historical average by one standard deviation
produces the debt to exports ratio of 119 percent
in 2017 (an increase from 94.9 percent in 2012).

C. A Scenario with Higher Commercial Loan Disbursements
10.
An alternative scenario including
additional commercial loan disbursements
indicates that an annual nonconsessional
borrowing limit of US$1 billion in
2012/13−2015/16 would be consistent with
maintaining a low external debt risk rating. In

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

light of several large public investment projects
under considerations, the authorities asked for a
simulation of the implications of increased
commercial loan disbursements in addition to
those assumed in the baseline. The result
indicates that there would be a breach of the

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

threshold for PV of external debt-to-exports
without remittances under the most extreme
shocks but there is no breach when remittances
are included. The low external debt risk rating
would be maintained in this scenario. However,
given the result of the sensitivity analysis which
indicates that a breach could occur if new public
sector loans were in less favorable terms, the

staffs are of the view that maintaining the
concessionality of external loans is important and
the authorities should remain vigilant regarding
new debt accumulation, particularly with
commercial loans. This view is also consistent with
IDA’s Non-Concessional Borrowing Policy.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
11.
Under the baseline scenario, the total
public sector debt-to-GDP ratio would rise
sharply in the near term. This reflects large
domestic borrowing and continued accumulation
of external PPG debt by public enterprises to
implement infrastructure investment projects. It is
expected that after an initial period of high
spending, total public sector expenditure would
revert to a lower level in the long run.
12.
Debt stock related indicators peak in
2014 and debt service related indicators peak
in 2017. All debt indicators decline gradually from
the peak; this result depends on continuation of
robust GDP growth, moderate public sector
primary deficits, and most crucially the authorities’
policy of keeping domestic interest rates low, at
negative levels in real terms because inflation is
assumed to stay at 9 percent in the long run.
Compared to the 2011 DSA, the peak is to be
reached earlier; at the peak, the debt-to-GDP ratio
is lower, but the debt-to-revenue and grants ratio
and the debt service-to-revenue and grants ratio
are higher mainly because lower levels are
projected from grants.
13.
Under any alternative scenario, public
sector debt would become unsustainable. The
scenario with unchanged primary balance from
2012 shows particularly sharp deterioration
because of a large primary deficit in 2012
reflecting investment activities by public

enterprises. This suggests that the current level of
public investment is not sustainable in the longrun. The other two alternative scenarios (real GDP
growth and primary balance at the historic
average; permanently lower GDP growth) show
milder but unsustainable debt trajectories.
14.
The baseline scenario understates the
public debt burden for the economy because it
reflects actual costs of borrowing by the public
sector, which are significantly lower than
inflation. Although inflation is projected to
decline to a single-digit level, given the current
policy of financing public investment at low costs,
interest rates on public enterprise domestic
borrowing would not be fully adjusted to a
positive level in real terms.7 If the actual cost of
borrowing were to rise above inflation, the debt
indicators would worsen or fiscal adjustment
could be required to maintain fiscal sustainability.

7

The authorities claim that, once inflation stabilizes at
single digits, interest rates would be adjusted to the
same level as the inflation rate.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

CONCLUSION
15.
The level of Ethiopia’s external debt
distress remains at a low risk rating. The
external debt ratios have risen rapidly in recent
years, and this trend is projected to continue in
the medium-term with the exception of 2012. The
results suggest the importance for Ethiopia of
monitoring debt closely and remaining vigilant
regarding new debt accumulation, particularly
with commercial loans. The financing plan
underlying the GTP needs to be reviewed taking
into account these results. Vulnerabilities
identified in various sensitivity analyses are
relevant for considering policies that would help
maintain the low risk rating of external debt
distress. Particularly important is maintaining the
concessionality of external loans.
16.
Monitoring the overall debt of the
consolidated public sector is needed to avoid a
building up of vulnerabilities. Since domestic

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

borrowing by the public sector is rapidly
increasing, it is becoming more important to
monitor the overall debt (including external and
domestic) of the consolidated public sector. To
that end, diagnosis through Debt Management
and Performance Assessment and capacity
building through Medium-Term Debt Strategy
technical assistance could be recommended. Also,
the macroeconomic assumptions underlying the
baseline scenario are subject to risks, including
both exogenous shocks and policy-induced
deterioration of the business environment,
leading to vulnerabilities as highlighted in the
alternative scenarios. Adjustments to policies to
ensure price stability, remove exchange rate
overvaluation, and address structural
impediments to private sector investment and
trading activities would go a long way in
enhancing Ethiopia’s debt sustainability.

3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections, also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equal to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguards Assessment
An update safeguards assessment of the
National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) was
completed in December 2009 in connection
with Ethiopia’s ESF-RAC approved on
January 23, 2009. The assessment found that,
since the previous assessment in 2001, the NBE
has implemented some improvements to the
safeguards framework but that several
initiatives were a work-in-progress and
substantial gaps remained. Financial
transparency has improved through the
publication of independently audited financial
statements, and internal audit capacity has
been strengthened. In response to the

assessment’s recommendations, action has
been taken to commence Audit Committee
(AC) oversight, and introduce controls and
independent reviews over program data
reporting to the Fund. The authorities are also
in the process of addressing remaining
safeguards issues relating to enhancing AC
oversight of the external audit mechanism,
further strengthening of reserve management
capacity, and introducing bank-wide risk
management practices. Going forward, the
NBE Law will need to be strengthened with
regard to independence of the central bank
and the potential scope for unlimited financing
of the government.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The de facto exchange rate regime is classified
as a crawl-like arrangement, in light of the
recent market developments. The authorities
describe their exchange rate regime as a
managed float with no predetermined path for
the exchange rate. The pace of the
depreciation, however, has been stable. The
NBE supplies foreign exchange to the market
based on plans established at the beginning of
each fiscal year that takes into account
estimates of likely supply and demand. The
transaction-weighted average interbank
market exchange rate on July 10, 2012, was
Br 17.7801 = US$1.
Ethiopia currently maintains four restrictions
on the payments and transfers for current
international transactions, which relate to:
(i) the tax certification requirement for
repatriation of dividend and other investment
income; (ii) restrictions on repayment of legal
external loans and supplies and foreign
partner credits;

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

(iii) rules for issuance of import permits by
commercial banks; and (iv) the requirement to
provide a clearance certificate from NBE to
obtain import permits. These restrictions are
inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2(a), of
the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and remain
unapproved.
The staff is continuing to assess whether a
general finance and economic cooperation
agreement signed between the government of
Ethiopia and China in 2006 gives rise to
exchange restrictions under Article VIII.

Article IV Consultation
Ethiopia is on the standard 12-month
consultation cycle, in accordance with the
Decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles
(Decision No. 14747-(10/96), 9/28/2010). The
last consultation was concluded on
August 26, 2011.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, albeit with
shortcomings. Despite recent progress, there are some shortcomings in financial, real, fiscal, and
balance of payments statistics.
National Accounts: Shortcomings in the source data and compilation practices affect the
accuracy and reliability of the statistics. The GDP estimates are heavily dependent on benchmark
data that are outdated and therefore, may not reflect current economic activity. Further, the
techniques used to compile the estimates for construction, distribution, and some other services
activities do not conform to international best practice. While some progress has been made in
compiling estimates of GDP by final expenditure, there remain substantial shortcomings,
particularly in the estimation of private consumption and fixed capital formation. The statistical
discrepancies between the estimates by expenditure categories and output remain large.
Government finance statistics: Despite recent improvements, general government fiscal
statistics continue to be affected by shortcomings. Timely data on the consolidated operations of
local governments is unavailable. Significant discrepancies between data on the domestic
financing of the budget deficit and the monetary accounts continue to complicate assessment of
fiscal developments.
Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics are broadly adequate for analytical purposes, although
there is a need for the NBE to resume data submissions based on the SRF and IMD framework.
For policy purposes, however, ensuring data collection and reporting in a timely manner
continues to be critical.
Financial statistics: The staff does not have access to sufficient data to assess the soundness of
the banking sector.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments data require improvements in coverage, valuation,
timing, and classification of transactions. Long delays in the collection of trade and tourist arrival
data and poor data on capital flows, especially FDI data, need to be addressed. Large errors and
omission recorded in recent years need to be reconciled.

II.

Data Standards and Quality

Ethiopia participates in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) and metadata
were partially updated in early 2008. Ethiopia
participates in the GDDS project for capacity
building in statistics in Anglophone Africa
(2006–09) including macro-economic and
financial statistics and socio-demographic
statistics.

No Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes has been completed.

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation
with Ethiopia
On September 12, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Ethiopia.1
Background
Ethiopia’s macroeconomic performance in 2011/12 has been mixed. Strong, broad-based
growth continues at a pace of about 7 percent and poverty reduction measured by poverty
head count declined from 38.7 to 29.6 percent during the six years to 2010/11. However,
inflation surged to 40 percent in August 2011, largely reflecting a combination of factors
including loose monetary policy, and high global food prices but has eased to about
21 percent in June 2012 supported by a slowdown in global food and fuel price inflation and
the implementation of the base money nominal anchor. Despite the continued robust
increases in goods exports and remittances, the current account deteriorated in the first half
of 2011/12 contrasting the surplus recorded in 2010/11 attributed to a frontloading of import
of capital goods the previous year. The developments in 2011/12 largely reflect a recovery
of imports of capital goods, an increase in consumer goods imports, and a weakening of the
services balance due to a surge in service imports.
The federal government budget execution in 2011/12 has been tight based on a strong tax
revenue increase when compared to the previous fiscal year, and a slower-than-budgeted
execution of recurrent expenditure. However, the public sector (including state-owned
enterprises) as a whole has been providing strong fiscal impulse given the state-owned
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

enterprise substantial capital expenditures financed by borrowing from external sources and
the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE). A rise in regional government deposits at CBE
contributed to the funding. The 2012/13 budget focuses on sustaining growth, lowering
inflation further, mobilizing revenue, and spending on pro-poor projects. The revenue target
is within reach with the continuation of administrative efforts. Total expenditure is projected
to grow slower than nominal GDP, but poverty-related spending as a share of GDP will be
maintained.
Monetary policy in 2011/12 has largely been geared toward lowering inflation with the
implementation of the base money nominal anchor. Base money at
end-May 2012 declined by 0.9 percent year-on-year as the central bank has ceased
providing new direct credit to the government since July 2011 and has been selling foreign
reserves in recent months to achieve a base money contraction target of 4 percent for the
fiscal year. However, the lowering of the reserve requirement ratio in early January from
15 percent to 10 percent weakens the tightening effect of the base money contraction.
Broad money at end-May 2012 grew by 29 percent year-on-year on account of strong credit
growth to public enterprises. Despite the planned National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) financing
of the 2012/13 budget, which could affect inflation expectations, the 2012/13 monetary
targets focus on lowering inflation.
The NBE directive that requires commercial banks (excluding CBE) to hold bills issued by
NBE is impeding financial intermediation. By creating a significant maturity mismatch in the
private banks balance sheets, it has a considerable negative impact on their capacity to
play their conventional intermediation role. Financial sector soundness indicators do not
point to immediate concerns. However, recent developments such as the increasingly
dominant market share of CBE and its growing exposure to large public enterprises, and the
adverse impact of NBE directive on private banks suggest a need for a closer scrutiny of the
banking system.
Absent increased role of the private sector to leverage the large public infrastructure
investment and efforts to improve the doing business conditions, IMF staff project that real
GDP growth will slow down to 6.5 percent in 2012/13 and over the medium term. However,
the authorities project the economy to grow at double digit rates.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Ethiopia’s strong economic growth and continued progress in
poverty reduction. However, Directors noted that the authorities’ public sector-led
development strategy is contributing to macroeconomic imbalances. To sustain robust
growth and address the emerging risks, policies for the period ahead should focus on
promoting disinflation, achieving an appropriate pace of public investment, reconstituting
official reserves, and promoting greater financial sector stability.

3
Directors welcomed the authorities’ goal of reducing inflation. In this context, they urged the
central bank to pursue a tighter monetary stance and avoid further deficit financing.
Directors also underscored the importance of broadening the toolkit of monetary policy
instruments, including by revamping the market for government securities, which could
foster private saving and investment. Greater exchange rate flexibility would safeguard
foreign exchange reserves, strengthen external competitiveness, and mitigate external
vulnerabilities.
Directors encouraged the authorities to persevere with their fiscal reforms. In particular, they
saw scope for further improvements in tax administration and revenue mobilization.
Additional public financial management reforms and development of a medium-term debt
management strategy encompassing both domestic and external debt would help achieve
the fiscal objectives under the Growth and Transformation Plan and maintain fiscal
sustainability. Any non-concessional borrowing should be consistent with maintaining a low
risk of debt distress.
Directors stressed that effective financial sector supervision and regulation remain crucial
for macroeconomic stability. In this regard they advised the authorities to consider
participation in the Financial Sector Assessment Program which would help identify
vulnerabilities in the financial system and suggest corrective actions as appropriate.
Directors encouraged the authorities to address the remaining deficiencies in Ethiopia’s
AML/CFT regime.
Directors agreed that deeper structural reforms are essential for promoting growth.
Accordingly, they underscored the importance of creating a more favorable business
environment and enhancing the role of private sector in the economy. Directors also called
for further efforts to improve data quality and supported Fund technical assistance in this
area.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on
The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia
September 12, 2012
This statement provides an update on developments since the staff report was finalized. It
does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Prime Minister Meles passed away on August 20 following a two-month illness. He
was the dominant political figure since overthrowing the military dictatorship in 1991. His
successors are most likely to continue the public sector-led development strategy, but absent
strong leadership from the top, the progress toward addressing emerging vulnerabilities,
associated with the ambitious public investment program, could stall.
2.
Official foreign exchange reserves declined further to 1.6 months of imports by endMay 2012, and there are reports of foreign exchange shortages that have recently intensified.
Further external pressures from heightened political uncertainty may push donors to provide
financial support because of Ethiopia’s geo-political importance. Given that Ethiopia imports
some food, rising international food prices would further exert pressure on the foreign
exchange reserves.
3.
The latest data are in line with the staff’s projections. CPI inflation (year-on-year) in
August 2012 at 20.2 percent was almost unchanged from the previous month, indicating that
reducing inflation to single-digit levels would take some time. Federal government budget
execution in May and June 2012 showed continued strong growth in revenue and restraint in
expenditure, resulting in a provisional overall federal government deficit (excluding grants)
at 2.7 percent of GDP, compared to 3.6 percent in the budget. Base money at end-May 2012
showed a small contraction of -0.9 percent with no new central bank credit to government.

Statement by Mr. Majoro, Executive Director
for The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia
September 12, 2012

The Ethiopian authorities appreciate staff’s candid discussions during the recent 2012
Article IV consultation. They value the timely exchange of views with the mission team
on key policy issues and options to achieve the objectives outlined in the Growth and
Transformation Plan, while addressing the current imbalances. While they find the staff
assessment of the country’s economic policies, challenges and prospects informative,
they do not share some of the analysis and conclusions reached by staff as articulated
under the “authorities’ views” and detailed below.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
The authorities’ pro-growth policies have been highly successful in recent years in
enabling the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to make significant strides in
reducing poverty, and thus have kept the achievement of many of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) within reach. Despite the slowdown in the global economy,
real GDP growth has been robust and broad-based, estimated at 11.1 percent for
FY 2011/121. This growth was supported by a 7.4 percent growth in agriculture output as
a result of both more land coming under cultivation and from better yields compared to
the previous fiscal year. Non-agricultural sectors have also exhibited a stronger growth
estimated at 17.9 percent for industry and 11.5 percent for services. Furthermore, the
currently above-normal rainfall in most food-growing regions is also expected to sustain
the harvest for the current fiscal year. Continued heavy infrastructure investments, a
strong pipeline of FDI inflows, and generally buoyant service sector activities are also
expected to propel activity levels in their respective domains and contribute to stronger
growth going forward.
Notwithstanding these achievements, inflation which has fallen sharply from 41 percent
in August 2011 to 20.2 percent in August 2012 remains an immediate challenge. The
tight monetary policy and food price moderation explains the bulk of the decline in
inflation, as prices stabilized across a range of non-staple foods. The authorities’ decision
to import and distribute flour products and edible oils has also contributed to the decline
in inflation. Nevertheless, the Ethiopian authorities remain committed to pursuing
prudent macroeconomic policies to bring inflation to single digits.

1

The authorities do not share the staff’s GDP estimates and outlook and are working with the East
AFRITAC national accounts expert to reconcile the differences in growth figures.

2
The Federal Budget for FY 2012/13 has recently been passed with planned expenditure
of Birr 138 billion (15.2 percent of GDP) and projected revenues and grants of
Birr 111 billion (10.5 percent of GDP). The resulting Birr 27 billion deficit (2.9 percent
of GDP) is expected to be financed in roughly equal parts by foreign and domestic bank
borrowing. The authorities expect that most of the public investment projects can be
covered by the public enterprises’ own funds, bond issues, and borrowing from domestic
as well as foreign banks. However, in the event that these sources turn out to be
inadequate, my authorities will scale down or delay the projects so that their financing
would not become inflationary.
Current Challenges
Notwithstanding these positive developments, the Ethiopian economy is confronted with
the challenges of containing inflationary pressures; and low international reserves, which
considerably limit the authorities’ policy options. My authorities recognize that the
current double-digit inflation poses a threat to the hard-won macroeconomic
performance. Though inflation is expected to continue subsiding in response to their
earlier tightening of monetary policy, the authorities are determined to take additional
measures to counter excess demand pressures that are contributing to high inflation
including further adjustments to fiscal and monetary policies, if needed. My authorities
are also aware that measures to scale down import growth in order to stay within the
confines of the available foreign reserves remain a priority. It is against this background
that the authorities intend to revisit their planned public spending and limit overall public
borrowing, in order to limit import demand.
Fiscal Policy
The thrust of government spending remains in conformity with the overall
macroeconomic framework, namely maintaining the level of spending on the key MDG
clusters and infrastructure. To protect spending in priority areas, my authorities will
continue to strengthen domestic and concessional resource mobilization in the medium
term. They are committed to improving domestic revenue mobilization, including
through administrative improvements and, to this end, will continue to seek the
International Monetary Fund Technical Assistance. Mindful of the overall resource
limitations, they intend to facilitate greater participation of the private sector and
mobilize a modest level of non-concessional financing while remaining vigilant of the
contingent liabilities and debt sustainability implications and the need to strengthen their
debt management strategy. My authorities also recognize the important role played by the
public enterprises, particularly in the improvement of infrastructure critical to socioeconomic development. While my authorities recognize staff’s concern regarding the
buildup of external debt, they would stress the undeniable need for such financing of
major infrastructure investment should also be appreciated. Nevertheless, with a view to
maintaining sustainable debt and to avoid debt stress, my authorities are committed to

3
continue seeking more grants and contract loans mostly on concessional terms.
Moreover, the joint debt sustainability analysis undertaken by the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank staffs reaffirms that the level of debt distress will not worsen.
Monetary Policy, International Reserves and NBE Bill
My authorities will continue with the implementation of the base money nominal anchor
which has served well the monetary policy objective of reducing inflation. While they
share staff‘s concerns regarding the high inflation, they are of the view that their
monetary policy stance was only partially responsible and that imported inflation has also
played a significant role. Nevertheless, recognizing that rising inflation poses a
significant challenge to their plan to sustain the current real growth momentum, going
forward they will continue to slowdown the growth in reserve money to ensure
macroeconomic stability. They will also explore all options of monetary policy to achieve
their single digit inflation objective.
While my authorities acknowledge the desirability of building up foreign exchange
reserves, they would do so over a longer time horizon than recommended by staff as the
immediate priority is to use foreign exchange sales to ward off inflation. Given the high
returns from their planned infrastructure investments and the nonexistence of currency
speculation in the economy, they also do not consider the rapid buildup of foreign
reserves as an immediate concern at this time.
On the NBE Bills, while my authorities note staff’s concern, they do not share the view
that it is aggravating the financial repression but rather the introduction of NBE Bills is
helping in shifting credit portfolio from short-term loans to medium and long-term loans.
They would also point out that interest income for commercial banks participating in the
NBE bills has increased by some 60 percent in the quarter ending March 2012 compared
to the same quarter last year, suggesting substantial increase in profitability and absence
of downside impact on banks profitability. Having said that, my authorities underscore
that financial soundness indicators do not point to immediate concerns but they will
remain vigilant in assessing the impact of the NBE bills and would take action
accordingly to ensure that the intended objectives are met without disrupting the
functioning of the financial sector. To this end, they are building capacity of NBE’s staff
on risk based supervision, implementing the World Bank’s financial sector capacity
building recommendations and conducting quarterly stress testing of banks. The
authorities at this juncture do not see a need for an FSAP.
Structural Reforms
The Ethiopian authorities are making progress on key reforms aimed at improving
productivity and efficiency in key sectors of the economy to strengthen the medium-term
growth prospects. These include, creating a more dynamic and productive agricultural
sector, strengthening the power sector to increase access and reliability of electricity

4
supply, promoting the development of non-traditional export sectors and improving the
business environment.
The authorities recognize the important role of private sector development to complement
public investment as a way to expand the capacity of the economy. In this regard, efforts
to accelerate private sector development, particularly, private investment, both domestic
and foreign are fundamental. To this end, the government will play an instrumental role
to create conducive environment and remove bottlenecks to private investment.
Conclusion
My authorities recognize the challenges of macroeconomic management, and remain
committed to taking appropriate measures to address the current imbalances. In this
regard, they will remain engaged with the International Monetary Fund, and would
appreciate the International Monetary Fund’s catalytic role in providing the needed
signals for development partners’ support of their efforts to achieve macroeconomic
stability, promote broad-based and pro-poor growth, and reduce poverty. My authorities
intend to be vigilant and continue adjusting their economic policies and programs for the
near term to meet the emerging challenges and restore macroeconomic stability while at
the same time maintaining their focus on their long-term development objectives of
closing their infrastructure gap and sustaining the growth momentum.
