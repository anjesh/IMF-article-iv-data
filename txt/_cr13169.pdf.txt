STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 16, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Macroeconomic situation and outlook: The economy is gradually turning around after
weak growth in 2010–11 on the back of increasing tourism income. Inflation remains
low, and the balance of payment stable. The fiscal position is sound, with fiscal deficits
on the decline. Credit growth has slowed significantly. In the medium term, growth is
expected to be driven by rising public investment, in part financed by external loans.
Buffers: Macroeconomic and prudential buffers are strong. Net international reserves
are high, and public and external debt low. The risk of debt distress is low, and expected
to remain so. While credit, foreign exchange and liquidity risks have increased in the
financial sector, capitalization is high and banks are profitable.
Longer-term prospects: Maintaining strong fiscal and external buffers should be a
macroeconomic policy priority in light of the economy’s exposure to shocks. The
authorities should also further improve supervision to contain emerging risks in the
financial sector. In the longer run, financing continued investment while preserving low
debt will require additional revenue measures. At the same time, structural reforms to
improve the functioning of markets and institutions and to create a more businessfriendly environment are needed to boost the growth potential.
Exchange regime: The vatu is pegged to an undisclosed basket of currencies. Vanuatu
is an Article VIII member and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Vanuatu is a small island economy in the Pacific. It consists of around 80 islands, and has
about 250,000 inhabitants. Situated about 1,200 miles northeast of Brisbane and 600 miles west of
Fiji, it is relatively close (by Pacific standards) to Australia and New Zealand, but far from the Asian
mainland. Vanuatu’s income per capita is around $3,000.
2.
Vanuatu is well-placed to improve the living standards of its population. Macroeconomic and prudential buffers are strong, and the potential for growth is considerable. However,
to seize growth opportunities, the authorities need to remove obstacles to private sector activity and
pursue reforms in the public sector. At the same time, to manage risks, macroeconomic buffers need
to be preserved and the financial sector vigilantly supervised.
3.
Vanuatu’s economy compares favorably to those of its Pacific island peers (Figure 1).
Even as aid and public investment have been lower in the last decade compared to other Pacific
islands, per-capita growth has been higher on average. Prudent fiscal and monetary policies have
kept fiscal deficits, public debt, and inflation lower than in the region. Net international reserve (NIR)
levels are high. The government is relatively small, and credit to the private sector, at 70 percent of
GDP, is the highest among Pacific islands. Earlier deregulation in the telecom and aviation sectors
has boosted growth and improved the business climate, which remains better than in most other
Pacific islands, although its relative global position has deteriorated.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. Recent Developments
4.
The political situation remains fractious and parliamentary coalitions have in the past
changed frequently. In October 2012 elections, 17 parties gained representation in the parliament.
While the recently replaced prime minister was reelected then, he resigned in March 2013 ahead of
a no-confidence vote, and was succeeded by the current prime minister, Moana Carcasses Kalosil.
5.
The economy is gradually turning around (Figure 2). After slowing growth due to a
decline in construction and tourism in 2010/11, output growth in 2012 is estimated to have
accelerated to around 2¼ percent, as tourism has recovered strongly. Inflation remains low
(0.8 percent y/y in December). The current account deficit has narrowed to 6¼ percent of GDP in
2012 after having risen to over 8 percent of GDP in 2011, and was more than covered by direct
investment inflows and capital grants, slightly raising international reserve coverage to 7 months of
prospective imports. The fiscal deficit is estimated at 1½ percent of GDP in 2012, down from
2¼ percent in 2011, largely due to the authorities’ efforts at controlling expenditure. Private sector
credit growth slowed to 6.4 percent y/y in January 2013.
6.
The authorities’ policies have been broadly in line with past Fund advice. They have
maintained external and fiscal policy buffers, as well as macroeconomic stability, and have stepped

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

3

VANUATU

up supervision of the banking system. Furthermore, they have made efforts to raise additional
revenue through administrative improvements, though the revenue-to-GDP ratio remains low
compared to other Pacific islands. The authorities are now considering tax policy measures that
could create additional fiscal space in the medium term.

B. Outlook and Risks
Staff Views
7.
The outlook is broadly favorable. In 2013, continued growth in tourism and some private
sector investment projects are forecast to raise output growth to 3¼ percent. At the same time,
inflation is expected to pick up moderately to 1¾ percent y/y, as demand pressures increase. The
current account is projected to decline somewhat further, and the overall balance of payments to
remain in surplus. The budget (delayed due to the 2012 election) targets a small overall surplus, with
zero net domestic financing and net repayments of external debt. It also envisages rising revenues
on account of higher growth and improved compliance, and a significant increase in grants. Staff
projections, which assume slower revenue growth and less external assistance, imply a modest
deficit of 1 percent of GDP.
8.
Medium-term prospects are favorable. Several donor-supported investment projects
(including construction of a new wharf in Port Vila and investments in inter-island shipping) are
scheduled to start over the next few years, boosting output growth to 4¾ percent by 2015.
However, thereafter, growth is expected to gradually decline to 3½ percent in the long term. To
sustain growth at higher rates, sufficient resources, both external and domestic, will need to be
mobilized for continued public investment. Also, reviving the momentum for structural reforms to
strengthen markets and institutions and improve the business climate more broadly is critical.
9.
Risks are tilted to the downside (Box 1). Domestically, political fragmentation and limited
capacity, in particular in line ministries, could affect the execution of planned projects and
undermine donor confidence. External risks arise from possibly weaker-than-anticipated activity in
the region which might adversely affect tourism, the mainstay of the economy, as well as a possible
oil price shock. In addition, the danger of earthquakes and cyclones is ever-present, though such
events have had only a small impact on the economy in past years. On the upside, a decisive push
for further structural reforms could boost confidence and investment.

Authorities’ Views
10.
The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s views. They considered, however, that
growth in the next few years could be higher than staff projections given the implementation of
donor-funded investment projects. They also stressed the importance of the agricultural sector, and
explained that they were aiming to expand market access, improve product quality, and increase the
value added of agricultural products in the next few years. They agreed with staff’s assessment of
the risks, but noted that implementation capacity at the Vanuatu Project Management Unit (VPMU)
had been strengthened.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A.

Securing Stability

Background
Vanuatu has solid macroeconomic and prudential buffers, and the balance of payments remains
stable. The authorities’ fiscal and monetary policies have been prudent, with the government
borrowing cautiously and the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) controlling the level of liquidity in the
financial system through open market operations and continuing to accumulate NIR.
11.
External sector. Current account deficits remain sizable, but are being comfortably financed
by foreign direct investment inflows and capital grants. As a result, the rise in NIR has exceeded the
pace of import growth. Other reserve adequacy metrics also suggest that Vanuatu could withstand a
number of potential shocks: at end-2012, coverage of NIR of foreign-currency deposits stood at
96 percent, and at 29 percent of broad money. This provides adequate buffers against a potential
withdrawal of foreign-currency deposits, which could be triggered by external factors, and permits
the RBV to meet requests for foreign currency in the unlikely event of a loss of confidence. At the
same time, the level of the exchange rate is broadly appropriate (Box 2).
12.
Public finances. The debt sustainability analysis indicates that the risk of debt distress
remains low, although contingent liabilities pose some risks. At end-2012, total public and public
external debt remained low at 21½ and 14 percent of GDP, respectively. The projected pipeline of
loans would lead to an increase in public debt by 2017, but the levels remain low and manageable,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

VANUATU

and are expected to broadly stabilize thereafter. The net present value-to-GDP ratios would remain
1–2 percentage points lower. However, these projections, which are consistent with the authorities’
cautious approach to borrowing, assume strict public expenditure restraint, especially in investment,
in the absence of higher revenues. Finally, significant contingent liabilities have accumulated from
legal proceedings (about 10¾ percent of GDP) and loan guarantees (3 percent of GDP).
Box 2: Exchange Rate Assessment
The exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. While the REER has appreciated by about
3¼ percent since 2007, the bilateral real exchange rate with the A$, which is underweighted in the standard
trade-based analyses (with a weight of 19 percent in the REER) but important for the key tourism sector
(with about two-thirds of tourists from Australia, and the tourism industry providing 70 percent of exports of
goods and nonfactor services), has depreciated by 14 percent over the same time frame. Compared to Fiji, a
key competitor in the tourism market, the difference in the bilateral RER with Australia that arose after Fiji’s
devaluation has narrowed significantly. At the same time, CGER-type assessments are inconclusive: the
equilibrium real exchange rate approach suggests that the vatu is 7½ percent below the estimated
equilibrium value but within the 95 percent confidence interval. The macroeconomic balance and external
sustainability approaches suggest an overvaluation of 12 and 25 percent, respectively, but the current
account norms used in these approaches are unrealistic, as they are about 4 and 8 percentage points of GDP
lower, respectively, than the average of actual current account deficits in the past 10 years.

Financial system. The onshore financial system consists of four banks, three of which are
foreign-owned branches and subsidiaries, and four insurance companies, two of which are local.
Credit growth, in part boosted by the entry of a new bank in 2007 and several large commercial and
tourism projects, has slowed gradually. Banks remain well capitalized and profitable, and Vanuatu is
attractive as a retirement and investment destination for Australian citizens due to its low-tax regime
(and no income tax). Risks in the financial system have risen recently, however, due to the weak
economic environment (including a decline in house prices), and structural change stemming from
enhanced oversight by the Australian Tax Office (ATO) of Australian citizens’ financial assets in
Vanuatu, which has led to the repatriation of some foreign-currency deposits.


6

Nonperforming loans (NPLs) have remained high, peaking at 9 percent of total loans in mid-2012,
driven by a few large loans. While this is in part due to legacy loans for which collateral is difficult

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VANUATU

to seize or monetize, write-offs have been slow, and the NPL ratio remains at 8 percent in
December. The RBV conducted a special onsite credit review at all banks in late 2011, has
increased the frequency of required reporting by banks on asset quality, and is introducing new
reporting requirements. The beginning of operations of a credit registry in mid-2012 should,
over time, help improve access to credit while reducing risks.


The credit-to-deposit ratio has reached almost 100 percent. This creates liquidity risks, potentially
exacerbated by the operations of the Vanuatu National Provident Fund (VNPF), which is one of
the largest depositors and has recently withdrawn significant amounts from the system to fund
other investments.



Foreign-currency credit faces downside risks. Growth of foreign-currency credit (which amounts
to about one-quarter of total credit) has continued unabated in recent years, even as foreigncurrency deposits have declined (from over one-half of total deposits in 2008 to one-third in
2012). Lending was financed by a drawdown of commercial banks’ net foreign assets (NFA).
However, with NFA now significantly reduced, a resumed repatriation of foreign-currency
deposits would constrain foreign exchange lending more severely than in the past. Since the
latter loans are extended to a significant extent to resident foreigners with foreign-currency
incomes to purchase real estate (generally priced in foreign currency), this could exacerbate the
current weakness in property prices. While borrowers appear hedged, to some extent, against
foreign exchange risks, banks could be exposed to credit risks in the event of a broader property
market downturn.

Staff Views
Maintaining buffers to sustain confidence and be able to respond to adverse shocks should be a policy
priority. The authorities should continue to pursue their cautious macroeconomic policies, while
strengthening prudential supervision where needed.
14.
Monetary and exchange rate policies. The peg to an undisclosed basket of currencies has
served Vanuatu well, and remains an appropriate anchor for monetary policy. Monetary policy
should aim to maintain high NIR and contain inflation within the RBV’s target range of 0–4 percent.
In this context, the RBV’s lowering of the rediscount rate from 6 to 5.5 percent in April, largely for
signaling purposes, is appropriate. However, the authorities will need to carefully monitor credit
developments to avoid a buildup of risks as economic growth picks up.
15.
Fiscal policies. The authorities should maintain their cautious borrowing policies to protect
strong fiscal cushions, in particular given significant fiscal contingencies. They need to carefully
assess financing of new projects with a view of debt sustainability, notably the upgrading of the
airport system currently under consideration, since their tax productivity is uncertain. At the same
time, risks arising from other possible financing models (e.g., public-private partnerships) need to be
carefully evaluated as well. Phasing large projects should also be considered. To the largest extent
possible, the authorities should rely on grants and raise additional domestic revenue (see below).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

VANUATU

16.
Financial sector policies. While all but one bank are foreign-owned, care will need to be
taken to preserve financial sector soundness. In this regard, the planned requirement for assigned
capital for foreign bank branches (of which there is one) is welcome. The shift toward risk-based
supervision provides an opportunity for systematically addressing risks in the financial system.


The RBV should soon conduct a follow-up onsite review of NPLs, focusing on implementation of
its previous recommendations to prevent the emergence of future NPLs, as well as on writing off
existing NPLs more aggressively.



The RBV should also carefully monitor individual banks’ as well as systemic exposure to foreign
exchange risk and to developments in the property market. While banks’ net open positions
remain modest, the RBV should consider introducing regulations to limit foreign currency risks.
Also, the authorities should consider introducing formal regulations to ensure that the risk of
unhedged foreign currency borrowers is reflected in banks’ balance sheets, either through
additional provisioning requirements or a higher risk weight.



To forestall liquidity risks, the RBV should review liquidity requirements from a prudential
viewpoint. While the current accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate, the high
credit-to-deposit ratio warrants close prudential attention, and liquidity cushions may need to
be strengthened.



The operations of the VNPF should be reviewed, and its mandate clarified. While the desire to
tap its resources for national development is understandable, its primary function is to ensure
adequate returns for its members, requiring a focus on the safety of its assets.

Authorities’ Views
17.
The authorities broadly concurred with the staff’s views. They stressed their
commitment to continue prudent fiscal policies to maintain fiscal buffers, including in the light of
fiscal contingencies. While they viewed infrastructure investment, in particular in the airport system,
as critical for future growth, they were conscious of the risks involved in debt financing of such
projects, and were considering a number of options, including private sector involvement. They
considered their exchange rate regime a key anchor for maintaining stability, and were determined
to maintain it. At the same time, they considered that there was room for higher credit growth to
support economic activity. They also emphasized their conservative approach to financial sector
supervision, pointing to the revocation of several licenses of offshore banks, and requested further
technical assistance (TA) to help improve supervision along the lines suggested by staff.

B.

Reigniting Sustainable Growth

Background
After the slowdown in recent years, growth is expected to rise in 2013–15 on the back of a recovery in
tourism and investment. However, in the longer term, a broader foundation needs to be built to
support sustainable growth.
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VANUATU

18.
Low investment poses risks to future growth. New projects in the next few years will
provide a boost to the economy, but continued investment in key infrastructure is required. In
particular, the upgrading of the main airport is critical to expand tourism and tap into the potential
of the Asian market. Investments to deliver public services to remote islands are also needed.
However, government revenues are low compared with other Pacific islands, even as a significant
share of recurrent spending—the wage bill—is comparable.
19.
The authorities are making efforts to increase revenue. They are strengthening the audit
function in the Department of Customs and Inland Revenue, including by introducing risk-based
auditing. Also, discussions are underway in the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) to amend the
rules of origin with the aim of reducing revenue losses arising from the MSG free trade agreement,
and new legislation is being discussed in the parliament to improve customs enforcement and
compliance. The government is also exploring tax policy measures.
20.
Capacity constraints weigh on public investment. After a number of donor-supported
investments were completed in 2010–11, new projects have only gradually been launched, despite
significant needs and the availability of donor financing. While the VPMU has been strengthened,
the strain on the administration of planning, coordinating, and executing investment projects, as
well as complying with donor requirements, is significant.
21.
The business environment has deteriorated in relative terms. After a number of reforms
in key sectors in the early 2000s—which have helped Vanuatu’s economy weather the global crisis in
2009 relatively well—the reform momentum appears to have slowed, and Vanuatu has slipped in the
World Bank’s Doing Business ranking.

Staff Views
Vanuatu’s cautious approach to external borrowing and its low debt level have established an
important buffer against fiscal shocks. To preserve this, any efforts to widen the fiscal space to finance
infrastructure spending and improved delivery of public services should come primarily through raising
additional domestic revenue. At the same time, reforms to improve the institutional and business
environment are needed to support a more dynamic private sector.
22.
In addition to revenue-increasing efforts already underway, further administrative
measures could produce gains. Tax enforcement would be strengthened with the hiring and
training of more staff, especially in the large taxpayers office, the establishment of a VAT tribunal,
and prosecution of non-payers. Any revenue losses arising from new trade agreements should be
offset through higher excise taxes. In this context, opportunities for streamlining the tax system and
reducing exemptions further should be explored.
23.
However, these measures, while welcome, cannot yield additional revenue on the scale
needed to finance future investment as well as needed maintenance and social spending.
More decisive tax policy measures will be required to boost revenue by amounts sufficient to
provide the government with the resources needed (Box 3). On balance, staff recommend the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

VANUATU

introduction of an income tax, as other Pacific islands have done. However, this requires significant
administrative preparation—additional staff would have to be hired and comprehensively trained
and equipped, and taxpayers educated. Therefore, an early decision will lead to higher revenue
yields only in the medium term. To alleviate the impact on businesses, structural reforms to lower
the costs of doing business should be implemented simultaneously (see below).
Box 3: Financing Public Investment over the Longer Term
Capital spending in Vanuatu has been among the lowest of the Pacific islands over the past decade.
As a result, the road network is inadequate and poorly maintained, commercial ports have the highest cost
in the Pacific, and limited capacity at airports constrains tourism growth. At the same time, a rapidly growing
population is increasing pressure on the existing physical and social infrastructure.
The fiscal space for scaling up public investment or for higher spending on maintenance and social
services is constrained. Vanuatu has been relying on a mix of grants and concessional borrowing to finance
public investment, including the current pipeline of projects scheduled for implementation during 2013–
2017, which would raise public debt by around 4¼ percentage points by 2017. Maintaining the debt-to-GDP

Strengthening compliance should result in continued improvements in VAT collection, but the scope for
further improvements is relatively narrow.



Raising the VAT rate from the current 12.5 percent to 15 percent could yield additional revenue
relatively quickly, but would disproportionately hit the poorer segments of the population and would
likely generate lower revenue than an income tax (some 1–1½ percent of GDP).



Conversely, the introduction of an income tax, levied on both wage earners and corporates, could yield
between 3 and 4 percent of GDP at modest tax rates, and bring greater equity to the tax system. Staff
estimates suggest that additional revenue of this magnitude would allow for sustaining the rate of
public investment at a level consistent with higher growth, as well as finance a modest increase in
current expenditure.

24.
Broader structural reforms are needed to complement public investment and boost
the underlying potential of the economy. This requires a broad-based strengthening of markets
and institutions. Reforms should be focused on and designed around achieving clear goals, with
agencies receiving political support and held accountable for results. Key areas are:

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VANUATU



Reforming government business enterprises (GBEs). Enhancing accountability, strengthening
governance, and clarifying objectives are important to control risks and improve financial
performance (Box 4). In this regard, the introduction of a new policy framework for GBEs is a key
prerequisite. Consideration should also be given to privatizing some GBEs, and entities slated for
liquidation should be closed expeditiously.
Box 4: Government Business Enterprises
Scope: There are 21 Government Business Enterprises (GBEs), of which 5 are regulatory entities, and 16 fully
or partially state-owned enterprises. Many of these have mandates which are both commercial and public
service-related.
Accountability and governance: Controls to ensure that GBEs are efficiently managed and accountable are
inadequate. Accounting standards in many GBEs are weak and several have not produced financial
statements for many years. Indeed, many do not employ any qualified accountants, while their boards are
often staffed by political appointees without the requisite technical knowledge. More generally, political
interference in GBEs’ operations can result in poor financial decisions.
Financial relations with the government: Transfers to GBEs from the central government budget are
limited to regulatory entities. While GBEs are managed at arm’s length, the government’s ultimate ownership
exposes it to financial risks, which are difficult to assess due to weak reporting. While borrowing by GBEs
requires government approval, this process may bypass the Ministry of Finance. A change to the Public
Financial Management Act is expected be gazetted soon to limit the liabilities of the government with
respect to the corporatized entities it owns.
Reform plans: The government has embarked on a reform program for GBEs, but progress has been slow.
Some GBEs have been moribund for several years and have been marked for liquidation. A GBE unit has
been created in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management and a draft policy framework providing
for stronger governance arrangements has been prepared with the assistance of the Asian Development
Bank. The framework is currently awaiting approval by the Council of Ministers.



Civil service reform. The strengthening of the VPMU should help ensure a smooth execution of
donor-supported investment projects. However, more broadly, the government will need to
ensure that the civil service is well-educated, well-staffed, and well-paid, while avoiding
unproductive employment. This will require focusing scarce resources on key areas, including
investment promotion and business service delivery. While every effort should be made to
contain costs, this may require some additional spending, reinforcing the argument for higher
revenue. Consideration should also be given to involving private sector associations more in
some activities.



Improving the business climate. To reverse Vanuatu’s slide in global competitiveness rankings,
and create a business-friendly environment to attract domestic and foreign investors, reforms
are needed to (i) lower costs, especially of key inputs such as energy, as well as of trading; (ii)
streamline procedures; and (iii) improve the land market (Box 5).

A concerted effort, in cooperation with the private sector, should be made to develop new markets
for tourism (both geographically and in enhancing the value added of the tourism industry). This
would require additional resources for sustained promotional campaigns, and collaboration with
external partners (operators and airlines) and investors.

Box 5: The Business Climate
th

Background: Vanuatu is ranked 80 in the World Bank’s
2013 Doing Business index. This remains higher than the
average of Pacific islands, but represents a slide from rank
62 in 2008. In the index’s subcategories, Vanuatu’s rank

improved in getting credit (due to a broadening of

collateral and better creditor protection) but deteriorated

permits (mainly due to the introduction of an
environmental assessment requirement). In addition,
energy and transport costs remain high. Even if the
business environment has not deteriorated in absolute
terms, or some new procedures (such the environmental assessment) are warranted, action needs to be
taken to improve Vanuatu’s relative standing to keep up with competitors and realize growth opportunities.
Reforms should concentrate on:



Lowering costs: While fostering competition in small economies is often difficult, every effort should be
made to introduce or enhance competition wherever possible to lower prices, in particular in the key
energy (fuel imports and electricity generation) and transport sectors. Where natural monopolies are
inevitable, expanding the remit and strengthening the capacity of regulators are critical. The planned
expansion of the wharf in Port Vila and an inter-island shipping project should help reduce trading
costs.



Streamlining administration: Eliminating redundant procedures (as Tonga and Timor-Leste have done)
and regulations, and reducing the time required (e.g., through an electronic system for business
registration, as in Solomon Islands) should help reduce start-up and compliance costs and save time. In
addition, comprehensive one-stop shop support for foreign and domestic investors should be made
available.



Further improving accessibility of land. The land market, while better developed than in most Pacific
islands, could be improved further through completion of data in the land registry and strengthening of
dispute resolution mechanisms.

Authorities’ Views
25.
The authorities concurred with staff that boosting revenue was critical, as they wanted
to preserve low debt, and reduce reliance on donors. At the same time, they pointed to the
administrative and political difficulties of introducing an income tax, and thought that ultimately

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VANUATU

consumers would bear the burden of such a tax, as this would be passed on in an environment of
limited competition. They were also concerned about the impact of an income tax on the business
environment. They seemed more inclined to rely on a combination of a VAT increase and
administrative efficiency gains, and possibly the reintroduction of a turnover tax (which had been
abolished earlier when the VAT was introduced) and increases in business licensing fees. However,
they stressed that they were exploring all options, and requested Fund TA to this end.
26.
The authorities also agreed that the business climate needed to be enhanced. They
shared staff’s views on GBE reform, but noted the considerable political challenges to reform in this
area. They also considered a streamlining of the administration and improving governance as
critical, including to boost Vanuatu’s reputation abroad. They explained their intention to strengthen
the Public Service Commission to introduce reforms in the civil service, as well as their plan to
promote the Chamber of Commerce as the single interlocutor of business with government, and to
increase the capacity of the public prosecutor’s office. They agreed with the need to strengthen
competition, but pointed to the difficulties facing a small economy in this regard. With regard to
business promotion, they affirmed their intention to facilitate business, including foreign direct
investment, but indicated that some activities—including in the tourism sector—would remain
reserved for businesses which were majority-owned by locals.

OTHER ISSUES
27.
AML/CFT issues. The most recent mutual evaluation by the Asia Pacific Group on Money
Laundering (APG) took place in 2006, which assessed Vanuatu as not passing 11 out of 16 core/key
recommendations. In 2011, Vanuatu was placed under the “Enhanced Mutual Evaluation Follow-Up”
process and subject to close monitoring by the APG. Since then, Vanuatu has enacted more
comprehensive AML/CFT legislation and has established a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), but
effective implementation and enforcement still need to be demonstrated. Personnel and financial
resources of the FIU need to be significantly increased. The FIU, though severely understaffed, has
prepared several cases for prosecution. A detailed report by Vanuatu on its AML/CFT progress will
be analyzed and discussed by the APG membership at its annual meeting in July 2013.

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Cautious macroeconomic policies have been instrumental in maintaining stability and
confidence. The authorities should continue with their conservative approach to debt financing.
While public and external debt is low, fiscal contingencies pose some risks. Monetary policy should
remain geared toward maintaining high international reserves and low inflation. The RBV will need
to monitor monetary conditions as economic growth is expected to pick up, and tighten policies if
needed.
29.
Financial sector policies have been appropriately cautious. Supervision of the financial
sector has been tight, and banks remain well capitalized despite a rise in NPLs. At the same time,
foreign exchange risks have increased, and the authorities should strengthen supervision further

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

VANUATU

through introduction of regulations limiting net open foreign exchange positions. Liquidity and
credit risks also warrant attention.
30.
To maintain low debt in the longer term while funding needed spending on
infrastructure, maintenance and social services, new revenue measures are needed. The
authorities’ consideration of options in this regard is welcome. While recognizing the benefits of a
low-tax environment (though, on the other hand, the reputational costs of being considered a “tax
haven” can be significant), staff recommend the introduction of an income tax, because it alone
among the options is expected to yield sufficient resources to adequately fund future spending
needs while supporting a more equal after-tax income distribution. However, a decision will need to
be made soon, since extensive and careful preparations are needed before a new tax can be
expected to yield substantial revenue.
31.
While higher revenues are needed, these should be used to strengthen, not broaden,
the state. Along with public investments and maintenance of the public capital stock, a welleducated, well-paid, and well-staffed civil service is critical to provide public services and support
private sector activity. However, with limited resources, the state should carefully consider its
activities, and concentrate on those where its impact is highest, while holding government agencies
accountable. In other areas, the government may be able to reduce its role.
32.
Vanuatu’s growth potential is considerable, especially in the tourism sector but also in
agriculture. To realize this potential, as well as the full benefits arising from infrastructure
investments, reforms are needed to increase the effectiveness of the civil service, enhance
competition in key sectors, and improve the accessibility to land. Such measures would lower
business costs and limit or at least partially offset the pass-through of higher taxes on consumers,
and thus help reduce the impact of higher taxation. Expediting reforms in these areas would also
help mitigate external risks.
33.
The authorities should carefully assess financing options for new large infrastructure
projects, in particular the upgrading of the airport system. Staff recognize that these
investments are important for future growth, but they also carry risks, and it is critical that Vanuatu’s
strong debt position not be jeopardized. Consideration should be given to phasing investments, and
involving the private sector (though this requires a careful assessment of risks to public finances as
well).
34.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 24-month cycle.

Exchange Arrangements
Since 1988, Vanuatu has officially maintained an adjustable peg exchange rate arrangement.
Currently, the exchange rate of the vatu is linked to a transactions weighted (trade and tourism
receipts) basket of currencies. The weights and composition of the basket, which are not publicly
disclosed, are adjusted periodically. The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) quotes daily buying and
selling rates for the vatu against the U.S., Australian, and New Zealand dollars; the euro; the U.K.

Economic Statistics
During 2010 and 2011 PFTAC assisted with the upgrading of government finance statistics to the
2001 GFS Manual. Support is now being provided by a regional GFS project managed by STA and
the authorities are now reporting data regularly to STA. PFTAC has provided ongoing assistance with
peer review of annual GDP estimates, helped finalize and publish for the first time GDP by
expenditure approach and is assisting with rebasing the constant price GDP measures to a 2010
base year. Future plans include the development of a quarterly measure of GDP.
Public Financial Management
In 2009 PFTAC was asked to assess the FMIS system (as part of PFTAC’s regional review of FMIS
implementation issues). Vanuatu has regularly sent officials to PFTAC-sponsored regional training
events. No direct PFM interventions have been recorded since the April 2009 FMIS review.
Macroeconomics
In the macroeconomic area, PFTAC provided assistance to the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Management (MFEM) in constructing a financial programming framework for Vanuatu and provided
training in its use. This assistance included a number of missions that focused on improving the
framework developed by MFEM, building together with MFEM and the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu
(RBV) a small empirical-based inflation model that was later integrated into the framework, and
holding a workshop to provide training in how to use the framework. In addition, staff members
from MFEM and RBV participated in a regional financial programming workshop in Fiji held jointly
by PFTAC and the Singapore Regional Training Institute using a Fiji case study specifically developed
for this workshop.

PFTAC in Suva, Fiji is a multi-donor technical assistance institution, financed by the IMF, AsDB, AusAID, NZODA,

and, until 2001, by the UNDP, with the IMF as Executing Agency. The Centre’s aim is to build skills and institutional
capacity for effective economic and financial management that can be sustained at the national level. Member
countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua
New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

BANK-FUND COUNTRY TEAM CONSULTATIONS
As of April 10, 2013
1.
A representative of the World Bank accompanied the IMF Article IV team on their visit
to Vanuatu on April 2–10, 2013 and participated in discussions with the team and the
Government of Vanuatu. The Bank and Fund country teams exchanged views on key
macroeconomic prospects, fiscal policy priorities, and fiscal sustainability, and agreed to coordinate
the two teams’ work over the period April 2013 to March 2014.
2.
The teams agreed on the main macroeconomic issues for Vanuatu. These are the near
and medium term growth outlook, appropriate fiscal and monetary policies over the near term,
maintaining a sound fiscal course over the medium term, and addressing structural issues to sustain
economic growth over the longer term.
More specifically:









Near-term growth outlook
o Key determinants of growth: Continued growth in the tourism sector of the economy
and the role played by donor-financed construction activities.
Fiscal policy
o Appropriate fiscal stance in 2013 and 2014.
o Revenue mobilization to support improvements in key service delivery areas such as
health and education and to enhance growth prospects, including via the
introduction of an income tax in the medium term and near-term policies such as
increased compliance and enforcement, and a continued reduction in exemptions.
Monetary policy
o Effectiveness of monetary policy in managing economic activity.
Financial policy
o The implications of declining net foreign assets for bank soundness.
o Continuing efforts to strengthen financial supervision and regulation.
Structural issues
o Improving basic infrastructure including transport, electricity, telecommunications
and urban amenities.
o Strengthening the investment climate, including through enhanced competition.
o Improving investor services, including through a one-stop shop.
o Improving education and health services.

3.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified four areas as macro-critical, in
view of their central role in achieving a sound macro-financial policy framework and sustained
growth: (i) continuing efforts to strengthen the medium-term fiscal framework and explore options
to generate more revenues to counter the decline in collections due to trade liberalization and to
mobilize more funds to finance social and physical infrastructure, including through the introduction
of income taxation; (ii) continuing efforts to safeguard financial stability by further strengthening

financial supervision and regulation; (iii) improving basic infrastructure such as seaports, airports and
urban amenities to support reduced costs and increased economic activity; and (iv) structural
reforms to strengthen competition and improve business service delivery to bolster the underlying
growth potential of the economy. Table 1 details the specific activities planned by the two country
teams over the period April 2013 to March 2014, along with their expected deliveries.
4.
The teams have the following requests for information and collaboration from their
counterparts:


The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in various projects and analytical
work undertaken by the Bank in order to use resources efficiently and avoid work overlaps.



The Bank team requests the Fund to make available to the Bank its latest macroeconomic
assessment and macroeconomic data from time to time as inputs to the Bank’s lending and
non-lending operations.

5.
No disagreements among the two teams emerged on either the key issues, challenges,
or on the division of tasks to tackle these. It was agreed that further details on collaboration, as
necessary, will be agreed at the technical level as work progresses.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
As of April 19, 2013
Operational Strategy
Asian Development Bank’s (AsDB) Country Partnership Strategy for 2010–2014 is aligned with the
government’s poverty reduction strategy and aims to assist the government to address constraints
in (i) transport—by providing support for improved connectivity to markets and social services; (ii)
urban development—by improving access to sanitation and drainage facilities and improve urban
infrastructure with a particular focus on Port Vila; and (iii) energy—by supporting greater energy
efficiency, rural electrification, and renewable energy sources. Consistent with the government’s
strategy of fostering private sector-led growth, AsDB also focuses on improving the enabling
environment for the private sector through updating the legal and regulatory environment, better
access to finance, and the reform and restructuring of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
Subject to the annual country performance assessment exercise, AsDB envisions support from 2013
to 2014 of about $10.56 million in loans from the Asian Development Fund as well as $300,000 per
annum in technical assistance (TA) grant support. To leverage AsDB’s impact and reduce borrowing
costs, cofinancing opportunities will be pursued with other development partners.
Lending Trends/ADF Grants/Portfolio Status
Since joining AsDB in 1981, 11 loans have been provided to Vanuatu for a total amount of $67.07
million and 60 TA projects for $21.82 million. More than 50 percent of the loans were for
infrastructure rehabilitation and more than 40 percent of the TAs were for institutional support and
capacity building. ADB resumed its lending operations in Vanuatu with the approval of two projects
in the last quarter of 2011. These were for the Vanuatu Interisland Shipping Project ($26.82 million),
cofinanced by the New Zealand Government and Port Villa Urban Development Project ($39.16
million), cofinanced by the Australian Government.
There are four ongoing TA projects amounting to $3.96 million: TA7288-VAN: Interisland Shipping
Support Project; TA 7345-VAN: Port Vila Urban Development Project; TA 7588-VAN: State-Owned
Enterprise Rationalization Program; and TA 8285-VAN: Energy Access Project.
Private Sector Development. AsDB’s country strategy in Vanuatu aims for rapid, inclusive, and
private sector-led economic growth. AsDB’s capacity development and advisory support focuses on
(i) improving the business regulatory environment; (ii) expanding access to finance; and (iii)
reforming SOEs and public-private partnerships which is provided through the Pacific Private Sector
Development Initiative II and II. The Private Sector Operations Department continues to explore
investment opportunities in energy, trade, information and communication technology, and financial
sectors to support small and medium-sized enterprises.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VANUATU



Improving the business regulatory environment. Recent AsDB assistance has been
focused on drafting a new Companies Act, a new Insolvency Act and a new Trustee Act.
Advisory support will continue for the implementation of these new laws and for
establishing an electronic companies’ registry.



Expanding Access to Financial Services. AsDB provides ongoing assistance for improving
access to finance opportunities in Vanuatu. AsDB has supported the National Bank of
Vanuatu to implement a rural outreach program to expand access to financial services in
several of Vanuatu’s islands using new technologies and communications equipment. A
diagnostic was also prepared for the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu and the Vanuatu Financial
Services Commission on the current framework for the regulation and supervision of
microfinance institutions (including the Vanuatu Women’s Development Scheme) that are
taking deposits. It is providing further support to improve outreach of financial services in
rural areas.



State-Owned Enterprise Program. SOE reform is central to the improved economic
governance supported through the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. AsDB approved a
stand-alone TA in 2010 to support the government's SOE reform efforts. The reform of the
government’s SOEs will be focused on assisting the government to improve the governance,
transparency, and efficiency of the SOEs. This could also include closure or divestiture as
appropriate.

Interisland Shipping Support Project. AsDB is cooperating closely with the government and New
Zealand to implement a package of investments and technical assistance to improve interisland
shipping services, capacity, and regulation. The main outcomes of the project includes (i) better
access to markets and social services in the outer island target areas by 2014; (ii) stronger safety
regulations and more compliance; and (iii) better shipping infrastructure. AsDB provides a loan of
$10.82 million, the New Zealand government a parallel grant of $12.60 million, and the Vanuatu
government $3.40 million. Implementation started in the beginning of 2013.
Port Vila Urban Development Project. AsDB’s support for urban development will contribute to
social development by improving access to sustainable basic services in urban areas. AsDB, through
a concessionary loan of $5.0 million equivalent and administering of the corresponding grant of
$31.0 million equivalent from the Australian government, will provide assistance focused on urban
planning and the provision of affordable, sustainable, and effective sanitation and drainage services
to the residents of Port Vila and its surrounds, particularly to those living in informal settlements.
Specific results targeted include (i) preparation of robust planning, legislative and policy documents
for implementation in cooperation with the government, (ii) preparation of an integrated storm
water drainage and sanitation master plan; (iii) institutional strengthening and capacity
development; and (iv) provision of high priority drainage and sanitation infrastructure.
Energy Sector Initiatives. Overall access to energy is estimated at 33 percent and power
generation is heavily dependent on diesel generation, which results in high power tariffs. RETA-7329

Promotion of Renewable Energy in the Pacific assessed alternative renewable energy options and
concluded that hydropower is the least cost expansion option. The $11 million Energy Access Project
(EAP), proposed for 2014, will support increased energy access to households and businesses in the
provincial centers of Vanuatu thus contributing to inclusive economic growth. This will be achieved
through expansion of existing distribution grids and the development of low-cost renewable energy
generation from hydropower. In addition, ADB will support the transition to renewable energy
through a pilot grid-connected solar project in Luganville and will assist consumers to use energy
more efficiently under regional technical assistance.
Regional Cooperation Initiatives. Regional support will continue to be provided for renewable
energy and energy efficiency, climate change, coastal and marine resources management, private
sector development, management of civil aviation and information and communications technology.
Under the Pacific Alliance for Sustainability, funded by the Global Environment Facility, AsDB is
helping to build climate change adaptation capacity through regional TA aimed at strengthening
management of coastal and marine resources. The regional TA for Statistical Capacity Building in the
Asia and Pacific Region will continue. AsDB will continue to support Vanuatu’s participation in
regional forums. AsDB will continue to work closely with the Pacific Islands Forum in a variety of
areas, including on economic monitoring and formulation and implementation of economic policy.
AsDB–World Bank joint Development Coordination Office
AsDB has strengthened its assistance to Vanuatu through closer collaboration with the government
and other development partners. An AsDB–World Bank joint Development Coordination Office was
opened in June 2010 in Port Vila. The shared field presence is increasing AsDB's responsiveness to
the development needs of Vanuatu and supports aid coordination and aid effectiveness.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of April 30, 2013
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. In particular,
national accounts and external sector statistics need to be further improved, while the coverage of
government finance statistics could be expanded.
National Accounts: While there have been improvements in methodology and the development of
additional data sources, the accuracy of the recently-released, experimental expenditure-based GDP estimates
could be further improved. Also, data are compiled only on an annual basis. Work is underway on rebasing
the constant price GDP estimates using 2010 as the new base year. PFTAC is providing technical assistance in
this work, and also in the improvement of the experimental expenditure-based GDP and the development of
estimates of GDP on a quarterly basis.
Price statistics: The CPI weights are based on 1998 household surveys, and only cover the two urban centers
of Port Vila and Luganville. Work on rebasing the CPI is underway, using data from the 2010 Household
Income and Expenditure Survey.
Government finance statistics: Budget classification is broadly consistent with the 2001 GFSM. Government
operations data are compiled for the central government. However, they exclude public enterprises and
operations of provincial governments and the two municipalities, as well as grant bodies and other central
government extra-budgetary units. The operations of the budget are recorded on a cash plus invoice basis.
Monetary statistics: The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu reports monthly monetary data, including the accounts of
the monetary authorities, commercial banks, and interest rates in its monthly bulletin posted on its website.
The RBV also publishes a quarterly report with wider coverage of financial data including fiscal transactions
and financial soundness indicators.
External sector statistics: An external sector statistics mission visited Vanuatu during March 2013 and made
the following key recommendations: (1) Review and improve the compilation of offshore banking data in the
balance of payments and international investment position using information from the Financial Institutions
Supervision Department; (2) Improve the coverage and classification of the public external debt; and (3)
Propose to the Vanuatu Investment Promotion Authority improvements to the different application forms for
foreign direct investment approvals, which would allow for the identification of new investments in Vanuatu.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) since April 2004.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA
Exchange rate and reserves data have been reported only through October 2012. Monthly monetary statistics
data have been reported through August 2012. Annual balance of payments data have been published
through 2011, but are inconsistent with data provided to the mission. Quarterly consumer price data are
available through Q3 2012. Annual trade figures are available only through 2011. Both the trade and price
data are gathered from other sources; no data is sent by the authorities. Annual GFS data through 1990 have
been reported intermittently in the 2001 GFS format. No sub-annual fiscal data have been reported for
publication in the IFS.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
Approved By

Luis Breuer and Peter Allum
(IMF)
Jeffrey D. Lewis and Sudhir
Shetty (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund
and the International Development Association.

Vanuatu remains at a low risk of debt distress based on the Low-Income Country Debt
Sustainability Assessment (LIC DSA). Vanuatu’s overall public debt level is low and should remain
manageable, provided fiscal deficits remain small. Under the baseline scenario, all external debt
sustainability indicators are projected to remain well below their applicable thresholds.2 Public debt
is also projected to remain low, consistent with the authorities’ conservative borrowing policies.
Contingent liabilities arising from lawsuits (all domestic) pose a moderate risk.

BACKGROUND
1.
Public and external debt levels remain comfortable. In 2012, public debt rose
slightly to 21.6 percent of GDP. A fiscal deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP was domestically financed.
Total external debt declined to 25.5 percent of GDP, mainly reflecting lower private external debt,
but also net repayments of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt, which declined to
slightly below 14 percent of GDP. 3 Publicly guaranteed domestic debt (not included in the DSA
baseline) amounts to 3 percent of GDP. Contingent liabilities arising from potential courtimposed damages in lawsuits amount to 10¾ percent of GDP. There are no other known
contingent liabilities.
2.
The analysis is based on the standard LIC DSA framework. The key assumptions
are conservative (Box 1), and differ somewhat from those in the last DSA. Growth is higher in the
medium term and lower in the longer run as investment rises and then declines. At the same
1

This DSA was prepared jointly with the World Bank, in accordance with the Debt Sustainability Framework for
low-income countries approved by the Executive Boards of the IMF and IDA. The debt data underlying this
exercise were provided by the Vanuatu authorities.
2

Vanuatu’s policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment, averaged 3.4 over the past three years, placing it as a medium performer.

time, the fiscal projections envisage a small primary deficit, in line with recent outcomes, and
consistent with a stable public debt-to-GDP ratio. In addition, the non-interest current account
deficit is projected to be slightly higher. Contingent liabilities are entirely domestic. PPG external
debt has broadly evolved as forecast in the last DSA, while total external debt has declined faster
as banks’ foreign liabilities have fallen. On the other hand, total public debt has risen instead of
declined as forecast at the time of the last DSA, as government deficits have not declined as
forecast then.



GDP growth is projected to recover to a peak of 4¾ percent in 2015 as new largely donorfinanced investment projects are implemented. This is, however, well below previous
investment-driven growth spurts. In the long run, growth is assumed to gradually decline
to 3½ percent, below the average of the past 10 years.



The GDP deflator in US$ terms is projected to rise gradually to 2¾ percent in the long run,
in line with an inflation rate within the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu’s target band.



The primary fiscal deficit is assumed to stabilize at about ½ percent of GDP (and the overall
deficit at about 1½ percent of GDP), slightly lower than the average of the past five years
and consistent with the authorities’ conservative borrowing policies and a stabilization of
the public debt-to-GDP ratio. Critically, maintaining the modest deficits envisaged in the
baseline scenario would compress public investment in the absence of domestic revenue
measures.



Foreign aid is projected to increase significantly in the next few years, before declining
gradually as a percentage of GDP. Roughly 9 percent of total aid in the long run is assumed
to be concessional loans, higher than the historical average but lower than in 2013–18
when a large, highly concessional loan is being disbursed.



The current account deficit is projected around 5 percent in the longer run and assumed to
be financed by foreign direct investment inflows and capital grants, reflecting the structure
of the economy. Tourism, the main earner of foreign exchange, has significant upside
potential.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VANUATU

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
3.
Under the baseline scenario, Vanuatu’s external debt remains sustainable. Total and
PPG external debt are projected to increase to 26¾ and 15¼ percent of GDP, respectively, by 2016
before declining again to levels similar to those at end-2012. Other key indicators of sustainability—
the present value of PPG external debt, the ratio of PPG debt service to exports, and the ratio of PPG
debt service to revenue—all remain well below the indicative thresholds.
4.
Stress tests indicate no breaching of the applicable thresholds for PPG external debt.4
However, if the authorities were to increase their external borrowing significantly beyond the
amounts assumed in the baseline scenario, for example to finance large infrastructure projects with
uncertain tax productivity, external debt levels could quickly rise, particularly if the terms of this
borrowing were to be less favorable than the baseline borrowing mix.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
5.
Under the baseline scenario, public sector debt increases to 26 percent of GDP in 2018,
and then broadly stabilizes at that level. This contrasts somewhat with the external DSA, where
PPG external debt falls back to 2012 levels, due to amortization of old debt and a sharp slowdown in
new external borrowing from 2017. All other indicators point in the same direction.
6.
Stress tests suggest that a realization of contingent liabilities equal to 10 percent of
GDP, would result an equivalent increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio over the longer term. A
growth shock or lower long run growth, however, poses a bigger risk to public debt sustainability
over the longer term. However, as with external debt, should the government debt-finance large
infrastructure projects, public debt levels would rise commensurately.

STAFF ASSESSMENT
7.
Vanuatu is at a low risk of debt distress; external and public debt levels are low. While
they are projected to rise in the next few years, they remain manageable, and all indicators of
vulnerability remain well below the applicable thresholds, even under stress tests.
8.
However, to contain public and external debt at prudent levels, the authorities will
need to continue the cautious borrowing strategy of the past. Combined with significant
spending needs for infrastructure investment and maintenance, as well as in social sectors, this
requires that domestic revenues be increased significantly.

4

The historical scenario, which assumes that key variables such as export growth and the US$ GDP deflator remain at
the average levels of the past 10 years, was eliminated from the analysis, as it presents an unrealistically favorable
view of conditions going forward (GDP growth was boosted by high levels of grant-financed investment while
primary balances were positive).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 21, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with
Vanuatu
On June 7, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Vanuatu.1
Background
Economic activity is gradually turning around after slowing growth mainly due to a
decline in construction and tourism in 2011. Output growth in 2012 is estimated at
around 2¼ percent on the back of a recovery in tourism. Inflation remained low, at
0.8 percent year on year in December 2012. The balance of payments remains sound.
The current account deficit has narrowed to 6¼ percent of GDP in 2012, and was more
than covered by foreign direct investment inflows and official grants. Official reserves
continued to rise to $182 million, with coverage of prospective imports rising to 7 months.
The fiscal deficit is estimated at 1½ percent of GDP in 2012, largely due to the
authorities’ efforts at controlling expenditure. Public debt remains low, at 21½ percent of
GDP.
The authorities have maintained prudent macroeconomic and financial policies. They
have protected external and fiscal policy buffers, as well as macroeconomic stability.
Furthermore, they have made efforts to raise additional revenue through administrative

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

improvements. The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) has also stepped up supervision of
the banking system to address credit and foreign exchange risks.
In 2013, continued growth in tourism and some private sector investment projects are
forecast to raise output growth to 3¼ percent, and inflation is expected to pick up
moderately to 1¾ percent year on year, as demand pressures increase. The overall
balance of payments is projected to remain in surplus. The budget targets zero net
domestic financing and net repayments of external debt. It also envisages rising
revenues on account of higher growth and improved compliance, and a significant
increase in grants. In the medium term several donor-supported investment projects are
scheduled to be implemented in the next few years, boosting output growth to 4¾
percent by 2015. Domestic risks arise from limited capacity, which could affect the
execution of planned projects. A key external risk stems from possibly weaker-thananticipated activity in the region which might adversely affect tourism. On the upside, a
decisive push for further structural reforms could boost confidence and private sector
investment.
Executive Board Assessment
They commended the authorities’ prudent policies, which have fostered macroeconomic
stability and resilience to shocks. Looking ahead, Directors considered that Vanuatu
needs to maintain strong policy buffers while investing in infrastructure, enhancing
public service delivery, and improving the business environment.
Directors agreed that spending needs, particularly in infrastructure and social services,
will put pressure on the fiscal position. They welcomed the authorities’ plans to
strengthen tax administration and their consideration of new revenue measures,
underscoring the advantages of an income tax, among the various options, in terms of
revenue yield and distributional impact. Directors emphasized the need to accelerate the
reform of government business enterprises, which is necessary to improve governance
and reduce fiscal risks.
Directors noted that public and external debt remain low. They encouraged the
authorities to maintain their conservative approach to debt management, supporting
their intention to seek external financing only on concessional terms. Prospective
financing pressures can be alleviated by appropriately phasing public projects and
partnering with the private sector.
Directors concurred that the exchange rate peg has served Vanuatu well, and remains
an appropriate anchor for monetary policy. They encouraged the Reserve Bank of
Vanuatu to monitor monetary conditions closely as economic growth picks up, and
tighten the policy stance if needed.
Directors commended the authorities’ cautious financial sector policies and noted that
banks remain well capitalized despite a rise in nonperforming loans. To address
emerging risks, Directors saw merit in further strengthening supervision and introducing
regulation to limit banks’ open foreign exchange positions. Liquidity and credit risks also

warrant close attention. Directors welcomed steps in establishing an anti money
laundering framework, but encouraged the authorities to speed up progress to address
gaps in implementation and enforcement.
Directors noted Vanuatu’s considerable growth potential, especially in tourism and
agriculture. Realizing this potential will require a new round of structural reforms,
including increasing the effectiveness of the civil service, promoting competition in key
sectors, and improving access to land. Such measures would lower business costs and
help mitigate external risks.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by Joon-Won Yoon, Executive Director for the Vanuatu
and Branan Karae, Advisor to Executive Director
June 4, 2013
The Vanuatu authorities thank staff for the constructive policy dialogue and useful advice
provided during the Article IV Consultation. The favorable 2013 economic assessment is a
welcoming sign that the country is maturing further and heading in the right direction.
Nonetheless, the authorities recognize that they face numerous challenges, including in
infrastructure and tax reform, and, in this regard, reaffirm their full commitment to the economic
growth agenda.
Economic Developments, Outlooks and Risks
Vanuatu is a highly open, small island economy in the Pacific, and remains significantly exposed
to external uncertainties. The delay in the global economic recovery has put a strain on the
economy over the past few years. The economy began to recover in 2012, with the tourism sector
picking up strongly. Inflation is low at 0.8 percent and the current account deficit has narrowed
to 6¼ percent of GDP, from 8 percent in 2011. Growth for 2013 is projected to continue,
supported by a pickup in manufacturing and construction.
Downside risks to the growth forecast include: further delay in the global recovery, unexpected
rise in global fuel prices, and a change of preference from tourism originating from Australia and
New Zealand. At the domestic level, the frequent changes in the political arena present
challenges to reform efforts. However, the new government, headed by Prime Minister Moana
Carcasses Kalosil, is committed to ensuring political stability in order to promote economic
growth and structural reform.
Fiscal Management
Fiscal management is sound and the authorities are committed to maintaining this position.
Authorities intend to maintain debt at low levels, although they recognize that this will be a
significant challenge, given projected infrastructure financing needs. Authorities agree with the
Staff assessment that the government budget needs to be strengthened to support the financing of
public capital investment projects. In this regard, the government will continue to work closely
with the development partners and to seek external financing support on concessional terms only.
The fiscal revenue base must be strengthened over the longer term. The authorities are pleased to
advise that discussions with the line ministries on the planned new revenue initiatives have
started and the government is putting together the recommendations. While some
recommendations can be implemented right away, such as increasing the VAT rates, others like
the income tax proposal will require comprehensive analysis to be carried out first. As noted in
the staff report, authorities are open to considering all tax options, and would welcome Fund
assistance to this end.
Tax administration will be further strengthened by the recruitment of suitable personnel,
appropriate training and improving enforcement capacity. On the expenditure side, the
authorities will continue to improve expenditure management and strengthen the oversight of

2
audit controls. The authorities recently amended the Public Finance and Economic Management
Act to improve the control and disbursement of funds. The government’s plan to address the
financial health of state owned enterprises (SOEs) through the restructuring of these entities and
liquidation of those that are no longer profitable will ease the pressure on the government budget.
Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate
The monetary policy framework of the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) continued to be
effective in achieving the monetary policy targets over the past two years. The peg to a basket of
currencies has served the country well in providing stability and guiding expectations. While
inflation is currently low, inflationary pressure is expected to increase over the coming years
with the implementation of government projects and the expected increase in domestic demand.
The RBV stands ready to tighten monetary policy and to take appropriate steps to protect net
international reserves above the four months import cover threshold as demand for import rises
in the near term.
Financial Sector
The financial sector is sound and domestic banks are well capitalized. However, growth of nonperforming loans (NPLs) resulting from weak economic environment is a concern. The RBV has
responded proactively, by conducting onsite reviews of NPLs, increasing their monitoring and
instructing banks to adhere to prudent credit lending standards. The RBV strongly advised banks
to ensure they had adequate provisioning to cover potential losses. As a result, specific
provisions for the banking industry as a whole, increased by 159 percent from August 2011 to
December 2012.
On the high credit to deposit ratio, the RBV is closely monitoring the situation, particularly in
relation to the Vanuatu National Provident Fund’s recent withdrawal of its significant deposits
from the banking system to fund its huge investments. More broadly, while the industry’s
liquidity level is high, the distribution among individual banks is uneven. To this end, the RBV
will continue to review the prudential liquidity requirements of commercial banks and ensure
that banks continue to adhere to best liquidity management practices.
Authorities concur with the staff assessment that individual banks’ systematic exposure to
foreign exchange risk should be monitored carefully. Notably, the trend increase in demand for
foreign-currency credit, against declining foreign-currency deposits, is of concern. At this stage,
the RBV has drafted, but not yet implemented, a guideline on managing foreign currency risk.
The guideline will also address the risk of exposure to unhedged foreign currency lending to
ensure that it is reflected in the banks’ balance sheet.
AML/CFT Issues
As an offshore center, Vanuatu’s reputation has come under intense scrutiny over the years.
However, Vanuatu is committed to complying with the international standards on anti-money
laundering practice. Vanuatu has enacted more comprehensive AML/CFT legislations and has
established the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to oversee this function. The authorities agree,
however, that effective enforcement of the legislation is an area of weakness and they will put
more focus on this. More financial support will be provided to the FIU and the authorities will

3
continue to recruit and upgrade the HR capacity of the Unit through its participation in domestic
and international trainings.
Structural Reform
The government continues to pursue structural reform steadfastly in its efforts to improve
government services to make basic services more affordable and reliable to the general public.
The 2008 reform in the telecommunication sector brought greater competition with the entry of
Digicel, bringing the total telecommunication service providers to two. The government also
launched in 2012 its e-government network allowing it to run its own network, improving its
services throughout the country. The government is also giving its full support behind a privateled joint venture project to deploy Vanuatu’s first international submarine cable system linking
Vanuatu to Fiji. This new set up, planned for completion this year, will deliver faster, more
efficient and cost effective internet connectivity, replacing the current unstable satellite
telecommunication set up.
On the energy sector, concerted effort has been made to increase power supply, improve
reliability, and reduce the high costs of electricity. The government has opened up the energy
sector and licensed a new electricity company, Vanuatu Utilities and Infrastructure, which
operates in the second town, in the northern part of the country. The main power provider,
Unelco Vanuatu Ltd., has also diversified its energy source to include coconut oil and wind
energy. The government is also in the process of finalizing the setup of a geothermal plant
venture with a reputable international energy company, Kuth Energy, on the northern side of the
island of Efate. The project, once in operation, is expected to reduce the high cost of electricity in
Port Vila (the capital) and reduce the high dependency on diesel based electricity generation.
The drop in the country’s 2013 doing business ranking from 62 to 80 is unfortunate. The
authorities are determined to improve the ranking by reducing the time it takes to start a new
business and the time taken to obtain a construction permit. Authorities also see merit in
eliminating redundant procedures to reduce start-up and compliance costs.
The government is committed to reforming Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) to achieve
the combined goals of improved public service delivery, reduced fiscal transfers to the GBE
sector and private sector development. A policy paper on reforming GBEs is currently being
finalized for submission to the Council of Ministers. The GBE policy will form the basis of a
new SOE legislation. While there are no current plans for privatizing any GBEs over the medium
term, any restructuring and privatization of GBEs can only occur after the new SOE legislation is
in place.
The future driver of growth will mainly come from the tourism sector. To reduce the heavy
reliance on the Australia and New Zealand markets, the authorities are also looking to expand
into the Asian market. Last year, the authorities conducted a number of big promotions in the
Asian region and they intend to increase this further. The outcome of last year’s promotion is
already showing positive results. Given that the infrastructure capacity of the country is
insufficient to support tourism targeted growth, the implementation of the donor funded projects
to improve Port Vila’s urban infrastructure, main wharf and shipping is a welcomed
development. Short-term growth will be driven by the implementation of donor funded public

4
infrastructure projects that have already been approved. To avoid delays and to smooth out the
impact of donor funded large capital projects, the authorities will strengthen the role and capacity
of the Vanuatu Project Management Unit. Over the longer term, the government is focused on
soliciting financial support to fund the expansion of the country’s main airports to accommodate
larger aircrafts and increased capacity.
For the agriculture and fishery industries, the authorities will continue to exploit the comparative
advantage of these industries and will more critically address the barriers to labor and
investment. Plans are also under way to open up a government fishery processing plant (built
with the assistance from China some years ago) on Efate in June this year. This processing plant
will help facilitate private sector activities, increase the value-added in the production process,
and provide local employment. Job opportunities have also increased with the opening up of the
unskilled labor mobility scheme with the New Zealand Government in 2006 under the
Recognized Seasonal Employee scheme. A similar scheme has just been established with
Australia, although the scale is still small.
