EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Growth picked up in 2006, reflecting stronger exports, while inflation slowed sharply, with
the 12-month rate back within the inflation target. Resolute implementation of the VAT
reform boosted tax revenues, and facilitated further fiscal consolidation, aided by constraints
on spending associated with non-passage of the 2006 budget. Fiscal reforms buoyed investor
confidence, with portfolio inflows up sharply in the third quarter and local financial markets
substantially stronger during the year. Remittances also continued to grow rapidly. In this
environment, the peso strengthened considerably against the U.S. dollar, even as reserve
accumulation accelerated.
The authorities have responded to strong balance of payments inflows through continued
exchange rate flexibility, accumulating reserves, scaling back external borrowing, and prepaying external debt. Staff consider this policy mix to be appropriate given relatively low
reserve cover, the volatility of capital flows, and indicators that the exchange rate is not out
of line with fundamentals.
The authorities recognize that sustaining the reform momentum is essential to maintain
investor confidence and set the stage for higher growth. Staff concurs, as public debt is still
highly sensitive to rollover and exchange rate risk, external commercial borrowing
requirements remain high, and pockets of weakness persist in the financial sector.
Staff welcome the authorities’ commitment towards continued fiscal consolidation.
Balancing the budget over the medium term, while raising priority spending will require
further revenue effort. The authorities regard accelerating the implementation of tax
administration reforms as crucial in this regard. Staff emphasize that new tax measures, such
as a rationalization of tax incentives, will also be needed. At the same time, careful
monitoring of other parts of the public sector should support the fiscal consolidation effort.
The authorities recently reintroduced tiering whereby placements at the central bank attract
progressively lower interest rates. While this system complicates assessment of the monetary
policy stance, staff believe that the effective easing implied is large and could endanger the
inflation forecast. However, the authorities view tiering as a temporary measure consistent
with inflation continuing to trend down. Staff encourage the authorities to remove tiering
should this outlook change.
In the banking sector, progress is being made in strengthening balance sheets, but the level of
distressed assets still remains high. Approval of long-delayed changes to the BSP Charter
remains essential to equip supervisors with adequate legal protection. In the power sector, the
recent agreement on a long-term supply contract with the largest distributor represents an
important opportunity to accelerate the shift of power sector assets into private hands.

if this were to coincide with signs

need to be sustained for there to be positive growth spillovers, which are needed to step up

and build popular support for reforms.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Private consumption and exports have been the principal growth drivers.
Growth averaged 5.4 percent (y/y) in the first three quarters of 2006, up from 4.8 percent in
the same period in 2005 (Chart 3), boosted by a recovery in both electronics and nonelectronics exports (Chart 4). Private consumption remains a major driver of growth,
underpinned by remittances, which are up 17 percent (y/y) through October. Staff expect
growth to have held up in Q4, in part due to the boost to spending from the Supplemental
Budget passed in October, and have revised up the growth forecast for the year from 5.0 to
5.5 percent.

Monetary policy has been eased in an environment of falling inflation. Headline
inflation fell to 4.3 percent (y/y) in December, implying average inflation of 6.2 percent in
2006, compared to the inflation target of 4-5 percent for 2006 and 2007 (Chart 5). A series of
adverse supply shocks, including those from food prices, international oil prices, and the
VAT reform, have failed to feed into underlying inflation, which staff estimate to be running
between 3-4 percent (Chart 6). This environment allowed the BSP to reintroduce the tiering
scheme in early November, thereby effectively easing monetary policy.1

1

Under tiering, bank liquidity placed at the BSP receives progressively lower interest rates: banks receive the
policy rate on the reverse repo window (currently 7½ percent) on balances up to P 5 billion; the policy rate
minus 200 basis points on balances above P 5 billion and below P 10 billion; and the policy rate minus 400
basis points on balances above P 10 billion.

5.
The national government deficit looks likely to have undershot the 2006 target,
and further consolidation is planned for 2007. Revenues grew by over 20 percent in
January-October (y/y) due to successful implementation of the VAT reform, and there are
also possible signs that collection efficiency is improving (Chart 7). Meanwhile, despite large
needs, spending growth was slow reflecting the failure of Congress to pass the 2006 budget.
Against this background, staff expect the national government deficit to have shrunk further
in 2006 and to be significantly below the target of 2 percent of GDP. A similar fall is
expected for the non-financial public sector (NFPS) deficit, reflecting consolidation at the
national government level, continued improved performance of the social security
institutions, and expenditure savings by the National Power Corporation (NPC) (Text
Table 1). The 2007 budget programs a further reduction in the national government deficit to
0.9 percent of GDP and a large increase in priority infrastructure and social spending, on the
basis of assumed strong revenue growth.

There have been strong inflows of foreign exchange. Remittances have continued
to grow strongly and the balance of payments received additional support in the second half
of 2006 from weaker oil prices. There has been a pick-up in FDI (cumulative net inflows

8
were $1.6 billion as of September, up by two thirds compared to the same period in 2005).
There was also a pronounced acceleration in net portfolio inflows once global risk appetite
resumed in Q3 following the sell-off in May-June, with net portfolio inflows from July
through November of $1.3 billion, five times the level in the same period in 2005 (Chart 8).
Against this backdrop, the peso appreciated by 7½ percent against the U.S. dollar during
2006, even as the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) continued to build reserves, while using
off-balance sheet currency swaps with local banks to reduce the impact on reserve money
(Chart 9). The authorities also used the greater availability of foreign exchange to repay
external debt, and to reduce their reliance on external borrowing.2

The rapid pace of foreign exchange
inflows has boosted liquidity growth. As
foreign exchange inflows have accelerated
across the region, growth in broad money has
risen (Chart 10). In the Philippines, M3
growth peaked at 16.2 percent in August
2005 (y/y), but subsequently fell as
households shifted from deposits to unit
investment trust funds (UITFs). In the wake
of the May-June market turbulence,
households switched back into deposits and
M3 growth reached 18.5 percent in
November.

Nonetheless, the Philippines remains

A loss of reform momentum would have negative economic implications over the
medium term. The baseline scenario (Currently Identified Measures Scenario, Table 5)
assumes that the national government meets its 2007 deficit target of 1 percent of GDP.
However, staff assume that it does so by spending less than the budgeted amounts, reflecting
likely slower-than-expected revenue growth and little chance of new tax measures ahead of
the elections. Even though containing expenditure will be challenging in an election year,
staff consider this to be the most likely scenario were revenues to underperform. Should there
continue to be no additional revenue measures over the medium term, the NFPS deficit
would settle at 2 percent of GDP, while public investment would increase only modestly. In
this environment, staff expect growth to rise to 5.8 percent in 2007 and remain at that level
over the medium term.
10.
The outlook would be much more favorable were there to be further progress
with reforms. An additional revenue effort would allow the authorities to meet the 2007
deficit target without compressing expenditure, and to eliminate the NFPS deficit altogether
over the medium term while substantially increasing infrastructure investment (Additional
Reforms Scenario, Table 6). Combined with improvements in the business climate, this
scenario would create an environment conducive to higher investment and the outlook for
growth would be even brighter. Under both scenarios, public debt would decline
significantly, but would still remain sizable by 2011 (Appendix I).
IV. Report on the Discussions
11.
Against this background, the discussions focused on several policy challenges
facing the authorities: (a) dealing with continued strong foreign exchange inflows;
(b) ensuring that fiscal reforms continue and are sustainable; (c) strengthening the structural
and financial sector foundations for higher medium-term growth.
A. Dealing with Continued Strong Foreign Exchange Inflows
12.
There has been strong upward pressure on the exchange rate. By one metric—
appreciation against the U.S. dollar—upward pressure on the Peso has been relatively modest
(Chart 12). However, factoring in reserve accumulation, including off-balance sheet currency
swaps, upward pressure has been much higher. Chart 13 shows that overall appreciation
pressure on the Peso has been comparable to that experienced by the Thai Baht, the strongest
performer in the region against the U.S. dollar in 2006.3

3

The measures taken by the Thai authorities in December to curb portfolio inflows had no adverse effects on
Philippine markets, with market participants deriving reassurance from BSP statements that no similar measures
were being considered.

13.
The authorities are appropriately pursuing several policy options in the face of
this upward pressure. The current strategy allows exchange rate flexibility while further
building reserves. Staff consider some reserve accumulation to be justifiable, given that the
exchange rate is not obviously undervalued (Box 1), reserves are still low compared to other
emerging markets, and capital inflows could easily reverse. The authorities are also shifting
towards domestic rather than external financing of the budget (Text Table 3), and plan to
seek additional opportunities for prepayment of external debt. Moreover, the reintroduction
of tiering represents an effective easing of monetary policy. While the BSP’s stated intention
behind this move was to stimulate bank lending, the initial impact seemed to have been to
take some pressure off the exchange rate.

The re-introduction of tiering represents an easing of monetary policy. While the
deceleration in underlying inflation has created room for some easing, staff noted that the
effective relaxation implied by tiering is large. Initial staff calculations pointed to a 200 basis
point cut in effective terms, although part of this was subsequently unwound (Chart 14).4
Nonetheless, so large an easing could endanger the inflation forecast if maintained. Staff
argued that a rapid removal of tiering would be warranted if the inflation outlook were to
become less favorable, in the event of a rise in global risk aversion or should there be
renewed hikes in international oil prices. The authorities responded that tiering has in recent
experience been a temporary measure. They were in any case keeping a close watch on
incipient inflationary pressures and stood ready to take policy action if necessary.

B. Ensuring that Fiscal Reforms Continue and Are Sustainable
15.
The authorities deserve considerable credit for recent fiscal reforms. Following
the sizable fiscal adjustment in 2004 and 2005, the authorities have fully implemented the
VAT reform. As a result, tax revenues are expected to rise by 1.3 percent of GDP in 2006.
Staff noted that the success of the VAT reform reflected resolute implementation and welltargeted mitigating measures.5 In addition, in November the authorities removed a provision
in the VAT reform bill that limits the input credit to 70 percent of the output VAT paid by
businesses whose input VAT exceeds their output VAT. Staff welcomed this move, as this
provision discriminated against some businesses and likely resulted in tax cascading.

4

In general, tiering complicates assessment of the policy stance. Private sector estimates of the effective easing
have ranged between 50 and 300 basis points. The reintroduction of the system also led to a rise in bond market
volatility (Chart 15).

5

A Selected Issues Paper assesses the distributional impact of the VAT reform.

16.
Achieving the 2007 deficit target may require new tax measures. Meeting the
2007 budget’s twin objectives of further consolidation and higher priority spending will
require national government revenue to grow by 15 percent, above projected nominal GDP
growth of 10 percent. Staff noted that meeting this revenue goal will be challenging,
particularly given the difficulty of passing new tax measures before the May 2007 elections.
Cutting expenditure to meet the deficit target, on the other hand, would undermine the goal
of raising infrastructure and social spending. Staff therefore inquired whether a slightly less
ambitious deficit target might be appropriate for 2007 providing that the overall downward
direction in the deficit could be maintained. The authorities, however, argued that any
relaxation in the deficit target might be misinterpreted as an attempt to increase spending
ahead of the elections. In addition, they noted that setting ambitious revenue targets would
help provide incentives to boost collection efficiency.
17.
Over the medium term, balancing the budget will require new tax measures. An
additional tax effort of about 2½ percent of GDP is needed over the medium term to achieve
the authorities’ goals of balancing the budget and augmenting priority spending. Although
improvements in tax administration can help partially close this gap, staff proposed reducing
tax incentives and raising and indexing excises to inflation as potential revenue raisers. In
this regard, staff suggested that early announcement of tax measures for the 2008 budget
would help to convey the authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal consolidation. The
authorities responded that Congressional support for new measures was contingent on fully
collecting revenues from the VAT reform. As a result, they argued for keeping the immediate
focus on establishing a credible tax collection record.
18.
Accelerating tax administration reform is therefore critical. Initial steps have
been taken in some areas, including towards developing an anti-tax evasion program and
cleaning the taxpayer register at the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). Progress in other
areas will be assisted by early approval of the World Bank tax administration loan that is
expected to provide a framework for financial and technical support from other donors.
While waiting for donor mobilization, staff urged the BIR to accelerate the pace of work on
cleaning the taxpayer register, auditing tax arrears, and drafting industry-based audit
manuals. The authorities agreed with these priorities.
19.
Reforms are on track in other areas. Civil service reform is proceeding and most
government agencies are expected to submit their rationalization plans by year-end. Reforms
at the Social Security System (SSS) have included an increase in the contribution rate, better
policing of delinquent contributors, and an information campaign to attract new members.
These changes have extended the date at which the SSS is projected to run out of resources
until 2031, while allowing benefits to be increased by 10 percent, the first hike since 2003.
The authorities have also taken initial steps to better monitor public enterprises. A
comprehensive review of the operations of the National Food Authority is underway and is
expected to lay the foundation for setting monitorable performance targets. Staff emphasized
that this should be the eventual goal for other important government-owned and controlled
corporations (GOCCs). The authorities indicated that performance reviews are also ongoing
for 20 other government agencies with a view to improving efficiency of their operations.

14
C. Strengthening the Structural and Financial Sector Foundations
for Higher Medium-Term Growth
20.
Staff expect medium-term growth to rise reflecting a more favorable investment
outlook. Even though investment remains anemic, several factors point to higher investment
growth ahead: (i) remittances are increasingly being channeled into real estate investment;
(ii) profits in the non-financial corporate sector have increased sharply; (iii) the financial
sector has reduced its non-performing assets; and (iv) the finances of NPC have improved.
(i) remittances:
21.
The surge in remittances is driven by global trends, a rise in the number of
overseas workers, and a shift to higher skill jobs. Remittance growth has accelerated in
recent years, in line with other countries (Chart 16). Factors driving this growth include the
rise in the number of overseas workers, in particular in the Middle East where high oil prices
have boosted demand, and the fact that skilled workers now account for a greater share of
overseas workers (Text Table 4).

22.
Remittances are being channeled into housing and construction. Major property
developers increasingly market directly to overseas workers, and market analysts estimate
remittances used for home purchases in the last 12 months at about $3 billion. Together with
the rise in the emerging business process outsourcing (BPO) industry, this has helped to
rejuvenate the property market. The authorities and staff agreed that the recent shift of
remittances from consumption to investment was a promising development and may help
promote a broader recovery in investment.6

A Selected Issues Paper examines the relationship between the rapid growth of the services sector and the
level of investment.

15
(ii) the non-financial corporate sector:
23.
Profitability in the non-financial corporate sector has risen, and the surge in the
stock market should help underpin an investment recovery. After lagging behind the
region since the Asian crisis, profitability in the non-financial corporate sector in the
Philippines exceeded that in the rest of the region in 2005, with evidence suggesting that
profit growth accelerated further in 2006 (Chart 17). In addition, the surge in the stock
market should reduce the cost of capital for firms, which may also underpin investment going
forward (Chart 18). Separately, staff expect investment in the mining sector to pick up
sharply in 2007, despite continuing legal and local government related obstacles. The
authorities indicated that FDI in this sector could be in excess of $850 million in 2007, nearly
quadruple the 2006 level.

(iii) the financial sector:
25.
Solving the distressed assets problem will be necessary if the banking system is
to contribute to the investment revival. The authorities have taken a number of steps since
the 2001 FSAP to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework. However, progress
in resolving non-performing assets (NPAs) has been relatively slow, a result of the fiscal
situation constraining the possible use of public money, and bank supervisors being hindered
in executing their duties by a lack of legal protection. In this environment, the level of NPAs
in the banking system has remained high and bank capital has grown only slowly (Chart 20).
This situation leaves the banking system vulnerable. Moreover, in a regional comparison,
slower progress in resolving nonperforming loans has been associated with lower investment
growth (Chart 21).

to households, by contrast, has grown rapidly, albeit from a small base, supported by a pickup in residential real estate, automobile, and credit card financing.8
27.
The stock of nonperforming assets remains large. The resolution of NPAs has
moved ahead, spurred by the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) framework that was in effect
from 2003 to 2005 (Box 2). Nonetheless, progress has been relatively slow, with some
important banks still burdened by large stocks of NPAs, consisting of nonperforming loans
(NPLs) and repossessed assets, mainly real estate (ROPOAs). Staff argued that since
ROPOAs are likely to be overvalued, these banks appeared effectively undercapitalized.9 In
response, the authorities noted that the recent tightening of supervision was forcing banks to
accelerate the clean up of their balance sheets. The implementation of new accounting
standards (IFRS) with stricter valuation requirements, combined with the gradual phasing in
of Basel II was increasing the capitalization needs of banks and inducing weaker ones to
raise capital or merge with other banks. There were also encouraging signs that the new
Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework, which provides a time bound setting to deal
with problem banks, was helping to strengthen enforcement.
28.
Additional efforts are needed to fortify bank balance sheets. The authorities
expected the disposal of NPAs to accelerate with the prospect of higher risk weighting under
Basel II and the recent extension of the SPV law through April 2008. Staff suggested that if
this acceleration does not occur, a further tightening of regulatory requirements on NPAs
should be considered. Where needed, the authorities intended to provide regulatory relief
strictly within the parameters of the new PCA framework and agreed with the staff that close
monitoring of the implementation of the agreed MOUs would ensure that the reform
momentum did not stall. There was a common view that current positive market sentiment
and the improved performance of the economy should permit banks to raise a substantial
amount of new capital.
29.
Legislative action should also help strengthen the financial system and lay the
foundation for healthy lending growth. The authorities agreed that bank supervision would
be significantly fortified by amendments to the BSP Charter that would provide legal
protection for bank supervisors, and allow them to increase pressure on banks to raise capital
and facilitate prompt closure of problem banks. These amendments, however, remained stuck
in Congress and, with elections approaching, the near-term prospects for passage were poor.
The authorities were more positive about an early adoption of the Credit Information
Systems Act that would foster greater transparency in the market and improve credit access.

8

The delinquency rates in household lending have been high in comparison with other countries, reflecting in
part the early phase of the product development cycle. Margins have been generally sufficient to cover the
credit risk. Adoption of the Credit Information Systems Act currently tabled in Congress should help banks
improve credit risk management.
9

While the value of ROPOAs may rise over time with a general increase in real estate prices, time also erodes
their value due to depreciation, neglect, and the presence of squatters (who obtain certain rights after a period of
time). Also, many properties reported on banks’ balance sheets have unresolved titling and other legal issues
that may prove costly to overcome once banks attempt to dispose of these assets.

18
30.
The authorities intend to speed up capital market development. An action plan to
further develop capital markets has been finalized and several initiatives are ongoing to
improve the operations of the trust industry following a sell-off in May-June 2006. The
authorities have also used debt swaps to develop strong benchmark issues along the
sovereign yield curve.10 Various legislative initiatives pending in Congress are also expected
to facilitate capital market development, including the Personal Equity and Retirement
Account bill, the Pre-Need Code, and amendments to the Investment Company Act.
(iv) the power sector:
31.
The financial performance of NPC has improved, and successful privatization
will boost reform efforts. Despite initial low prices in the Wholesale Electricity Supply
Market (WESM), NPC operations registered a slight surplus through September, helped by a
stronger peso, higher sales, and lower fuel costs (Chart 23). But progress in privatization,
which would promote competition in WESM and augment long-term power supply capacity,
has been slow. Staff welcomed the recent long-term supply contract agreement between
Meralco, the largest distributor, and NPC, as this should remove uncertainty over the industry
outlook and drive privatization forward. Steps are also being taken to bid out Transco, with
three pre-qualified bidders currently contending for the 25-year concession. Staff argued that
a timely outcome to the Transco sale could help improve privatization prospects more
generally.

However, NPC continues to face medium-term challenges. A substantial need for

NPC debt payments are scheduled for 2009-11, averaging US$1.5 billion per year (Chart 24).
The authorities expect that successful privatization would strengthen the investment climate
more broadly and help with debt repayments.

The BSP has recently sought technical advice from Fund staff on bond market development and reform and
liberalization of the foreign exchange system.

19
V. Staff Appraisal
33.
Significant fiscal reforms have lifted financial markets and economic
performance has been strong. The authorities deserve considerable credit for the sizable
fiscal adjustment that has been achieved in the past few years. Markets have taken note.
Sovereign spreads have fallen, the peso has rallied, and the stock market has boomed.
Reserves have risen to new highs, and rating agencies have revised their outlooks from
negative to stable. Meanwhile, growth has remained robust and there has been a welcome
decline in inflation.
34.
Nonetheless, vulnerabilities remain high, underscoring the need to sustain the
reform momentum. With public debt highly sensitive to rollover and exchange rate risk and
external commercial borrowing requirements still large, Philippine markets would be hard hit
by a sudden rise in global risk aversion. In addition, pockets of weakness remain in the
financial sector. Sustaining the reform momentum is therefore critical. Continued reforms
will also help promote positive growth spillovers that are necessary to make substantive
inroads into reducing poverty.
35.
The current mix of strategies to deal with the upward pressure on the exchange
rate is appropriate. The exchange rate does not appear out of line with fundamentals,
reserve cover remains low compared to other emerging markets, and, as evidenced by the
market sell-off in May, capital inflows can quickly reverse. Some further intervention to
build reserves therefore seems justified. Nonetheless, there should also be continued
emphasis on exchange rate flexibility going forward. Meanwhile, the authorities are
appropriately shifting towards domestic rather than external financing and seeking additional
opportunities for prepayment of external debt.
36.
Care should be taken to ensure that monetary policy has not become too easy.
The reduction in inflation justifies easier monetary policy and the authorities have recently
reintroduced tiering. Although assessing the monetary policy stance is more complicated
when easing occurs through tiering rather than cuts in the policy rate, the effective relaxation
appears to be large and could endanger the inflation forecast. Nonetheless, the authorities
view tiering as a temporary measure consistent with inflation continuing to trend down. Staff
encourage the authorities to remove tiering were this outlook to change.
37.
Fiscal performance continues to be strong. Tax collections are up sharply due to
the VAT reform. Important efforts are also being made to improve tax administration, though
it is too early for positive effects on collection to be clearly visible. Non-passage of the 2006
budget has constrained spending, notwithstanding the Supplemental Budget. The national
government deficit is expected to have fallen by a further 1.2 percentage points of GDP in
2006, with a similar decline expected for the NFPS deficit, reflecting continued strong
performance of the social security institutions, and expenditure savings by NPC.
38.
Looking ahead, balancing the budget while increasing priority spending will
require further revenue effort. Continued expenditure compression is neither desirable nor
sustainable. Accelerating the implementation of tax administration reforms is therefore
crucial. New tax measures, such as a rationalization of tax incentives, will likely also be
needed. At the same time, careful monitoring of other parts of the public sector will be
necessary to support the fiscal consolidation effort. In this context, the turn around in NPC’s

20
finances needs to be sustained, and performance targets should be put in place for other
important GOCCs.
39.
Further steps are needed to strengthen the banking sector. While progress has
been made in the disposal of NPLs, the stock of ROPOAs remains large and concentrated.
The disposal of NPAs is expected to accelerate with the prospect of tighter prudential
requirements, the extension of the SPV framework, and implementation of Basel II. If not,
the authorities should consider a further tightening of regulatory requirements on NPAs.
While recent consolidation in the banking sector and efforts by banks to raise new capital are
welcome, the BSP should maintain pressure on banks to raise capital. Any regulatory relief
provided to banks should be tied closely to the new PCA framework.
40.
Long-delayed changes to the BSP Charter remain essential. Congress continues to
show little interest in passing BSP Charter amendments that would strengthen legal
protection for supervisors and increase their leverage over problem banks. The authorities
should continue to press for passage of these amendments so as to allow efforts being made
to strengthen the regulatory framework to become fully effective.
41.
Capital market development is appropriately a priority. The authorities are
promoting the development of domestic capital markets through their public debt
management. Legislative initiatives, including bills to create credit information bureaus and
promote retirement saving vehicles, are complementing this effort.
42.
Power sector privatization should be accelerated. The recent agreement on a longterm supply contract between NPC and Meralco should help reduce uncertainty that has
hampered privatization, and should be seized as an opportunity to shift power sector assets
into private hands.
43.
Data provision for surveillance purposes is adequate overall, although staff
analysis continues to be affected by certain deficiencies in the data. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ efforts to address these shortcomings, particularly those in the balance of
payments data.
44.
The exit from PPM is appropriate given the progress that has been made with
reforms. The recent ending of PPM is a welcome sign of the gains made in strengthening the
fiscal and external positions. Staff looks forward to maintaining close relations with the
authorities as part of regular Article IV surveillance in the post PPM era.
45.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation with the Philippines be
held on the standard 12-month cycle.

21

Box 1. The Appreciation of the Peso and Competitiveness

However, according to CGER estimates,
the recent appreciation has brought the
Peso in line with fundamentals.
Following the Asian crisis, the real
effective exchange rate (REER) has been
steadily below its equilibrium value, based
on the augmented PPP approach developed
as part of CGER. Since 2004, the
appreciation of the Peso has closed this
gap, and has brought the REER in line
with fundamentals, including productivity
differentials, the terms of trade, and net
foreign assets. Thus, in terms of the CGER
measure, the recent appreciation of the
Peso corrects a misalignment, rather than
creates one.

The appreciation of the Peso has given
rise to concern over a loss of
competitiveness. In the year through
September, the Peso rose 10.3 percent
versus the U.S. dollar, and strengthened
14.8 percent in real effective terms. This
appreciation is in common with other
regional currencies, but also reflects
country-specific factors, such as continued
strong growth in remittances, a rebound in
exports, and a marked improvement in
sentiment following fiscal reforms. The
strengthening of the Peso has caused
concern to mount in the Philippines about
a possible loss of competitiveness.

Moreover, the appreciation of the peso has coincided with an export recovery. Export growth through
October of this year averaged 16.4 percent (y/y), compared with 3.3 percent in 2005. This recovery has been
driven to a large extent by non-electronics exports, consistent with the view that the recent appreciation has
not harmed competitiveness to date.

Box 2. Banking Sector Reforms
The FSAP carried out in 2001 had identified a number of problems in the Philippine banking sector. High
levels of nonperforming assets (NPAs) had seriously affected the health of the sector, reduced capital
adequacy, and constrained credit to the private sector. There was a need to strengthen the supervisory
framework, especially to deal with the conglomerate structure of the corporate sector. The prompt
corrective action (PCA) regime also needed to be reinforced. Since then, a number of reforms have been
carried out.
Initiatives to deal with NPAs:
•

The Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) law, introduced in 2002, provides regulatory and tax
advantages to banks disposing of their NPAs. Sales of P 100 billion of NPAs (one fifth of the
stock) have been concluded. The framework (that expired in April 2005) was extended in March
2006 for another two years.

Regulatory and supervisory framework:
•

Prudential regulations governing lending to related interests (DOSRI) were expanded in March
2004 to include subsidiaries and affiliates. Exposure limits have also been introduced, as well as
stiffer penalties for noncompliance. In parallel, a consolidated supervisory framework has been
phased in.

•

A new PCA framework was adopted in February 2006, allowing banking supervisors to intervene
before a significant decline in capital occurs and introducing specific sanctions if banks do not
comply with their capital restoration plan.

•

The BSP is gradually phasing in Basel II and adopting risk-based supervision for the country’s
commercial banks. In February 2005, an additional 25 percent was assigned to the risk weighting
on NPLs (bringing it to 125 percent). On July 1, 2007, banks will be required to implement the
standardized approach for credit and operational risks. In particular, risk weightings for NPAs
will be increased to 150 percent, a capital charge equivalent to 15 percent of operating revenue
will be introduced to cover operational risk, and a 100 percent weighting on Philippines external
sovereign bonds (ROPs) will be phased in over three years.

Financial transparency:
•

From end-2005, the financial statements of banks have to be prepared in line with the
International Financial Reporting Standards, which imply more rigorous valuation requirements.
Although banks will be allowed to defer recognition of losses from their NPA sales under the
SPV framework, their audited financial statements will be subject to a qualified opinion.

•

A new set of rules and standards have been issued to clarify the role of internal and external audit
functions (in November 2005 and February 2005, respectively).

1/ "Currently-identified measures" scenario assumes no new tax measures starting in 2007, but higher capital spending from 2008.
2/ Includes other percentage taxes, documentary stamp tax, and non-cash collections. These collections are also reflected as tax
expenditures under current expenditures.
3/ Excludes purchase of NPC securities and other onlending; includes capital transfers to LGUs. May exceed public investment
in years when capital transfers to LGUs exceed their reported capital spending.
4/ Includes privatization receipts as revenue and excludes the operations of the Central Bank-Board of Liquidators (CB-BOL).
5/ Excludes privatization receipts from revenue.
6/ Consolidated (net of national government debt held by the sinking fund) and excludes contingent/guaranteed debt.
7/ Nonfinancial public sector includes the national government, CB-BOL, 14 monitored government-owned enterprises, social
security institutions, and local governments. Debt is consolidated (net of intra-nonfinancial public sector holdings of debt). Data on
local government debt are not available for 2001; it is assumed that these debts were the same as a share of GDP as in 2002.
8/ Defined as the deficit, plus amortization of medium- and long-term debt, plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last
period, plus market financing on behalf of NPC.

APPENDIX I. PHILIPPINES: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The sustainability of the Philippines’ public sector debt depends on the degree to which
current reforms can be sustained and further reforms implemented:
•

Currently identified measures. The “currently identified measures” scenario
(Table 5) is considered the baseline for the Debt Sustainability Analysis (Table A1).
This scenario assumes that the recent fiscal gains are sustained, but no new measures
are introduced over the medium term. In this scenario, the nonfinancial public sector
(NFPS) debt will decline, but will remain high at over 60 percent of GDP in 2011.
The scenario assumes average real GDP growth of 5.8 percent over 2006-11 and a
gradual deterioration of the primary surplus. While the debt dynamics are favorable
overall, they remain vulnerable to shocks, especially to the exchange rate and, to a
lesser extent, growth.

•

Additional reforms. Under staff’s recommended scenario (Table 6), reforms are
assumed to continue after 2006, including full implementation of tax administration
reform, indexation of excises to inflation, and a revenue-positive rationalization of tax
incentives. In such a world, public sector debt would be placed on a steeper
downward path. This scenario assumes that primary surpluses will remain high,
improving the debt dynamics both directly and indirectly, with improved confidence
and higher private sector investment raising real GDP growth to 6½ percent.

The reduction in external vulnerabilities is largely driven by the extent to which the
National Government reduces its dependence on external financing. In the “currentlyidentified measures” scenario, external debt is envisaged to fall to about 36 percent of GDP
by 2011. As the stress tests show, the external debt trajectory is most sensitive to a sharp onetime nominal depreciation in the exchange rate (for example, if there were a shock similar to
the period in 2000-2001). Furthermore, if: (1) the current account reverts to a deficit (for
example, due to a strong shock to global growth that slows export growth and remittances),
and/or (2) the economy experiences a growth shock stronger than the standard stress tests
envisage, the external debt dynamics would look considerably less favorable.

1/ Nonfinancial public sector includes the national government, CB-BOL, 14 monitored government-owned enterprises, social security institutions, and local governments. Debt is gross
and consolidated (net of intra-nonfinancial public sector holdings of debt). Data on local government debt are not available for 2001; it is assumed that these debts were the same as
a share of GDP as in 2002.
2/ Revenue is the sum of all nonfinancial public sector revenue net of intra-public sector payments. It is assumed that 80 percent of Bureau of Treasury revenue represents interest and dividends
from other parts of the nonfinancial public sector.
3/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreigncurrency denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
6/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
7/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Exchange Arrangement:

The exchange arrangement is classified as an independent float. The value of the Philippine
peso is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market; the Bangko Sentral intervenes
in the spot and forward markets in order to smooth undue short-term fluctuations in the
exchange rate and to strategically build reserves.

41
VIII.

Article IV Consultation:

The Philippines is on the standard 12-month cycle. The 2005 Article IV Consultation was
discussed by the Executive Board on February 13, 2006. At that time, Directors commended
the authorities for steadying the economic ship after the political turbulence in mid-2005 and
for regaining momentum on their reform agenda – as evidenced by the sharp reduction in
power sector losses and the full implementation of the landmark VAT reform law. They
welcomed the large reduction in the public sector fiscal deficit in 2005. These policies have
helped to turn around investor sentiment, boost market confidence, and strengthen the peso.
IX.

FSAP and ROSC Participation:

MCM: The Philippines’ FSAP was conducted during the fourth quarter of 2001; FSAP

by the Executive Board together with the Article IV staff report in September 2002.
FAD: Discussions on fiscal transparency were held in Manila in September 2001. The ROSC
report was discussed by the Executive Board in September 2002 together with the Article IV
staff report, and published in October 2002. The update to the ROSC report was published in
June 2004.
STA: ROSC Data Module mission was conducted in September 2003, and the report was
published in August 2004.
X.

Technical Assistance:

An MCM resident banking supervision advisor has been stationed in Manila since May 2003,

the regulation and infrastructure of the domestic debt market. Another MCM visited Manila
in November 2006 to advise on liberalization of the foreign exchange market.
An STA peripatetic mission visited Manila in July–August 2003, January–February 2004,
and February–March 2005 to provide technical assistance in balance of payments and
international investment position statistics and in implementing the recommendations made
by the ROSC Data Module mission. An STA mission took place in March-April 2006 to
assist the authorities in compiling and disseminating government finance statistics in
accordance with GFSM 2001.
An FAD mission to provide a briefing to the new tax commissioner took place in April–
May 2001. An FAD mission reviewed VAT and excise administration in December 2001. An

42
FAD staff member participated in the July 2004 PPM mission to evaluate and advice on tax
measures. An FAD mission visited Manila in November-December 2005 to provide
assistance in the areas of tax and customs administration and another mission was fielded in
March 2006 to reach agreement with the authorities on the priorities of the BIR reform
agenda. An FAD tax administration advisor visited Manila in June-July 2006, the first in a
program of 8 or 9 visits to help the Tax Reform Administration Group to implement the
reform agenda.
An LEG legal expert visited Manila to discuss anti-money laundering initiatives in
March 2002.

II. PHILIPPINES: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
A. World Bank Lending and Non-Lending Activities
Since the World Bank started operations in the Philippines, it has committed approximately
$12 billion under IBRD loans and $239 million under IDA credits (less cancellations).
As of December 31, 2006, the current Philippines portfolio consisted of 24 projects,
amounting to $1.7 billion with an undisbursed balance of $1,084.02 million. During FY06,
the Bank approved three loans for a total of $410 million: National Program Support for
Basic Education ($200 million), National Program Support for Health ($110 million), and
Support for Strategic Local Development and Investment ($100 million). In FY07, a
Development Policy Loan ($250 million) was approved on December 21, 2006. Based on net
commitments and by sector, the current portfolio can be broken down as follows:
infrastructure ($499 million, 30 percent); human development ($426 million, 25 percent);
rural development ($351 million, 21 percent); social development ($100 million, 6 percent);
environment ($35 million, 2 percent); and governance and economic management
($272 million, 16 percent).
The overarching objective of the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the
Philippines is to improve the lives of Filipinos through sustainable economic growth and
greater social inclusion. Fiscal stability and public institutions that serve the common good
are critical to these objectives. The strategy supports “Islands of Good Governance” in those
government agencies, local governments, and dynamic sectors in the Philippines that
demonstrate how improved accountability and service delivery will lead to better economic
and social outcomes. The CAS seeks to align Bank lending more closely with the
government’s own investment priorities, within the existing national budget, implying a shift
away from financing discrete projects toward programmatic engagement. The approach also
encourages local government units to pursue and finance their own priorities and to foster a
better partnership with the national government.
The CAS sets forth a lending program of up to $1.8 billion for the FY06-08 period. The
actual lending level will be determined by progress on fiscal reforms and country demand.
Reflecting significant progress on the fiscal reform program, the First Development Policy
Loan (DPL) to the Philippines was approved by the Board on December 21, 2006, following
an eight-year hiatus in policy-based lending.
An important aspect of Bank support to the Philippines is in the form of non-lending
activities. These activities focus on six themes emphasized by the Bank’s current assistance
strategy: fiscal reform; growth and the investment climate; social development and inclusion,
social protection, and poverty; governance, political economy reform, and anti-corruption;
local government units, municipal finance, and fiscal decentralization; and meeting
infrastructure needs. Recent examples of non-lending outputs include a Development Policy
Review, Environment Monitor on Coastal and Marine Resource Management, Rural
Development Sector Strategic Priorities, an Investment Climate Assessment; and a report on
Meeting Infrastructure Challenges.

44

In addition to analytical work, the Bank also provides technical assistance to the Philippines,
frequently supported by trust funds such as the Institutional Development Fund (IDF) and the
Bank-managed ASEM Trust Fund.1 Also, technical assistance funded by the Policy and
Human Resource Development (PHRD) Grant Facility helps the client prepare lending
operations. In recent years, trust funds have supported studies, project preparation, capacity
building and technical assistance in such areas as: pension reform, international
competitiveness, banking supervision, procurement reform, financial management capacity,
corporate governance, community managed agrarian reform, public sector strengthening,
poverty mapping, and rural power.
The Bank has an extensive outreach program in the Philippines to promote knowledge
sharing. Currently there are ten Knowledge for Development Centers (KDCs) around the
country that make available Bank publications and development literature either through online access or through hard copies. The Bank has also partnered with the Asian Institute of
Management (AIM) to create a Global Distance Learning Network that offers distance
learning sessions for a broad national, regional, and international audience. In addition, the
Bank also maintains an external country website (www.worldbank.org.ph).
A.

Consultative Group

The Philippine Development Forum (PDF), formerly called the Consultative Group (CG), is
next scheduled to convene in March 2007 in the Philippines. The Bank will co-chair the
meeting with the Philippine Government. An innovation to the development partner
collaboration has been the formation of six working groups focused on: MDGs and social
progress; growth and investment climate; economic and fiscal reforms; governance and anticorruption; sustainable rural development; and decentralization and local government. In
addition, a Mindanao working group which was already in place was subsumed under the
PDF umbrella. These working groups each meet regularly throughout the year (in the
Philippines) to discuss key issues and reform measures related to their relevant topics.

Asia-Europe Meeting–The European Union’s Asian crisis response fund, created in April 1998; intended to
help eligible East Asian countries, including the Philippines, to recover from the regional financial crisis. The
trust fund has supported activities both in the financial/corporate and social sectors.

III. PHILIPPINES: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
In 2006, ADB extended two program loans in the aggregate amount of $650 million for
reforms in the power and financial sectors. Four technical assistance grants for $4.15 million
were approved also approved in 2006.
Since joining the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1966, the Philippines has received 197
loans for a total of $9.45 billion, and 320 technical assistance grants amounting to
$145.7 million. Forty-three percent of the loans were for projects in the energy and
agriculture sectors.
ADB’s private sector operations, which are made without government guarantee, amounted
to $516.2 million, including 16 loans of $475.3 million and 20 equity investments of
$36.8 million. The Philippines is one of the largest clients for such activities.

The ADB Country Strategy and Program for Philippines 2005–2007 (CSP) provides the
framework for ADB’s development partnership with the Philippines. The CSP benefits from
longer term considerations of the Government’s Medium-Term Philippine Development
Plan, 2005-2010 and its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The
CSP, expected to be flexibly implemented, aims to help the country reinforce its fiscal
consolidation program, while reducing poverty and regional imbalances. The CSP focus on
six thematic constraints which impair the Philippines capacity to reduce poverty more
rapidly: (1) fiscal imbalance; (2) weak investment climate; (3) inadequate infrastructure;
(4) poor management of assets, land, and resources: (5) low institutional capacity; and
(6) geographical inequalities.

47
Fiscal and macroeconomic stability. The ADB has been working jointly with the World
Bank in the preparation of a broad based policy agenda to ensure sustainability of fiscal
reforms. This is expected to be supported through program lending operations over the
medium term on an annual basis over 2007-2009. Support is also being extended under this
program for the government’s reforms to strengthen governance and anti-corruption efforts,
improve the investment climate, and extend greater support to social sectors.
Financial Sector. The ADB’s financial sector operations aim to develop a more balanced
growth of bank and non-bank financial sectors, accelerate convergence to international
standards for financial governance, and build regulatory and supervisory agencies that are
operationally and financially autonomous. In this connection, the Financial Market Reforms
and Intermediation Program (FMRIP), approved in December 2006, supports the
government’s medium term program to progressively set in place measures that (i) promote
financial deepening and strengthened intermediaries, (ii) enhance information reporting and
disclosure standards, (iii) develop securities markets and a broader investor base, (iv) reduce
systemic risk and lower transactions costs through improved settlement and payment
systems, and (v) develop greater capacity to address the legal, regulatory, financial
governance and enforcement challenges of a more open and regionally and globally
integrated economy and financial sector.
Power Sector. ADB’s involvement in the power sector commenced in 1998 with program
support for sector restructuring. Since then technical assistance and policy dialogue have
focused on establishing a conducive policy, regulatory and institutional framework;
unbundling and corporatization of the National Power Corporation; preparing for
privatization and promoting wholesale competition. A Power Sector Development Program
was approved in December 2006 with the objective of restoring the viability of the sector,
establish the necessary conditions for privatization, and ensure a smooth transition to a
competitive electricity sector.
Other sectors. ADB is also engaged in policy dialogue and technical assistance in the areas
of judicial reform and local government finance and decentralization. Major TA programs
are under way to strengthen the accountability and autonomy of the judiciary. Similarly, TA
support is being provided to strengthen the reporting, accounting and public expenditure
management systems at both central and local government levels in the context of
decentralization.

IV. PHILIPPINES: STATISTICAL ISSUES
While data provision for surveillance purposes is adequate overall, shortcomings
remain in certain areas. The Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)—
Data Module, a Response by the Authorities, and a Detailed Assessment Using the Data
Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) were published on the IMF website in
August 2004. The ROSC identified the national accounts and balance of payments statistics
as needing particular attention.
The Philippines subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) in
August 1996 and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB).
A. National Accounts
Despite the authorities’ efforts to improve quality, weaknesses remain in the national
accounts. These include large discrepancies in GDP estimates between the expenditure and
production sides (the official GDP estimates), with consequent differences in estimates of
GDP growth.
The data ROSC identified a number of causes for these problems.1
•

Deaths and births of establishments are not adequately captured. This gap is of
growing importance given the rapid structural change in the economy in recent years,
with a large number of new establishments, in particular in the electronics and
information technology industries.

•

Compilation relies on an outdated benchmark year and fixed input-output ratios.
Estimates are derived by extrapolation of the 1988 benchmark year using fixed inputoutput ratios. For example, GDP statistics for the electronic sector suggest that value
added remained at 10 percent of exports over the past years in spite of industry evidence
that the domestic component of exports has been rising sharply.2

•

Statistical techniques in estimating GDP at constant prices are inadequate. For most
activities, not all components of the production accounts are compiled, instead only value
added is estimated. Value added at current prices is calculated by extrapolating the
benchmark year value with an indicator for the value of output; data in constant prices are
estimated using a price deflator for output. In addition, the national accounts constant
price estimates for merchandise exports and imports are constructed by multiplying 1985
values by quantity data (weights) from the foreign trade statistics for current years.
Because of this inappropriate method, implicit deflators for electric machinery products
appear high compared with developments in world market prices.

1
2

Currently, the authorities are compiling new national accounts series based on the 1993 SNA guidelines.

Industry representatives indicate that the domestic component has increased significantly, to around 30 percent
in recent years.

49

The consumer price index (CPI) has been compiled since February 2004 using weights based
on the 2000 Family Income and Expenditures (FIES) survey. A notable change was that the
weight given to food, beverages and tobacco (FBT) group decreased to 50 percent in 2000
from 55 percent in 1994, the previous weight reference year.
B. Balance of Payments
Steps have been taken to improve the quality of the balance of payments. The Fund has
fielded several technical assistance missions since 1995, including the assignment of a
peripatetic advisor in 2003. In 2005, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas created a new Department
of Economic Statistics, with one of its units to concentrate on compiling, analyzing, and
publishing the balance of payments and the international investment position. There has been
important progress since 2004, including a significant improvement in the measurement of
imports to correct an underestimation of imports of electronic goods on a consignment basis,
improvements in the classification and recording of remittances, the introduction of a new
methodology for measuring trade credits, and progress in the direct investment survey. Major
revisions to the 2003-04 accounts were made in March 2005 and work to backtrack the series
to 1999 was completed in the first quarter of 2006. Data for external debt and reserves are
generally of good quality, although the data ROSC mission identified scope for
improvement.
The revisions to imports have narrowed the gap between national trade data and those
of partner countries on a net basis. An interagency task force on import statistics was
established in July 2002 to improve the measurement of activity in the electronics sector,
which accounts for about 43 percent of trade flows. Results of surveys covering electronics
sector raw material imports confirmed that imports were routinely underestimated in reports
to the NSO. Import figures have therefore been revised substantially, back to 2000.3 As a
result, the estimated trade balance for 2001 changed from a surplus of 3.8 percent of GDP to
a deficit of 8.8 percent of GDP. A comparison of the revised figures with trade data of
partner countries suggests that the revised trade balances of 2001–02 are reasonably well
measured. However, substantial differences remain with partner country data on gross flows
of exports and imports, with the latter about 15 percent higher than the corresponding
national data. The BSP is continuing research on the factors behind discrepancies in data
related to trade in processed goods, such as electronics and textiles.
Challenges remain for addressing certain compilation issues. Since deregulation in the
early 1990s, international transactions have increasingly flowed through nontraditional
channels that are not adequately covered by the statistical reporting system. The Foreign
Currency Deposit Units (FCDUs), which account for about 70–75 percent of foreign
exchange settlements, are exempt from reporting requirements because of strict secrecy
banking rules. Steps have been taken to measure cross-border transactions that skirt the

50
domestic banking system, such as flows through inter-company accounts.4 Enterprise
surveys, for example, have been introduced. But, these are conducted on a voluntary basis
and will take time to implement fully. Unless modifications are made to secrecy rules
associated with FCDU accounts to facilitate the collection of data for statistical purposes,
compilers of the balance of payments will continue to face challenges in securing adequate
source data.
C. Monetary Accounts
Compilation of monetary statistics largely conforms to the Fund’s methodology,
although there is scope for improvement. The authorities have recently made progress in
implementing some of the recommendations of the data ROSC. They have introduced the
Depository Corporations Survey, which now includes operations of thrift and rural banks.
They have also introduced uniform procedures for converting foreign currency denominated
accounts to local currency in the monetary aggregates. However, weakness remain, including
in the treatment of non-operational banks, valuation of securities, and treatment of accrued
interest. In October 2004, STA introduced standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting
monetary statistics to the IMF and requested that countries submit test data by January 2005.
However, BSP has yet to submit the data to STA.
D. Fiscal Data
While the Philippines meets the requirements of fiscal transparency in many important
respects, the fiscal and data ROSCs found areas that require strengthening. An
important problem is that the budget is presented on an obligations basis, while the deficit is
reported on a cash basis, complicating comparisons of budgets and outcomes. In addition, for
levels of the public sector beyond the budgetary central (national) government, consolidated
fiscal outturns for items other than the fiscal balance are generally unavailable. The
August 2004 GFS mission addressed shortcomings in the reconciliation of debt stocks and
financing flows and advised on improving the consolidation of debt data for the public sector
(and its subsectors). This has allowed publication of revised nonfinancial public sector debt
data since early 2005. The discrepancy between stocks and flows was further investigated
during a follow-up mission in April 2006. It was established that the problems with
reconciliation result from differences in time of recording and inconsistency in the coverage
and classification of some transactions related to debt guarantees and assumed debt. The
authorities agreed to compare the coverage of data in the two debt recording systems,
standardize the classifications of these transactions, and improve the recording of debt
transactions according to international best practice.
The introduction of a standardized chart of accounts, and the electronic New
Government Accounting System (NGAS) has facilitated the compilation of annual
financial statements for all the levels of the public sector. The accounting system allows
for the compilation of accrual based accounts and also provides for the compilation of a

Workers were not channeled through the banking system, suggesting that remittances may have been
underestimated by about US$3 billion (3.8 percent of GDP) in 2002.

51
statement of cash flows. These statements become available six months after the end of a
reference period. In addition, the mission worked with the authorities to revise classifications
in the chart of accounts, in order to allow for the consolidation of data for the nonfinancial
public sector as a whole. Also, it recommended separating the market and non-market
activities of the government-owned-and-controlled-corporations, so that consolidated data for
the general government sector could be compiled.
Annual data covering only the budgetary central government are reported for
publication in the GFSY, and monthly budgetary central government data are
published in the IFS. A dedicated unit in Department of Finance was created to compile
government finance statistics in accordance with GFSM 2001 framework.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 7, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2006 Article IV Consultation
with the Philippines
On January 19, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2006 Article IV Consultation with the Philippines based on the information
available through that date.1
Background
Impressive fiscal reforms in an environment of sustained growth and declining inflation
have strengthened market confidence in the Philippines. A large reduction in the
national government deficit was achieved in 2004 and 2005, primarily through
expenditure compression. Full implementation of the VAT reform in early 2006
broadened the national government’s adjustment effort to the revenue side, and tax
administration has proved sufficient to ensure that collections have risen as
programmed.
The economy is expected to have expanded by 5.5 percent in 2006, faster than the
5.0 percent previously projected. Private consumption has continued to be the main
driver, underpinned by rapid growth in remittances. Inflation has continued to moderate
with headline inflation in December falling within the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)
inflation target of 4-5 percent for 2006.
The national government deficit is projected to have shrunk further in 2006 and to be
significantly below the target of 2 percent of GDP. With revenue collection broadly on
target, the faster-than-expected pace of adjustment stems from the failure of Congress
to pass the 2006 Budget; as a result, the 2005 Budget was re-enacted which
constrained spending. A similar fall is expected for the non-financial public sector deficit,
reflecting consolidation at the national government level, continued improved
performance of the social security institutions, and expenditure savings by the National
Power Corporation.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2

Remittances have continued to grow strongly and the balance of payments received
additional support in the second half of 2006 from weaker oil prices. There has also
been a pick-up in foreign direct investment and a pronounced acceleration in net
portfolio inflows. Against this backdrop, the peso has appreciated against the
U.S. dollar, even as the BSP has continued to build reserves. The authorities have also
used the greater availability of foreign exchange to prepay external debt, including to the
IMF, and are shifting towards reduced reliance on external borrowing.
The key challenge for the Philippine authorities going forward is to sustain the reform
momentum, which will help maintain the confidence of markets and insure against
market volatility. On current policies, growth is expected to increase to 5.8 percent in
2007, but could be higher over the medium term on the back of additional reforms that
put public debt on a more sustainable downward path and boost investor confidence
and investment. The main downside risks to the outlook are a renewed surge in oil
prices, a slowdown in the global economy, and a sudden reversal in global risk appetite.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Philippine authorities for the substantial further
strengthening of macroeconomic performance in 2006. Growth rebounded, inflation
slowed markedly, and significant progress with fiscal consolidation boosted market
confidence, reflected in higher capital inflows and a buildup in foreign reserves. Given
this progress, Directors welcomed the early repayment by the Philippines of its
outstanding obligations to the IMF, which triggered the exit from Post-Program
Monitoring (PPM) at end-2006.
Directors underscored the need to sustain the reform momentum. Although the
economy’s resilience has improved, there are still vulnerabilities. Public debt remains
sensitive to rollover and exchange rate risks and external commercial borrowing
requirements, while declining, are still significant. As recognized by the authorities, a
sudden rise in global risk aversion could also affect the Philippines, unless confidence is
sustained through further reforms. Continued reforms are also necessary to boost
investment and growth and accelerate progress in reducing poverty.
Directors congratulated the authorities on their strong and disciplined fiscal
performance, and supported their commitment to sustain consolidation. They welcomed
the marked increase in tax collections in 2006 due to the VAT reform, but regretted that
the non-passage of the 2006 budget had constrained spending. Directors regarded
continued expenditure compression as neither desirable nor sustainable given the
country’s sizeable social and infrastructure needs. Looking ahead, they considered that
balancing the budget, while increasing priority spending, will require accelerating the
implementation of tax administration reforms, as well as new tax measures, such as a
rationalization of tax incentives. Directors also saw careful monitoring of other ongoing
public sector reforms as essential to support fiscal consolidation.
Directors pointed to the recent agreement on a long-term supply contract between the
National Power Corporation and the largest power distributor as providing a welcome
opportunity to accelerate privatization in the power sector. They saw an efficient energy
sector, together with decisive improvements in governance as set forth in the Medium-

3

Term Philippine Development Plan, as key elements of a better business and
investment climate.
Directors considered the current policy mix to deal with upward pressure on the
exchange rate to be broadly appropriate. Going forward, they urged continued exchange
rate flexibility, even though some further reserve accumulation might be justified, given
that the exchange rate does not appear to be misaligned and capital inflows could
quickly reverse. In addition, Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to shift towards
domestic financing and to prepay external debt.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ success in containing inflation, which had created
room for some monetary policy easing, and noted their continued vigilant monitoring of
inflationary pressures. In this regard, many Directors cautioned that while tiering was
introduced as a targeted and temporary approach to encourage credit growth, its reintroduction created uncertainties about the monetary policy stance and corresponded
to a significant effective easing that could render the inflation outlook less favorable.
These Directors encouraged the authorities to remove tiering, in particular should the
currently benign inflation outlook deteriorate. Some Directors, however, saw tiering as
an appropriate instrument to help address the low level of bank lending.
Directors called for further steps to strengthen the banking sector. While encouraging
progress has been made in disposing of non-performing assets (NPAs), Directors
observed that the stock of repossessed real estate assets remains large and that
solving this problem will be key to allowing the banking sector to contribute to the
investment recovery. They urged the authorities to tighten regulatory requirements on
NPAs further if disposals do not accelerate. Directors welcomed the recent consolidation
in the banking sector and efforts by banks to raise new capital, but encouraged the BSP
to maintain pressures on banks to raise new capital, while ensuring that any regulatory
relief is applied within the new framework. Directors urged the authorities to continue to
press for the passage of the long-delayed changes to the BSP Charter to strengthen
legal protection for supervisors and increase their leverage over problem-banks as
necessary conditions for a fully effective regulatory framework.
Directors commended the authorities for promoting the development of domestic capital
markets through their public debt management. They observed that legislative
initiatives, including bills to create credit information bureaus and promote retirement
saving vehicles, would usefully complement this effort.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.

liabilities. These pledged assets (gold and other securities) remain foreign reserve assets of the BSP and so are considered part of
GIR. However, they are not as readily usable as other components of GIR since pledged assets must be set aside while the shortterm liabilities they secure remain outstanding.
10/ Short-term liabilities include medium- and long-term debt due in the following year, and exclude loans backed by gold and
securities pledged as collateral.

Right of Reply Document
The authorities consider the 2006 Staff Report to be a concise account of the
developments in the Philippine economy and the policies that have been taken to bring the
economy to a higher growth path. The Authorities would like to complement the Staff
Report by issuing this statement so that developments can be better appreciated in light of
their proper context.
The Staff Report states that Philippine markets would be hard hit by a sudden rise in
global risk aversion. It should be clarified that an adverse change in market sentiment would
impact all economies, and not only the Philippines. With debt dynamics having improved
considerably, the external payments position showing considerable strengthening, and the
pace of fiscal consolidation accelerating, the Philippine economy is in fact better able to
respond more flexibly to the moods and swings of international capital markets.
The authorities consider it important that the objective of the tiering system is
properly discussed in the Staff Report. Tiering—which was reintroduced in early November
2006—applies to banks’ placements with the BSP. Its objective is to encourage banks to
perform their financial intermediation function by lending their excess funds instead of
placing the same with the BSP. The Staff Report states that while the BSP’s stated intention
behind the tiering was to promote bank lending, the initial impact seemed to have been to
take some pressure off the exchange rate. This statement could suggest that the expressed
intention is not the true intention. It is important to underscore that any impact on the
exchange rate was not directly intended and was only a consequence of banks’ portfolio
management actions. The Staff Report also states that tiering complicates the assessment of
the policy stance. On the contrary, the impact of tiering is well understood by market
participants, i.e., the banks, since they are able to determine the effective impact on their
respective placements.
Finally, the staff enjoins the authorities to ensure that monetary policy has not become too
easy. Surely, the monetary authorities will not allow monetary policy to be either too easy or too
tight. They are firmly committed to prudent monetary policy and will employ all the instruments
they have at their disposal to pre-emptively guard against inflation risks and to safeguard price
stability.

Key Points
●

The Philippines heavily focused on achieving sound public finance, an appropriate
monetary policy, a more resilient banking system, and structural reforms.

●

The strong resolve to forge ahead shored up confidence in the economy which
achieved record performances in spite of external and internal shocks that occurred
during the year. The Philippines managed to grow by an average of 5.4 percent for
the first three quarters of 2006, with the whole year growth estimate slightly higher at
5.5 percent. Inflation has declined; the budget deficit has been dramatically reduced;
reserves have reached historic levels; the exchange rate has significantly appreciated;
and the stock market has remained bullish with the index at year-end recorded at its
highest level since 1997.

●

Sustaining macroeconomic stability and shifting growth to a higher level require
continued implementation of structural reforms. High on the agenda of the
authorities are measures to further improve the fiscal, power and banking sectors.
Likewise, enhancing governance practices to improve the business environment is a
major feature of the reform program.

The Philippine economy reached a milestone on December 29, 2006 as it marked the
independence of the country from Fund financial support after 45 years of availing itself of
various Fund lending facilities. The ability to repay early reflects a stronger macroeconomy
resulting from the use of prudent monetary and fiscal policies and pushing through with
required reforms.
Turning to the Article IV report, our authorities welcome the comprehensive review by staff
as well as the productive exchange of views which paved the way for a candid assessment of
the country’s economic performance and policy considerations, as well as the challenges that
lie ahead. In particular, the selected issues paper substantiates that the policy moves taken by
the authorities were well-advised and provides further information that could guide future
decisions. The Philippine authorities are particularly appreciative of the staff advice enriched
by exposure to a wide range of policy experiences.

2
The economy has continued to grow as a result of prudent policies and reforms
Economic growth continued to be resilient, as GDP expanded by an estimated 5.5 percent in
2006, comparing favorably with 5.0 percent in 2005. Inflation quickly resumed its
downward path after the VAT increase and the fiscal deficit is expected to be significantly
below target. The external payments position has considerably improved bolstered by
substantial inflows of foreign exchange while the exchange rate has strengthened to its
highest level in almost six years. Given these conditions, the authorities have taken the
opportunity to build the country’s international reserves and improve the debt level and
structure. Buoyed by investor confidence, the stock market maintained its bullish stance with
the Phisix reaching its highest level since 1997.
Viewed against the backdrop of high international oil prices and domestic political
developments, the encouraging performance, particularly the substantial progress in the fiscal
front, attests to the authorities’ commitment to implement sound macroeconomic policies and
to pursue much-needed structural reforms. Notwithstanding the recent strong economic
performance, the authorities are well aware of the remaining vulnerabilities that need to be
addressed in order to sustain the gains achieved so far. Although oil dependence on foreign
markets has been reduced, inflationary pressures may rise should oil prices rebound. The
currently benign global environment may reverse and affect the Philippines’ accessibility to
capital markets that could create problems in the financing of its domestic requirements.
Consequently, high on the reform agenda are measures to further improve the fiscal sector,
reduce further the debt stock, strengthen the financial system, and restructure the power
sector.
Prudent monetary and external sector policies are critical to continued economic
expansion
Inflation continued its downward trajectory with headline inflation falling to 4.3 percent in
December 2006, resulting in an average inflation of 6.2 percent for the year. Recording a
decline from the 7.6 percent inflation recorded in 2005, this favorable development
transpired even as oil prices rose during the year; food prices increased resulting from natural
calamities; and as VAT-reform pressure on prices was seen to be one off and less than
expected.
The decline in inflation allowed the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to effectively ease
monetary policy by putting in place the tiering scheme in early November. The scheme is
designed to encourage greater local bank lending as opposed to banks’ placing their deposits
with the BSP.

3
The external sector dramatically improved, buoyed by robust remittances and strong exports,
despite the 8.3 percent appreciation of the peso at the P49.03/$1 average closing rate for
2006.
International reserves posted a record high at year-end, as the authorities took advantage of
the favorable external environment. At approximately $23 billion, the level of reserves
easily exceeded the target of $21 billion for the year. Assessed against international
benchmarks, the reserve level can adequately finance 4.4 months of imports of goods and
services and equivalent to 4.0 times the country’s short-term external debt based on original
maturity and 2.3 times based on residual maturity.
Likewise, the authorities took the opportunity to retire some of its debt, including the Brady
Bonds, as well as obligations to the Fund resulting in the improvement of the country’s debt
structure. The latter resulted in the Philippines’ early completion of its Post-Program
Monitoring.
Fiscal policy reforms continue, aimed at achieving earlier fiscal consolidation
Commitment to fiscal reforms led to a better-than-programmed National Government (NG)
deficit. Preliminary full year estimates of the NG deficit-to-GDP indicate a 1.03 percentage
ratio, substantially surpassing the target, due to a significant increase in revenues; reduced
spending considering the impasse over the 2006 budget and the delayed passage of the
supplemental budget which constrained the government’s ability to implement expenditure
plans; and savings in interest payments resulting from lower interest rates and volume of
issuances as well as the prepayment of debt. A similar improvement was reflected in the
financial position of other public sector entities leading to an improved consolidated public
sector deficit.
Revenues increased significantly as a result of the successful implementation of the VAT
reform. Together with improvements in tax administration, the tax effort improved to an
estimated 14.3 percent of GDP, which compares favorably with 13.0 percent of GDP in
2005. Measures undertaken by the authorities have been successful in cushioning the impact
of the tax increase on the lower income strata of the population, as indicated by staff findings
discussed in the selected issues paper. In particular, results of staff analysis based on the
2003 Family Income and Expenditure Survey suggest that the reform had a modest effect on
household budgets, with the lower income households bearing a smaller share of the tax
burden relative to income.
A more efficient tax administration is crucial to increased revenue. Towards this end, steps
taken by the authorities include cleaning the tax register and instituting a comprehensive
computerization program at the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and developing an anti-tax
evasion program. To implement reform in other areas, the authorities have sought the

4
assistance of the World Bank in the form of a tax administration loan aimed at providing a
framework for financial and technical support from other donors.
Attaining fiscal consolidation likewise entails expenditure reduction of which a major
component relates to civil service reform. With most government agencies expected to
submit their rationalization plans by year-end, the streamlining of the bureaucracy is aimed at
reining in costs and increasing public service efficiency through the abolition of overlapping
functions and closure of offices that have outlived their purposes. Reforms in other public
sector entities are proceeding vigorously to further enhance balance sheets. An important
aspect of the reform includes comprehensive reviews of the operations of government
agencies, a first step towards setting monitorable performance targets with the objective of
improving efficiency of their operations. In addition, the Department of Finance (DOF) has
intensified its campaign against graft and corruption and exerted efforts to improve the
procurement efficiency through the Government Electronic Procurement System (G-EPS).
Moving forward, staff emphasized the need for new tax measures in 2007 to keep within
fiscal targets for the year and in order not to undermine the authorities’ commitment to a
balanced budget by 2008. Recognizing the difficulty of instituting such measures in an
election year, staff inquired on the possibility of the authorities’ adopting a less ambitious
2007 deficit target, but one which continued to show the downward deficit-to-GDP trend.
Seriously committed to their goal of fiscal consolidation, however, the authorities strongly
argued to maintain their target in order not to create any misinterpretation that a relaxation in
the target deficit is an attempt to increase election spending. Moreover, the authorities felt
that a lower deficit target may lead to a slackening of efforts by those in charge of collection
operations. In addition, a less ambitious target will not help the authorities in seeking
approval for new tax measures from Congress.
Furthering the structural reform agenda to sustain macroeconomic stability and herald
the way for higher economic growth
Staff have pointed for the need to further improve the business environment. This is well
recognized by the authorities. Improved governance is thus a priority area in the country’s
Medium- Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP).
The Government has sustained its efforts to privatize assets, mainly those in the power sector
led by the National Power Corporation and the National Transmission Corporation. The
successful privatization of three hydropower plants (472MW) in 2006 indicates strong
investor confidence in the country’s energy sector, and boosts the privatization prospects
further.
The BSP is also well aware of the remaining challenges in the financial sector. Its mediumterm plan, which gives strong emphasis on financial system stability, specifically aims to

5
develop a stronger, more efficient and less vulnerable banking system that can effectively
meet the requirements of the country’s medium-term economic development program, and to
foster the development of the broader financial system through a more accelerated
development of the domestic capital market. To meet these twin objectives, the BSP
employed a four-point strategy, under which broad initiatives include the acceleration of the
adoption of risk-based supervision technology; promotion of corporate governance reform
and strengthening of market discipline through better financial transparency more
specifically through the adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS);
advancement of capital market initiatives; and further improvement in the regulatory
framework and its implementation, through alignment with Basel and other international
standards. It has worked closely with Congress to ensure passage of legislation that
addressed the high level of nonperforming assets in the financial system. It is continuing to
push for amendments to the Central Bank Act to strengthen its supervisory and regulatory
powers, including by providing legal protection for bank supervisors and facilitating closure
of problem banks. Meanwhile, the BSP’s Monetary Board approved a liability insurance
scheme for its officers and bank examiners which offers financial safeguard to BSP officials
faced with lawsuits for any act committed in relation to the performance of their duties.
Concluding Remarks
Our authorities are strongly aware of the importance of maintaining consistency and
discipline in macroeconomic policy and pursuing additional reform measures. More
importantly, they are aware of the need to initiate these additional reforms promptly.
Cognizant of the risks that may lie ahead, the authorities are determined more than ever to
pursue what remains to be done and to see the realization of the plans mapped out in the
MTPDP. Developments particularly in the first half of the year when the elections are
scheduled to take place, will be a crucial test of the administration’s will to continue moving
ahead.
The Philippines’ early repayment of its outstanding financial obligations to the Fund has
triggered the country’s exit from its post-program monitoring, four months earlier than the
scheduled termination. While this ends the country’s financial dependence on Fund
resources, our authorities intend to maintain a close working relationship with the Fund,
particularly through the regular productive exchange of views during Article IV
consultations, and Fund support to enhance technical capabilities and data systems.
