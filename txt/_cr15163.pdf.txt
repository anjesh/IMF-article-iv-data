IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Croatia

On June 24, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Croatia.
After six years of persistent recession, Croatia’s economy is showing first signs of recovery.
Robust retail sales and Value-Added Tax receipts suggest that private consumption has bottomed
out. Employment has stabilized and corporate profits are recovering. Tailwinds from a favorable
external environment have helped, notably lower energy prices, stronger euro area growth, and
ample domestic and external liquidity that contain debt servicing costs. However, stronger
exports, industrial production and foreign direct investment also suggest that the economy’s shift
from inward orientation towards the tradable sector is making progress.
This said, the economy is not yet out of the woods, with several structural impediments weighing
on the recovery. Corporate investment is still contracting, as many companies struggle with high
debt levels. State-owned enterprises continue to tie up a disproportionate part of economic
resources. Together with a chronically weak business environment and relatively high wages,
this increases the costs of operation for private corporations, complicating the strengthening of
competitiveness and the re-orientation toward markets with growth potential. Policy
uncertainty—especially high in face of parliamentary elections that are due within the next nine
months—weighs on sentiment.
In the wake of the long recession, large fiscal vulnerabilities have built up. Public debt has
increased from 35 percent of GDP in 2008 to 85 percent at end-2014, reflecting fiscal deficits
averaging almost 6.5 percent of GDP since 2009—due in part to the assumption of debts from
state-owned enterprises—and the economic contraction. At around 20 percent of GDP, public
annual gross financing needs are large.
Still, macro-economic and financial risks appear contained. The government covers more than
80 percent of financing needs from domestic sources, notably banks. Risks of capital outflows

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

and currency instability are contained by prudential regulation compelling banks to maintain
large liquidity surpluses in Croatia, the absence of foreign investors in the domestic currency
securities market—limiting the risk of a destabilizing sell-off—and thin futures markets that
render it difficult to build up positions against the kuna.
For 2015, the economy is projected to grow by 0.5 percent. Domestic demand is expected to
stagnate as two effects broadly offset one another: continued corporate balance sheet repair
constraining investment, and lower oil prices that support consumption. Net exports are expected
to make a modest positive contribution to growth. From 2016, a more robust recovery is
expected, as better corporate profits facilitate dealing with high debt levels, exports strengthen
further in line with the external environment, and the government increasingly offsets a
contractionary impulse from fiscal adjustment with absorption of European Union structural and
cohesion funds.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed signs that Croatia’s economy is recovering, supported by a
favorable external environment. Directors noted, however, that fiscal vulnerabilities, incomplete
corporate balance sheet repair, and structural weaknesses pose risks to the outlook. In particular,
they underscored that the severity of the last recession points to the need to address decisively
the entrenched rigidities that still hamper the economy’s growth potential and resilience.
Directors commended the authorities for the progress made on structural reforms, but noted that
key issues remain to be tackled. Specifically, the large and inefficient state owned enterprise
sector is in need of overhaul and the overlap between different layers of government undermines
the business climate. Directors agreed that prompt actions on these fronts should top the policy
agenda for the period ahead.
Directors welcomed Croatia’s ongoing fiscal consolidation under the European Commission’s
Excessive Deficit Procedure. They encouraged the authorities to flesh out a comprehensive
medium term plan of fiscal adjustment that focuses on growth friendly measures. In particular,
Directors recommended a shift to less distortionary taxation, including a modern property tax.
They also saw a strong case for rationalizing transfers and subsidies while protecting public
investment. Directors welcomed the adoption of EU standards for fiscal statistics, which will
allow a more accurate reflection of risks to the government’s balance sheet.
Directors considered that, in view of the prevalence of euro denominated loans, safeguarding the
kuna-euro exchange rate anchor remains without a viable alternative for monetary policy. They
underscored, however, that the quasi-peg requires adequate international reserves and a more
active use of policies to safeguard competitiveness.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors commended the central bank for maintaining financial stability through a long
recession, but stressed that continued supervisory vigilance is needed in light of the risks
associated with elevated nonperforming loans. Directors looked forward to a prompt resolution
of the issues related to Swiss franc denominated debt in a manner that would safeguard financial
and monetary stability. Addressing these vulnerabilities is also key to removing impediments to
new bank credit.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with the Republic of Croatia will be held on
the standard 12-month cycle.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Removing structural obstacles to growth. After six years of persistent contraction,
Croatia’s economy is showing signs of a tentative recovery, supported by a favorable
environment—the last economy in emerging Europe to exit the post-Lehman recession of
2008/09. Deep-seated structural factors have impeded the economy’s capacity to adjust,
many of them relating to incomplete transition of Croatia’s corporate sector toward market
orientation. While the authorities have made progress with some structural reforms in
previous years, others remain incomplete—notably reform of the bloated, inefficient stateowned enterprise sector and of Croatia’s opaque governance system, characterized by much
overlap between different layers of government. Unless addressed, these factors are bound
to weigh on activity going forward.
Restoring Fiscal Sustainability. Large fiscal vulnerabilities have built up in the wake of the
recession. In the face of high fiscal deficits and public debt, policy has started to move in the
right direction under the auspices of the European Commission’s Excessive Deficit
Procedure. However, it requires more of a long-term orientation: a comprehensive
consolidation plan should aim not only at reducing the deficit, but also at restructuring the
budget to render it more growth and employment friendly.
Safeguarding Monetary and Financial Stability. The kuna-euro exchange rate anchor
remains without viable alternative for the time being, given the high degree of loan
euroization. The banking system has remained resilient despite the drawn-out recession.
Continued supervisory vigilance is needed to preserve this record.
Previous Staff Advice. No major additional progress has been made on structural reforms
since the 2014 Article IV consultation. Fiscal consolidation has advanced gradually, although
efforts to reduce the headline deficit have been frustrated by revenue underperformance in
a deflationary environment.

Risks of capital outflows and currency instability are contained by (i) prudential

Croatia is under both the EU’s Excessive Deficit (EDP) and the Macroeconomic
Imbalances Procedures (MIP). Implementation of the EDP started in 2014. For 2015, the European
Commission (EC) has confirmed that the fiscal plan submitted in the context of Croatia’s
convergence program meets EDP requirements. As for the MIP, the EC considers Croatia to have
excessive imbalances. However it has not yet opened a formal corrective procedure, as some
progress has been made with structural reforms (see below).

Deflation. Monthly CPI inflation dropped
into negative territory in late 2013 and has
remained there for much of 2014,
reflecting mostly lower prices for imported
food and energy. With non-food, nonenergy inflation stable and nominal wages
growing slightly, there appears limited
spillover of deflation into expectations.

The banking system has remained stable, and is, on average, liquid and well-capitalized
(Figure 4). Non-performing loans (NPLs) are high at almost 17 percent, but are covered by
provisions and large capital buffers.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
Staff projects modest but positive growth for 2015, and a more robust recovery from
2016 (Table 2).


For 2015, staff projects domestic demand to stagnate, as two effects broadly offset one
another: (i) continued corporate balance sheet repair constraining investment, and
(ii) lower oil prices that support consumption—the price drop is equivalent of an annual
transfer of 0.6 percent of GDP to the Croatian economy. Despite solid growth rates, net
exports are expected to make only a modest contribution to growth, given the small
tradable sector.



From 2016, staff projects a strengthening recovery, as better corporate profits facilitate
dealing with high debt levels, exports strengthen further in line with the external
environment, and the government increasingly offsets the contractionary impulse from fiscal
adjustment with absorption of EU structural and cohesion funds. Staff forecasts that by 2018,
real growth would return to long-term potential, estimated at 1¾ percent.



Deflation is projected to persist in 2015, reflecting mainly lower prices for energy imports.
Core inflation would remain near zero.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

The current account is expected to move further into surplus in 2015 and 2016, reflecting
better exports and low commodity prices compressing the import bill (Table 3), and
triggering a relatively rapid reduction in external debt (Annex I).



9.
Risks to this forecast are substantial and, in the short term, mostly tilted to the
downside (Box 3).


Domestic political risks feature prominently ahead of parliamentary elections, with popular
but destabilizing policies a distinct possibility. This could contribute further to policy
uncertainty and depress sentiment.



Private sector balance sheet repair could drag on for longer—or end earlier—than
projected. Similarly, oil prices may rebound, and/or staff may over-/underestimate the
impact of lower oil prices on domestic demand.



The euro area economy could falter once again, harming exports and intensifying
deflationary pressures. While trade and financial linkages with Russia/Ukraine are minor, the
unsettled situation can affect the Croatian economy through sentiment. Liquidity conditions
may tighten, especially if financial stress in Europe reemerges, making financing for both the
public and private sectors more challenging. Exposure to Greece is limited, however, limiting
the risk of direct contagion from Greece-related events.

These fall into three broad categories:


policies that provide short-term support for the economy—notably debt restructuring;



policies that enhance the economy’s capacity to adjust, such as restructuring state-owned
enterprises and reducing their role in the economy; and



measures that increase long-term potential growth, such as pension reform to raise labor

11.
The drawn-out 2008–14 recession holds
important lessons (Figure 5). As most countries in the
100
region, Croatia was left by the pre-2008 boom with an
appreciated real effective exchange rate, a bloated
75
non-tradable sector (especially construction) and
impaired private sector balance sheets. As others,
50
Croatia suffered a sharp initial contraction. However, in
contrast to most peers, Croatia failed to emerge from
25
recession in 2009–11. Instead, its slump lasted a full six
years, driven primarily by a sustained contraction in
private investment. Further, and again in contrast to
peers, Croatia’s corporate sector made little progress with
balance sheet repair during this period, but instead
continued to leverage up until 2013 (Figure 6, Box 4).

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

The crisis exposed the un-sustainability of many
SOEs’ business models, forcing restructuring,
downsizing and deleveraging—or put differently, a
structural transition of Croatia’s corporate sector
from SOEs toward market orientation; a shift that in
Central Europe had typically occurred already in the
1990s. Croatia’s experience is part of a broader
pattern: contraction in real investment after 2008
correlates strongly with the degree of corporate
transition that had taken place by that time.

flexibility of working hours. The Investment Promotion Act
of 2013 aims at facilitating FDI and is showing first results. A pre-bankruptcy settlement procedure
(PBSP) introduced in 2012 helped restructure some corporate debts. Some central government
social benefits were streamlined, the regime for special pensions was tightened, and the penalty for
early retirement increased somewhat. The authorities claim that stricter government oversight of
SOE operations and restructuring has improved some SOEs’ performance.

Policy Discussion
14.
While welcoming the progress achieved, staff argued that many structural obstacles
remained and would need to be addressed forcefully.


Debt restructuring framework. The PBSP was halted in 2014 after problems arose relating
to minority creditor rights. Staff argued that the revised procedure as is currently in front of
the parliament should be passed swiftly, to allow debt restructuring to continue and to
increase legal certainty surrounding the process. The envisaged consumer bankruptcy act
should also be enacted. Judicial reform to enhance the capacity of commercial courts
remained critical.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

50

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA



State-owned enterprises. Staff noted that several problem cases persist, including the
fertilizer company Petrokemija, and the state highway and railroad companies. In many
cases—especially corporations operating in areas other than public infrastructure, and
including currently profitable SOEs—sale was the better option than restructuring, as it
would allow attracting professional expertise and overcome constraints from the public
sector’s limited administrative capacity. Meanwhile, chronic governance issues in SOEs
needed to be addressed. A positive step was the planned professionalization of SOE
management and supervisory boards, including through public tenders for executive
positions, and by holding management accountable to clear performance criteria.



Governance and business climate (Figure 7). Staff argued that red tape, especially at the
local government level, would best be addressed by comprehensive governance reform that
clearly defines municipalities’ responsibilities and regulates access to central government
funding in line with municipalities’ capacity to provide public services. As for the central
government, better coordination of regulatory activities by different line ministries and
agencies was called for. Staff emphasized that the planned rationalization of para-fiscal
charges and the envisaged reduction in state agencies were commendable steps.



Social benefits. Staff underscored that streamlining of benefits should encompass the entire
central government and extend also to the myriad of transfers granted at the local level that
often overlap with central government benefits, creating employment and poverty traps.



Pensions. Staff argued for a further increase in the penalty for early retirement—beyond
that already enacted—and reductions in privileged pensions, with a view to increase
chronically low labor market participation.

15.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s recommendations, but emphasized that the
turnaround in economic performance owed much to structural reforms already taken,
including better performance of state-owned enterprises and the investment laws that had resulted
in an increase in FDI. They noted that additional structural reforms were envisaged after the
elections, including further streamlining and rationalization of benefits. The authorities argued,
however, that another push for pension reform had to wait until the economy was stronger and the
labor market better able to absorb additional workers.

B. Restoring Fiscal Sustainability
Diagnostic
16.
The analysis of fiscal policy is at this juncture complicated by methodological changes
and shifts in the coverage of the public sector, reflecting Croatia’s adoption of the European
Union’s statistical standards (Tables 4a-c, Figure 8). While these changes should eventually greatly
improve the quality of fiscal statistics—including by reflecting fiscal risks more accurately than the

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

cash-based central government statistics used thus far—they
trigger large revisions to fiscal aggregates in the short term.1
The 2014 general government deficit is now reported at
5.7 percent of GDP—a significantly larger number than was
expected to result from these revisions—while public debt
stands at 85 percent of GDP. The widening reflects inter alia
the inclusion of additional agencies in the deficit
computation, and the calling of a state guarantee by
Croatian railroads. In terms of policies, expenditure-side
consolidation efforts in 2014 were neutralized by weak
revenue performance in the face of GDP contraction and
deflation, especially in the first half of 2014.

17.
Domestic financing is expected to be the main funding source going forward,
insulating the government somewhat from external market pressures. About 80 percent of the
central government’s funding needs are covered from domestic issuance, of which more than half
are short-term instruments such as t-bills that are mostly bought by Croatian institutional investors.
As for external funding, in early 2015 the government issued a €1.5 billion bond with 10-year
maturity at a low yield (3.3 percent), with no immediate plans for further issuance.
Policy Discussions
18.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the challenge for fiscal policy remained striking a
balance between sending a credible signal of consolidation on the one hand—even more important
now in the face of the upward revisions of government deficits and debt—and the need not to
overburden the still weak economy on the other (Box 6).


Overall adjustment need and phasing. Staff’s analysis suggests that adjustment of close to
3 percent of GDP is needed to reach a structural deficit of about 1 percent of GDP,
motivated by the general minimum balance in the EU’s fiscal framework. Stretching
adjustment over three years appears appropriate, lest to overburden the still weak economy.
In this case, the public debt ratio would peak at about 93 percent of GDP in 2017, before
embarking on a sustained downward path (Annex II). The sustainability of this path is robust
to a wide variety of shocks, including a delay in the recovery, and the drawing of additional
state guarantees. For 2015, the path applies a (net) annual adjustment need of ½-1 percent
of GDP.



Adjustment in 2015. Given the fragility of the recovery, staff advocated measures with
limited spillovers to private demand in 2015. In view of the dearth of structural expenditure
measures that could be implemented right away (i.e., without accompanying structural
reforms that require preparation), most of these should be on the revenue side, such as

1

Further revisions are likely, as by end-2015 SOEs linked to local governments will be included into the general
government. This is bound to increase reported public debt further.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

reducing exemptions from personal income tax and limiting a tax break for reinvested
corporate earnings. Better absorption of EU structural and cohesion funds would also help
mitigate the impact of consolidation.


For 2016 and beyond, staff argued that the priority was to restructure expenditures, so as
to render public spending more growth and employment friendly. In this regard, a
comprehensive approach was called for, which should be based on a recent expenditure
review conducted by the Croatian authorities. In particular, subsidies and transfers in Croatia
are higher than in comparable countries, and are often poorly targeted, while public
investment is low. Further, on the revenue side a shift to less distortionary taxation is called
for, such as introduction of a modern property tax.

19.
Against this yardstick, staff argued that the amount of fiscal adjustment contained in
the authorities’ 2015 fiscal plan was broadly appropriate, but the composition was not. The
2015 budget contains an income tax cut of about 0.6 percent of GDP (through the realignment of
tax brackets). In the 2015 convergence program submitted to the EC, part of the cut is offset by a
couple of high-quality but low-yielding revenue measures, notably higher excises for gasoline and
tobacco, and a new tax on interest earnings. But the larger portion is compensated by ad-hoc and

The authorities defended the income tax cut, arguing that it was needed to stimulate
the economy. In this context, they claimed that the improvement in private consumption thus far in
2015 owed significantly to tax relief. The authorities also defended the emphasis on expenditure
side consolidation in 2015, pointing to Croatia’s elevated level of government spending relative to
peers.
21.
Staff followed up on health sector reform, especially efforts to reign in the persistent
accumulation of arrears. Since the beginning of this year, the public health insurance fund
operates outside the central government. Staff saw fiscal risks from loosening treasury control over
health spending. The authorities underscored, however, that the health insurance fund was using the
autonomy to engage in an ambitious reform that strengthens performance incentives and increases

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

pressures on hospitals to stay within their budgets. Staff and the authorities agreed that the test for
success would be whether the envisaged reduction in health arrears materializes.

C. Maintaining Monetary and Financial Stability
22.
The central bank and staff agreed that Croatia’s long-standing quasi-peg to the euro
remains key for financial stability (Table 5). While the peg means that monetary and exchange
rate policy cannot be employed to mitigate macro-economic shocks, Croatia’s large share of foreign
currency (FX) denominated loans—about ¾—rules out unconstrained exchange rate flexibility, as
large depreciations would trigger potentially devastating contractionary balance sheet effects for

Staff encouraged the central bank to accumulate
more foreign currency reserves, as reserves remain
modest compared to standard IMF adequacy metrics.
However, staff acknowledged that related risks are
mitigated by the absence of foreign investors in kuna
securities markets—reducing the risk of destabilizing selloffs—and a tight regulatory regime that obliges banks to
maintain sizeable FX liquidity buffers as a complement to
central bank reserves (Figures 10, 11). The central bank
emphasized that it continued to accumulate reserves by
purchasing FX from external government bond issuances. In
line with the advice given in previous years, staff

The central bank argued that at a deeper level, euroization reflected distrust in a domestic monetary anchor,
following experiences with hyperinflation in the 1990s. The distrust was reflected in deposit euroization, which banks
then sought to match on the asset side of their balance sheets with FX lending. In this regard, Croatia was different
from some Central European economies, where deposits were denominated mostly in domestic currency, and loan
euroization was to benefit from carry trade (taking advantage of lower FX borrowing rates).
3

In particular, the central bank noted that upon EU entry it had to substitute one of the most effective de-euroization
measures—higher risk weights for unhedged borrowers—with a less efficient alternative—capital buffers as
permitted under the second pillar of Basel II. The central bank also underscored that other measures remained in
effect, such as FX liquidity buffers, information requirements on currency risks to borrowers, and guidelines for banks
on managing risks from FX exposures to unhedged borrowers.

encouraged the central bank to consider alternative means for accumulating reserves, especially as
opportunities to obtain FX from the government may become less frequent as fiscal consolidation
advances.
24.
The banking system has remained stable, and is, on average, liquid and wellcapitalized (Table 6). Staff argued that continued supervisory vigilance was needed to preserve this
record.


NPLs. While non-performing loans (NPLs) are high at almost 17 percent, banks’ large capital
buffers and provisions contain risks to financial stability (Box 8). Some pockets of
vulnerability in smaller banks are addressed in the context of standard supervisory
operations. Still, staff argued—and the authorities agreed—that clearing out NPLs at a faster
pace was desirable, not least to allow borrowers a fresh start. To this end, staff
recommended forming a task force with representatives from tax authorities, the accounting
and legal professions, banks, and regulators that should seek to identify and remove
possible obstacles to NPL write-offs and sales.



State development bank. In line with a recent EC recommendation, staff proposed tighter
supervision of the state development bank HBOR, in particular with respect to loan
classification. The central bank was reluctant to step in as a supervisor, however, claiming
that supervision of an institution that was not a credit institution went beyond its mandate.

25.
Staff warned against potentially destabilizing steps in reaction to the Swiss Franc
(CHF) appreciation in early 2015 (Box 9). The appreciation has affected a sizeable portion of
borrowers indebted in CHF, especially for mortgages. In response, the government froze the
applicable kuna/CHF exchange rate for one year, during which creditors and debtors are supposed
to seek a permanent solution (see the Informational Annex for details). Staff urged negotiations to
proceed swiftly, as the unsettled situation produces policy uncertainty. Further, staff advocated that
negotiations should focus on needy borrowers that lack capacity to pay; according to Central Bank
estimates about one-quarter of CHF borrowers owing about 5 percent of CHF debt. By contrast,
across-the-board bailouts should be avoided, as (i) any such solution would result in a de facto
conversion of CHF loans into kuna, putting pressure on already modest FX reserves, and (ii) relief to
non-needy borrowers in response to political pressure could generate a perilous perception that
politicization was a means of avoiding contractual obligations. Staff discussed this issue with various
stakeholders. While most counterparts agreed with staff in principle, they emphasized that in a preelection environment, finding differentiated solutions may be difficult.

STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Croatia’s economy appears to have entered a tentative recovery, allowing for cautious
optimism that much overdue relief for Croatian households may finally be on its way. The return to
sustained growth is not yet assured, however: the exceptionally favorable external environment may
not last; and the continued contraction in private investment suggests that the process of corporate
balance sheet repair is not yet complete.
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

27.
The depth and unusual length of Croatia’s 2008–14 slump is troubling, however, and
points to deep-seated structural factors that impede the economy’s capacity to adjust. Many
of these impediments relate to incomplete transition of Croatia’s corporate sector toward market
orientation, as evidenced by the continued large role of SOEs in the economy. The recession
exposed that corporate structure to be unsustainable, setting in motion a transition of the corporate
sector away from SOEs toward competitive markets that in many transition countries occurred
already in the 1990s.
28.
The authorities have made progress with some structural reforms, but have shied away
from tackling some of the most critical issues in the face of well-organized vested interests. Key
unfinished reforms relate in particular to state-owned enterprises and to Croatia’s governance
structure. The latter is characterized by much overlap between different layers of government
(central government ministries, state agencies, and local governments), giving rise to lack of
transparency and red tape, and undermining Croatia’s business climate. While major progress in
these areas is unlikely prior to the parliamentary elections, these issues should be tackled forcefully
thereafter.
29.
Fiscal policy has started to move in the right direction under the auspices of the EC’s
Excessive Deficit Procedure, but requires more of a long-term orientation. Efforts at gradually
reducing the deficit are continuing, even though the ad-hoc nature of adjustment in 2015 is suboptimal. Looking ahead, a comprehensive consolidation plan is needed that aims not only at
reducing the deficit, but also at restructuring the budget to render it more growth and employment
friendly. On the revenue side, a shift to less distortionary taxes is called for, such as a modern
property tax. On the expenditure side, there is a strong case for reducing unproductive transfers and
subsidies—areas where Croatia overspends substantially relative to peers—while preserving public
investment. An expenditure review that the government conducted in early 2015 provides a helpful
basis for such an endeavor, and should be published. The shift to EU statistical standards should
eventually lead to a significant improvement in the quality of fiscal statistics, reflecting risks to the
government’s balance sheet more accurately than the previously used central government cash
concept.
30.
The focus of monetary policy on financial stability is adequate. Given the high degree of
euroization, the kuna-euro exchange rate anchor remains without viable alternative for the time
being—though it implies more pressure on structural and income policies to adjust in the face of
shocks. Supervisory policies have been successful in maintaining banking system stability despite the
drawn out recession—an impressive achievement. Continued vigilance is needed to preserve this
record. However, the debate surrounding the revaluation of CHF loans harbors potential for
undermining financial stability, especially if the call for de-facto currency conversion would gain
traction, as such a step would undermine an already modest FX reserves position.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Croatia be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Economic Policy Uncertainty
Economic policy uncertainty can affect economic outcomes by changing expectations. For example, policy
uncertainty may incline companies and households to reduce debt and build precautionary balances instead
of investing and consuming. Economic policy uncertainty has many dimensions, including: uncertainty
about: (i) who will be in power; (ii) the policies to be implemented; and, (iii) the quality of these policies.
To provide a measure for this concept, Baker, Bloom and Davis (BBD, 2013) 1 have developed an economic
policy uncertainty index (EPUI). Their news-based EPUI for Europe can be used as a proxy for global and
regional uncertainty, but there is no established EPUI yet for Croatia. To fill the gap, staff has compiled a
simplified news-based EPUI index based on BBD’s methodology. The index counts the monthly frequency of

Further, from 2013 the Croatian and the European EPUI index diverge: the Croatian index has increased,
while the European index has moderated. While reasoning about forces behind economic policy uncertainty
is to some degree speculative, a survey among foreign investors 2 suggests that uncertainty is fueled by the
lack of legal certainty, frequent and unexpected changes in legislation, incomplete implementation of EU
acquis, unclear responses to requests for clarifications from tax authorities, etc.

Box 2. Potential Growth and Output Gap
Traditional statistical methods of separating cyclical fluctuations from trend growth yield misleading results
when applied to non-cyclical phenomena, such as Croatia’s drawn-out balance sheet recession. Standard
tools like the popular Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter tend to underestimate the length of the recession. As one
implication, potential (or trend) growth converges toward actual growth so as to close the output gap within
the standard length of a business cycle. The “production function” approach to de-trending—which filters
GDP components rather than GDP—suffers from similar shortcomings.
To remedy this shortcoming, staff experimented with a Bayesian filter developed in-house and oriented on
Borio et. al. (2014).1 It incorporates financial information into the filtering procedure—in this case house
prices and credit growth. Depressed house prices/credit growth signal that GDP remains below potential.
The Bayesian filter shows a far smaller decline in potential growth post-2008, and, consequently, a larger
output gap. This has inter alia implications for the estimated fiscal effort during recession: with the Bayesian
filter, fiscal effort is substantially larger.

Potential GDP used in the macro-framework complements the Bayesian approach by some judgment. It
shows negative total factor productivity growth already before the 2008/09 crisis, reflecting that much of the
pre-crisis investment boom was concentrated in the non-tradable sector, especially real estate.

surrounding the baseline ("low" is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, "medium" a probability between 10 and
30 percent, and "high" a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks at the time of

i.e., the deviation of debt from its long-run relationship with GDP per capita, interest rates, etc.2 The study
suggests that at end-2013, Croatian private sector debt was some 20 percent of GDP above its
fundamentals-consistent value. Another finding is that corporations operating in rigid labor markets—such
as Croatia’s—are more likely to adjust to falling revenues by cutting investment.
Firm-level data show that corporate debt distress—
defined as debt-to-income and/or debt-to-equity
ratios above long-term averages—is widespread across
sectors (Figure). Especially in whole and retail sales,
construction, real estate, and market services, corporate
leverage appears excessive. Further, exporters tend to
do better than firms in the non-tradable sector, a
finding that is consistent with a recent World Bank
study.3 This suggests that the small size of Croatia’s
export sector has been a hindrance for normalizing
corporate leverage, prolonging the recession.

Box 5. State-Owned Enterprises
State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) continue to play a large role in Croatia’s economy. At end-2013, SOEs
accounted for 18 percent of non-financial corporate (NFC) employment and administrated more than onethird of NFC assets. The average SOE employs more than 10 times more workers than private enterprises
and is highly unionized. Given Croatia’s uncoordinated and decentralized wage bargaining system, this
grants SOE unions much influence over labor
conditions in the entire economy (EU, 2015).
Nestic et. al. (2014) find that wages in SOEs
are 20 percent higher than in the private
sector, and 7 percent when controlling for

strategically important SOEs with 80,124 employees. Several are loss-makers and receive subsidies,
particularly in the transport sector, while profitable SOEs are mainly energy firms and the state lottery. The
Center for Restructuring and Sale manages stakes in 538 other companies owned by the central government
with 5,711 employees (October 2014). Subsidiaries of SOEs and SOEs attached to local governments are
without central oversight. Efforts to restructure and privatize loss-making SOEs have advanced at a slow
pace: Croatia’s shipyards and the majority of Croatian Insurance is now in private hands; but attempts to
privatize the Postal Bank, Croatian Airlines, and the Cargo Railway Company failed.
Comparable cross-country data on SOEs are hard to come by, but the EBRD transition indicators provide
some insight. The depth and length of the slump in investment following the 2008/09 crisis correlates
strongly with the degree of transition from a centralized to a market-based non-financial corporate sector.
While far from conclusive, the evidence is consistent with SOEs hampering corporate adjustment and
delaying the recovery.

Box 6. Fiscal Adjustment and Domestic Demand
Fiscal policy has not followed a clear path since the
onset of the crisis in 2008. Between 2008–11, the
cumulative fiscal impulse was negative, indicating a
slightly expansionary stance. However, fiscal policy
tightened afterwards, especially sharply in 2012.
This raises the question to what extent Croatia’s
poor growth performance since 2008 is related to
fiscal policy.

This said, the correlation between the fiscal policy

2011–14. This is in line with findings in the
literature that fiscal multipliers increase with the

Box 7. Real Exchange Rate Assessment and Competitiveness
Most methods suggest modest overvaluation of Croatia’s real effective exchange rate (REER). The
macroeconomic balance approach under the CGER methodology—that compares staff’s projected current
account with a current account norm—suggests overvaluation by 3.7 percent. Similarly, the external
sustainability approach—that compares Croatia’s
Assessment of Croatia's Real Exchange Rate

projected net foreign asset position with a sustainable
level, and computes the REER revaluation needed for
this—signals overvaluation of about 3 percent. The
equilibrium exchange rate approach lacks robustness
to the inclusion of different explanatory variables (such
as the current and lagged NFA position) and hence

delivers a wide range of estimates.

With the EBA-lite methodology, overvaluation is estimated at 5 percent. EBA-lite estimates a country’s CA
norm based on economic fundamentals (similar to the MB approach), cyclical factors, and desirable mediumterm policy levels. The present-year current account is adjusted for temporary factors, in particular import
compression in response to extraordinarily weak demand while Croatia’s private sector draws down excess
debt levels. Exchange rate misalignment is defined as the adjustment necessary to bring the current account
back to its norm.
A simple measure comparing Croatia’s unit real labor cost (ULC) with peers points to even higher
overvaluation of around 10 percent. It is unclear, however, to what extent this differential reflects misalignment, and to what extent an unfavorable real equilibrium outcome due to high reservation wages (inter
alia from the tourism sector). The measure also suggests that Croatia has made some progress in reducing
its ULC-malus in recent years.
Croatia’s export market share has developed unfavorably in recent years, although this is mostly due to weak
growth of trading partners (Italy, Slovenia, Bosnia—see the 2014 Article IV report).

Loans denominated in or indexed to Swiss francs became popular during the 2000s in Emerging Europe,
providing a cheaper alternative to euro or domestic currency loans. CHF loans were extended mostly to
households, especially for mortgages, and typically to wealthier clients. Until recently, CHF loans were most
wide-spread in Hungary, followed by Poland and Croatia, although Hungary converted most CHF loans to
domestic currency, effective November 2014.1

CHF loans came under scrutiny when the franc
began to appreciate in 2009. In 2010, Croatian
borrowers set up an NGO—called Franak—that
initiated a collective action lawsuit, claiming
banks had mis-informed about currency and
interest risk. A first level court ruled in favor of
Franak, but in July 2014, the High Commerce
Court dismissed the currency complaint. It
upheld the interest complaint, but it is unclear
how borrowers would be compensated. These
rulings were confirmed in May 2015 by the
Supreme Court. Further, in 2014 the government
imposed interest ceilings on CHF loans.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e =
nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP
deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection
year.

Annex II. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt stood at 85 percent of GDP at end-2014. Gross financing needs are high at about
20 percent of GDP, reflecting mostly rollover of existing debt. Under the baseline, debt will stabilize
at around 90 percent of GDP in the medium term. However, this projection is vulnerable to growth
prospects turning out less favorable than expected.
Baseline and Realism of Projections
The baseline assumes implementation of fiscal policies as envisaged in 2015 Convergence
Program, and thereafter adjustment broadly consistent with the EC’s Excessive Deficit
Procedure (EDP) until the headline deficit is below 3 percent of GDP.


Fiscal consolidation: Preliminary data put the 2014 general government deficit at 5.7 percent
of GDP. The deficit is projected at slightly above 5 percent of GDP in 2015 declining to
4½ percent of GDP in 2016.



Growth: real GDP growth shows signs of recovery in 2014Q4, though the economy
contracted by 0.4 percent for the whole year. Going forward, the economy is expected to
gradually regain momentum, converging to a long-term real growth rate of about
1¾ percent.

Risks to the baseline are tilted to the downside.


Croatia’s real GDP growth forecast has been optimistic since 2009—reflecting mostly
premature expectations of recovery—and the median forecast error is in the top decile of
surveillance countries with market access. This points to a need for growth shocks in the
stress tests.



The 3-year adjustment of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance in Croatia is moderate
relative to the historical experience for high-debt market access countries. While the EDP
provides a much needed anchor for fiscal adjustment, there are risks that it may not be
implemented as foreseen. This may lead to better growth in the short-term, but
continuously rising public debt and concern about fiscal sustainability would likely
undermine confidence and increase country risk (see alternative scenarios).

There are risks to debt sustainability. Staff projects that the debt-to-GDP ratio will increase to
nearly 93 percent in 2017 before starting to decline after 2018. This deterioration mainly reflects a
positive interest rate-growth differential and still wide deficits in the near term. Gross financing
needs stay elevated and are projected at 21 percent of GDP in 2020, due to large fiscal deficits
accumulated since 2009 and the relatively short maturity of public debt (around five years).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

Shocks and Stress Tests
Slower output growth is the main risk to debt sustainability. Underperformance of real GDP
growth by one standard deviation in 2016 and 2017 would lead to a deterioration of the primary
balance, as nominal revenues fall against unchanged spending. The primary deficit would
deteriorate to close to 5 percent of GDP in 2017 before improving over the medium-term. The
worse primary balance leads to a slight increase in risk premiums and a sharp increase in public
debt, which stabilizes at almost 110 percent of GDP after 2017. Gross financing needs also rise to
around 25 percent of GDP in 2016–2017.
A combination of macro-fiscal shocks further highlights the sensibility of public debt and
gross financing needs to adverse scenarios. Assuming that shocks to real GDP growth, the
primary balance, real exchange rate, and real interest rate occur simultaneously, public debt would
increase sharply and stabilize above 119 percent of GDP. Gross financing needs would approach
30 percent of GDP in 2020.

When a member has overdue financial obligations outstanding for more than three
months, the amount of such arrears will be shown in this section.
Exchange Rate Arrangement:
In December 1991, Croatia adopted the Croatian dinar as its sole legal tender. The Croatian
dinar was replaced by the Croatian kuna on May 30, 1994. The exchange rate of the kuna is
determined by supply and demand in the interbank market, with tight management of the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

kuna-euro exchange rate by the Croatian National Bank (CNB). Croatia’s de jure exchange
rate is a managed float without a predetermined path. Croatia’s de facto exchange rate
arrangement is classified as a crawl like arrangement from April 30, 2011. The CNB transacts
only in euros, U.S. dollars, and SDRs. On May 19, 2015, the official exchange rate was kuna
7.537332 per euro (middle rate).
Exchange Restrictions:
Croatia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2–4 and maintains an exchange
system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions, except for restrictions that Croatia maintains solely for the preservation of
national or international security that have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive
Board Decision 144 (52/51).1
Article IV Consultation:
The previous Article IV consultation with Croatia was concluded on May 14, 2014 (IMF
Country Report No. 14/124: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=41565.0).
Croatia is on the 12-month consultation cycle.
FSAP:
An FSAP Update mission took place in October–November 2007. The FSSA Update was
published (IMF Country Report No. 160: http://www.imf.org/external/country/hrv/index.htm).
The original FSAP was concluded with the completion of the 2002 Article IV consultation on
August 5, 2002 on the basis of missions that took place in April 2001 and September 2001.
The FSSA was published (IMF Country Report No. 02/180).

On January 23, 2015, the Croatian Parliament amended the Consumer Credit Act, temporarily freezing for one year
the HRK/CHF exchange rate for interest and installment payments on consumer loans indexed to or denominated in
Swiss Francs. The Croatian National Bank informed Fund staff that interest and installment payments of CHFdenominated loans are always made in kuna, and accordingly that the frozen exchange rate is used only for
accounting purposes and not for actual foreign exchange transactions. Accordingly, staff does not find this
amendment to give rise to a multiple currency practice subject to Article VIII, Section 3.

WORLD BANK RELATIONS
1.
The World Bank’s Board endorsed the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Croatia for
fiscal years (FY) 2014–17 in June 2013, with the goal to assist Croatia's convergence with the EU
through an engagement that is focused on key reform-based outcomes. For the World Bank Group
(WBG), priority will be placed on aspects of the Europe 2020 “smart, sustainable and inclusive
growth” strategy; and the government’s new reform agenda that focuses on the economic
management, state institutions, business environment, and responsibility toward shared regional
assets. In pursuing these goals, the WBG program aims at contributing in the following three areas:


Fiscal adjustment through reforms at the sector level;



Innovation and trade competitiveness for growth and shared prosperity; and,



Helping maximize the economic benefits of becoming an EU member state.

2.
The CPS envisages an indicative base-case lending envelope of about US$800 million. For
the FY14–17 lending program, DPLs will continue to play an important role based on the need to
combine policy reform with budget finance. At the same time, Croatia and the Bank, explored the
use of new investment financing instruments like results-based operations, as the share of
traditional investment financing should decrease during the CPS period. The lending program has
been based on and complemented by analytical work, particularly in the areas of public expenditure
reform, governance, EU preparedness, investment climate, higher education, and trade
competitiveness.
3.
In FY14, the Bank’s Board approved two loans and one grant amounting to US$315 million,
including the Second Economic Recovery DPL (EUR150 million in April 2014), Health System and
Quality Efficiency Improvement Program-for-Results (EUR75 million in May 2014), and GEF Adriatic
Sea Environmental Pollution Control Project (US$4.3 million in June 2014). Projects delivered or
under preparation for FY15–16 are Social Protection System Modernization Project (EUR70 million in
September 2014), Sustainable Croatian Railways in Europe (EUR163.5 million in April 2015), and
Innovation and Entrepreneurship Venture Capital (EUR20 million scheduled for the Board in July
2015). Currently, the World Bank finances 13 operations in a wide range of sectors with a
commitment of about US$1083 million. In FY14, IFC invested US$142 million in Croatia. IFC’s
investments have financed projects across a variety of sectors including in the financial sector,
renewable energy, infrastructure, agribusiness, life sciences, and general manufacturing. Across all
sectors, IFC prioritizes investment in Croatia’s less-developed regions and in projects that contribute
to greater economic diversification and regional integration. MIGA's outstanding gross exposure in
Croatia as of June 30, 2014 was US$976 million in support of financial institutions and a retail sector.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Croatia—Statistical Issues
(As of April 30, 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, with shortcomings related to data
coverage and reliability, especially for national and fiscal accounts. Progress to resolve these
shortcomings are impeded by insufficient resources and a lack of coordination among government
agencies.
National Accounts: The national accounts have undergone substantial improvements in recent years.
The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) publishes constant and current price data compiled in
accordance with the ESA 2010 standard. However, a breakdown of gross fixed capital formation into
private and public components is not yet published. Quarterly GDP estimates are disseminated at
current prices and at prices of the previous year for the main categories of expenditures and main
economic activities. Nonetheless, shortcomings remain. Discrepancies exist between expenditurebased and value-added-based GDP data, stemming from: (i) incomplete coverage of unincorporated
businesses and the self-employed (farmers, traders, and craftsmen); (ii) inadequate data for
measuring changes in inventories; (iii) incomplete coverage of the informal sector; and (iv) a lack of
quarterly data for the seasonally volatile agricultural sector.
Wages and Employment: The CBS produces data on average net and gross earnings per person and
employment by sector. Currently, the CBS is in the process of reviewing the data series.
Earnings data include bonuses (in sums that are subjects to contributions, taxes, and surtaxes), sick
pay, and meal allowances. They are based on monthly surveys covering 70 percent of workers in
permanent employment in each division of NKD 2007 (NACE Rev. 2). They do not cover a significant
part of the working population, including persons employed in trade and crafts, contract workers, and
farmers.
The number of registered unemployed overstates the actual level of unemployment. However, the
discrepancy has significantly diminished in 2014. A preliminary Labor Force Survey, which meets ILO
standards, was conducted for the first time in 1996 on 7,200 households. The sample was
subsequently expanded and the survey is now being conducted on a regular basis. Semi-annual
results have been released since 1998, and quarterly results since 2007, with a lag of about four
months.
Price Statistics: The CBS produces a monthly consumer price index, with expenditure weights
(updated every five years) derived from a Household Budget Survey. Between rebasing, the weights
are price-updated annually to December of the previous year. Data are collected at different time
periods in the month for different product groups, but in most cases between the thirteenth and the
twenty-third day of each month. (Prices of agricultural products sold in market places are recorded on
the first and third Friday in a month and prices of fuel for passenger cars weekly.) The indices are
released around the fifteenth day of the following month. The price collection is confined to nine
towns, but the weights are based on a sample of households in the whole country.

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

Croatia—Statistical Issues (Continued)
(As of April 30, 2015)
A harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) is also calculated in line with Eurostat methodology.
A core CPI is calculated based on a methodology developed by the Croatian National Bank (CNB).
The CBS also releases a monthly producer price index (PPI), usually on the eighth day of the following
month. The weighting system of the PPI is based on the 2000 Annual Report of Industry and is
changed every five years, while weights are partially corrected every year.
Government Finance Statistics: The authorities have started presenting some budget plans based
on the ESA 2010 framework. However, the State Budget and the local budgets are based on the
national Chart of Accounts. Historical general government data based on ESA 2010 definitions are
published nationally by the Croatian Bureau of Statistics and by Eurostat, but are frequently revised
due to methodological and data source improvements. Additional analysis has been initiated in order
to assess whether some enterprises owned by local government units should be included in the
government sector according to the ESA 2010 criteria.
Budget execution (cash) data are produced on a monthly basis on the GFSM framework (GFS 2001)
and are available in the Monthly Statistical Review of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and in the timeseries database, both published on the website of the MOF. Central government data normally come
with a lag of about six weeks, but end-of-year data often with much longer lags. Revenue data are
reliable, and expenditure data on a cash basis are available according to GFS classifications (economic
and functional) for the central budget and extra-budgetary funds. However, changes of institutions
included in the central government are not always clearly indicated, hence central government figures
are not fully comparable over time.
Cash data for the operations of local governments and the consolidated general government are
available on a quarterly basis, but for end-of-year data with long lags. Local government data are
partial, as they only include the operations of the 53 largest units (20 counties, the City of Zagreb, and
32 largest cities). Cash data reporting will be abolished in 2015, and a modified accrual concept will
be applied instead. The coverage of local governments is going to be extended to all 576 local units
and 20 local extra-budgetary users (county road authorities).
According to the latest Agreement on cooperation in the field of national accounts of general
government and related statistics (signed on July 31, 2013 between the Croatian Bureau of Statistics,
Croatian National Bank (CNB), and Ministry of Finance), the CNB took over the responsibility for the
compilation of general government debt statistics. The CNB is compiling general government debt
according to ESA 2010 and EDP definitions and publishes these data in the CNB Monthly Bulletin.
Data showing the level of central government guaranteed debt are presented as a part of the
reporting table in the CNB Monthly Bulletin.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Beginning 2015, the CNB has started published monetary
statistics using the ESA 2010 framework, with some backward revisions of historical data series. Since
June 2013, the IMF’s Statistics Department receives monetary statistics on Croatia directly from the
European Central Bank.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

Croatia—Statistical Issues (Continued)
(As of April 30, 2015)
Previously, the CNB compiled and reported monetary data for publication in International Financial
Statistics (IFS) in accordance with the 1995 ESA standards and the European Central Bank’s framework
for monetary statistics using the national residency approach. For December 2001 to June 2013,
monetary statistics in IFS were based on the Standardized Report Forms developed by the IMF’s
Statistics Department, in accordance with the concepts and definitions in the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual, 2000. For December 2010 through June 2013, the CNB has reported revised data for
other depository corporations covering money market funds in addition to the licensed banks,
savings banks, and housing savings banks, which represent other monetary financial institutions in
accordance with the 1995 ESA standards.
Financial Sector Surveillance: The CNB is the banking supervisor and publishes selected financial
soundness indicators (FSI) on its website, reports to the IMF’s Financial Soundness Indicator Database,
and provides IMF staff with a broad range of FSIs. A general description of the stress testing
methodologies used on the Croatian banking system is included in the Financial Stability Report,
published by the CNB twice a year. Summary balance sheets and profit and loss statements of
individual banks are reported in the Banking Bulletin, published twice a year, with a lag of six to nine
months.
The Croatian Financial Services Supervisory Agency (HANFA) publishes monthly reports and monthly
summary statistics on the sectors it regulates and supervises (capital markets, investment funds,
private pension sector, insurance, leasing, and factoring companies).
External Sector Statistics: Quarterly balance of payments and international investment position data
are compiled broadly in accordance with the sixth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual
(BPM6). Data are generally available with a lag of three months and are subject to revisions in
subsequent releases. Net errors and omissions have ranged from 1 to 3½ percent of GDP since 2005,
and are negative. The coverage and quality of portfolio investment data are reasonably complete and
accurate.
Croatia participates in the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) and plans to participate in the
Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) after the new security database becomes operational
toward the end of 2015. Data on the International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity (Reserve
Data Template) are available with a lag of one to two months.
Croatia compiles external debt data according to the requirements of External Debt Statistics: Guide
for Compilers and Users, 2013.

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director for Republic of Croatia
and Andrijana Cudina, Advisor to Executive Director
June 24, 2015
The Croatian authorities thank staff for very constructive policy discussions and their
insightful analysis, with which they broadly agree. They believe that staff’s report rightly
recognizes recent positive developments in the country, but also raises awareness about the
fiscal vulnerabilities and remaining structural challenges. Despite the uncertainty ahead of
parliamentary elections the authorities are keeping pace with reforms to address these
challenges and accelerate the rebalancing of the economy.
Economic developments and outlook
After six years of recession, the Croatian economy has entered into positive territory at the
turn of last year. The pace of economic contraction abated already in the second half of 2014
and the positive developments continued into the first quarter of 2015. However, the
recovery is still very delicate as it mostly relies on external factors, primarily low energy
prices, favorable financing conditions and stronger euro area growth. The internal demand is
still very weak as the corporate sector debt overhang and balance sheet repair continue to
weigh on investments. Private consumption, however, has picked up reflecting not only the
lower oil prices, but also the income tax relief that was introduced at the beginning of the
year. According to the latest labor market indicators it seems that the fall in employment is
also bottoming out. CPI inflation has moved back into positive territory, partly on account of
consumer food prices and the depreciation against the US dollar, which has mitigated the
impact of low oil prices.
Looking ahead, the authorities assume that the growth will continue and further strengthen in
2016. Like staff, they also see that the additional fiscal consolidation, needed to bring the
public debt under control, will continue to be a drag on growth. On the other hand, the
external demand will remain strong and the contribution from domestic demand could also
become marginally positive, if trends in private consumption continue and EU funds spur the
recovery of investments. The authorities anticipate that the rebound in energy prices could
push inflation higher, although it will remain well below its long-term average. The pick-up
of growth is set to bring about a gradual reduction in unemployment. However, the risks to
the outlook are substantial and tilted to the downside, especially in light of possible adoption
of additional fiscal consolidation measures, worsening of the external environment and
suboptimal use of EU funds.
Fiscal policy
The authorities share staff’s concerns about the fiscal vulnerabilities that have built up during
the recession. In a difficult environment of economic contraction and low inflation, they have
pursued fiscal consolidation in order to set the deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2017 and
stabilize the public debt trajectory. Moreover, the fiscal effort of 2.5 percent of GDP
achieved in 2014 was somewhat stronger than the requirements under the Excessive Deficit

2
Procedure (EDP). However, despite these efforts, the general government deficit ended at
5.7 percent of GDP, much above the projected level, as revenues underperformed but also as
the coverage was broadened with the adoption of European ESA 2010 accounting standards.
These methodological changes affected the level of public debt, which reached 85 percent of
GDP at end-2014.
In light of these developments, the authorities have reinforced their consolidation efforts for
2015. The Convergence Program that was submitted to the European Commission in April
anticipates a fiscal effort of 1.5 percent of GDP, aiming for headline deficit of 5.0 percent of
GDP. The European Commission has assessed that the proposed measures would probably
yield a somewhat smaller structural adjustment, but has nevertheless confirmed that due to an
over-achieving effort in 2014, the cumulative fiscal effort over 2014–2015 meets the target
implied by the EDP requirements. The focus of consolidation in 2015 would be more on the
expenditure than on the revenue side. Significant savings across different categories of
expenditures, including subsidies and transfers, as well as across different levels of
government, are expected. Capital investments, especially in the health sector, would also be
rationalized and oriented more towards EU funding. The government plans to boost revenues
mainly by withdrawing profits from SOEs, but also through increased excise taxes on
tobacco and gasoline, and a recently introduced tax on interest earnings.
The fiscal consolidation in 2016 will focus on further rationalization of current spending to
provide sufficient space for growth-enhancing expenditures. Tax compliance would be
further enhanced, especially through strengthening of the tax administration. Regarding the
property tax, the government will focus on the harmonization and better collection of local
communal fees. More broadly, the consolidation process in the coming period will be
underpinned by improvements in budget planning and expenditure control, as well as through
strengthening of fiscal rules. In the authorities’ views, the implementation risks to their
consolidation plan are relatively contained, especially given the realism in growth and
revenue projections, and their engagement in the enforcement of savings. Risks stemming
from the accumulation of arrears in the health sector are also being addressed through
comprehensive reforms, including tighter cost control and a new management model.
Monetary policy and financial system
In the context of widespread euroization and sizable foreign currency exposure of both
private and public sector, maintaining exchange rate stability is instrumental in preserving
both macroeconomic and financial stability. The monetary authorities remain strongly
committed to this goal, as the contractionary impulse from a revaluation of FX-indexed debts
and its impact on the financial system would outweigh any stimulus for the tradable sector.
While preserving exchange rate stability, the monetary policy has maintained its
accommodative stance, creating favorable financing conditions and supporting the credit
activity.
Mainly thanks to sound macro-prudential regulation the banking sector has been coping well
with the prolonged recession. The banks are well-capitalized, with an adequacy ratio over
21 percent, much above the required minimum. Their profitability has also improved over the

3
last year, and NPLs have stabilized at around 17 percent. However, a weak macroeconomic
outlook and uncertainty over the outcome of negotiations related to Swiss Franc-indexed
loans remain the most important risks for the performance of the banking system. Against
this background, the authorities are actively engaged in finding a socially acceptable solution
which would not jeopardize the financial stability and legal certainty.
The existing external vulnerabilities require adequate reserve buffers and the authorities
continue to be dedicated to enhance them. In the authorities’ view the current level of
reserves is adequate. Having in mind recent efforts to reform the RAM framework with the
aim to capture country specifics in a more comprehensive way, one should not assess reserve
adequacy solely on the basis of RAM metric’s results. Hence, the authorities point to a few
country specifics which ought to be taken into account while making an overall assessment
of the reserve adequacy. The first is related to the CNB’s macro-prudential regulation, under
which the commercial banks in Croatia are prescribed to hold minimum required foreign
currency claims (MRFFC), which serve as a complement to the central bank’s reserves. The
second factor is related to a sizable affiliated bank debt and FDI-related short-term liabilities,
which are both known to be a more stable source of funding, and which serve as a mitigating
factor against risks of capital outflows. If the aforementioned two factors would be accounted
for, the RAM coverage for Croatia would increase by some 30 percentage points up to the
adequacy requirement limit.
Structural reforms and competitiveness
Despite recent improvements, Croatia’s export sector is clearly lagging behind its peers and
lacks competitiveness. In search for underlying factors, staff finds that the REER is modestly
overvalued based on the results in the range from -2.8 to 10 percent. The upper bound of this
range comes from the comparison of unit labor costs, while the two standard methods of ER
assessment - CGER and EBA (in the range from -2.8 to 5.8) - clearly indicate that the REER
is broadly in line with fundamentals. With such ambiguous results and minor deviations from
the equilibrium, the authorities would not expect a conclusion on the exchange rate
overvaluation. Also, unlike CGER and EBA, the results based on the comparison of unit
labor costs are subject to arbitrariness in sample selection and data sources, and are usually
not taken as a benchmark for ER assessment in IMF country reports. In that regard,
evenhandedness in the application of the ER assessment methodology is warranted.
The authorities attribute the export underperformance more to non-price structural factors. In
response, they have embarked on an ambitious structural reform agenda, with the emphasis
on the business climate, labor market flexibility, debt restructuring and public sector reform.
Significant improvements have already been made in some areas. The second phase of the
labor market reform was fully implemented, resulting in lower costs of work force
restructuring and increased flexibility of working hours. The pre-bankruptcy settlement
procedure is also being strengthened with the objective to facilitate earlier access to the debt
restructuring process. The consumer bankruptcy act is currently in the parliamentary
procedure.

In the context of the business environment, the authorities are further reducing para-fiscal
charges for the private sector. The restructuring of SOEs has progressed and now the
governance issues are being tackled through professionalization of management, which
should underpin the ongoing privatization endeavors. Streamlining of social benefits and
tightening of special pensions should support the chronically low labor market participation.
Despite these efforts, the Croatian authorities see that their reform agenda has only recently
started to bear fruit. Now, that the economy has finally bottomed out, there should be more
space and broader public support to push the reform agenda further. They understand that
structural reforms are key to increasing competitiveness and unlocking the growth potential.
