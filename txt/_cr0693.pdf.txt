EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Algeria’s economic developments and prospects are encouraging. Real GDP growth
moderated somewhat to about 5 percent in 2004–05, mainly due to a slowdown in agriculture
following the 2003 bumper crop. Boosted by high world oil prices and expanding oil output,
the external position strengthened further. Inflation was low and the unemployment rate
continued to decline, although youth unemployment remains very high.
In light of increasing hydrocarbon revenue and the need to address infrastructure bottlenecks,
the government decided in 2005 to boost public investment. Monetary policy remained
prudent with the Bank of Algeria (BA) mopping up most excess liquidity in the banking
sector. Credit to the economy accelerated, while nonperforming loans remained high. Progress
was achieved in structural reforms, mainly in external trade and energy sector liberalization.
Policy discussions
Discussions focused on how to sustain growth and reduce unemployment in the context of
large hydrocarbon revenues and increasing openness.
•

The draft 2006 budget envisages a considerable increase in public investment. In light of
the limited absorption capacity and the need to ensure high quality spending, staff
recommended a more even implementation of the investment program, taking into
account the recommendations of the public expenditure review being undertaken with the
World Bank. The authorities agreed on the need for a wage policy that would preserve
the competitiveness of the economy. It is also important to use part of the fiscal space to
support priority structural reforms.

•

The authorities were interested in staff’s advice to formulate fiscal policy in the context
of a long-term framework and to replace the present oil stabilization fund by a
savings/financing account that is fully integrated into the budget.

•

In light of the envisaged fiscal expansion, staff recommended tightening the monetary
policy stance by bringing the BA’s policy interest rate to a positive level in real terms to
keep inflation under control. The authorities intend to pursue their current policy of
gradual appreciation of the real effective exchange rate.

•

The authorities agreed that the opening of the Algerian economy increases the need to step
up priority reforms aimed at encouraging private investment and creating jobs. This
requires implementation of a coherent strategy that includes accelerated banking reform,
further external trade liberalization, ensuring the free current convertibility of the dinar,
improving the business climate, and public enterprise estructuring/privatization.

I. BACKGROUND AND KEY CHALLENGES
1.
Algeria, an important hydrocarbon exporter, has benefited from abundant and
increasing hydrocarbon revenues in recent years. In the context of sharply increasing oil
prices, the external and fiscal positions have strengthened markedly. The significant fiscal
impulse created by the government’s Economic Recovery Program underpinned growth in the
nonhydrocarbon sector (annual average rate of 5.7 percent in 2001–04), while inflation
remained under control.1 Consequently, real per capita GDP increased considerably and the
unemployment rate has declined, although this partly reflected an increase in temporary
employment and youth unemployment remains high (Figures 1 and 2).

2.
The authorities have made progress in economic liberalization but other reforms
have trailed, delaying Algeria’s transition to a market economy. A comprehensive tariff
reform has been implemented since 2001, when the number of non-zero tariffs was cut to
three, reducing the simple average tariff rate from 26 percent to 19 percent. The 2001–05
temporary additional duty on some imports is being phased out as planned. Important steps
have also been taken to liberalize the hydrocarbon and telecommunications sectors. However,
economic activity continues to rely heavily on the state. State-owned banks, which account for
90 percent of banking system assets, lack basic risk management capacity and are burdened
by nonperforming loans. Following the privatization of more than 400 public enterprises in
the 1990s, some 1,200 public entities remain. These and other factors, including the violence
during the 1990s, explain Algeria’s difficult business climate which contributed to the low
diversification of exports and high unemployment.2
1

The Economy Recovery Program was a public investment program covering the period 2001–04. It supplemented
the budget and amounted to about US$7 billion (almost 13 percent of 2001 GDP).

Reforms for Faster Job Creation,” (forthcoming).

3.
Algeria’s challenge is to improve growth prospects and create jobs for its young
and growing labor force in an increasingly open environment. With the external trade
liberalization, Algeria has committed to a course that can be completed successfully only by
managing carefully the large hydrocarbon-related inflows and speeding up reforms aimed at
private sector development. Fund surveillance in recent years has focused on these areas
(Box 1).
4.
On the political front, President Bouteflika has taken a number of initiatives that
have strengthened Algeria’s political stability. The President’s election as head of the Front
de Libération National party in February 2005 has cemented his political power. The Charter
for Peace and National Reconciliation, which offers broad amnesty for acts committed during
the 1990s, won strong support (97 percent of the votes) in a referendum held in September
2005.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Growth performance in 2004–05 continued to be encouraging. Real GDP growth
moderated to about 5¼ percent in 2004 from 7 percent in 2003, due to a slowdown in
agriculture following the 2003 bumper crop and
in hydrocarbon output (Figure 3 and Table 1).
Figure 3. Real GDP Growth, 2000–05

Inflation remained low in 2005.
Consumer prices fell by some 1½ percent
(year-on-year) in October 2005, mainly
owing to a drop in food prices (Figure 4). At
the same time, annual nonfood-CPI inflation
remained above 3 percent through October,
reflecting the impact of the fiscal stimulus
and increases in administered prices for
transportation and energy products.

Box 1. Fund Surveillance in Algeria
Since 1998, Fund surveillance has focused on policies to improve growth performance and reduce
unemployment. In the wake of abundant hydrocarbon revenue, staff recommended prudent fiscal and
monetary policies. It also called for the acceleration of structural reforms to encourage private sector-led
growth, in particular liberalizing external trade, reforming the banking system, privatizing/restructuring
public enterprises, and improving the business climate.
The macroeconomic policy mix has been largely in line with staff’s advice. BA’s prudent monetary
policy and flexible management of the exchange rate helped maintain macroeconomic stability. The
authorities have also started reducing their external debt through early repayments. At the same time,
they considered that an expansionary fiscal policy has a role to play in creating jobs and improving
living standards.
Progress in structural reforms has been mixed. Important steps have been taken in some areas,
including economic and trade liberalization, but implementation of other reforms, in particular in the
public bank and enterprise sectors, has been slow.
Current Fund strategy focuses on sound management of hydrocarbon wealth and structural
reforms, notably in the banking sector. As agreed during the Managing Director’s visit to Algiers in
March 2005, the Fund is providing technical assistance in the areas of banking reform; banking
supervision; tax administration; and statistics. Fund staff liaised with a World Bank public expenditure
review mission and is intensifying training of Algerian officials. The Fund also helped organize a
conference on trade facilitation in the Maghreb in November 2005.

account surplus to 18⅓ percent of GDP in
2005. After early debt repayment of US$1.1 billion, including to the European Investment
Bank and the African Development Bank, the external debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to
decline further from 26 percent in 2004 to 16½ percent in 2005. Gross external reserves grew
by US$20 billion since end-2003 to reach US$53 billion at end-September 2005 (more than
1½ years of import cover). In light of the significantly improved balance of payments and
external reserves position, Algeria effected the early and full repurchase of its past drawings
on the Fund in November.
8.
The nominal effective exchange rate appreciated during the first eight months
of 2005 (Figures 6 and 7). This followed the depreciation of the real effective exchange rate
(REER) by some 10 percent during the last quarter of 2004, mainly reflecting the appreciation
of the euro against the dollar. The appreciation in 2005 was intended to minimize the deviation
of the REER from its end-2003 level, which the authorities considered an equilibrium level3.
The spread between the illegal parallel market and the official exchange rates remained large at
about 20 percent, partly reflecting problems in the implementation of the free current
convertibility of the dinar (see paragraph 30 below).

2005 is expected to increase by
4 percentage points of nonhydrocarbon
GDP (NHGDP), with the nonhydrocarbon primary deficit widening from 28 percent of NHGDP
in 2004 to 31½ percent in 2005 (Figure 8 and Table 3). Nevertheless, higher hydrocarbon
revenue would almost double the overall budget surplus.

10.
Monetary policy remained prudent, in line with the authorities’ objective to keep
inflation low. The central bank implemented several measures to absorb the rapidly increasing
liquidity in the banking sector. In particular, it (a) increased the amount of deposit auctions in
2004 and early 2005; (b) raised its policy interest rate from ¾ percent in 2004 to 1¼ percent in
July 2005 (however, this rate remained

Given Algeria’s ample liquidity situation and the extensive controls on the capital account, the link between
domestic and foreign interest rates is weak.

- 10 -

Box 2. Nonperforming Loans
Nonperforming loans in Algeria’s banking sector are concentrated in public banks, which had an
aggregate nonperforming loan ratio of 40 percent at end-2004. Nonperforming loans of private banks
stood at 4 percent of total loans at end-2004.
The continued provision of credit to large loss-making public enterprises has been the main
factor behind the fragility of public banks. Between 1991 and 2002, the Treasury repeatedly bailed
out public banks to enable them to meet prudential ratios. On average, these interventions amounted to
about 4 percent of GDP per year over 1991–2002. The Ministry of Finance estimated public banks’
nonperforming loans to insolvent or dissolved public enterprises at approximately DA 290 billion (or
almost 4 percent of GDP) at end-June 2005.
Nonperforming loans of public banks to the private sector have also been growing recently. A
BA audit of five (out of six) public banks found that these banks’ nonperforming loans to the private
sector represented 33 percent of their total loans to the private sector at end-2003. This is mainly due
to the rapid expansion of public banks credits to the private sector in the wake of abundant liquidity
and these banks’ weak risk assessment capacity.

The authorities have taken several actions in line with the recommendations of the
2003 FSSA. They strengthened performance contracts of public bank managers and shareholder
oversight, retained an investment advisor for the sale of the first of three public banks
designated for privatization, and made important progress in modernizing the payments
system.5 The Banking Commission instructed all public banks to submit external audits of their
end-2004 financial accounts by end-2005.
12.
Several other important structural reforms were also implemented in 2005. The
Association Agreement with the European Union (AAEU) became effective as of September
2005, and WTO negotiations are entering their final stages. A new hydrocarbon law was
adopted that further liberalizes investment in this sector (Box 3). The government has also
submitted to parliament an anti-corruption law following Algeria’s adoption of the 2003 United
Nations’ Convention against Corruption. The law contains a broad definition of corruption,
institutes a code of conduct for public servants, protects whistle-blowers, and provides for
international cooperation.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
The policy discussions focused on Algeria’s main challenges of improving growth
prospects and creating jobs for its young and growing labor force in an increasingly open
environment. The success of Algeria’s external trade liberalization envisaged under the AAEU
requires speeding up interrelated structural and institutional reforms aimed at private sector
development. The authorities recognized that the considerable increase in hydrocarbon revenue
provides an excellent opportunity to step up the pace of economic and social development in
Algeria. Staff underscored that sound management of hydrocarbon receipts is crucial to
maintaining macroeconomic stability and enhancing the competitiveness of the nonhydrocarbon
sector. The authorities are aware of the importance to ensure that the ample availability of
hydrocarbon resources does not weaken the resolve to undertake economic reforms but is used
to facilitate costly and difficult reforms such as of public banks and enterprises. Over the
medium term, a strategy aimed at efficient use of hydrocarbon resources and accelerating
growth-enhancing structural reforms would also contribute to the alleviation of global
imbalances.
A. Medium-Term Outlook
14.
Algeria’s external position is projected to strengthen further over the medium
term. With world market oil prices expected to remain high, annual hydrocarbon exports are
projected to average US$57 billion through 2010. Imports are likely to increase significantly
with the envisaged large public investment, Sonatrach’s investment plans, and the
implementation of the AAEU. The external current account surplus, while gradually declining
after 2006, is expected to remain large and gross international reserves are forecast at above two
years of import cover from 2006. Gross external debt is projected to fall below 5 percent of
GDP by 2010, partly reflecting the authorities’ policy of limiting nonconcessional borrowing.
5

The Real Time Gross Settlement system is expected to be effective as of January 1, 2006.

Box 3. The Hydrocarbon Sector
Algeria is an important hydrocarbon (oil and gas) exporter. It is the world’s 14th largest oil
exporter and supplies some 20 percent of Europe’s natural gas. Oil production in 2004 was 1.9 million
barrels/day (about 2½ percent of world production) and marketed gas production was 225 million
cubic meters/day (about 3 percent of world production).
The hydrocarbon sector dominates the economy, accounting for 38 percent of GDP, 98 percent of
exports of goods, and 71 percent of budgetary revenue in 2004.
Algeria is still considered to be relatively under-explored. Proven crude oil reserves are estimated
at 11.8 billion barrels. However, recoverable crude oil reserves may range as high as 28 billion barrels
according to the 2005 U.S. Geological Survey. Algeria has also proven natural gas reserves of about
4.5 trillion cubic meters, ranking seventh in the world, while significant discoveries of additional
reserves are expected in the coming years.
The hydrocarbon sector has been open for almost 20 years. In 2004, foreign partners accounted
for slightly less than half of Algeria’s crude oil output (14 percent for gas). However, each foreign
investor was required to partner with the state-owned hydrocarbon company, Sonatrach. The complex
contractual arrangements imposed by law increasingly hampered the financing of Algeria’s
investment needs in the upstream hydrocarbon sector (estimated at US$70 billion for 2005–15).
In March 2005, Parliament adopted a new law, which:
•
•
•
•
•

Simplifies the contractual framework for upstream activities (exploration, production, and
transportation);
Introduces free entry in transportation and downstream activities;
Replaces the existing production-sharing regime by a tax and royalty system;
Establishes investors’ rights and obligations, including Sonatrach’s;
Creates a regulatory agency to tender upstream contracts, set reference gas prices, and collect
royalties and taxes, and an agency that would issue permits for downstream activities.

The law should lead to more investment upstream, through foreign investment and by freeing
Sonatrach from the obligation to own and operate all oil and gas infrastructure, finance new pipelines,
and fulfill noncommercial roles, such as regulation, tendering, and collection of taxes and royalties.
On domestic pricing, the law states that the price of crude oil for domestic refineries is set at the
beginning of each year on the basis of the moving 10-year average of Algerian export prices.
Domestic gas prices are set by regulation each year.

15.
The fiscal policy stance envisaged in the draft 2006 budget law implies a
sizable increase in public spending. In particular, government investment in 2006 is
programmed to double compared to its 2004 level.6 At the same time, amid abundant
hydrocarbon revenues, there is mounting pressure for a large wage increase.7 Staff
6

The public investment program for 2005–09 comprises the GCP, as well as US$16 billion representing other
projects under way. In total, the public investment program amounts to US$74 billion (72 percent of 2005 GDP).
7

In January 2004, the authorities granted an increase in the minimum wage of 25 percent.

- 13 -

projections assume a 10 percent increase in public sector wages in 2006 and also take
account of the government investment program’s implications on current expenditure
needs over the medium term, both of which are not included in the draft budget. On this
basis, the nonhydrocarbon primary deficit would increase from 31½ percent of NHGDP in
2005 to 36½ percent in 2006; thereafter it would decline to about 26½ percent by 2010.
However, the overall budget surplus is expected to remain above 10 percent of GDP over
the period.
16.
The economic outlook would remain favorable over the medium term. Average
annual real NHGDP growth is projected at about 5½ percent, and the unemployment rate would
continue to decline. However, the envisaged sharp increase in public investment and a likely
public sector wage hike would contribute to higher inflation. The entry into effect of the AAEU
and the ensuing increased international competition may have a negative impact on the
industrial sector starting in 2007, but this could be short-lived if enterprises take the necessary
measures to improve their competitiveness. The increased openness of the economy would also
help local producers to improve their efficiency via technology transfers from abroad and better
access to imports and capital goods.
17.
The debt sustainability analyses show that external and public debt will remain
sustainable over the medium term (Tables 7 and 8). The standardized stress tests for external
debt sustainability show that the external debt ratio is expected to drop sharply under all
circumstances. The public debt sustainability analysis indicates that although the public debt-toGDP ratio may increase under various scenarios, it will likely remain sustainable.8 Domestic
public debt would increase, due to the constraints imposed by the current rules of the
hydrocarbon stabilization fund—Fonds de Régulation des Recettes (FRR)—that do not allow
the FRR to finance the nonhydrocarbon budget deficit directly, but only to repay public debt. To
finance the nonhydrocarbon budget deficits in the coming years, the government will need to
issue new debt and use the FRR to repay this debt when falling due. In view of the economy’s
high dependency on hydrocarbon revenue, staff also analyzed the impact of a drop in oil prices
to US$19 per barrel starting in 2006, resulting in lower growth. Under this scenario and with no
policy changes, international reserves would decline and the government would run budget
deficits starting in 2006. Nevertheless, given Algeria’s strong financial position, external and
public debt would remain sustainable.
B. Management of Hydrocarbon Revenue
18.
Sound long-term management of hydrocarbon revenue is the basis for successful
macroeconomic policy in Algeria. The authorities were interested in a long-term framework
for setting fiscal policy presented by staff (IMF Country Report No. 05/50). Such management
does not preclude significant government expenditure, but delinks it from fluctuations in oil
prices. The authorities agreed that the current rules governing the FRR are likely to generate
additional interest expenditures and may create bottlenecks in financing future budget deficits.
8

Public debt includes the quasi-fiscal debt arising from public banks’ nonperforming loans to public enterprises.

- 14 -

Therefore, they plan to reconsider the role of the FRR, including transforming it into a
savings/financing account as proposed by staff. This account would be fully integrated into the
budget and be used to finance the sustainable nonhydrocarbon primary deficit and to repay
public debt, including prepayments. The sound management of hydrocarbon resources also
requires coordination between fiscal and monetary policies, as well as the transparent use of
hydrocarbon revenues to avoid problems of governance and waste.
Fiscal policy
19.
The authorities decided to use
part of the fiscal space created by high
hydrocarbon revenues to increase
public investment (Figure 10). In the
current low inflation environment, there
is room to increase government
expenditure. The government investment
program appropriately envisages building
much-needed public infrastructure,
developing human capital, improving
public services (mainly the judiciary),
supporting economic activity, and
expanding housing.

20.
The authorities agreed with staff on the need to pay attention to the quality of
spending, including by taking into account the recommendations of the public expenditure
review being conducted in cooperation with the World Bank that, inter alia, aims to help
increase the authorities’ capacity in selecting projects on efficiency grounds. Staff underscored that the sizable front-loading of spending, despite its high import content, could run
into absorption capacity constraints. It advised, therefore, a more even implementation of
the investment program. The authorities agreed that their public investment plans are very
ambitious in the short term. They indicated that the draft 2006 budget was meant to send a
strong signal that multi-year funding for the public investment program is assured.
21.
At the same time, it is important to maintain macroeconomic stability and adopt
a wage policy that the economy can support. While the higher world market oil prices
allow for higher nonhydrocarbon primary deficits, the envisaged fiscal expansion would
likely contribute to higher inflation, given domestic supply rigidities. The authorities were
determined to adhere to their objective of achieving fiscal sustainability over the medium
term (Box 4). In this connection, it would be important for the government to start preparing
comprehensive medium-term budget projections that take account of the implications for
current spending of the government investment program. The authorities agreed with the need
to limit any increase in real wages to the real growth rate of nonhydrocarbon GDP, in order to
preserve competitiveness as Algeria’s economy opens up.

- 15 -

Box 4. Management of Hydrocarbon Revenues and Fiscal Sustainability
Staff’s long-term fiscal framework aims at preserving the permanent per capita income from
hydrocarbon wealth on the basis of a sustainable path for the nonhydrocarbon primary
deficit/nonhydrocarbon GDP ratio (IMF Country Report No. 05/50). The updated assumptions are: depletion
of probable reserves by 2050; population growth of 1.5 percent per annum; real NHGDP growth of 4 percent
per annum after 2010; a 5 percent real interest rate; a gradual decline of oil prices to a long-term level of
US$30/bbl from 2015; and a ratio of $/Km3 gas to $/bbl oil of 3.8. All prices are expressed in 2003 dollars.
In this framework, the sustainable nonhydrocarbon primary deficit decreases from 32 percent in 2005 to
27 percent of NHGDP by 2009 (compared to 21 percent estimated at the time of the 2004 Article IV
consultation which was based on a long-term oil price of US$25/bbl). Income from financial wealth entirely
finances the deficit that prevails after 2050.

22.
The authorities agreed with the importance of allocating resources in support of
market-based reforms, including to limit the social cost of priority reforms in the public
banking and enterprise sectors, and to bring the quasi-fiscal deficits related to public bank losses
into the budget. Staff suggested streamlining the tax system by eliminating exemptions and
using part of the additional fiscal space to reduce the tax burden on businesses, and to further
reduce employer contributions to stimulate job creation.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
23.
The monetary policy stance should be tightened to keep inflation under control.
The BA’s response to the rapidly changing liquidity environment and the absorption of excess
liquidity helped maintain low inflation. Staff underscored, however, that the anticipated fiscal
expansion and the current strong growth of credit to the economy would complicate monetary
management and the development of a sound banking sector. The monetary stance needs
tightening through: (a) raising BA’s policy interest rate to a positive level in real terms; and
(b) handling the national hydrocarbon company’s large deposits outside the money market to
strengthen BA’s control over base money. These measures would allow BA to restore the
signaling role of its policy interest rate and establish more effective control over the system’s
liquidity. The authorities considered that the existing monetary instruments were adequate to
contain money growth, but indicated that they would carefully consider staff’s

- 16 -

recommendations. BA’s monetary program aims to limit broad money growth to 16½ percent in
2006 by controlling base money growth.
24.
The authorities intend to continue to manage the exchange rate in a flexible
manner, taking account of the inflation objective. They indicated that in managing the float
they take account of fundamental developments of the real effective exchange rate. The increase
in real oil prices and the current economic growth suggest a tendency for the equilibrium REER
to appreciate. The expansionary fiscal stance also implies a real exchange rate appreciation,
while the trade liberalization envisaged under the AAEU points in the opposite direction.
However, with the increased openness of the economy, the link between changes in the
exchange rate and the inflation rate would be strengthened. Against this backdrop, staff
recommended allowing the REER to appreciate through a nominal appreciation of the dinar
rather than higher inflation. The authorities agreed, and indicated that the flexibility with which
they manage the float would be maintained. Since early 2005 they have been appreciating the
nominal effective exchange rate, but declining inflation has thus far prevented the REER from
appreciating as much as expected.
C. Structural Reforms
25.
The authorities are aware that opening of the Algerian economy reinforces the
need to step up priority reforms aimed at encouraging private investment and creating
jobs. To maximize the benefits and minimize the inevitable costs of the greater competition
entailed by establishment of a free trade zone with the European Union (Box 5), staff
encouraged the authorities to accelerate banking sector reform, further liberalize external trade,
and ensure full implementation of the current convertibility of the dinar.

Box 5. The Association Agreement with the European Union
Algeria’s AAEU became effective on September 1, 2005. The agreement provides a major impetus
toward an open trade regime over the next 12 years.
The economic impact of this agreement includes both costs and benefits, with costs likely to occur in
the short run while benefits accruing over the longer term. The potential benefits would consist of
welfare gains, increased foreign direct investment, technology and knowledge transfer, higher
productivity, and increased growth. Costs include a limited fiscal revenue impact, trade diversion,
transitional unemployment, and enterprise restructuring/closure.
Maximizing the benefits depends to a large extent on Algeria’s commitment to reforms. Other
countries’ experiences show that the Barcelona Process positively affected mainly countries that
manifested serious commitment to reform.
The required policy actions comprise: (a) maintaining sound macroeconomic policies; (b) undertaking
deep structural reforms aimed at diversifying the economy and achieving a transition to a market
economy; and (c) liberalizing trade more generally.

Reform of the Financial Sector
26.
The strategy for reforming the financial system in Algeria should focus on banking
sector reform. In discussing the authorities’ comprehensive approach to financial sector
reform, including the nonbank financial sector, staff stressed that financial intermediation would
be bank-based in the near future.
27.
The weak financial situation of public banks confirms the need to adopt a coherent
strategy that aims to gradually reduce the State’s role in the sector. The authorities’ reform
program aims at strengthening the governance of public banks and accelerating privatization.
Key actions include:
•

Successfully privatizing the first of three designated public banks. Building on the
preparatory work for opening up the majority of the capital of a first public bank to a
reputable strategic investor, it is now important to issue the call for bids as soon as
possible.

•

Preparing for the privatization of the other two public banks, to take advantage of
the momentum created by the privatization of the first public bank as soon as it is
completed.

•

Improving the governance of public banks. The strengthening of performance
contracts for public banks is a welcome step. Staff recommended that these contracts
require banks to grant loans only to solvent clients and be published with their ex-post
assessments. Although the 2005 budget law included explicit government subsidies to
replace part of public banks’ credit to loss-making public enterprises, the
implementation of this reform was delayed. The authorities are endeavoring to speed up
the process, including by developing an enterprise restructuring program aimed at
phasing out the subsidies over the medium term. Staff advised establishing a code of
conduct for the financial relations between public banks and public enterprises.

•

Promoting competition in the banking sector, in order to ensure the success of the
privatization and facilitate efficient intermediation. In this regard, staff recommended
replacing the directive prohibiting public entities from dealing with private banks with a
directive instructing these entities to deal solely with sound banks. It also encouraged the
authorities to avoid any discretionary measures aimed at increasing credit to the
economy, such as interest subsidies.

28.
Continued improvement of the operational framework for financial intermediation
should accompany this strategy. Key actions are the ongoing modernization of the payments
system, as well as the authorities’ capacity-building efforts in banking supervision, with Fund
technical assistance. To ensure the success of these efforts, the political support for the banking
commission in enforcing prudential regulations needs to be sustained.

- 18 -

Other Structural Reforms
29.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ continued efforts toward external trade
liberalization. It is now important to step up the negotiations for Algeria’s accession to the
WTO. In this context, staff encouraged the authorities to liberalize rights of establishment to
attract more foreign investment. Regional integration is also an important factor in enhancing
the positive impact of the AAEU and attracting more foreign direct investment. The work
program agreed upon at the conference on trade facilitation in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia,
which took place in Algiers in November, provides a good basis to make progress in this
direction. Regarding customs reform, the ongoing development of the risk management system
should be continued to shorten customs clearance times.
30.
The free current convertibility of the dinar is essential to enable Algeria to benefit
from its opening up to the rest of the world. A recent Fund technical assistance mission noted
some problems in the implementation of the free convertibility of the dinar for payments and
transfers relating to bona fide current international transactions, particularly those relating to
invisible transactions and imports of some services; it also noted problems in the
communication of this free convertibility to the banks and the Algerian public. The authorities
acknowledged that the exchange system needs to be improved and indicated that they have
started work to implement the preliminary recommendations of the Fund technical assistance
mission (Box 6).

Box 6. Improving the Exchange System
Algeria’s exchange system was found to be complicated and bureaucratic. Despite the publication
of a BA note in 1997, the public was generally unaware that BA allows the purchase of bona fide
amounts exceeding annual limits, which cover many invisible payments. The foreign exchange
authority should:
•

Issue a new instruction confirming the free convertibility of the dinar for the payment of
invisible transactions (i.e. for healthcare, education, and travel) and disseminate widely and
immediately the policy of free convertibility for all bona fide current account payments and
transfers;

•

Significantly increase or abolish the current indicative limits on conversion for current
international invisible transactions; and

•

Launch a general overhaul and streamlining of the regulatory framework.

31.
Other structural reforms should be targeted at improving the business climate
in Algeria. In this regard, the authorities were determined to push ahead with the ongoing
judicial reform aimed at implementing the legislation in a transparent and predictable fashion.

- 19 -

They were also interested in exploring possibilities to improve the incentives for enterprise and
job creation through the tax system as proposed by staff (Box 7).
Box 7. Algeria’s Business Climate
Algeria’s business climate lags behind that of countries on the rim of the European Union.1 The
authorities are pursuing a number of structural reforms to improve the business climate, but these will
take time to mature.
The fiscal space created by higher hydrocarbon revenues could be used to achieve a faster
improvement in the business climate through the tax system. The gap between Algeria and its
competitors is largest in business taxes. While Algeria has lowered its corporate income tax (CIT) rate to
30 percent, the average maximum CIT rate in the EU10 accession countries dropped from 30½ percent
in 1995 to 21½ percent in 2004.
The subsidy implicit in the pricing of domestic energy could also partly be redirected away from
energy-intensive to labor-intensive activities. A reduction in taxes and mandatory charges on labor
could be considered in this context to make its tax system more conducive to job creation.

(forthcoming).

32.
Staff encouraged the government to step up its efforts to reduce its involvement
in the productive sector. It advised against subjecting privatization to the maintenance of
employment and activity, but rather to accompany this process with appropriate social
measures. Staff also encouraged the government to subject remaining public enterprises to
annual external audits in line with international standards, and to publish the results.
33.
Further strengthening fiscal governance and transparency is key to ensuring the
proper use of the large hydrocarbon revenues. Staff welcomed the progress made with
regard to anti-corruption legislation, and encouraged the authorities to accelerate budget
modernization and establish an action plan to implement the recommendations of the fiscal
ROSC. Priorities include (a) finalizing the draft organic law on public finances; (b) improving
information disseminated to Parliament and the public; (c) modernizing the budget
nomenclature and accounting framework; (d) reducing the number of special accounts; and
(e) reforming the financing of local governments. Staff also encouraged the authorities to
participate in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
IV. STATISTICAL AND OTHER ISSUES
34.
Despite the authorities’ efforts to improve the statistical base, serious weaknesses
remain, particularly in government finance statistics and prudential data on the financial
sector, as well as in the timeliness of data dissemination.9 Staff recommended that Algeria
9

compared to 33.1 percent in IMF Country Report No. 05/50.

- 20 -

participate in the GDDS to develop and modernize its statistical system in a structured
framework, while obtaining the needed technical assistance.
35.
The authorities intend to pursue their active external debt management. Staff
encouraged them to continue their efforts to seek early settlement of issues related to the debt
with Russia, which would facilitate a more ambitious approach in prepaying external debt to
Paris Club creditors.
36.
The authorities expressed satisfaction with Fund technical assistance on tax
administration, monetary policy, and banking supervision. Staff welcomed the authorities’
efforts to accelerate the reform of the tax administration, including the start-up of the Large
Enterprise Unit, and expressed Fund readiness to continue to provide technical assistance in
this area. Near-term Fund technical assistance also includes bank restructuring and banking
supervision, as well as organizing a course on financial markets analysis in Algeria in early
2006.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Since 2001, the Algerian economy has successfully used abundant hydrocarbon
revenues to boost economic growth while keeping inflation low. Growth benefited from a
sizable fiscal impulse and buoyant activity in the hydrocarbon sector. The unemployment
rate declined considerably, but this also reflected an increase in temporary employment and
youth unemployment remains high. Monetary policy adequately managed the large external
inflows by absorbing most of the excess liquidity in the banking system. However, the strong
expansion of credit to the economy remains a cause for concern in light of the very large
share of nonperforming loans in the public banks. Several major structural reforms were
accomplished in 2005, including the entry into effect of the AAEU, but much remains to be
done to achieve the transition to a market economy.
38.
The key challenge for Algeria is to strengthen the prospects for sustainable
growth in the nonhydrocarbon sector and increase employment in an increasingly open
environment. With greater competition resulting from the external trade liberalization, it is
imperative to speed up priority reforms aimed at encouraging private investment and creating
jobs. The prospect of continued high hydrocarbon revenues would provide the fiscal space to
accelerate these reforms. In managing the large hydrocarbon-related inflows, it is important to
coordinate fiscal and monetary policies to maintain macroeconomic stability.
39.
The progress made in consolidating political stability and the encouraging
outlook for Algeria’s already strong financial position provide an excellent opportunity
to decisively advance the government’s economic agenda. The government’s program
focuses on (a) using part of the hydrocarbon revenues for investment in infrastructure,
education, health, and housing; and (b) accelerating structural reforms aimed at moving
toward an open and diversified market economy. While this orientation is appropriate, it is
also important to ensure that the program is implemented in such a way as to ensure that its
objectives are achieved.

- 21 -

40.
With the rise in world oil prices, the sustainable level of public spending for 2006
and beyond has increased significantly, but the government’s investment plans are very
ambitious in the short term. Given limited absorption capacity, the front-loading of
investment could jeopardize the quality of these expenditures and increase inflation. Staff
recommends a more even implementation of the public investment program, taking into
account the recommendations of the public expenditure review being conducted in
cooperation with the World Bank.
41.
It is also important to use part of the increased fiscal space to accelerate reforms
and to adopt a wage policy that the economy is able to support. Allocating adequate
resources to support reforms in the public bank and enterprise sectors, including to mitigate
the inevitable social costs, would help to accelerate the transformation of the economy. To
achieve an immediate improvement in the business climate, the authorities should consider
streamlining the tax system, and lowering the tax and other charges on enterprise and
employment. In view of the need to preserve the competitiveness of the economy, real public
sector wage increases should not exceed the real growth in the nonhydrocarbon sector.
42.
Staff encourages the authorities to transform the current hydrocarbon
stabilization fund into a savings/financing account that is fully integrated into the budget.
It also underscores the importance of setting the fiscal management of hydrocarbon revenue in
a long-term framework and to start preparing medium-term budget projections that take
account of the current spending implications of public investment.
43.
Inflation will likely be more difficult to control in the period ahead, owing to the
envisaged fiscal expansion and the strong credit expansion to the economy. This requires
tightening monetary policy by further strengthening BA’s control over system liquidity and
increasing its policy interest rate to a positive level in real terms. The latter would also lead
banks to better assess prevailing credit risks. Staff reiterates its recommendation that the large
structural liquidity of Sonatrach be deposited directly at BA.
44.
The authorities should continue to implement the managed exchange rate float in
a flexible manner. The rise in oil prices, together with the fiscal expansion and the current
growth momentum, suggest a tendency for the equilibrium real exchange rate to appreciate.
The current policy of gradually appreciating the dinar should be pursued in the period ahead,
which would help keep inflation under control.
45.
To enable Algeria to benefit as much as possible from establishing a free trade
zone with the European Union, the implementation of market-based structural reforms
needs to be accelerated. Banking reform remains a priority. Staff emphasizes the need to push
ahead with the privatization of several public banks, strengthen governance of the remaining
public banks, and promote competition in the sector on a level playing field. In addition,
stepping up efforts to join the WTO and to strengthen regional integration are important,
including to attract more foreign direct investment. Staff also encourages the authorities to
decisively execute their privatization program.

- 22 -

46.
In order to ensure free convertibility for international current transactions, staff
urges the authorities to implement the recommendations of the recent Fund technical
assistance mission without delay.
47.
The progress made with regard to enacting anti-corruption legislation and
strengthening banking supervision is welcome, but further efforts are needed to implement
the recommendations of the 2004 fiscal ROSC report and to undertake financial audits of
public enterprises.
48.
Staff urges the authorities to step up their efforts to improve the statistical base.
Although data provision to the Fund is still broadly adequate for effective surveillance, there
are serious weaknesses, including in the government finance statistics. Staff recommends that
Algeria participate in the GDDS.
49.
The authorities’ policy to prepay external debt is appropriate and Algeria’s
voluntary advance repurchase to the Fund was a positive step. Staff encourages the
authorities to continue their efforts to seek a settlement of bilateral debt issues with Russia.
50.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Algeria take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ This includes the impact of banks' restructuring packages. The conversion of bank claims on public
enterprises in bank claims on the government results, other things being equal, in a decrease of credit to the
economy and an equal increase in credit to the government. The adjustment amounted to about DA 216
billion in 2000, DA 311.6 billion in 2001, and DA 297 billion in 2002. The flow of new credits to the
economy in 2003 (17.5 percent annual growth) exceeded the stock difference between 2002 and 2003,
because of the liquidation of two private banks.
2/ This includes the debt-rescheduling proceeds blocked in special accounts at the Bank of Algeria.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth
rate, ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Assuming that the authorities seek to maintain the reserve cover of next year's imports at its 2005 level throughout the projection period.
7/ Assuming that the reserve cover of next year's imports does not drop below 3 months by 2010.
8/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

1/ Public sector debt covers central government and is in gross terms.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; accumulation of government deposits at the central bank in percent of GDP; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

B. Nonfinancial Relations
Exchange Rate Arrangement
On October 1, 1994, the Bank of Algeria introduced a managed float for the dinar through
daily fixing sessions that included six commercial banks. This system has been replaced by
an interbank foreign exchange market as of January 2, 1996. At the end of November 2005,
the average of the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar was $1 = DA 73.76, equivalent
to SDR 1 = DA 105.04. No margin limits are imposed on the buying and selling exchange
rates in the interbank foreign exchange market, except for a margin of DA 0.017 between the
buying and selling rates of the Bank of Algeria for the dinar against the U.S. dollar.
The exchange regime is a managed float with no pre-announced path for the exchange rate.
Full surrender requirements are in effect on hydrocarbon export proceeds. Limits on the
making of payments for invisible transactions and current transfers, which are still in effect
since Algeria accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, in 1997, are
indicative according to the authorities, although this information is not commonly known by
the public, despite the publication of a BA note in 1997. In addition, some difficulties arise
with regard to the making of payments for other current international transactions (such as
the payment of certain services).
Latest Article IV Consultation

October 7–24, 2004. The staff report (IMF Country Report No. 05/50) was discussed by the
Executive Board on January 12, 2005 and published on February 15, 2005.

APPENDIX II

Algeria: Relations with the World Bank
(As of November 8, 2005)
The World Bank portfolio in Algeria comprises 9 active operations and 64 closed loans, with
cumulative net commitments of US$4.5 billion, of which US$3.67 billion have been repaid.
Net commitments for the 9 current operations amount to US$337 million.
The Algeria Country Assistance Strategy was discussed by the World Bank Board on
June 12, 2003 and a Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report was discussed by the
Board on August 30, 2005. The proposed support of the Bank Group to Algeria for 2004–06
aims at: (a) strengthening fiscal sustainability and hydrocarbon revenue management to build
the basis for sustained growth; (b) removing the constraints to private sector-led growth,
particularly those affecting the business environment, SMEs, the financial sector, and
infrastructure development; and (c) supporting the Government’s efforts to articulate and
implement a strategy for better service delivery, particularly in water supply, transport,
housing, environmental services and human development to meet the critical needs of the
population. The Bank Group’s support is guided by three principles: (a) selectivity through
engagement in a limited number of areas and a selective use of Bank instruments;
(b) programmatic approach focused on transfer of knowledge and capacity building; and
(c) partnerships, outreach and knowledge sharing.
Recent analytical work includes policy notes on poverty, the transport sector, and the legal
and business environment (FY05). A Public Expenditure Review is scheduled for FY06 (in
collaboration with the IMF). The Bank is seeking to expand its analytic and advisory work in
Algeria.
Given high oil revenues and the decision to reduce external borrowing, the authorities have
expressed interest in Reimbursable Technical Assistance (RTA) from the World Bank.
Agreement has been reached on an RTA program in the water and sanitation sector and
another is under preparation in the information and communication technology sector.
The quality of the Algeria portfolio deteriorated in FY04 and FY05. The percentage of
projects at risk rose from 8 percent in FY03 to above 20 percent in FY04–05, and is currently
at 22 percent. Slow implementation continues to affect most projects, partly because of
insufficient institutional capacity and procurement problems. The average disbursement ratio
was 11 percent in FY04 and dropped to 8.9 percent in FY05. No new loans have been
approved since FY03.

APPENDIX III

Algeria: Statistical Issues
Algeria’s data provision to the Fund is still broadly adequate for effective surveillance, but
there are serious weaknesses particularly in government finance statistics. Since the late
1990s, the reporting of statistics to the Fund has generally deteriorated, particularly with
respect to overall quality and timeliness. The lack of financial resources allocated to the
compilation of statistics, insufficient inter-agency coordination, as well as concerns about
accuracy and subsequent reluctance to publish provisional data, are partly responsible for this
situation.
The September 2002 multisector statistics mission designed an action plan to facilitate
Algeria’s eventual subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). STA
believes that the optimal strategy is participation in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) as an interim step. The GDDS would provide a comprehensive and consistent
framework for improving Algeria’s statistics, attract the required technical assistance from
the Fund and other donors, and serve to signal to the world Algeria’s commitment to
improving statistics. The authorities have stated that they aim for Algeria to participate in the
GDDS in the near future.
Real Sector
Real sector data is reported to STA on an irregular basis and with substantial lags. The latest
national accounts information in IFS pertains to partial data reported for 2003. IFS import
trade data at current prices are derived from Direction of Trade Statistics. The September
2002 multisector statistics mission recommended that priority be given to move the
compilation of national accounts to 1993 SNA. STA missions visited Algiers during 2004–05
to assist the National Statistical Office with the development of quarterly national accounts.
Government Finance
Algeria reported government finance statistics (GFS) for the period 1994–2002 for
publication in the GFS Yearbook. However, the institutional coverage of the data reported is
limited to Budgetary Central Government, albeit in a wide sense, including the general
budget, the annexed budget, and the special treasury accounts. Clarification has been sought
from the authorities regarding the recording of the latter (net versus gross recording). No subannual data are submitted for IFS publication.
The September 2002 multisector statistics mission recommended the designation of a
coordinator and the assignment of at least one economist for the compilation of GFS data.
The authorities have not yet followed up on their initial intention to assign GFS leadership to
the General Directorate of Accounting in the Ministry of Finance. A first step would be the
establishment of an automated bridge table between the detailed monthly Treasury ledger
(Balance générale), regularly produced by the latter, and the GFS table (Situation Résumée
des Opérations du Trésor —SROT) in order to ensure a more timely production of quarterly

- 41 -

APPENDIX III

and monthly GFS, as well as a more timely report to the Fund of quarterly data that fully
reconcile the SROT presentation of government finances with the budget presentation. The
ongoing changeover to an enhanced chart of accounts of the Treasury would offer an ideal
opportunity to revamp the way GFS compilation is organized and carried out in Algeria.
The mission further recommended (a) that proceeds of the oil stabilization fund (FRR) be
shown as revenue (rather than financing); (b) the compilation of more detailed breakdowns,
in particular relating to the item “other transfers”; (c) a more appropriate reporting of the
three large debt assumption operations carried out over the past decade; and (d) further work
on the financing and the reconciliation with monetary statistics. The mission noted that
meeting the GDDS and eventually the SDDS standards would require substantial efforts in
terms of extension of coverage (consolidating the operations of social security and Wilayate,
and subsequently of other administrative bodies and municipalities).
Monetary Accounts
Monetary data are broadly adequate for policy formulation and monitoring of economic
developments. In particular, coverage has improved with the consolidation of data from the
national savings bank (CNEP). However, reporting of balance sheet data by some
commercial banks is very untimely, and most commercial banks do not report the complete
data needed to compile the monetary survey. Prudential data reported by banks are untimely
and unreliable on the part of public banks. The September 2002 STA multisector statistics
mission recommended expanding further the coverage of the monetary survey to include
banking operations of the National Mutual Fund for Agriculture (CNMA) and strictly
enforcing the reporting obligations of banks by introducing high penalties.
Balance of Payments
The September 2002 multisector statistics mission noted the following: (a) the Bank of
Algeria’s legal authority to collect data is limited to banking and financial institutions only;
(b) data sources need to be expanded by conducting enterprise surveys in addition to
traditional exchange-based records; (c) a more rigorous and uniform application of the
residency criterion should be followed; (d) quarterly data are compiled but not regularly
disseminated; and (e) international investment position data are not compiled. Algeria does
not report Balance of Payments data to STA, and there are no BOP data in IFS or in the
BOPSY.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Algeria
February 13, 2006

Since the issuance of the staff report, the following information has become available.
This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Inflation in 2005 was lower than projected. The consumer price index rose on average by
1.6 percent in 2005 as compared with the projected 2.7 percent, mainly reflecting a strongerthan-foreseen decline in food prices.
International reserves at end-2005 were slightly higher than expected. Gross official
reserves reached US$ 56.2 billion at end-2005 as compared to the projected level of
US$55.6 billion.
Free current convertibility of the dinar. Staff has assessed the jurisdictional implications
under Article VIII of certain limits on the making of payments for current international
invisible transactions and has concluded that such limits do not give rise to an exchange
restriction subject to Fund jurisdiction. However, staff urges the authorities to make the
public more aware of the indicative nature of those limits. The authorities have sent staff for
comments a new draft regulation on payments and transfers relating to current international
transactions, in response to the recommendations of the Fund technical assistance. This draft
is currently being reviewed by staff.
Progress continued on the structural reform front with the parliamentary approval of
the anti-corruption law on January 24, 2006. The law contains a broad definition of
corruption, institutes a code of conduct for public servants, and provides for international
cooperation.
Participation in GDDS. In a letter to the Director of the Statistics Department dated
February 6, 2006, the authorities announced Algeria’s participation in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS).

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 06/28
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 9, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Algeria
On February 13, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Algeria.1
Background
The Algerian economy continues to benefit from abundant and increasing hydrocarbon
revenues. Real GDP growth is expected to continue at about 5 percent in 2005, led by
increased output in the hydrocarbon sector and sustained activity in the construction
and services sectors. Inflation is projected to remain low, mainly due to a decline in food
prices, and the unemployment rate continued to decline.
Boosted by high oil prices, the external position strengthened further. Despite a
continued surge in imports, the external current account surplus is projected to increase
further in 2005, reflecting a rapid increase in oil prices as well as an expansion of oil
production. Gross external reserves grew by US$20 billion since end-2003 to
US$53 billion at end-September 2005, covering more than 1½ year of imports.
With continued early debt repayment, the external debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to
decline further from 26 percent in 2004 to 161 ⁄2 percent in 2005.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

-2-

In the context of buoyant hydrocarbon revenue and the need to address infrastructural
bottlenecks, the government decided in 2005 to boost public spending and launched a
Growth Consolidation Plan for 2005–09 amounting to US$50 billion. In June 2005, the
program was revised upward to US$57 billion. As a result, the nonhydrocarbon primary
deficit is expected to widen from 28 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP in 2004 to
31½ percent in 2005. Nevertheless, higher oil prices would allow for a stronger overall
fiscal position, with the overall surplus increasing almost twofold from 6.9 percent to
12.6 percent of GDP.
Monetary policy remained prudent with the Bank of Algeria (BA) adopting several
measures to mop up the rapidly increasing liquidity in the banking sector. As a result,
BA was able to absorb most excess bank liquidity. However, BA’s policy interest rate
remains negative in real terms, despite an increase from ¾ percent in 2004 to
1¼ percent in July 2005. Annual broad money growth continued at about 12 percent
through September 2005. Credit to the economy accelerated in the first half of 2005,
while the level of nonperforming loans remained high.
Important progress was achieved in structural reforms. The Association Agreement with
the European Union (AAEU) became effective in September 2005, and negotiations
towards Algeria’s accession to the World Trade Organization are in their final stages.
The authorities strengthened performance contracts of public bank managers and
shareholder oversight, initiated the privatization of a public bank, and made progress in
modernizing the payments system. A new hydrocarbon law was adopted that further
liberalizes investment in this sector. The government has also submitted an anticorruption law to parliament.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their prudent macroeconomic
policies and welcomed Algeria’s robust economic performance in recent years, noting
the decline in the unemployment rate, continued strong economic growth, low inflation,
and comfortable external and fiscal positions in the wake of high world energy prices.
Looking forward, Directors agreed that prospects are favorable for sustaining strong
economic growth and further reducing unemployment, especially among the young. In
view of the greater competition resulting from further external trade liberalization,
Directors underlined the importance of speeding up priority reforms aimed at
encouraging private sector investment and job creation, and accelerating the transition
to a market economy. The considerable increase in hydrocarbon revenue provides an
excellent opportunity to step up the pace of economic and social development.
Directors noted the authorities’ decision to use part of the fiscal space created by the
higher hydrocarbon revenues to increase public investment. The investment program
appropriately envisages building much-needed public infrastructure, developing human
capital, improving public services, supporting economic activity, and expanding housing.
While some caution was expressed concerning the somewhat front-loaded distribution
of investments in light of constraints on absorptive capacity, Directors generally

-3-

supported the authorities’ strategy of making upfront expenditure authorizations as a
signal to economic agents that investment resources will be available over a longer time
horizon. At the same time, Directors stressed that the high quality of public spending
needs to be assured. In this context, they welcomed the authorities’ intention to take into
account the recommendations of the ongoing public expenditure review undertaken in
cooperation with the World Bank.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ resolve to maintain fiscal sustainability over the
medium term. They stressed the importance of preparing comprehensive medium-term
budget projections, and limiting increases in real wages to increases in productivity in
the non-hydrocarbon sector in order to preserve Algeria’s competitiveness as the
economy opens up further.
Directors emphasized that sound management of hydrocarbon wealth will be critical to
maintaining macroeconomic stability and enhancing the competitiveness of the
nonhydrocarbon sector, and advised setting fiscal policy within a long-term framework.
Appropriate coordination between fiscal and monetary policies and the continued
transparent use of hydrocarbon revenues will also be needed. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ intention to reconsider the role of the oil stabilization fund—the Fonds de
régulation des recettes (FRR)—including transforming it into a savings/financing
account; such an account should be fully integrated into the budget. Some Directors
encouraged Algeria to participate in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
Directors commended the authorities for the prudent conduct of monetary policy that
has kept inflation under control. However, the planned increase in public investment and
the current strong growth of credit to the economy could complicate monetary
management. Directors encouraged the authorities to consider tightening the monetary
stance by raising the Bank of Algeria’s (BA) policy interest rate to a positive level in real
terms, and to strengthen the BA control over base money.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to continue implementing the managed
float of the exchange rate of the dinar in a flexible manner. They noted the pressures for
a real appreciation resulting from the increase in oil prices and the current economic
growth. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their commendable work
toward ensuring the free convertibility of the dinar for international current transactions,
in line with recent Fund technical assistance recommendations.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ reform program to develop a stronger and more
efficient banking system. They urged the authorities to push ahead with the privatization
of several public banks, improve the management and governance of the remaining
public banks, and promote competition in the sector. Continued improvement of the
operational framework for financial intermediation, including by ensuring that the
banking commission can enforce prudential regulations effectively, will be critical.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue the ongoing modernization of the
payments system, as well as their capacity building efforts in banking supervision, with
Fund technical assistance.

-4-

Directors welcomed Algeria’s commitment to trade liberalization and the ratification of
the AAEU in 2005. They encouraged the authorities to step up the negotiations for the
country’s accession to the World Trade Organization. They considered that regional
trade facilitation and integration would enhance the positive impact of the AAEU and
help attract foreign direct investment.
Directors urged the authorities to take advantage of the current favorable economic
conditions to accelerate their efforts at improving the business environment to support
private sector-led growth. Adequate resources need to be mobilized in support of further
market-based reforms, including to limit the social cost of priority reforms in the public
banking and public enterprise sectors. The tax system should be streamlined by
eliminating exemptions, and the tax burden on businesses should be reduced in order to
stimulate investment and job creation. Directors recommended reducing further the
state’s direct involvement in the productive sectors, and subjecting all remaining public
enterprises to annual external audits in line with international standards, and publishing
the results.
Directors praised the authorities’ policy to prepay external debt, and welcomed Algeria’s
voluntary advance repurchase to the Fund. They encouraged the authorities to continue
their efforts to seek a settlement of bilateral debt issues with Russia.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ support for the HIPC Initiative, but encouraged their
full participation in the Initiative.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision for Algeria to participate in the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS). They encouraged them to continue their efforts to
improve data coverage, quality, and timeliness, in order to support effective policy
making.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after
Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board
in a particular case. The staff report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation with Algeria is also available.

Statement by Abbas Mirakhor, Executive Director for Algeria
February 13, 2006

As underscored in the staff report and in previous Board meetings, Algeria has progressively
strengthened macroeconomic stability in recent years, and has taken important strides in
reforming and liberalizing its economy. As a result, the country has achieved high growth,
significant reduction in unemployment, and substantial improvement in the living standard of
the population. To fully consolidate macro stability and achieve sustainable higher growth,
reform efforts will be enhanced with greater reliance on an expanded role for the private
sector as the engine of growth. The authorities have seized the opportunity of the increase in
international hydrocarbon prices to accelerate the pace of fiscal consolidation, saving most of
the additional revenue, maintaining control over current spending, and using part of the
available fiscal space to increase the much needed capital expenditure.
Underpinned by the 2003-05 Economic Recovery Program, growth averaged more than
5 percent, real per capita GDP increased by 4 percent a year on average, and the
unemployment rate fell from 23.7 percent to 15.3 percent. The central government’s fiscal
position recorded a surplus of more than 9 percent of GDP on average over the past three
years, as against virtual balance in 2002. Additional hydrocarbon revenues and prudent fiscal
stance, combined with active debt management policy, led to a decline in gross government
debt-to-GDP ratio by half over the period—on a net basis, the government debt-to-GDP ratio
decreased from 38 percent to 4 percent. Over the same period, the current account recorded
an annual surplus of more than 14 percent on average, while the ratio of international
reserves to external debt increased from 1.0 in 2002 to 3.4 in 2005.
The authorities remain cognizant of the considerable challenges that still lie ahead: high
unemployment, with youth unemployment of 32.5 percent; infrastructure in need of
considerable further attention; public enterprise restructuring process yet to be completed;
and the role of the private sector to be strengthened.
Recent economic developments
Real GDP expanded by 5.3 percent in 2005, led by buoyant activity in the construction and
services sectors, steady agricultural growth, and higher hydrocarbon production and export.
Reflecting prudent fiscal and monetary policies, inflation slowed to 1.6 percent from
4 percent in 2004. Strengthened hydrocarbon and nonhydrocarbon revenues, careful selection
and monitoring of capital expenditure, and prudent current spending contributed to further
improvement in the fiscal position; overall budget surplus was about 12 percent of GDP
despite larger infrastructural investment.

-2Building on recommendations of a technical assistance mission on liquidity management, the
central bank (BA) took additional measures to mop up excess liquidity, including increasing
the amount of deposit auctions, extending maturity of a large part of these deposits, raising
its policy interest rate, and introducing a 24-hour deposit facility. Despite these actions, credit
to the private sector continued to support buoyant activity in the nonhydrocarbon economy
leading to further decline in unemployment.
On the external front, strong export revenues offset higher imports due, in part, to the public
investment program and the entry into force of the Association Agreement with the European
Union (AAEU). The current account surplus strengthened further, exceeding 18 percent of
GDP, thus allowing additional accumulation of international reserves. The authorities
continued advanced repayment of external debt, including early repurchase of the
outstanding financial obligations to the Fund, bringing the external debt-to-GDP ratio to
16.5 percent and the debt service ratio to 12 percent and substantially strengthening external
viability. The authorities intend to accelerate early debt repayments in 2006, including to
other multilateral creditors.
Short- and medium-term policies
As detailed in the 2005-09 Growth Consolidation Plan (GCP), the authorities reiterate their
commitment to address the remaining agenda of reforms. The ongoing and planned policies
and reform actions, described below, attest to the strength and seriousness of this
commitment. The considerable progress achieved in consolidating political stability and
improving the security environment, as well as the strong financial position, provide a
fortuitous opportunity for successful implementation of the reform agenda.
Fiscal sustainability remains the centerpiece of the medium-term strategy. The strong fiscal
performance over the past several years has allowed for a sizable accumulation of savings,
thus providing resources for the implementation of the public investment program under the
GCP. The authorities are carefully considering staff’s recommendation for the management
of the hydrocarbon revenues in the context of a longer-term fiscal framework. They look
forward to further consultation with the staff on this issue as well as on the possibility of
transforming the stabilization fund into a savings/financing account that would be fully
integrated into the budget.
The authorities remain vigilant to the need to balance accumulation of financial savings for
intergenerational equity and the more urgent demands for infrastructure, education, health,
and other social spendings. While acknowledging the appropriateness of the authorities’
investment program, staff raise concerns regarding the front-loading of the planned spending.
However, it should be noted that the budgeted capital spending is more evenly distributed
over the 2005-09 period (Table 3 of the staff report) than implied in paragraph 15 of the staff
report.
The front-loading of the program authorizations reflects identified programs that are
scheduled to be completed over the period of several years. The authorities view the process
of upfront expenditure authorizations as a signal of the assurance to economic agents of the

-3availability of the necessary resources over the horizon of the investment period. Actual
annual appropriations will be allocated in the future budgets, with due consideration to the
selection and monitoring of the projects, their macroeconomic implications as well as to the
absorptive capacity constraints. They are fully cognizant of the latter limitation and the
potential risk of adverse impact of an unsustainably rapid pace of implementation on the
quality of spending. The ongoing public expenditure review with World Bank assistance
should lead to adoption of measures that would mitigate against such risk. Along with the
rationalization of capital expenditure, efforts to contain current spending will be sustained,
including through a prudent wage policy to preserve the competitiveness of the economy.
In view of the volatility of hydrocarbon prices, priority is attached to enhancing
nonhydrocarbon revenues; important progress is being made to improve tax administration.
Particularly noteworthy is the launching of operations of the large taxpayers department, the
transfer of remaining non-tax functions to the treasury, the simplification of identification
procedures, and progress in restructuring the tax office network for the remaining taxpayers.
Along with Fund technical assistance, the tax modernization strategy is benefiting from other
multilateral (World Bank and the European Union) and bilateral assistance. Further, the
authorities are considering staff’s recommendation for a tax policy review.
The flexible exchange rate regime continues to serve the economy well, and BA remains
committed to monitoring developments in line with its objective of minimizing deviations of
the real effective exchange rate from its equilibrium level. In view of increased trade
liberalization in the context of the AAEU and the expected WTO membership, a recent Fund
technical assistance mission has suggested a number of useful recommendations aimed at
improving the exchange rate and payments systems. The authorities are taking steps to
implement these recommendations: they have already drafted a new, unified regulatory
framework and have requested the mission’s comments on the draft before its final approval.
They look forward to receiving the TA mission’s final report to take further actions as
needed.
Financial sector reform has received strong political support as a priority in the authorities’
agenda, and important progress is being made in this area. In addition to strengthening
banking supervision, the authorities have articulated a reform strategy based on the FSAP
recommendations. Accordingly, the privatization of one public bank is well advanced; a
contract has been signed recently with a foreign investment bank to assist in implementing
the process in 2006. Preliminary indications suggest strong interest from reputable foreign
strategic investors. The authorities attach high importance to the success of this process as it
will have a positive demonstration effect on the envisaged privatization of two other public
banks already slated for divestiture. Other ongoing reforms in the sector include:
¾ modernization of the payment system, entailing improved information and accounting
systems. The new Real Time Gross Settlements system will be launched shortly, and
the Retail Payments system will be established later this year. In addition to
improving financial intermediation, this will contribute to enhancing the quality and
timeliness of data reporting, including in the area of public finances and further
facilitating enhanced supervision;

-4-

¾ improving governance in the banking sector, particularly through strengthened
performance contracts and the replacement of quasi-fiscal activities with direct
budget support in line with FSAP recommendations. These and other steps in the
context of the ongoing MFD technical assistance should address decisively the issue
of nonperforming loans in public banks; and
¾ consideration of options to improve performance of the remaining public banks,
including through corporatization and the use of management contracts.
It is worth noting that, as required by the Banking Commission, all public banks are currently
being audited by reputable international auditing firms. The audit reports should provide
further guidance in improving the institutional capacity and financial performance of these
banks.
To strengthen the insurance sector, the parliament has passed a new law that establishes an
independent supervisory commission and a guaranty fund, and allows participation of foreign
insurance companies in this sector. The parliament has also adopted a law on the
securitization of mortgages that should further encourage the development of this market.
This effort will be enhanced through measures that would facilitate the issuance of property
titles. Moreover, a draft law on establishment of investment funds has been submitted to
parliament for approval. To further deepen the domestic financial market, the authorities are
preparing legislation that would allow creation of credit unions.
Sustained efforts have been made thus far to reduce the role of the public sector in the
economy, with this sector now representing only 20 percent of nonhydrocarbon value-added.
As can be viewed from the table below, important privatization efforts in various sectors
have been made over the past three years.

In addition, contracts with foreign companies to manage water distribution are either signed
or are under consideration. Strong efforts are being made to advance further the divestiture
process.
In March 2005, the parliament approved a new law to strengthen competition in the
hydrocarbon sector. As summarized in Box 3 of the staff report, the law introduces major
developments in the sector. Particularly noteworthy aspects of the law are:

-5¾ elimination of the obligation for foreign investors to enter into partnership with
Sonatrach, the national oil company;
¾ liberalization of transportation and downstream activities in the hydrocarbon sector;
¾ establishment of two regulatory agencies, one responsible for tendering upstream
contracts and the other for issuing downstream permits; and
¾ establishment of investors’ rights and obligations.
The authorities are committed to further improvements of the business climate to support
expansion of private investment and accelerate growth. To this end, a high-level, multi-sector
task force, assisted by the World Bank, has been established recently to propose policies.
Based on the recommendations of the task force, concrete actions would be taken in the
course of the year. Efforts are also directed to improving governance, e.g., adoption of a new
law on combating corruption and the strengthening of the judiciary system. Moreover, an
organic law governing public finances is drafted for submission to the parliament.
There has been considerable improvement over the past years in data provision, and the
authorities are determined to address the remaining weaknesses, consistent with Fund advice.
To this end, they have subscribed to the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System.
As in the past, my Algerian authorities look forward to the Board discussion of this year’s
Article IV report and to the views and guidance of Executive Directors. They appreciate the
participation of the Managing Director in the ongoing trade facilitation process among the
Maghreb countries.
