Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2011 Consultation with Georgia
Approved by David Owen and Dominique Desruelle
March 7, 2011


Discussions for the 2011 Article IV consultation with Georgia took place in Tbilisi from
February 2–17, 2011. The staff team comprised E. Gardner (head and Senior Resident
Representative), E. Martin, A. Luca (all MCD), L. Eyraud (FAD), I. Halikias (SPR), and
N. Sharashidze (Resident Representative Office). The mission met with the Prime
Minister, the Ministers of Finance, Agriculture, Health and Social Affairs, and
Infrastructure and Regional Development, the Governor of the National Bank of Georgia
(NBG), and other senior government officials. It also met with representatives of the
commercial banks, the private sector, and the donor community. The mission held a press
conference and issued a concluding statement.



Georgia is on the 24-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was
concluded on March 23, 2009. On that occasion, Executive Directors observed that the
Georgian economy had been seriously affected by the August 2008 armed conflict and
the global downturn. They supported the authorities’ plans to contain the economic
slowdown through a donor-financed fiscal stimulus and a reorientation of expenditures.
Directors took note of the staff assessment that the real effective exchange rate was
overvalued and observed that the authorities’ commitment to exchange rate flexibility
and structural reforms to enhance competitiveness should help correct the overvaluation.
Directors recommended that all instruments of monetary policy be deployed in support of
the authorities’ adjustment strategy to preserve external stability.



Georgia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, effective December
20, 1996. Georgia’s exchange rate regime is classified as “floating.” Georgia maintains a
multiple currency practice (MCP), which preceded the program, arising from the fact that
the official exchange rate used by the government may differ by more than 2 percent
from freely determined market rates. In practice, the official and market rates have never
differed by more than 2 percent since the introduction of foreign exchange auctions in
March 2009, when the market rate became more flexible. Staff does not recommend
approval of this MCP.



Economic data are broadly adequate for surveillance and program monitoring. Georgia
participates in the GDDS and subscribed to the SDDS in May 2010.



The authorities indicated that they would consent to the publication of the staff report.

Executive Summary
The policy response to the crisis has succeeded in stabilizing the economy and restoring
confidence. The economy is recovering at a solid pace, with real GDP growth expected to
have exceeded 6 percent in 2010 and projected at 5½ percent in 2011. Supported by the
cyclical upturn, the fiscal position has improved sizably and the 2011 budget implies
substantial additional adjustment, with the deficit projected to decline from 9.2 percent of
GDP in 2009 to 3.9 percent of GDP in 2011. Inflation has risen to 12 percent on the back of
rising commodity prices, but core inflation remains subdued. While the recovery of FDI has
been slower than initially anticipated, the overall external position has continued to improve,
as reflected in stable foreign exchange rate market conditions.
In the short term, the authorities’ main challenge is to limit the impact of the recent
commodity-price shock on the most vulnerable and to contain inflationary risks. To alleviate
the social impact of higher food and energy prices, the authorities have issued transferable
electricity vouchers and are considering increases in social spending. With regard to
inflation, the monetary tightening to date should help stabilize inflation expectations. Staff
and the authorities agreed that further tightening should be contingent on evidence that
inflation is not abating as projected or credit is growing too fast.
Turning to the medium term, the main challenge is to transition from recovery to durable
growth by addressing remaining adjustment needs—both fiscal and external—against an
external environment that remains unsettled. The authorities have taken a more proactive
approach to economic growth, with emphasis on structural reforms in agriculture and
targeted public investment to improve productivity and attract private investment. Staff
stressed the need to ensure that the new strategy is consistent with fiscal policy’s goal of
bringing the deficit to a sustainable position over the medium term (1½ percent of GDP by
2016). Despite the significant external adjustment already achieved since 2008, the current
account deficit remains, by most measures, unsustainably high. The cyclical recovery in
partner countries and, as noted by the authorities, productivity gains from structural reforms
should help narrow the deficit over the medium term. The authorities agreed with staff that
exchange rate flexibility should also remain a central instrument of adjustment. In the event
of continued instability in international financial markets, balance-of-payments gaps could
reemerge in 2012–14 on account of debt rollover needs.

I.

THE POLICY RESPONSE TO THE TWIN CRISES AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

1.
The government moved forcefully to counter the economic impact of the August
2008 conflict with Russia and global financial crisis (Figures 1 and 2). Access to a large
package of international financial support, combined with Georgia’s relatively low public
debt at the outset of the crisis, allowed the government to put in place a strong
countercyclical fiscal policy response—the total fiscal stimulus injected into the economy in
2008 and in 2009 was equivalent to nearly 10 percent of GDP.
2.
Monetary and prudential policy easing was, however, unable to prevent a sharp
credit squeeze. The confidence shock triggered by the war and subsequent political
instability led to a 29 percent loss of deposits (exchange rate adjusted), much larger than in
comparable countries. In a context of volatile domestic and external funding, banks moved to
increased liquidity buffers. The authorities sought to boost liquidity and restore credit growth
through cuts in policy rates and reserve requirements, direct liquidity support, and a
loosening of prudential regulations. However, in the highly dollarized financial system, these
policies had a limited impact on on-shore dollar market interest rates and could not prevent a
sizable contraction in credit.
3.
Although the loss of private external and domestic financing was generally
larger than in comparable crisis economies, official financial support and the policy
response led to a much lower overall output contraction. They also helped avert a large
overshooting of the exchange rate, which, in a dollarized context, would have led to even
larger economic and financial dislocation.
4.
The external financing gap opened by the twin crises was closed by a
combination of current account adjustment and official financing. Current account
adjustment was in large part driven by the fall in private demand and of import-intensive
FDI, but also by real exchange rate depreciation (18 percent peak to trough). The current
account adjustment was large but consistent with bringing it closer to a sustainable position.
Reliance on official financing (including from the Fund) to cover the remaining private
sector financing gap through intervention was deemed appropriate on the expectation that
private financial inflows would rebound.

5.
The economy is recovering at a solid pace, with real GDP growth expected to
exceed 6 percent in 2010. Encouragingly, growth was broad based across all economic
sectors, driven by a rebound of credit to the private sector and strong export demand. The
recovery of private sector growth enabled the government to begin withdrawing the fiscal
stimulus, with a resulting narrowing of the fiscal deficit to 6.6 percent of GDP in 2010 from
9.2 percent in 2009—driven essentially by a tightening of current spending. The recovery of
FDI has been slower than initially anticipated. However, the private sector external position
has improved since mid-2010, reflecting an increase in other private financial inflows and a
narrowing of the current account deficit. The resulting abatement of exchange rate pressures
has allowed the central bank to reduce intervention and strengthen its net international
reserve position. While FDI inflows continue to disappoint relative to the levels prevailing
prior to the crisis, at 5 percent of GDP in 2010 they remain quite respectable by international
standards.
II.

STRENGTHENING THE EXIT STRATEGY AND THE
FOUNDATIONS FOR SUSTAINED GROWTH

6.
The policy response to the twin crises of 2008–09 succeeded in averting a much
deeper economic contraction, but vulnerabilities remain. The countercyclical fiscal
response led to significant increases in the government deficit and public debt (from 22
percent of GDP in 2007 to 39 percent in 2010). Private sector balance sheets have also been
weakened by the crisis, as evidenced by higher loan dollarization and indebtedness and, for
the banks, a deteriorated loan portfolio, although the increase in nonperforming loans (NPLs)
also reflects vulnerabilities built up prior to the crisis. Meanwhile, the external environment
is likely to remain volatile and the much expected rebound of FDI appears increasingly
uncertain.
7.

The main economic policy challenges going forward are to:



create the conditions for solid economic growth even in the absence of a strong
rebound of FDI, while preserving a viable external position;



strengthen public balance sheets;



maintain price stability; and



prevent the emergence of new imbalances and systemic risks in the private sector as
credit and external borrowing resume.

8.
As a basis for the discussions, staff developed a medium-term scenario which
relies on a set of consistent policies that address the above challenges (Box 1). The main
drivers of the scenario are: a moderate recovery of private capital inflows, which necessitates
convergence of the current account deficit to 5.5 percent of GDP over the medium term; and

8

convergence of the government deficit to a level consistent with a steady decline in the
public debt-to-GDP ratio.
Box 1. Georgia: Medium-term Scenario: Assumptions and Underlying Policies
GDP and inflation
The scenario projects real GDP growth of 5½ percent in 2011, higher than under the previous
scenario (Seventh and Eighth reviews under the SBA), reflecting a higher carry-over from 2010.
Growth is projected to stabilize at 4¾ percent thereafter, in line with regional peers. End-2011
inflation has been revised up to 8 percent, owing to higher commodity price inflation, but would
decline to 6.5 percent in 2012 and then gradually to 5 percent.
Balance of payments
FDI increases from 5 to 6 percent of GDP over the medium term, compared to nearly 8 percent
under the staff’s previous scenario. Gross international reserves increase to $2.9 million by end2016, consistent with keeping reserve coverage at roughly the same level as end-2010. The
external financing and gross international reserve assumptions require that the current account
deficit decline from 12.5 percent of GDP in 2011 to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2016 (compared with
9.1 percent of GDP in 2015 under the previous scenario). The cyclical recovery of trading
partners and exchange rate adjustment contribute about equally to the narrowing of the current
account deficit over the medium term. The (moderate) real exchange rate adjustment implied by
these assumptions would eliminate the current estimated misalignment.
Fiscal policy
Debt sustainability analysis points to the need for slightly more fiscal adjustment than under the
staff’s previous scenario, with the deficit converging to 1.3 percent of GDP by 2016, rather than
2 percent of GDP under the previous scenario. Assuming an unchanged tax-to-GDP ratio, the
adjustment would come from a 9 percent decline in real primary spending over the first two years
(2011–12), followed by real growth of primary spending of around 3 percent on average per year
through 2016. The compression of real spending in 2011–12 is concentrated in the capital budget,
which in real terms declines by 17 percent as post-crisis spending winds down.
Money and credit
Consistent with an implied increase in domestic private saving, broad money growth is projected
to exceed nominal GDP growth by about 7 percentage points a year over the medium term.
Banks are assumed to finance part of their loan portfolio through external borrowing, all the
while keeping the loan-to-deposit ratio on a downward path in line with prudential
considerations. As a result, private credit growth would average 18 percent per year, and the
credit-to-GDP ratio would rise moderately from 31 percent in 2010 to 43 percent in 2016,
consistent with prudential considerations.

A. Sustaining Growth and a Viable External Position
9.
The authorities considered that sole reliance on a large rebound of FDI to unlock
the economy’s growth potential may no longer be realistic in the post crisis
environment, and that a more proactive strategy is necessary. They noted that by
channeling countercyclical spending

agricultural commodity prices appears
low. To promote growth in the sector,
the authorities are preparing a three-year plan of structural reforms and investment focused
on logistics (distribution and storage), irrigation, access to training and new technologies, as
well as land consolidation. They also saw scope for targeted public investment in selected
other sectors (such as energy), possibly through public-private partnerships. Based on this
revised strategy, they considered that the economy had the potential to grow much faster than
the 4¾-percent growth rate assumed in the staff’s medium-term scenario, but accepted this
assumption as a conservative base on which to build policies.
10.
Staff underscored the importance of fitting the revised strategy within existing
fiscal constraints. This would require a reallocation of expenditure priorities, consistent with
the deficit reduction strategy endorsed by the authorities (see below). Staff also cautioned
that public-private partnerships or public enterprise investments should be considered with
caution in view of the large direct and contingent fiscal costs which they may generate.
11.
Improving external competitiveness is also fundamental to sustained growth
and, in this regard, the staff’s analysis suggests that the crisis-related real exchange rate
depreciation has moved the lari exchange rate closer to equilibrium (see Selected Issue
Paper on Exchange Rate Assessment and Competitiveness). Standard equilibrium exchange
rate assessments suggest that the real effective exchange rate remains moderately overvalued
by 7–9 percent. The current account deficit (10 percent of GDP in 2010) remains large by
most measures, including by comparison with other emerging market

economies in the region. In line with a
more conservative view of FDI inflows,

rate depreciation over the medium term.
Real exchange rate adjustment would be facilitated by fiscal consolidation.
12.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment, but considered that the
required external adjustment over the medium term could be fully achieved through
productivity gains, consistent with their revised growth strategy. They also underscored
the high degree of uncertainty surrounding equilibrium real exchange rate assessments.
Nonetheless, they restated their commitment to exchange rate flexibility as an essential
instrument of adjustment.
13.
The external debt repayment profile constitutes an important vulnerability, with
the government and the central bank facing large external debt service obligations in
2012–14 (including to the Fund), peaking at just over $1 billion in 2013 (equivalent to
8 percent of GDP). The authorities

international reserves. In view of the
volatile conditions of international
financial markets, staff presented the
implications of an alternative refinancing strategy involving greater issuance of domestic
government paper (Box 2), which would involve faster external adjustment. To ensure
against the risk of adverse market developments, staff recommended that issuance of
domestic government paper be raised gradually to cover this possibility. The authorities
indicated that they were indeed considering alternative financing options, based on
developments in international financial markets through the rest of the year. However,

11

they noted that accumulating deposits in anticipation of future debt service would create
political pressures to increase spending.
Box 2. Georgia: Alternative Financing Scenario
Under the baseline scenario, the government’s main external debt repayment
obligations would be financed primarily through the issuance of a $800-million
Eurobond in 2013. This issuance would allow the government to repay the maturing $500million Eurobond and about three quarters of its obligations to the Fund over 2013–15.
To reduce exposure to changes in external market conditions, the authorities could rely
more on domestic financing. The alternative financing scenario assumes a Eurobond issue
of only $500 million and additional issuance of domestic government paper of $300 million
to refinance the government’s component of the debt to the Fund. To avoid unduly crowding
out credit to the private sector, the additional issuance of domestic government paper is
assumed to start in 2011 and span over 4 years.
However, because the domestic paper issuance would be in lari, additional external
adjustment would be needed to generate the needed foreign exchange. In order to avoid a
decline in international reserves, the central bank would have to increase sterilized purchases
of foreign exchange in the market. This would lead to further (temporary) depreciation of the
lari and improvement of the current account. The current account adjustment would replace
the foregone external borrowing.

The authorities consider the present
level of gross international reserves ($2.3
billion) to be appropriate, given perceived
risks. This conclusion is backed by staff’s
analysis, which shows that GIR presently meets
nearly all of the standard and composite reserve
adequacy thresholds (see Selected Issue Paper
on International Reserve Adequacy).
Maintaining these ratios roughly unchanged
over the medium term, would require a gradual
increase of GIR to $2.9 billion by 2016.
Meeting this objective, all the while repaying
the Fund, will limit the room for central bank
sales of foreign exchange in the market over the
medium term. The authorities noted that
intervention in response to temporary pressures
will continue to be needed in Georgia’s thin
foreign exchange market to avoid abrupt
exchange rate movements, which could have
destabilizing effects in an economy prone to
sudden currency conversions. Staff noted that
such intervention should be systematically
financed by purchases of foreign exchange in
the market during quiet times so as to avoid a
ratcheting down of GIR relative to its target.

Reserve requirements on foreign exchange liabilities of banks were increased from 5 to 10 percent on January 20, 2011,
and to 15 percent on February 17, 2011. The net inflows generated in 2011 by this measure are estimated at around
$264 million.

from mid-2008 to end-2010), because of the attractive yields offered. Staff and the
authorities agreed that risks of overheating from these inflows appear negligible at present,
and staff pointed out that in fact these inflows may prove useful given continuing uncertainty
about more traditional types of external financing such as FDI. The authorities highlighted,
nonetheless, financial stability concerns related to these inflows (discussed in Section II.D.
below).
B. Restoring a Sound Fiscal Position
16.
The authorities restated their commitment to durable fiscal adjustment over the
medium term, as contained in their 2010 medium-term fiscal framework. Furthermore,
they underscored their intention of
reducing the deficit to under 4 percent

2011. The adjustment strategy is based
on expenditure containment, notably by
scaling back the capital budget in which they had concentrated their countercyclical
spending. To a large extent capital spending would reflect the phasing out of external project
support. The authorities considered that reducing government spending over the medium
term would be more growth enhancing than raising taxes.

authorities consider that the economic
recovery would lessen demand for
social assistance, but also acknowledged that pressures are emerging for broad increases,

14

particularly in pensions, owing to the steep rise in food and fuel prices. Some limited
measures have already been taken in the form of electricity vouchers, which are by nature not
very well targeted. Staff agreed that a real increase in social spending will need to be
considered in the 2012 budget. It also noted that, while the overall impact of pensions in
mitigating poverty is larger due to their universal coverage and the larger funding, targeted
social assistance (TSA) is much more efficient. Accordingly, it would be important to direct
the largest portion of any increase in the social budget to targeted rather than untargeted
programs (Box 3).
Box 3: Social Programs in Georgia
The social safety net system mostly relies on three pillars: a targeted social assistance program
(TSA), pensions, and health programs.

1/ Includes assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs).
2/ The 2009 increase reflects both the 5.7 percent decline in nominal GDP and the nominal increase in
spending stemming from two minimum pension hikes, the introduction of health insurance for the most
vulnerable, and the increase in the number of social assistance beneficiaries after the 2008 conflict. The
subsequent decine mainly reflects the fact that pensions were frozen in 2010 and 2011.

The TSA program was introduced in 2006, based on proxy means tests (PMT) including over
100 indicators. The benefit amounts to GEL 30 per month for the household head, plus GEL 24
for each additional household member. There are approximately 400,000 beneficiaries.
Minimum pensions consist of a universal GEL 80 monthly benefit for men above 65 and women
above 60. In comparison, the monthly pension was only GEL 14 in 2003. Pensions account for
about three-fourths of the social protection budget, and above half of social spending of the
public sector. Owing to the high rate of inter-generational living, about half of the population
lives in a household-receiving pension income.
The medical insurance program (MIP) targeted to the poor was introduced in 2008. The target
group is identified on the basis of the same proxy means tests as the TSA program, but comprises
a significantly higher number of beneficiaries (about 900,000). The MIP entails a transfer from
the public budget to private insurers in exchange for their services as purchasers of health care
for the poor. In 2009, the program accounted for nearly half the total health budget (the
remainder going to disease-specific health programs).

Staff also noted that the expenditure-based consolidation strategy narrows
considerably the room for contingency measures in the event of adverse shocks, raising
the importance of preserving sufficient flexibility on the revenue front. Staff analysis
points to the fact that the tax system is already quite efficient, leaving little room for
increasing revenues through administrative improvements or base broadening (see Selected
Issue Paper on The Challenge of Enhancing Tax Productivity in Georgia). By the recent
constitutional amendment, tax increases will be subject to a referendum requirement starting
in 2013. The underlying rationale, from the authorities’ perspective, is to preserve Georgia’s
favorable investment climate and avoid a ratcheting up of the tax burden over time.
Nonetheless, the authorities confirmed that an escape clause would be specified through
separate legislation. Staff recommended that the escape clause cover a sufficiently wide
range of contingencies: in addition to linking it to a deficit and debt threshold, it could also
be based on prospective debt dynamics, so as to capture adverse shocks that are not
immediately reflected in the fiscal deficit, such as those illustrated in the DSA (Figure 4).
The authorities said they would welcome staff advice on the subject.
Box 4. Staff Suggestions on a Possible Escape Clause
to the Referendum Requirement for Tax Increases
The escape clause should be triggered under exceptional circumstances, but before
fiscal indicators start signaling severe fiscal stress. It would suspend the referendum
requirement temporarily to restore fiscal flexibility. The escape clause should be forwardlooking and restore full tax autonomy when fiscal indicators are projected to exceed certain
thresholds under unchanged policies.
The authorities expressed a preference for an escape clause based on objective criteria
rather than on political consensus, such as a parliamentary supermajority. Based on
international experience, the thresholds could include: a 3-percent-of-GDP ceiling on the
general government deficit (as initially envisaged by the authorities); a 2-percent-of-GDP
ceiling on the primary gap (i.e. the difference between the primary deficit and its debt
stabilizing level); and a 40-percent ceiling on the debt-to-GDP ratio. These criteria would
have to be based on well-defined definitions, such as provided by the GFS 2001 Manual.

C. Maintaining Price Stability
19.
As in most other countries, consumer price inflation has risen unexpectedly since
mid-2010, reaching 12 percent in January 2011. Nearly all of this inflation originates from
hikes in the international prices of food and energy. Currently, staff does not see any
evidence of second-round effects, but the available price measures are, admittedly, subject to

16

data limitations. In the absence of
additional external shocks, or second
round effects, inflation is projected to
decline by year-end to around 8 percent
(see Selected Issue Paper on Inflation
Trends and Monetary Policy Options).
However, the uncertainty around this
projection has increased recently on
account of the spike in oil prices
stemming from the Middle East turmoil.

The main challenge ahead for
monetary policy is to avoid the emergence of second-round effects that would entrench
inflation at this higher level, undermining confidence in the lari. The NBG has tightened
its monetary stance sizably since June

increased in two steps from 5 to 15
percent (effective February 17) so as to
balance monetary tightening across currencies. The authorities considered that, while higher
reserve requirements on dollars may encourage larger firms to finance themselves directly
abroad, in effect few companies have access to international financial markets at this stage.
The increases in liquidity requirements (on October 1, 2010) and in regulatory capital
requirements (on January 1, 2011) add to the general tightening of policies. Nonetheless, the
NBG has communicated that it stands ready to tighten monetary conditions further. Staff
suggested that further increases be linked to deviations of inflation from current projections
or credit growth markedly in excess of the projected level.
Sources: Georgian authorities; and Fund staff estimates.

21.
The planned transition to an inflation-targeting framework should eventually
anchor expectations around the inflation target rather than the exchange rate, thus
allowing the exchange rate to move more flexibly. The path toward an effective inflationtargeting framework is hampered by a number of constraints: structural (imperfect interest
rate transmission), informational (inadequate understanding of the inflation process and

17

monetary policy transmission mechanisms), and statistical (insufficient price and economic
activity indicators to assess underlying inflation and output trends). One of the preconditions
to effective inflation targeting is the ability to affect market interest rates and, through that,
credit aggregates and expectations. In this regard, the reforms undertaken by the NBG since
2009 to improve monetary policy effectiveness and to move to a market-determined
exchange rate system have begun to bear fruit, and policy interest rate signals are now more
effectively transmitted to market interest rates (see selected Issue Paper on Inflation Trends
and Monetary Policy Options). Staff encouraged the authorities to continue preparing the
ground for an inflation-targeting framework by building up their inflation forecasting and
modeling capacity with technical assistance from the Fund.
D. Preventing the Emergence of New Private Sector Imbalances
22.
With the stabilization of financial conditions, in 2010, the supervisory authority
began to restore liquidity and capital
requirements back toward pre-crisis

relatively low credit-to-GDP ratio, there
should be scope for continued financial
deepening, but also stressed the
importance of monitoring risks based on
debt-service-to-income ratios (which remain high) and loan-penetration ratios (which remain
low), reflecting conditions typical of developing and emerging market economies. Although
banks were severely affected by the crisis, financial stability concerns from the balance sheet
impact of the crisis have abated reflecting the decline of NPLs (from 8.6 percent of the loan
portfolio in mid-2009 to 5.4 percent currently) and adequate provisioning. Currency-induced
credit risk (from loan dollarization) remains a vulnerability. While credit dollarization
increased at end-2010, the risk of a large depreciation appears to be lower, reflecting the
modest estimated misalignment relative to the equilibrium exchange rate.
1/ NPLs are defined as loans in substandard, doubtful, and loss loan categories.
2/ NPLs are defined as loans with overdue payments (principle and/or interest) over 90 days.

23.
On the funding side, the Georgian banking sector has succeeded in reducing
considerably its exposure to foreign borrowing, which proved to be a major systemic
vulnerability during the financing crisis. The central bank considers that nonresident
deposits can provide diversification benefits but also create new financial stability risks,
owing to the potentially volatile nature of these inflows. To limit reliance on nonresident
deposits as a funding base for domestic lending, the authorities are planning to introduce a
100-percent marginal liquidity requirement on nonresident deposits in excess of 10 percent of

18

the deposit base. The mission welcomed the authorities’ alertness to new risks and the
decision to monitor these deposits closely. It noted, however, that the empirical evidence of
higher volatility of nonresident deposits was inconclusive—while they declined more rapidly
than domestic deposits in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 conflict, they proved to be a
more resilient source of funding during the subsequent domestic political unrest in April-May
2009. It also noted that financial stability risks should be weighed against other risks,
including that of curtailing a useful source of balance of payments financing. It therefore
encouraged the authorities to review the need for such a measure on a regular basis as more
information on the nature and volatility of the nonresidents’ deposits become available.
E. Relations with the Fund
24.
An Ex Post Assessment Update (EPA) was conducted to review Georgia’s
economic performance during its long-term involvement with the Fund. The report
covered the country’s performance during 2004–10 under two Fund-supported programs: the
2004–07 Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and the 2008–11 SBA. The EPA
concluded that the cooperation with the Fund was fruitful, and the objectives of the two
programs were broadly met. The PRGF helped remove the main impediments to effective
economic policy and promote private sector activity, with a resulting impressive acceleration
of growth. Yet, the program could have been more forceful in addressing risks associated
with overheating and increasing financial vulnerabilities. The SBA was effective in restoring
confidence and macroeconomic stability in the aftermath of the crises, but it remains to be
seen whether the program objectives toward the exit strategy will be fully met, in view of
Georgia’s still large current account deficit.
25.
Macroeconomic policies were generally aligned with previous Fund
recommendations. While staff had recommended that additional tax revenue measures be
considered to bolster the fiscal consolidation strategy, the authorities preferred to implement
an expenditure-based strategy, which proved successful in meeting their objectives. On the
exchange rate, while agreeing with staff’s recommendation that the exchange rate remains
flexible, the authorities considered that intervention was occasionally needed to avoid
excessive volatility.
26.
The authorities confirmed their interest in a successor arrangement to reinforce
confidence and provide a safety net against possible shocks during the challenging debt
rollover period ahead. Its modalities will be discussed at the time of the final review of the
current SBA.
III.

STAFF APPRAISAL

27.
The policy response to the crisis has succeeded in stabilizing the economy and
restoring confidence. The challenge is now to transition from recovery to durable growth.
Managing this transition will require further adjustment in an external environment that
remains unsettled.

19

28.
The authorities’ more proactive growth strategy is a welcome sign of policy
flexibility in response to the weak rebound of FDI. Structural reforms in agriculture could
unlock the sector’s growth potential. Selective use of public investment to attract private
sector involvement is potentially fruitful, but will need to be designed carefully and
integrated in the broader fiscal strategy to avoid risks of undermining fiscal adjustment.
29.
Despite significant external adjustment already achieved since 2008, the current
account deficit remains, by most measures, unsustainably high. Policies over the medium
term should support its narrowing to 5–6 percent of GDP. Fiscal adjustment—necessary on
its own merits—should contribute to this process. Real exchange rate adjustment would also
be needed over the medium term, consistent with closing the remaining (moderate) exchange
rate misalignment.
30.
Balance-of-payments gaps could reemerge in 2012–14 on account of debt
rollover risks. Georgia’s sound policy performance and overall macroeconomic conditions
and prospects place it in a good position to tap international financial markets. However, in
the event of continued instability in international financial markets, an alternative refinancing
strategy could involve greater issuance of domestic government paper, accompanied by faster
external adjustment. The authorities are encouraged to raise issuance of domestic government
paper and lengthen maturities gradually to cover this possibility.
31.
Accordingly, exchange rate flexibility should remain a fundamental pillar of
growth and adjustment. The foreign exchange auction system introduced in March 2009
has already enhanced flexibility (see Box 1 of the EPA). Greater exchange rate volatility
should be increasingly tolerated. If temporary exchange rate pressures need to be resisted, it
is important that sales of foreign exchange in support of the lari be offset by purchases in
quieter times, consistent with the need to rebuild net international reserves and exit from
Fund support.
32.
Fiscal policy should be anchored on the need to bring the deficit to a sustainable
position over the medium term, implying an adjustment need of approximately
5 percent of GDP relative to 2010. Through a sizable deficit reduction in 2010, the
authorities have started to make good progress toward this objective. The 2011 budget
maintains the front-loaded nature of the adjustment, ahead of the 2012–13 elections. Keeping
spending in 2011 within the budget envelope is key to safeguarding the structural
improvement of the deficit, in the event of a stronger cyclical upturn.
33.
Over the medium term, the expenditure-based fiscal adjustment strategy chosen
by the authorities will require some difficult decisions among competing priorities. It
will be important to carve out sufficient fiscal space to enhance social safety nets and to
avoid an unsustainable compression of other current spending, which would leave the
government hostage to large catch-up increases down the road. These constraints, as well as
the need to respond to unforeseen contingencies, highlight the importance of rationalizing the

20

capital budget, and of preserving adequate flexibility on the revenue side. Revenue measures
should also be considered if expenditure pressures cannot be contained and the escape clause
to the referendum requirement on tax increases should be sufficiently broad.
34.
The immediate challenge for the monetary authorities is to prevent the
entrenchment of the commodity-price shock into permanent inflation. While core
inflation remains subdued, the large increase in headline CPI raises the risk of second-round
effects. The preemptive tightening to date should help stabilize inflation expectations. In
view of the uncertain lags and transmission channels of monetary policy, the full impact of
recent policy rate and reserve requirement increases should now be allowed to play out, and
further monetary policy tightening should be contingent on evidence that inflation is not
abating as projected or credit is growing too fast. The authorities’ message that they stand
ready to tighten further if needed is welcome.
35.
The medium-term challenge for the central bank is to manage the transition to
inflation targeting. Over the last two years, the authorities have successfully implemented a
number of reforms to introduce market-based policy instruments and to develop financial
markets. These reforms have begun to pay off by increasing the traction of monetary policy.
Building on these achievements, the authorities are invited to continue building up their
inflation forecasting and modeling capacity and improving underlying statistics.
36.
Given the relatively low level of financial intermediation, the authorities will
continue to face challenges in balancing financial development considerations against
prudential ones, so as to limit systemic risks. Financial stability concerns stemming from
the crisis-related increase in NPLs have abated. With credit growth picking up, the
supervisory authority has moved decisively and appropriately to contain the emergence of
new risks by tightening prudential regulations. Increases in its risk monitoring and
assessment capacity, and the move to risk-based supervision, are commendable. The
authorities have also shown the ability to act preemptively in response to the emergence of
new risks, such as financial stability concerns created by the growth in nonresident deposits.
The authorities are encouraged to review on a regular basis whether the recently introduced
liquidity requirement to limit such inflows remains necessary, given the limited evidence
about the added risks and these inflows’ potential usefulness for balance of payments
financing.
37.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation be held in accordance with
Decision No. 14747-(10/96), 9/28/2010, as amended.

3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels

under the SBA approved on August 6, 2009. The NBG continues to publish financial
statements that comply with International Financial Reporting Standards, and are externally
audited by an international firm in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. In
response to the safeguards assessment, the authorities have agreed to a multi-year
appointment of an external audit firm, beginning with financial year 2010.

Exchange Arrangements:

(a) From 1993 to 2009, the National Bank of Georgia conducted foreign exchange market
interventions through daily fixing sessions at the Tbilisi Interbank Currency Exchange
(TICEX). A temporary de facto exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar was introduced in the
wake of the early August armed conflict. During the second week of November, the
authorities allowed a 17 percent depreciation of the lari. In March 2009, the authorities
introduced an auction-based system for the foreign exchange market. This mechanism is
intended to allow more flexibility and give market forces a greater role in setting the price,
with a view to reaching faster and smoother convergence toward equilibrium in the foreign
exchange market and giving the market greater clarity about the authorities’ policies. In endMay 2009, the authorities officially ended foreign exchange market interventions on TICEX.
(b) The government uses the official exchange rate for budget and tax accounting purposes
as well as for all payments between the government and enterprises and other legal entities.
The official rate may differ by more than two percent from freely determined market rates,
which gives rise to a multiple currency practice. In practice, the official and market rates
have never differed by more than 2 percent since the introduction of foreign exchange
auctions in March 2009.
XI. Article IV Consultation:
The 2009 Article IV consultation was concluded on March 23, 2009.
XII. FSAP Participation:
Two FSAP missions visited Tbilisi during May 1–15, and July 24–August 7, 2001. An FSAP

ANNEX III. GEORGIA: RELATIONS WITH THE EBRD
(As of December 15, 2010)
Since 1994, the EBRD has been active in supporting Georgia’s transformation toward a
market economy. The Bank’s current country strategy for Georgia, approved in February
2010, outlines the following main strategic directions:
 Supporting stabilization and restructuring of the financial sector, strengthening risk
and portfolio management practices and increasing the share of local currency
operations;
 Helping rehabilitate and modernize the country’s road, energy and municipal
infrastructure to strengthen energy security and promote energy efficiency, help
Georgia benefit from its potential as a transit country and improve efficiency and
long-term financial sustainability of its municipal services;
 Provide financing to the enterprise sector with the view of supporting innovation,
competition and export potential, in particular in manufacturing and agribusiness.
As of end-November 2010, the Bank had signed 131 investments in Georgia with the
cumulative commitment totaling € 1 billion. Its outstanding portfolio stands at around € 700
million. The majority of the portfolio is in the financial sector (around 2/5th), energy sector
and infrastructure (1/5th each). The ratio of private sector projects in the portfolio currently
stands at 80 percent. The Bank will give preference to non-sovereign operations. Where
sovereign guarantees are required, donor co-funding on a grant basis will be sought.
In 2008-9, the Bank played an important role in stabilizing Georgia’s financial system that
had suffered from the August 2008 conflict and the global financial crisis. Along with the
IFC, the EBRD provided Bank of Georgia and TBC Bank, the two largest systemic banks,
with equity, quasi equity and loan facilities aggregating $170 million.
In 2010, the EBRD’s operations focused on the infrastructure sector. The Bank signed
several large projects, including Tbilisi Railway By-Pass (€112 million), a sovereign
guaranteed loan to finance the Black Sea Transmission Line (€80 million), the second stage
of the rehabilitation of the Enghuri hydro power plant (€20 million) as well as a berth
rehabilitation project at the Poti port (€8 million) and Adjara solid waste landfill project
(€3million).
The Bank also signed a number of smaller projects in the financial and industrial sectors. The
Bank increased its equity participation in Bank Republic and provided SME credit lines to
TBC Bank and Bank of Georgia (€ 5.6 million and € 15 million, respectively). It enhanced its
Medium size Co-Financing Facility (MCFF) and signed four sub-projects in the
manufacturing, agriculture and health sectors (totaling € 16 million). MCFF has been
working successfully for several years. The Bank also expanded the efforts in promoting its

8
Energy Efficiency Initiative by providing € 3.7 million facility for residential and industrial
on-lending to Bank of Georgia.
Georgia is part of the ‘Early Transition Countries’ (ETC) initiative. Launched in April 2004,
the initiative aims to increase investments in the Bank’s then seven poorest countries. The
initiative builds on international efforts to address poverty in these countries. Through this
initiative, the EBRD focuses its efforts on private sector business development and selected
public sector interventions. It aims to stimulate market activity by using a streamlined
approach to financing, focusing on smaller projects, mobilizing more investment, and
encouraging ongoing economic reform. The Bank will accept higher risk in the projects it
finances in the ETCs, while respecting the principles of sound banking. Since the launch of
the ETC initiative, the Bank’s annual business volume in Georgia has increased five-fold.
Going forward, the EBRD is actively engaged in promoting local currency lending and dedollarisation of the Georgian banking system. Georgia is one of the first countries to undergo
a joint EBRD-IMF-World Bank assessment of the economic policy, regulatory and legal
frameworks for development of the local currency capital markets. Next steps are expected to
include a framework agreement with the authorities on policy reforms required to support dedollarisation, expansion of EBRD lending in lari and technical assistance activities.

Key Issues

1



During 2004-07, Georgia experienced an impressive economic transformation
owing to enhanced macroeconomic policies and structural reforms supported by a
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility-arrangement.



The double shock (the armed conflict and the global crisis) in 2008-09 put
pressure on the capital account, which the country was able to counteract with a
strong domestic policy response supported by a Stand-By Arrangement and
donors’ aid.



Though Georgia navigated relatively well through the storm, risks remain—fiscal
consolidation, greater exchange rate flexibility, and enhanced effectiveness of
monetary policy should be central to the authorities’ policy strategy.



A successor arrangement with the Fund could help the country mitigate the risks
ahead and facilitate access to international capital markets.

The team is comprised of Stefania Fabrizio (head) and Linda Kaltani (both SPR), Alina Luca (MCD), and Luc
Eyraud (FAD).

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This Ex Post Assessment (EPA) Update reviews Georgia’s performance under
two Fund-supported programs between 2004 and 2010: the 2004–07 Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF) (total access of SDR 206 million or 147.5 percent of quota) and
the 2008 Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) (total access of SDR 747 million or 497 percent of
quota), which will expire in June 2011.
2.
The recommendations of the 2003 EPA provide the starting point for this update.
The 2003 EPA (Country Report No. 04/26) noted that Georgia made some progress toward
macroeconomic stabilization during 1996–2003. However, the overall results fell short of
expectations, owing to the pervasiveness of corruption, political fragmentation, and low
institutional capacity (Appendix I summarizes the 2003 EPA recommendations and their
implementation status).
3.
Since 2004, Georgia experienced radical political and economic changes. The new
political leadership that came to power after the Rose Revolution of November 2003
implemented an ambitious reform agenda during 2004–07 that turned Georgia into a businessfriendly market economy and led to strong economic growth. In 2008–09, the economy was hit
hard first by the conflict with Russia in August 2008 and subsequently by the global crisis. The
economic recovery started in late 2009 and accelerated in 2010.
4.
This EPA Update is structured as follows. First, it reports on macroeconomic and
structural developments since 2004. Second, it assesses the objectives, design, and
performance under the IMF-supported programs. Finally, it analyzes challenges and risks
ahead, draws broad policy recommendations, and suggests possible future Fund engagement.
II. MACROECONOMIC AND STRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENTS SINCE 2004
A. Macroeconomic Developments: From Fast Growth to Recession
Georgia enjoyed impressive economic growth over 2004–07, driven mostly by large external
private inflows. This strong growth came to a halt in August 2008, when the conflict with
Russia and the global crisis pushed the economy into recession. The recovery started in late2009.
Economic growth was systematically underestimated.
(Real GDP growth rate, in percent)

5.
During 2004–07, the Georgian
economy performed beyond expectations.
Real GDP grew at an average rate of 9 percent,
reaching a peak of 12.3 percent in 2007.
Growth was generated mainly by large foreign
capital inflows, in particular FDI, driven to a
large extent by privatization. Significant

homegrown structural reforms undertaken throughout the period facilitated the transition to a
market-based economy and fostered capital inflows.
6.
As growth accelerated, new macroeconomic challenges emerged in the period
leading to the double shock:


Inflation picked up in early 2005, remaining just below 10 percent throughout the
period.



While fiscal revenue performance was impressive and beyond expectations (the
revenue-to-GDP ratio increased by more than 10 percentage points in four years) and
expenditure arrears were eliminated, lingering difficulties to contain expenditures
persisted, favoring a procyclical fiscal stance. Procyclicality continued in 2008, with
the fiscal deficit partly financed by the issuance of a Eurobond to be repaid in 2013.

External imbalances built up as reflected by a widening current account deficit. The
central bank accumulated foreign exchange reserves rapidly to contain real
appreciation pressures on the lari stemming from large capital inflows. Despite the
relatively stable nominal effective exchange rate, the real rate appreciated by about
30 percent over the period on account of relative high inflation.
Large external private capital inflows financed the
widening current account deficit during 2004–07.

Monetary and exchange rate policies were not very effective in fighting inflation and
preventing the economy from overheating. The large accumulation of international
reserves was only partially sterilized, and contributed to a significant expansion of
monetary and credit aggregates, which was not contained by the increases in reserve
requirements and the policy rate.

Fiscal policy played a supportive role during the crisis. The fiscal deficit increased
significantly in 2008, mostly due to higher current spending, and increased further in 2009—
to 9.2 percent of GDP—owing to tax revenue shortfalls. Expenditures shifted from defense,
which had increased sharply over the previous four years, to conflict-related reconstruction
and social spending.

While exchange rate flexibility increased somewhat during the crisis, monetary
policy continued to be quite ineffective in supporting the economy. Immediately after the
conflict, facing large depreciation pressures, the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) pegged the
lari to the U.S. dollar in an attempt to stabilize it. As pressures mounted and the reserve
losses increased significantly, NBG allowed the exchange rate to depreciate substantially and
has since moved gradually to a more flexible exchange rate regime (Box 1). However, when
the lari came under pressure again in mid-2010, the NBG intervened aggressively. Regarding
monetary policy, large policy rate cuts from mid-2008 to end-2009 had limited impact on the
deposit and lending rates, while credit continued to contract. Limits on the loan-to-deposit
ratios due to covenants with shareholders and factors that, as elsewhere, undermined the
credit markets, such as elevated credit and funding risks and worsening bank balance sheets,
exacerbated the inability of the monetary policy stimulus to ease credit conditions.
The policy rate cuts during 2008-09 failed to
affect the lari deposit and lending rates.

Box 1. Exchange Rate Flexibility: Some Progress, but the Extent of the Commitment Still to Be
Fully Demonstrated
From 2005 to 2007, in an attempt to contain real exchange rate pressures stemming from large
capital inflows, foreign exchange reserves increased rapidly. Tensions between the NBG’s objectives
of maintaining the external purchasing power of the lari and ensuring price stability arose in 2006, as the
central bank was resisting exchange rate pressures at a time when inflation pressures intensified (figure
below). As a consequence, toward the end of 2007 the NBG allowed the lari to appreciate significantly,
and in March 2008 it declared that price stability was the main monetary objective.
In response to large depreciation pressures in 2008, the authorities pegged the lari to the U.S.
dollar. Immediately after the August 2008 conflict, the lari came under strong depreciation pressures
owing to the confidence shock and the drying-up of foreign inflows. The NBG’s strategy at the time—
supported by the Fund—was to peg it to the U.S. dollar in an attempt to stabilize it.
As pressures on the exchange rate mounted and the reserve losses increased significantly at end2008, the NBG allowed the exchange rate to depreciate. In October 2008, depreciation pressures reemerged and NBG lost about 20 percent of reserves over a three-week period in an attempt to contain
them. Subsequently, the NBG abandoned the peg and the exchange rate depreciated by 16 percent in the
first ten days of November. The NBG has since moved to a more flexible exchange rate regime, though
more gradually than recommended by the Fund. In this context, a multiple-price foreign exchange
auction system was adopted in March 2009 and direct intervention in the interbank market was phased
out by end-May 2009. The auctions led to improved functioning of the foreign exchange market (also
evidenced by a lower share of NBG’s transactions in the total foreign exchange market turnover (figure
below)) and enhanced flexibility of the exchange rate. The frequency of the auctions was also reduced
gradually from three a week to two and infrequent (ad-hoc) interventions later on.
However, while intervention was limited from mid-2009 to early 2010 when exchange pressures
were subdued, the authorities intervened heavily in mid-2010 as pressures reemerged. The
uncertainty surrounding the municipal elections in May 2010 and expansionary monetary and fiscal
policy from the first half of 2010 led to a bout of lari depreciation pressures, which the authorities
resisted with, consequently, a significant loss in reserves.
As pressures on the exchange rate increased in mid-2010, heavy intervention resumed.

The banking sector weathered the crises relatively well, albeit with regulatory
easing and large liquidity injections. Systemic risks have abated, and lending has resumed
since early-2010. Banks’ balance sheets are cushioned by ample levels of capital and
provisioning, but the elevated NPLs and the large exposure to the currency-induced credit
risk remain important vulnerabilities. Deposit and credit dollarization ratios, which shot up
during the conflict, have been declining recently but continue to be high. The authorities are
reinforcing prudential regulations by tightening prudential norms back toward precrisis
levels.
11.
As economic activity resumed, the authorities have started to tighten domestic
policies in 2010. The recovery began in the last quarter of 2009 and accelerated in the first
half of 2010. Output growth in 2010—estimated at 6.3 percent, in line with growth in the
region—was broad-based, driven by private sector demand. Inflation surged to around 10
percent, owing to rising food prices. The current account deficit narrowed, but remains high
at about 10 percent of GDP. Fiscal consolidation started in mid-2010 along with the
recovery, with the adjustment consisting mostly of expenditure compression, though overall
spending was higher than originally budgeted as revenue windfalls were allocated to higher
spending in mid-year. Monetary policy tightening also started in June 2010 in response to
initial lari depreciation and recent inflationary pressures. In the second half of 2010, facing
lari appreciation pressures, the NBG purchased dollars to reverse the crisis-induced decline
in international reserves.
Growth in 2010 is estimated to be similar to
that of peers.

However, market confidence has
not been fully restored, and FDI inflows
are yet to rebound. The recovery of FDI
inflows has been slower than initially
anticipated. While the banking sector has
been experiencing outflows reflecting
mostly debt prepayments, inflows to
nonfinancial corporates have been strong,
mostly due to the July Eurobond issued by
the Georgian Railways.

FDI inflows have systematically underperformed.

B. Structural Reforms: From a
Transition to a Market-Based Economy

2009

2010

Sources: Georgian authorities, and Fund staff estimates.

During 2004–07, structural reforms paved the way for the modernization of the economy
with a more efficient public sector and an economic and legal environment more conducive
to entrepreneurship. Since 2008, as the need to increase policy efficacy and flexibility
became more pressing amid the crisis, the reform agenda has mainly focused on enhancing
the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies.
13.
Until 2003 Georgia was perceived as a highly corrupt and inefficient country
with a poor business environment. In 2003, Georgia scored 124 out of 133 in the
Corruption Perception Index published by Transparency International. Public frustration
eventually led to a political upheaval, the Rose Revolution.
14.
As the new leadership came to power in 2004, it undertook forceful measures to
fight corruption, increase public sector efficiency, improve governance, and create a
business-friendly environment. The authorities implemented comprehensive reforms that
have borne long-lasting fruits. They effectively fought corruption (Box 2), reformed the civil
service, reducing drastically public employment, restored the financial and technical viability
of the electricity sector, and simplified regulations to facilitate business activity. An
ambitious privatization program was also launched in 2004 (Appendix II).
15.
As a result, revenue collection increased beyond expectations. The 2003 EPA
indicated that revenue to GDP had the potential to increase by 4 percentage points over the
subsequent five years. Owing to the reorganization of the revenue administration and the
streamlining of tax policy (Appendix II), the tax-to-GDP ratio increase was almost twice
higher than expected. Georgia’s success is also striking among its peers.

11
Box 2. Significant Progress Has Been Made in Fighting Corruption


Considerable progress has been made since 2004 in fighting corruption, as shown by the 2010
Transparency International survey that ranks Georgia 68 out of 178 countries in its Corruption
Perception index.



According to the 2010 Global Corruption Barometer, 77 percent of Tbilisi’s residents feel that
the Georgian government has been effective in fighting corruption, which is the highest
percentage among the 86 countries surveyed.



The latest World Bank Enterprise Survey (2008) echoes this perception from the perspective
of the business community perspective. Georgian firms face less corruption than firms in the
region: the Incidence of Graft Index, which is an indicator of the importance of bribery in
dealing with government officials, is below the European and Central Asian region’s average.
Georgia's tax performance stands out amongst peers.

16.
Progress in the monetary and financial areas was less even during 2004–07.
Despite substantial advances in improving the quality of banking supervision through the
adoption of new regulations and staff training, a number of important 2001 FSAP
recommendations—mainly inadequate assessment and supervision of credit concentration
and connected lending, and limited supervisory powers related to governance—were yet to
be implemented at the end of the PRGF (some of these recommendations were, however,
undertaken after 2007). Reforms to enhance the conduct of monetary policy consisted mainly
of strengthening the independence of NBG, and increasing the effectiveness and transparency
of monetary policy (Appendix II).
17.
Since 2008, the structural reform agenda has mostly focused on enhancing the
effectiveness and flexibility of macroeconomic policies. This change in priorities was
partly a natural shift to “second-generation” reforms and partly dictated by the crisis-related
need to restore macroeconomic stability and, in turn, investor confidence, and to strengthen
the financial sector. In this regard, significant progress has been achieved in public
expenditure management, banking supervision, and exchange rate and liquidity management
(Appendix II).
18.
Despite their aim to stimulate private sector growth, some tax policy initiatives
were ill-timed, and recent proposals could reduce fiscal policy flexibility. Precrisis

12
proposed tax cuts on income and dividends were implemented during the crisis, aggravating
the 2009 tax shortfall. Also, in late 2009, the authorities proposed to put to referendum any
increase in the rates or the base of existing taxes and prohibit the introduction of progressive
taxes. This proposal (the Economic Freedom Act) would have introduced a great deal of
rigidity in the budget and created risks for fiscal consolidation plans. Ultimately, following
extensive discussions with the Fund and other donors, the authorities recognized the
importance of preserving fiscal policy flexibility and thus limited the scope of the
referendum to rate increases for selected taxes and introduced an escape clause to deal with
adverse fiscal shocks. The triggers of the escape clause will be specified through separate
legislation in 2011.
III. ASSESSMENT OF RECENT FUND INVOLVEMENT
A. The 2004–07 PRGF—Program Objectives, Design, and Performance
The objectives and design of the PRGF focused on reforms to remove the main impediments
to effective economic policy and foster private sector activity. The authorities’ strong
ownership of their reform agenda was key to the program’s success.
19.
The objectives of the PRGF-supported program were in line with the main
recommendations of the 2003 EPA. They consisted in tackling corruption and governance
issues so as to secure sizable gains in tax collections, streamlining government operations,
reforming the civil service, and creating a business-friendly environment.
20.
Although overall the program design remained unchanged overtime, some
targets were dropped or modified, reflecting progress toward program’s objectives and
new macroeconomic challenges. Conditionality was very frontloaded and focused on
measures that would help fiscal consolidation and the modernization of the public sector, and
foster economic activity. In line with the 2003 EPA recommendations, conditionality was
highly concentrated in the fiscal area, in particular on tax and customs collections, arrears
clearance, and social and infrastructure spending increases. Other fiscal reforms were
targeted toward the strengthening of budget execution, transparency, and monitoring.
Performance criteria (PCs) were streamlined mostly in the context of the third review, since
they were considered redundant given the new macroeconomic reality. As signs of
overheating started to emerge, the indicative target on reserve money was converted to a PC
to strengthen the monetary policy framework and better tackle inflation, and a new indicative
target on net domestic assets was introduced. Georgia received extensive technical assistance
from the Fund in the fiscal, monetary, financial, and statistical areas.
21.
Overall, the program was successful— it helped boost economic growth, fight
corruption, strengthen revenue performance, and foster significant improvements in
governance and the business environment. All reviews were completed on time and nearly
all program conditionality was met or exceeded, particularly on tax collections. Quantitative
PCs were almost always met, in many cases by wide margins, while on the structural side
various PCs and benchmarks were implemented, though often with delay. Key to the success
of the program was the authorities’ strong ownership and determination.

13
22.
However, in the later years, the program could have been more forceful in
addressing risks associated with overheating and increasing banking sector
vulnerabilities. As the economy transformed, the country started to experience massive
capital inflows, which, in particular in the later years, were channeled by banks mainly as
foreign currency lending to unhedged domestic customers. The central bank had limited
capacity to manage capital inflows, and the existing prudential framework failed to contain
banks’ exposure to excessive external borrowing. Risks of overheating and rising bank
vulnerabilities were discussed only late in the program. More comprehensive action would
have been warranted earlier on to address such vulnerabilities, in particular through a more
prudent fiscal stance, more effective expenditure control, stronger focus on enhancing
monetary policy effectiveness, and redirected conditionality towards strengthening banking
prudential regulation.
While overall the program design remained unchanged overtime, it adapted to reflect progress and new macroeconomic challenges.

The lack of reliable monitoring indicators limits the ability to assess progress in
reducing poverty. During 2004–07, household monetary incomes, in particular social
transfers, increased in real terms. The minimum pension was raised to $35 per month in
2007, from $7 in 2003. In addition, non-income poverty indicators improved, including
access to and quality of education and health care, and provision of public services. Since
consumption aggregates are not comparable over time, it is not possible, however, to assess
comprehensively developments in poverty reduction during the period. That being said,
poverty remained entrenched in rural areas, which benefitted only marginally from rapid
economic growth.

14
B. The 2008–11 SBA— Program Objectives, Design, and Performance
The SBA, approved right after the conflict-induced crisis, aimed at providing significant
resources in order to replenish international reserves and help restore investor confidence.
The program’s design focused on measures to increase the flexibility and the efficacy of
macroeconomic policies and strengthen banking sector soundness. The SBA was effective in
restoring confidence and macroeconomic stability in the aftermath of the dual crisis, but the
program’s objectives toward an exit strategy are likely not to be fully met.
24.
The SBA intended to mitigate the impact of the shock on the balance of
payments and to restore investor confidence. After August 2008, a large financing gap
emerged as new capital inflows came to a stop. The Fund-supported program was intended to
provide the policy guidance to address the macroeconomic imbalances, to provide large (and
quick) financing necessary to ensure the restoration of investor confidence, and to catalyze
significant external support.
25.
Although Georgia is a PRGT-eligible country, an SBA arrangement was deemed
appropriate. The choice of facility was determined to a large extent by the amount of access
needed, which could not have been granted under the PRGF, but also by the expectation of
the short-term nature of the BOP needs (mainly created by a capital account crisis). In
addition, the requirement of a Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) document for accessing
concessional financing would have delayed Fund’s support.
The program’s design focused initially on measures to stabilize the
26.
macroeconomic situation and support domestic demand. The program envisaged
quarterly reviews, and conditionality focused on accommodating a strong fiscal
countercyclical response, protecting international reserves, and enhancing the banking
sector’s ability to mitigate potential vulnerabilities (Appendix II). The success of the reforms
and the authorities’ credibility on reform implementation built up since 2004 also provided a
basis to limit structural conditionality.
27.
Since mid-2009, with a view to help the authorities prepare for an exit strategy,
the program’s focus rightly changed toward consolidation to help preserve investor
confidence and restore access to international markets. In the context of the third review,3
the program was extended through mid-2011 and augmented (by about 180 percent of quota).
The augmentation was intended to help contribute to a faster reserve accumulation and to fill
a larger gap that had emerged due to lower capital inflows and the stronger-than-initiallyplanned fiscal stimulus. In the context of the augmentation and extension, the program was
revised by rebalancing the fiscal strategy toward consolidation and by moving to more direct
budget support. Throughout the program, collaboration with official creditors and donors, in
particular with the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD), has been close.
3

The third review was postponed to allow for additional discussions on the implications of a deeper-thanexpected economic correction and a revision of government spending plans for the year.

1/ This performance criterion (PC) could not be monitored at the sixth review because data were not available. A waiver of applicability was granted. The PC was eventually met.

28.
Performance under the program in 2008–10 was broadly satisfactory, but
slippages have occurred in the fiscal and exchange rate areas. Fund’s endorsement of the
authorities’ decision to peg the currency immediately after the conflict was justified by the
expected temporary nature of the pressures and the need to shield the economy from
exchange rate risks. From the onset, the strategy envisaged a quick return to a flexible
exchange rate to preserve reserves, which the authorities resisted until the peg became
unsustainable at a large reserve cost. Quantitative PCs were met in most reviews, with the
exception of the NIR target for end-June 2010 that was missed because of foreign exchange
market pressures due to municipal elections. PCs related to the fiscal deficit were also
frequently modified to rightly allow automatic stabilizers to operate and to accommodate
countercyclical increases in spending during the 2008–09 downturn. However, against
previous Fund advice, the authorities issued in April 2010 a budget supplement allocating
most of the additional revenues from higher growth to new spending. In this context, a new
PC on government spending was introduced at the time of the sixth review to contain the
recurrence of supplementary spending revisions. Structural benchmarks were in some
instances implemented with delay. Georgia received extensive technical assistance (TA)
from the Fund in the fiscal, monetary, financial, and statistical areas.
29.
During the SBA, the government made efforts to support the poor by increasing
social benefits. The World Bank estimates that during the crisis the poverty headcount may
have increased from 23.7 percent in 2007 to 27.1 in 2009 (due to weaknesses in the poverty
monitoring system, it continues to be difficult to provide a comprehensive assessment of
poverty). To alleviate the crisis impact, the government expanded the targeted social
assistance and medical insurance to the poor.
30.
The SBA was effective in restoring confidence and macroeconomic stability in
the aftermath of the dual crisis, but it remains to be seen whether the program
objectives toward an exit strategy will be fully met. Macroeconomic stability has been
regained thanks to the supportive domestic policies that were implemented under the
program. As the recovery took ground, fiscal consolidation and monetary tightening also
started. However, fiscal consolidation in 2010 could have been more ambitious, if the

16
domestic capital budget had been contained and retrenched faster or additional more
comprehensive tax measures had been adopted and revenue windfalls had been saved as
recommended by staff, suggesting that the large budget financing by the Fund may have
reduced incentives for faster adjustment. Monetary policy effectiveness remained weak,
although some traction has been gained since April 2010, in the context of moving toward
inflation targeting, as planned by the authorities. Also, exchange rate flexibility has
improved, but the level of net international reserves (excluding Fund support) are yet to reach
their precrisis levels, which was a main objective of the SBA. Finally, the program assumed a
strong recovery of FDI inflows, which has not materialized as projected. Under the program,
shortfalls in capital inflows were to be met by faster exchange rate adjustment, and indeed
the exchange rate has depreciated during the program period. However, because the delayed
response of FDI was viewed as temporary, reserves were used to counter exchange rate
pressures in early 2009 and again in mid–2010 (Box 1). Additional exchange rate adjustment
could have been desirable against the risk of permanently lower FDI.
IV. CHALLENGES AND RISKS AHEAD AND FUTURE FUND ENGAGEMENT
A main challenge ahead is to prepare for facing the high debt obligations coming due in
2012–13. The main risk is a failure of FDI to rebound. Fiscal consolidation and increased
exchange rate flexibility, combined with enhanced effectiveness of monetary policy, should
be key components of the authorities’ policy strategy ahead. A successor arrangement with
the Fund can help anchor confidence and guide the design and implementation of such a
strategy.
31.
The country is well positioned to refinance its large debt repayments due in
2012–13, but rollover risks cannot be ruled out. While solvency risks on the sovereign
debt appear manageable, as reflected in the DSA, debt repayment obligations in 2012–13 are
high. Georgia’s ongoing recovery and rating upgrades should facilitate rollover, but potential
adverse spillovers from the instability in the Euro zone and Middle East and the sluggish
rebound in investor confidence—as shown by the slow return of capital inflows—might
impact the yields. Although the state-owned Georgian Railways successfully tapped the
markets in July 2010, the yield on the issued Eurobond was considerably higher than
similarly-rated sovereign Eurobonds.
32.
The main risk to the macroeconomic outlook and, in turn, to the authorities’
policy strategy is protracted low capital inflows. In the absence of a strong rebound in
capital inflows (which, despite subdued geopolitical risks, have not yet recovered to expected
levels), the policy adjustment would have to be stronger than currently planned, requiring
larger fiscal consolidation to preserve debt sustainability and exchange rate adjustment to its
equilibrium level. There would also be a need to refocus the current growth strategy in order
to promote more actively domestically-originated growth and export diversification including
through the expansion of sectors with significant growth potential, such as tourism and
transportation, where progress has been made, and agriculture, where little action has been
taken so far. On the contrary, were capital flows to rebound massively, there would be a need
to develop strategies to manage them, while avoiding overheating pressures through
enhanced exchange rate flexibility and monetary policy efficiency, and if needed, by
adopting regulatory measures to discourage short-term capital inflows (hot money).

17
33.
In light of the elevated risks lying ahead, pursuing fiscal consolidation is crucial.
A successful fiscal adjustment could be based on reduced spending, consistent with the
authorities’ strategy. However, given the reduced room for further expenditure cuts, as well
as inflation and electoral pressures, the credibility of the adjustment could be enhanced
through the introduction of new tax measures. Therefore, preserving the ability to rapidly
adopt revenue measures could be needed for a lasting consolidation. Increased budget
flexibility would also help create the fiscal space to finance pro-growth and povertyreduction spending.
34.
Fiscal consolidation should be complemented by enhancing exchange rate
flexibility and building up international reserves. Enhancing the exchange rate flexibility
further by limiting foreign exchange intervention to smoothing extreme volatility would help
protect the international reserve buffer, which, despite being recently on an upward
trajectory, remains below its precrisis level and inadequate in light of high dollarization
ratios. A higher reserve buffer would help ensure financial stability, mainly by enhancing
NBG’s role as a lender of last resort in foreign exchange in case of liquidity shortages.
35.
Preparing the ground for moving to inflation targeting can help monetary policy
gain traction. It is crucial to continue to implement the prerequisites for inflation targeting,
including by improving price statistics, investigating and developing the transmission
mechanism from the policy rate to inflation, improving the modeling capacity for inflation
forecasting, and introducing a strong accountability framework. During the transition phase,
NBG should stand ready to complement changes in the policy rate with other instruments
(e.g., changes in reserve requirements), when needed. Gradual sustainable de-dollarization,
achieved by pursuing sound policies and local currency and capital market development will
contribute to enhanced monetary policy effectiveness.
36.
The resilience to shocks of the banking sector should be further enhanced. In this
context, it would be important to tighten regulation back towards precrisis levels, expand the
central bank’s supervisory capacity, and conduct regular stress tests. The merits of a deposit
insurance scheme covering only lari-denominated term deposits should be re-considered.
Risks stemming from elevated NPLs and large exposure to currency-induced credit risk are
difficult to mitigate in the short run and need to be monitored carefully. An update of the
2001 FSAP in due course could help assess the health of the financial sector and remaining
vulnerabilities.
37.
A successor arrangement with the Fund can help guide the conduct of
macroeconomic policies needed to fully regain market confidence consistent with the
authorities’ exit strategy. The key objectives of the program would be to support
macroeconomic stability in order to anchor investor confidence and strengthen access to
international financial markets. In this context, the program would need to design and
implement a sound macroeconomic framework (built on more conservative FDI inflows
assumptions), strengthen capacity for monetary policy, address fiscal consolidation
buttressed by an explicit expenditure cap in order to strengthen expenditure control, and
promote exchange rate flexibility and a higher international reserve buffer.

18
38.
The choice of Fund facility would depend on the existence of an actual or
potential balance of payments need and could be in the form of a blended arrangement.
Georgia is eligible for Fund concessional support. As such, the authorities should consider a
blended arrangement that, while offering the same access options as a stand-alone SBA,
would provide more favorable financial terms than the latter. Also, given the role that the
arrangement would play in guiding macroeconomic policy and providing insurance in light
of high rollover risks, a precautionary (in the absence of actual balance of payments gap)
SBA/SCF arrangement would appear to fit best the needs of the country over the next two
years. In this case, a PRS document would not be required. Given the receding external risks
relative to the current SBA, program monitoring could occur at a semiannual frequency.
However, if risks materialize, a longer-term engagement with the Fund cannot be ruled out.
Under such a scenario, there would be a need for greater policy adjustment, which could be
partly generated by additional structural reforms. Should this turn out to be the case, a
blended ECF/EFF, which would have a longer duration and also more advantageous
financing terms than an SBA/SCF, should be considered. In this case, a PRS document
would not be a delaying factor as it would have been when the current SBA was negotiated,
since such a document would need to be circulated to the IMF Board only by the time of the
second review.

Appendix II. Structural Reforms during 2004–10
1.
During 2004–07 the authorities implemented a comprehensive reform agenda that
helped address corruption, reduced government inefficiencies and fostered the business
environment. In particular, reforms aimed at:


Improving governance in the public sector. Measures included: (i) routine auditing
of SOEs was widened in 2004 to all SOEs with a turnover higher than $5 million;
(ii) management of these enterprises was strengthened by appointing supervisory
boards guided by performance-based contracts; (iii) all public tenders were
announced on the website of the State Procurement Agency; (iv) an ambitious
privatization program was implemented; and (v) a large number of budgetary
organizations were transformed into legal entities of public law with higher
operational and financial autonomy (in particular, 2700 schools in 2005).



Reforming the civil service. A new generation of policymakers was appointed to key
government positions particularly vulnerable to corruption (including in the tax and
customs departments of the ministry of finance and the ministry of interior). Public
employment was reduced by 23 percent. The Police was modernized. State service
became prestigious. The salary savings as well as some donor funds were used to
increase the remuneration of the staff, reducing incentives to bribe-taking.
Misconduct of state officials has been severely punished since then.



Streamlining the tax and customs codes. The government passed a comprehensive
tax reform in 2005: (i) The number of taxes was reduced from 21 to 7; (ii) The bases
of the VAT and profit tax were broadened by eliminating certain exemptions and
special regimes; (iii) The personal income tax rates were replaced by a single flat rate
of 12 percent and was later merged in 2008 with the payroll tax rate (the rate of which
was further decreased in 2009). The VAT rate was reduced from 20 to 18 percent. In
addition, efforts were made to simplify the customs code (2007) and to liberalize the
trade regime, with a notable revision of tariffs in 2006 reducing the number of rates
from 16 to 3 and the top rates from 30 to 12 percent.



Curbing tax fraud and evasion. A number of high-profile officials from the former
administration and major state-owned enterprises suspected of corruption and tax
fraud were fired and prosecuted; the prosecution measures were blunt and publically
broadcasted (2004). The tax and customs departments were reorganized (then merged
in 2007) with greater focus on large taxpayers. An excise tax inspectorate was
established to bolster excise receipts by eliminating fragmentation in the control of
excisable goods that occurred when the customs and tax departments shared
responsibilities in this area (2004). A financial police with investigation authority was
created under the ministry of finance, replacing economic crime units in the power

22
ministries (2004). The authorities announced a one-off amnesty on undeclared tax
arrears to regularize the informal sector (2004). The government established a
revenue service to increase tax collection efficacy, improve taxpayer services, and
develop risk-based customs controls and tax audits (2007).


Removing obstacles to growth in transport infrastructure and energy supply. In
the energy sector, reforms successfully restored the sector’s technical and financial
viability and expanded capacity, through modernization, privatization and resource
diversification Regulations to start and operate a business were streamlined. The
World Bank Doing Business Survey ranks Georgia 12 (out of 183 countries) for the
ease of doing business in 2011.

2.
Advances were also made in monetary reforms during 2004–07. These reforms
aimed at strengthening the independence of NBG, and enhancing the effectiveness and
transparency of monetary policy. The main reforms in this area included (i) prohibiting direct
lending to the government and initiating the phased conversion of the government debt to
NBG into tradable securities; (ii) clarifying NBG profit transfer procedures; (iii) creating a
decision-making body in the form of the monetary policy committee; (iv) overhauling the
reserve requirement system, (v) improving the quality of and access to key statistics; and
(vi) launching the publication of periodical reports.
3.
Since 2008 the structural reform agenda has focused on improving the effectiveness
of domestic policies and strengthening the financial sector.
4.
Fiscal reforms. The pace of reforms to improve budget planning, auditing, and cash
management has gathered momentum under the SBA, with important steps in the following
areas:


Adoption of a new budget system law. The main PFM reform in 2009 was the
adoption of a budget code, aimed at consolidating and simplifying budget legislation;
unifying central and local budgets; and accelerating the budget approval and
execution process. The budget code also introduced program budgeting.



Strengthening of the medium-term framework. Since its first publication in 2005,
the Basic Data and Directions (BDD)—a document that presents annually fiscal and
macroeconomic projections and sectoral strategies for the following four years—has
been underused, partly because the previous budget system law did not properly
articulate the BDD calendar with the budget preparation cycle. In this regard, the new
budget code brings several improvements: the elaboration of the BDD is better
integrated in the budget cycle and will now be submitted to the Parliament along with
the annual budget; the ceilings are included in the BDD; the list of spending agencies
involved in the BDD preparation is extended.

23


Treasury reforms. The authorities re-activated the T-bill market in 2009 and
extended the term structure to two years in early 2010. Another important reform
pertains to the design and implementation of an integrated PFM information system.
The design of the IT system was finalized in 2009 and tenders were made in 2010.
The new integrated PFM information system is now expected to be fully implemented
in 2013–14. In addition, the Treasury is involved in accounting reforms to comply
with the IPSAS norms by 2020 and to complete the transition to accrual GFS 2001.



Expansion of internal audit activities. Several PFM reviews pointed to the need to
develop internal control and audit systems in the public sector. In 2008, a unit was
created in the MOF. In 2009, the Parliament adopted a law on internal audit that
regulates the scope, principles, methodology, requirements of internal audit within the
public sector. This law will precede the creation of internal audit units in line
ministries.



Improvement of taxpayer services, through a number of initiatives: development of
e-filing systems; establishment of a dispute resolution office (2008); e-declaration
service (2009); progress in the risk-based audit functions in the revenue service;
adoption of a new tax code merging the existing customs and tax codes (2010);
transformation of the revenue service into an independent entity with the aim of
increasing efficiency and modernizing tax enforcement (2010); setting-up of customs
clearance zones (2010).

5.
Monetary and exchange rate reforms. Since 2008 NBG has significantly improved
exchange rate and liquidity management, and started the transition to a soft inflation targeting
regime. The main reforms have aimed at (i) strengthening the lender of last resort (LOLR)
facility, (ii) increasing the exchange rate flexibility (mainly through the introduction of an
auction-based system for the foreign exchange market, which replaced the daily fixing
sessions in the inter-bank market), (iii) improving the liquidity framework to enhance
liquidity forecasting, (iv) strengthening the transmission mechanism of policy rate changes
through the re-activation of standing facilities and the introduction of guaranteed access to
refinancing loans, (v) reforming the payment system, and (vi) improving the management of
the international reserves. However, the creation of the Financial Supervision Agency as an
independent legal entity in 2008 and its subsequent merger into the NBG has likely diverted
attention from pressing banking-related issues and stretched scarce capacity.
6.
Financial sector reforms. A series of measures were adopted to strengthen financial
sector supervision: (i) enhanced monitoring of banks, notably by re-organizing the banking
supervision department, and conducting regular stress tests; (ii) adoption of a contingent plan
for dealing with crises scenarios and bank resolution, and (iii) expansion of central bank’s
powers over banks under temporary administration granted through the amendment of the
NBG’s organic law.

24
Annex I. The Authorities’ Reaction
Discussions of the Ex Post Assessment (EPA) update were held in Tbilisi on February 23–4,
2011. The authorities broadly shared the conclusions and recommendations of the report and
thought that, in most aspects, the report adequately reflected developments in Georgia
during the period under review. Their comments are summarized below.


The authorities viewed macroeconomic challenges in 2004–07—namely the widening
of the current account deficit, and the increasing money and credit expansion—
predominantly as effects of permanent upward shifts in the potential output and
financial deepening rather than signs of overheating. They thought that monetary
policy had played a crucial role in keeping inflation under control, and did not share
the conclusion that monetary policy was not very effective during the PRGF period.



The authorities considered that increased vulnerabilities in the banking sector during
the precrisis period were due mainly to the lack of a macro-prudential and forwardlooking regulatory framework, which limited the supervisors’ ability to concentrate
on the major sources of risk. Supervision was instead concentrated on microprudential risks, and the central bank resisted pressures to ease micro-prudential
requirements, which remained conservative compared to peer countries. Moreover,
the authorities did not share the view that concentration and connected lending were
key areas in need of improvement, and believed that the focus should have been
mainly on the aforementioned macro-prudential regulatory shortcomings.



The authorities also pointed out that, in line with a countercyclical policy conduct and
the recommendations in the EPA update, regulation has been recently tightened back
toward precrisis levels. In addition, to address the shortcomings of the existing
regulatory framework, the authorities are moving gradually toward risk-based
supervision, including by taking into account systemic risks, introducing macroprudential oversight, and conducting a more forward-looking supervisory assessment.



The authorities indicated that, before the conflict and global crisis shocks, they were
targeting fiscal balances, and that fiscal policy decisions were based on public debt
considerations, which was on a downward trend in GDP terms over 2004–07. Also,
they clarified that the 2008 Eurobond was not issued with the purpose of financing
the fiscal budget, and that it was rather meant to establish Georgia’s benchmark in
international capital markets. Subsequently, the authorities created two sovereign
reserve funds, in which they safeguarded the Eurobond proceeds. In the context of the
fiscal stimulus in response to the crisis, the authorities deemed appropriate the tax
policy initiatives to stimulate the economy despite their permanent nature. In their
view, the countercyclical benefits of these measures outweighed the challenges that
they would present to achieve medium-term fiscal consolidation. Also, the authorities
viewed fiscal consolidation in 2010 as appropriately ambitious, emphasizing that

25
capital spending was, to a large extent, financed by donor’s highly concessional
assistance. Regarding a possible successor IMF-supported program, the authorities
noted that the recommendation of maintaining the expenditure cap is challenging in
the context of rising food and fuel prices.


The authorities emphasized their commitment to exchange rate flexibility and
indicated that the decision to peg the currency in the aftermath of the August 2008
shock and subsequent interventions were dictated by the need to maintain public
confidence in the financial sector. They pointed out that the peg was abandoned about
two weeks after it was introduced and flexibility was restored thereafter. However,
when the second shock hit the economy at end-September, exchange rate flexibility
was again limited. In early November 2008, as it became clear that the shock was not
of a temporary nature, the authorities abandoned the peg and allowed the lari to
depreciate. The authorities also observed that greater exchange rate flexibility before
moving to the auction system in early 2009 would have not been feasible, given the
preparation time needed to introduce the auction system. Furthermore, the authorities
deemed that the exchange rate pressures in mid-2010 were transitory, therefore
justifying their heavy interventions to contain exchange rate volatility. The latter is
viewed by the authorities as detrimental to the economy, given the high private sector
dollar indebtedness and risks of additional conversions of lari holdings into US
dollars. Also, they noted that, by end-2010, interventions were less than envisaged
under the SBA-supported program and net international reserves higher than the endyear target. In the authorities’ view, this over-performance was to a large extent
attributable to their successful containment of exchange rate volatility.



The authorities also made the point that the recent exchange rate assessment,
conducted after the period covered by the EPA, suggests that the real effective
exchange rate is overvalued by less than 10 percent, compared to previous findings
of a larger overvaluation. In their views, these new results suggest that no additional
exchange rate adjustment was necessary during the SBA.



Regarding the Economic Freedom Act and the referendum requirements for new
taxes and increases in the rates of existing taxes, the authorities pointed out that the
requirements may be suspended through an escape clause, the conditions of which
will be defined in a separate organic law. They stressed that this clause would
maintain adequate tax policy flexibility to react quickly to possible adverse shocks.



The authorities indicated that they did not see the refinancing of the 2013 Eurobond
as a challenge. They emphasized that the Georgian Eurobond’s secondary market
performance is currently encouraging, and that they were confident that Georgia’s
credit history would allow debt refinancing at favorable conditions. They also pointed
out that FDI inflows were not the only source of growth, and that sectors such as
tourism and energy were also important contributors.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 28, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Georgia
On March 23, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Georgia.1
Background
The economic recovery is proceeding at a solid pace, with real GDP growth of above 6 percent
in 2010. Growth was broad based across all economic sectors, driven by a rebound of credit to
the private sector and strong export demand. Inflation rose to 13.7 percent in February on the
back of increasing commodity prices, but core inflation remains low. Although foreign direct
investment inflows remain subdued, the private sector external position has improved since
mid-year, reflecting an increase in other private financial inflows and a narrowing of the current
account deficit to 10 percent of GDP in 2010. The resulting abatement of exchange rate
pressures has allowed the central bank to reduce intervention and strengthen its net
international reserve position.
Riding on the rebound of the private sector, the government began withdrawing the fiscal
stimulus, with a resulting narrowing of the fiscal deficit to 6.6 percent of GDP in 2010 from
9.2 percent in 2009, driven essentially by the containment of current spending. The central bank

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

has tightened its monetary stance steadily since June 2010, initially in response to exchange
rate pressures and more recently worries about rising inflation.
Financial stability concerns from the balance sheet impact of the crisis have abated, reflecting
the decline of non-performing loans and adequate bank capitalization and provisioning.
Prudential requirements have been restored back toward pre-crisis levels, adding to the general
tightening of policies.
An Ex Post Assessment Update (EPA) was conducted to review Georgia’s economic
performance during its long-term involvement with the Fund. The report covered the country’s
performance during 2004-10 under two Fund-supported programs: the 2004-07 Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and the 2008-11 Stand-By Arrangement (SBA).
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their strong policy response to the crisis,
which succeeded in stabilizing the economy and restoring confidence. The economy is
recovering at a solid pace, the fiscal position has improved substantially, and core inflation
remains subdued. Directors noted that fiscal consolidation, exchange rate flexibility, and
effective monetary policy would help tackle the challenges ahead and lay the foundations for
sustained growth.
Directors agreed that the short-term priority is to limit the impact of the recent commodity-price
shock on the most vulnerable and to contain inflationary risks. They welcomed the recent
increase in social spending and the authorities’ readiness to tighten monetary policy further
should inflation pressures persist or credit grow too fast.
For the medium term, Directors observed that the main challenge is to transition from recovery
to durable growth by addressing remaining adjustment needs. They supported the authorities’
more proactive approach to economic growth, with emphasis on structural reforms in agriculture
and targeted public investment. At the same time, it will be important to further reduce the fiscal
deficit to a sustainable level. To create sufficient fiscal space so as to enhance social safety
nets and avoid an unsustainable compression of other current spending, Directors underscored
the need for rationalizing the capital budget and preserving adequate flexibility on the revenue
side.
Directors noted that further adjustment is needed to bring the fiscal and external positions to
sustainable levels and encouraged the authorities to decisively implement their consolidation
strategy. While the cyclical recovery in partner countries and productivity gains from structural
reforms should help narrow the deficit, they stressed that exchange rate flexibility should remain
a central instrument of adjustment. Directors also encouraged the authorities to increase the
issuance of domestic government paper to contain potential external debt rollover risks.

3
Directors commended the authorities for the successful implementation of reforms to introduce
market-based monetary policy instruments and to develop financial markets, which have
contributed to increasing the traction of monetary policy. They looked forward to further
progress in the transition to inflation targeting, by enhancing the inflation forecasting and
modeling capacity, and improving underlying statistics. Directors welcomed the strengthening of
financial sector supervision, and recommended continued vigilance in the face of emerging
challenges.
Directors broadly agreed with the conclusions of the EPA update of Georgia’s economic
performance under the two Fund-supported programs. Structural reforms, implemented under
the PRGF, have led to a private-sector driven economy. There was, however, some concern
that the program in 2004–07 could have been more ambitious in addressing increasing
vulnerabilities. The current SBA has been effective in restoring macroeconomic stability in the
aftermath of the crisis, but the external and internal adjustment is likely to be incomplete.
Directors agreed that addressing remaining vulnerabilities should be at the core of any future
program engagement with the Fund.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mr. Bakker, Executive Director for Georgia
and Mr. Lezhava, Advisor to Executive Director
March 23, 2011

On behalf of my authorities, I would like to thank staff for the detailed and very objective
report. Overall, the distributed set of documents in a clear and open manner describes
economic developments, the policy consultation processes, and the authorities’ views on both
past and future developments. We would still like to draw the Board’s attention to the main
trends in current developments and the challenges ahead as seen by the authorities, including
those widely discussed previously at the Board.
Economic Development Trends
After the contraction of 3.9 percent in 2009, the Georgian economy started to recover in
2010. In the course of the year, the growth forecast was adjusted upwards several times and it
is now estimated to be between 6.3-6.5 percent at the end of 2010. The fiscal stimulus, made
possible thanks to international support led by the IMF, was a decisive factor in avoiding a
larger output drop and in the subsequent recovery.
Against the backdrop of a general economic rebound observed in 2010 and as a result of
revenue and expenditure-side measures, the budget deficit declined to 6.6 percent of GDP
(compared to 9.2 percent of GDP in 2009). The government aims at bringing the budget
deficit below the 4.0 percent level in 2011.
Annual inflation has been steadily accelerating during the last few months. In the February
2010 it reached 13.7 percent. Withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus and reduced government
spending was appropriate, having in mind both recent price developments and the closing
GDP gap. The monetary authorities took several measures for tightening their policy.
As the staff report shows, overvaluation of the exchange rate in place during the crisis was
eliminated or at least became less pronounced. Acceleration in economic activity and
increased competitiveness were reflected in the balance of payments figures. In 2010 the
current account is estimated to decline below 10.0 percent of GDP, down from 22.6% in
2008. Over the last two months the local currency has experienced appreciation pressure.
Although some appreciation may have a positive effect on inflation, it may be harmful for the
competitiveness of the country. To alleviate this pressure and accumulate reserves, the
National Bank has intervened periodically by purchasing foreign exchange through auctions.

2
The situation in the financial sector has steadily stabilized. Financial stability indicators do
not provide much cause for concern. The capital adequacy ratio is 16.8 percent in February
2011 and the liquidity ratio is 40.1 percent. The NPL ratio still remains slightly elevated at
5.3 percent, reflecting high risk taking by banks in the pre-crisis, boom period. Currently the
authorities are moving gradually towards a more risk-based approach in supervision,
including macro-prudential oversight that should prevent sharp deterioration in the banking
sector in case of changing macroeconomic conditions.
Monetary and Fiscal Policy Efficiency Challenges
Inflation developments described above are raising concerns. We need to mention that the
high figures of headline inflation are primarily explained by rising food prices. Monetary
and fiscal tightening measures were taken in a timely manner and their effects still need to
materialize. The authorities believe that second-round effects on prices will be contained.
Even if further negative macroeconomic consequences are avoided, an unfavorable social
impact has already materialized. In order to ease social conditions, the government has
distributed power and food vouchers. Avoiding second-round effects of the rising prices
and easing social conditions while staying within the margins of the fiscal framework, is
the immediate challenge for the Georgian authorities.
Improving the transmission mechanism is the current objective of the monetary authorities
in the path toward inflation targeting. The authorities remain committed to the flexible
exchange rate. The monetary authorities are putting efforts to reduce dollarization of the
banking sector, which should better serve the transmission channel, as well as reduce
financial sector fragility.
Staff rightly identified “the challenge of enhancing tax productivity in Georgia” as an
important issue. Supplemental analysis of tax productivity is an important tool that should
be used more frequently by the staff in country reports. Indeed, tax collection in Georgia has
improved significantly in recent years. Strong political will and a stream of measures aimed
at improving tax compliance have contributed to the enhancement of the tax base and
minimize tax fraud. Driven by the desire to implement a simple and business-friendly tax
framework, the government seeks an appropriate balance between reasonable and
context-specific containment measures on the expenditure side and thoughtful
revenue-enhancing measures.
Concerns regarding a proposed referendum requirement for new taxes widely expressed here
at the Board were duly noted by my authorities. The authorities are driven by dual objectives
here: (a) send a strong signal that, despite the global economic context, Georgia will pursue
its liberal private sector-led economic stance as it is in the best long-term interest of the
country, and (b) retain, as appropriate, access to fiscal flexibility measures that we might
wish to enact to counter the impact of adverse developments. The authorities are looking

3
for the formulation of an escape clause for the referendum requirement that will allow an
adequate margin of maneuver.
Economic Development Pillars
FDI in 2010 was US$ 553 million (about 5 percent of GDP), which is high compared to peer
countries, but is below the expectations of the authorities. They have been conducting an
aggressive policy to attract investors and try to eliminate political or economic barriers. The
authorities realize that FDI is one of the main driver of growth. However, the authorities are
not going to rely solely on FDI.
Agriculture, tourism, and energy are considered to be the main drivers for the economy in the
coming years. The government is concerned about the developments in the agriculture sector;
productivity of the sector is well below the desirable level. The government also considers
that the potential of the energy and tourism sectors are not fully utilized and sees as its role
to reform all three sectors and attract private investment. The government considers active,
direct state intervention to be necessary for the development of these sectors.
Funds provided by the IMF and other donors were decisive for Georgia during the crisis. The
country intends to decrease gradually the reliance on external support. Although Georgia
faces large external debt payments in 2012-13, refinancing of the 2013 Eurobond should
not be challenging. The current Georgian Eurobond’s secondary market performance is
encouraging and the authorities believe that Georgia’s credit story will allow refinancing on
good terms. Given the rebound in the economy, the authorities’ capability to ensure phasing
out of IMF support has been reinforced.
The Georgian authorities are thankful to the IMF Board members for their comments and
suggestions expressed during the previous discussion. The authorities believe that the success
achieved under the programs is one of the best examples of effective cooperation. Both
programs discussed in the Ex Post Assessment of Longer-Term Engagement were of crucial
importance for Georgia. The first one allowed implementation of structural reforms leading
to a private sector-driven economy, while keeping high growth rates. Without the second the Stand-By Arrangement - Georgia would still struggle with the negative consequences of
the crisis. The recent upgrade of Georgia’s credit rating by the major rating companies
should be seen as a reward for the successful implementation of the programs.
