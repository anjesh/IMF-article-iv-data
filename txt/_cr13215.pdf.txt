STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
SIXTH REVIEW UNDER THE POLICY SUPPORT INSTRUMENT,
REQUEST FOR A THREE-YEAR POLICY SUPPORT
INSTRUMENT AND CANCELLATION OF CURRENT POLICY
SUPPORT INSTRUMENT

KEY ISSUES
Inflation has come down to close to the target level and growth is picking up. With
stable prices and a stronger external position, the economic rebound—mainly driven by
trade and investment—was faster than expected. Policies appropriately supported the
stability and growth objectives. Debt remains sustainable.
High shilling interest rates attracted foreign exchange inflows and skewed
domestic lending toward foreign currency. Inflows were well managed and led to a
fast reserve accumulation, creating a useful policy buffer. Increased foreign currency
lending poses risks that call for stronger bank supervision and regulation enforcement.
Program performance was satisfactory. All end-December 2012 quantitative
assessment criteria were met, as were most indicative targets. Achievement of structural
benchmarks was mixed, with progress on publishing crucial data, but delays on
avoidance of domestic arrears and transparency over fiscal operations.
Progress on providing fiduciary assurances to donors after the fraud scandal has
not yet led to full budget support resumption. Donors acknowledged significant
progress on repaying misappropriated funds and tightening spending controls, but
partial progress on sanctioning involved officials and strengthening governance. Only
minimal budget support is projected for next fiscal year.
A successor PSI will support important institutional reforms. These include
modernizing the inflation targeting framework, enhancing revenue collection and
expenditure management, developing the financial system, and improving the business
climate. The program inclusion of an inflation consultation clause signals central bank
commitment to price stability.
Risks to the program stem from external and domestic shocks. A key risk arises
from potential delays in implementing important projects and fighting corruption.
Staff supports the authorities’ requests to complete the sixth PSI review and
approve a successor arrangement. This involves cancellation of the current PSI
immediately upon conclusion of the sixth review.

CONTEXT
1. Despite challenging conditions, macroeconomic performance under the three-year Policy
Support Instrument (PSI) was satisfactory. While the objective of moving growth to potential was
interrupted by a severe inflationary episode, output is now recovering from a historical low; inflation
is close to its 5 percent target level; and international reserves—at times lower than expected—are
growing rapidly. Volatility in growth, inflation, and exchange rates—caused by external shocks and
policy slippages—was costly, but the authorities’ policy response was generally appropriate.
Monetary policy re-established price stability, some tax exemptions were abolished, investment
spending increased, financial soundness indicators remained robust, and exchange rate flexibility
provided overall policy support. Box 1 presents a summary of Uganda’s policy response to key
Article IV recommendations.
2. Progress on structural reforms was also important, albeit slower than anticipated.
Significant milestones were achieved during the program period with the abolition of electricity
subsidies and some improvements in tax administration and public financial management. However,
benchmarks related to tax expenditures, arrears control, introduction of national identity cards, and
budget credibility were missed. More recently, after a fraud scandal that led to donor withdrawal of
budget aid, the authorities moved fast in improving payment systems and strengthening spending
controls. However, plans for resumption of budget support remain unclear.
3. Oil exploitation, economic diversification, and prospects for improved governance
underpin a favorable medium-term outlook. Maintaining macroeconomic stability and
strengthening infrastructure and private investment to promote economic diversification are
medium-term priorities. Oil production, expected to start in 2018, has significant potential, but
poses resource wealth management challenges. Insufficient implementation capacity, governance,
and policy coordination could threaten growth prospects.
4. The authorities have requested a new three-year PSI to back their reform agenda. The
new PSI will supersede the current arrangement, which needs to be cancelled immediately upon the
completion of the sixth review. The new arrangement will support reforms to the monetary policy
framework, tax revenue mobilization, public financial management, and financial sector
development. Importantly, the PSI will also back Uganda’s efforts to improve the business
environment, including by preparing the economy better for oil production. Financing of the
program is set to rely less than in the past on budget support and more on improved revenue
collections, domestic debt, and higher non-concessional external borrowing.
5. The political economy is expected to support program objectives. Uganda is experiencing
a lively political debate with a more assertive legislature and a more vocal civil society. This debate,
increasingly focused on the need to strengthen governance and reduce dependence on donor
funds, would likely result in popular support for the reforms backed by the program. Risks emanate
from high political level decisions that could jeopardize the quality of spending, delay key measures,
or weaken reforms.

Box 1. Uganda: Response to 2010 Article IV Consultation’s Key Recommendations
Maintaining macroeconomic stability. Following a severe inflationary episode in 2011–12, the
authorities tightened fiscal policy, regained control of inflation, and rebuilt international reserves.
Improving revenue mobilization. Some progress was made, but the revenue-to-GDP ratio remains
low by regional standards even though tax rates are consistent with the EAC average. Tax
administration gains were hindered by weaknesses in tax policy and by deficiencies in the status of
taxpayer accounts and in taxpayer audit and enforcement capacity.
Strengthening public finance management (PFM). Despite improvements, investment spending is
still characterized by under-execution, poor planning, and delays in procurement processes. Reliance
on supplementary budgets has shifted spending away from social and infrastructure investment.
Moving to inflation targeting. Many of the key elements of a full-fledged inflation targeting
framework are now in place, and there is a clear plan to advance on the remaining institutional and
operational reforms.
Implementing pension reform. A reform was passed in mid-2011 creating an independent
regulatory authority.
Managing oil revenues carefully. Initial oil proceeds from capital gains generated by company
transfers have been kept in a special fund and earmarked for future energy investments. However, full
transparency in oil operations has not been fully endorsed.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM
PERFORMANCE
A. Growth is Recovering from a Short Slowdown
6. Real GDP growth is picking up from its lowest level in more than a decade (Figure 1).
Driven mainly by investment and trade, growth has recovered to about 5 percent—a stronger-thanexpected rebound from the low 3½ percent expansion registered last year. Fast implementation of
road construction, the start of operations of the Bujagali hydropower plant, and a good harvest
boosted aggregate demand. A pick up in private sector credit, skewed mainly towards foreign
currency lending to large firms, contributed to the recovery. Importantly, the recent agreement on
broad modalities of oil production and the peaceful elections in Kenya improved market confidence.
7. Inflation has been falling sharply since end-2011. A fast disinflationary process brought
down annual core inflation from a peak of over 30 percent in October 2011 to about 5½ percent in
May 2013, close to the 5 percent target. Declining food prices largely contained headline inflation,
while evidence from Bank of Uganda (BoU) surveys and private sector forecasts indicates reduced
inflationary expectations.

8. The international reserve position remains strong (Figure 2). The current account deficit
(including grants) is projected to narrow to 10½ percent of GDP in FY12/13 on account of strong
non-coffee exports and a deceleration of imports. The weakening in imports is deemed temporary,
reflecting disruptions in transport routes from Kenya at the pre-electoral time and clearance delays
from disputes over transit goods fees and other non-tariff barriers. Public sector loans, use of
commercial bank deposits abroad, and other foreign exchange inflows are expected to finance the
current account deficit and allow for an accumulation of international reserves of US$400 million.

B. The Policy Stance has Adapted to the Evolving Conditions
9. Fiscal policy is set to ease slightly this fiscal year (Figure 3). Excluding one-off factors, the
overall deficit at end-year would be 3 percent of GDP, ¼ percentage point higher than both the
projected level and the outturn of last year. Key features of fiscal performance were:


An increase in tax revenue in line with expectations—with over-performance of direct taxes
compensating for shortfalls in VAT collected on imports and petroleum duties.



A delay in investment in the large hydroelectric project Karuma because of difficulties with
the procurement process, but higher-than-anticipated investment in road construction.



A shift in the composition of spending in favor of current outlays following the approval of a
supplementary budget.



An unplanned, but needed, recapitalization of the BoU expected before the end of this fiscal
year.

Fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30.
One-off factors include oil-related revenue, power sector subsidies, BoU recapitalization, and exceptional security and Karuma expenditure.

10. Monetary policy remained focused on achieving the inflation target while coping with
large foreign exchange inflows. The BoU further refined its inflation targeting lite (ITL) framework
by developing inflation forecasting capabilities and improving understanding of transmission lags
and pass-through effects. Supported by this framework, monetary policy was sharply eased once
inflation was under control, with cuts in the policy rate from 23 percent in January 2012 to 12
percent in December. Since then, the BoU maintained a neutral policy stance before reducing the
rate by an additional 1 percentage point in June 2013.
11. High demand for domestic currency from foreign exchange inflows complicated
somewhat monetary management in

for liquidity management and monetary and fiscal policy coordination. Following a decision by
the Ministry of Finance (MoF) to stop providing treasury bills for monetary sterilization, the BoU’s
availability of policy instruments was curtailed. As a result, the central bank had to rely on very
short-term repurchase agreements (repos), while bearing the cost of sterilization on its own balance
sheet. Although a 30–60 day deposit facility was introduced in March, the maturity profile of
sterilization securities remains short, creating uncertainty about the BoU’s ability to sustain largescale liquidity operations.
13. Lending rates have been slow to fall and banks are granting loans only to their most
creditworthy clients, slowing the recovery phase of the cycle. Despite some decline, lending
rates are exhibiting downward rigidity, mainly due to high fixed costs, heightened risk aversion,
difficulties in assessing creditworthiness

collateral has skewed lending sharply
toward foreign currency to large corporations and upper-income individuals. This segment now
accounts for nearly all of the increase in private sector credit growth. As a result, some banks have
breached the 80 percent limit on the loan-to-deposit ratio in foreign currency. Nonetheless banks’
open foreign currency positions remain well within prudential ceilings, and banks report full
compliance with regulations limiting foreign currency lending to foreign currency income earners.
14. The banking sector remains solvent, liquid, and profitable although nonperforming loans
have been increasing and provisioning declining. Financial deepening and inclusion are low by
regional standards, but rapidly growing mobile banking activity is contributing to an increase in
financial access. The BoU has made progress in moving towards risk-based financial supervision.

C. Progress in Structural Reforms was Mixed
15. Recent important steps have been taken to advance structural reforms. In the area of
regional integration, the customs union is in place—although affected by lingering non-tariff
barriers—and some progress towards harmonization of policies has been made. While
improvements in transparency and PFM were less ambitious than anticipated, following the freeze of
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

donors’ budget aid in November the government took action to strengthen spending controls, and
prepared amendments to the Public Finance Management Bill (PFMB) to pursue best practices.
Progress in most areas is deemed satisfactory by donors, though it has been slower in the area of
administrative sanctions to officials who engaged in financial impropriety (Box 2).
Box 2. Uganda: Progress Under the PFM Reform Commitments
Significant progress was achieved on the implementation of actions contained in the High Level Action
Matrix agreed with development partners in response to weaknesses in public financial systems:



Investigations and prosecutions of indicted public officials, private persons, and firms for fraud have
been carried out.



Misappropriated funds have been repaid to donors.



Weaknesses in the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) have been addressed, including
by recruiting a consultant to help improve the security of the system.



Amendments to the PFMB have been discussed with parliament and are ready for official
submission.



The recruitment, payroll, and pension modules of the integrated payroll and pension system are in
the process of becoming fully operational.

Some progress has been made in taking administrative action against responsible officials. The Inspectorate
of Government has not been fully constituted.

16. The authorities have advanced arrangements for an initial recapitalization of the BoU.
The BoU’s capital has deteriorated sharply over recent years, affected by continuous operating
losses, which poses risks to its credibility as an inflation targeting central bank. The first stage of
recapitalization is ready to proceed after a recent agreement that allows the government to provide
BoU with enough marketable securities to raise its capital levels to the statutory limit. This
arrangement will allow the BoU to use its new securities for monetary purposes, addressing a key
institutional shortcoming, as in the past, monetary and fiscal instruments were not distinguishable.

D. Program Performance under the Sixth Review of the PSI was
Satisfactory
17. All end-December 2012 quantitative assessment criteria (QACs) were met. International
reserves surpassed the target with a large margin (½ percent of GDP). The ceiling on net banking
credit to the government was also observed, and the BoU held net domestic assets (NDA) well
below the program ceiling. The indicative target on base money was missed, but did not pose risks
to the attainment of the inflation target. No new non-concessional external debt was contracted. All
indicative targets for end-March, including the indicative target on base money, were met.
18. Progress on implementing the structural benchmarks for the sixth review was uneven.
Production and dissemination of a monthly index of economic activity and publication of tax
beneficiaries and relevant economic data proceeded as anticipated. While government has not sent

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

to cabinet either a concept note reflecting the decision to introduce a treasury single account (TSA)
or a new tax procedures code—both structural benchmarks for early 2013—considerable progress
has been made, and completion is expected by end-June. However, benchmarks related to the
avoidance of domestic arrears, production of a status report on planned public private partnership
(PPP) programs, and transparency over the treatment of unspent funds were missed. The first two
missed benchmarks will be maintained under the new PSI. However, the requirement to publish the
unspent balances on all government accounts will be allowed to lapse, as this issue is expected to be
addressed once the new PFMB is enacted. At the same time, the planned introduction of a TSA
would remove the need to gather individual account information.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
19. The output momentum sustains a favorable macroeconomic outlook. Growth is projected
to reach 5¼ percent this fiscal year and increase to 6 percent next fiscal year. Fiscal and monetary
policies are expected to support the launch of infrastructure projects and a boost in private sector
activity. Average core inflation is projected to decline to 6¼ percent by the end of the next fiscal
year, held back by base effects, but the downward path toward the 5 percent medium–term target
has already started. Some loss of international reserves is programmed in the short term, but
reserves are still projected at 4 months of imports, a comfortable level. The real effective exchange
rate is in equilibrium (Box 3) and debt remains at low risk of distress (Annex I: Debt sustainability
analysis update).
20. Over the medium term, the main priority will be to achieve broad-based growth and
improve social conditions for all Ugandans. With inflation in the mid-single digits, output should
gradually approach its estimated potential of 7 percent. The required investment for oil production
is expected to be a major growth driver, along with productivity gains in the agricultural sector and
increased trade with neighboring countries in the context of EAC regional integration. The current
account deficit is expected to widen temporarily during the development phase of projects in the
electricity, oil, and road sectors, but FDI would finance much of the corresponding gap. As these
projects come on stream, production-related imports would decline, and additional export revenue
would be generated from industries benefiting from better infrastructure. As a result, the current
account deficit is expected to improve gradually but significantly, beginning in 2016/17. Donor
support is likely to be oriented more to project than to budget financing, with the existing space for
domestic and non-concessional debt supplementing higher financing needs arising from the scaling
up of public investment.
21. Risks to the outlook arise externally from a challenging global environment and
domestically from political, governance and capacity constraints. Adverse spillovers from a
decline in external demand, a surge in oil prices, or a disruption of aid flows would derail growth
and stability plans. Domestic risks center on governance, capacity constraints and policy
coordination, and their impact on effective policy making (Annex II: Uganda: Risk assessment matrix
and vulnerability to external shocks).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

Box 3. Uganda: External Stability Assessment
The underlying external current account deficit is
very close to the estimated norm. Although the
current account deficit is projected to remain at
10-14 percent of GDP over the medium-term, it is
significantly driven by temporary FDI-related
imports. If these are stripped out, the underlying
deficit would decline to about 7 percent of GDP in
FY2017/18, a level not significantly different from
the estimated current account norm of 6¼ percent
of GDP.

The international reserve level is broadly
adequate. A cost-benefit approach to the optimal
level of reserves in LICs2, suggests that at 4 months
of imports, projected reserves are slightly higher than
the optimal level, estimated at 3–4 months of
imports, assuming an opportunity cost of holding
reserves in the range of 3–4 percent.3 Furthermore, at
64 percent, the reserve-to–broad money ratio, which
captures potential safeguards for capital flight, also
appears adequate in light of the flexible exchange
rate regime in place. These estimates should be
considered as the lower bound, given the model’s
assumption of risk-neutrality. Other considerations to
accumulate reserves beyond self-insurance against
external shocks may be justified, such as the need to
deal with volatile foreign exchange capital flows and
the management of prospective oil revenues.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy: Gains in Efficiency and Transparency
22. The fiscal stance will be relaxed in FY2013/14 to support a gradual recovery of growth to
potential. The budget will allocate significant resources to development spending on key
infrastructure projects including in the roads, energy, and agriculture sectors. The non-oil primary
deficit is expected to increase by 1 percent of GDP to about 3¼ percent compared to FY2012/13.1
Without budget support loans, the government will count on improved revenue collections and turn
to domestically issued securities and non-concessional external borrowing to provide the financing
necessary to support their ambitious fiscal program.
23. Despite improvements in tax administration, tax policy reform has not proceeded at the
same pace and tax revenues have remained stubbornly low. Staff noted that Uganda lags
behind other EAC countries in terms of the tax-to-GDP-ratio and does not appear to be catching up
to the region’s stronger performers. The

authorities argued that many of the
structural features of a small landlocked

informal sectors have made it harder to

revenue in Uganda: challenging but
necessary).
24. It is therefore critical to firm up the tax base as soon as possible. The authorities intend to
promote a tax reform agenda to raise the revenue yield over time and reduce reliance on donor
support and high-cost domestic borrowing. With oil production only a few years away, this is the
time to prepare the non-oil sector to support the economy’s needs and boost revenue performance
to help shield public finances from volatile oil revenues. To this end, staff argued that a fundamental
reform of the VAT to reduce the many exemptions accumulated over the years would be the ideal
way to proceed. As a first step, the authorities plan to conduct and publish a VAT gap analysis early
in the next fiscal year. Subsequently, they intend to prepare an action plan to guide the sequence of
actions to make the VAT more efficient.
25. Meanwhile revenue measures and improvement in tax administration are expected to
add about ½ percent of GDP in tax revenue in the next fiscal year. These measures will include,
1

production.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

UGANDA

among others, the elimination of VAT exemptions on hotel accommodation, water for domestic
consumption, and packing material. Excises will be increased on fuel, kerosene and cigarettes, and a
mobile money levy will be introduced, but at a low rate to avoid impacting the use of this new
payment option. Tax administration measures will focus on audit and enforcement functions and will
prioritize the hiring and training of qualified staff in the revenue administration, in particular in the
large taxpayer unit. Various non-tax and one-off revenue measures will also contribute to revenue
growth, including higher registration fees for motor vehicles and motorcycles, and a large receipt of
oil-related revenue delayed from FY 2012/13.
26. On the expenditure side, discussions centered on the importance of improving budget
credibility. To avoid the risk of running into arrears or resort to another supplementary budget,
staff recommended realism in budgetary allocations. The authorities explained the parliamentary
preference for compression of current spending, but agreed to make the budget more realistic and
credible. This would involve: (1) aligning development spending plans with implementation capacity;
(2) keeping salaries constant in real terms; (3) allocating sufficient non-wage recurrent outlays to
support maintenance of public projects and offices; and (4) including an additional allocation in the
budget to absorb deviations from the proposed spending profile.
27. Success in scaling up spending to address infrastructure deficiencies will strongly depend
on improvements in implementation capacity and availability of financing. The envisaged nonconcessional borrowing limit of US$1.5 billion to finance key infrastructure projects—for which
feasibility studies are already completed—is compatible with debt sustainability and the absorptive
capacity of the economy.2 The authorities acknowledged that suboptimal project and cash planning,
as highlighted by Uganda’s poor performance on the Index of Public Investment Efficiency (PIMI),
have often delayed project implementation. They therefore intend to revise the public investment

the use of these schemes.

Kampala-Jinja highway project with non-concessional loans during the period covered by the new PSI.

28. Envisaged PFM reforms are set to address the problems of persistent under budgeting,
arrears accumulation, and failure to sanction financial irregularities. Minimal linkages between
budget preparation, execution, and oversight result in poor use of funds and lead to cash rationing
and unexpected use of deposits in the BoU, which complicates monetary management. The
authorities intend to deal with these weaknesses as soon as parliament approves the PFMB (Box 4).
The introduction of the TSA arrangement expected for early 2014 is a key milestone within this new
framework as it will allow complete and timely information on government cash resources, improve
appropriation and operational control during budget execution, enable efficient cash management,
and facilitate bank reconciliation. In addition to technical and legal reforms, efforts to tighten
administrative standards are needed to ensure that all transactions are conducted within the
government accounting systems and that all spending remains within budgetary allocations.
Box 4. Uganda: Enhancing PFM
The PFMB currently before parliament aims to address the lack of credibility, integrity and predictability of
the budget. To this end, the PFMB will:



Introduce a charter of fiscal responsibility setting out measurable fiscal policy objectives for the
short and medium term.



Base commitments on budget appropriations and cash flows on procurement, work, and
recruitment plans approved by parliament.



Bring forward the budget calendar to avoid parliamentary approval of the budget several months
into the fiscal year.



Make the annual budget framework paper and the budget more consistent with the medium-term
expenditure framework and the national development plan to better reflect the medium-term fiscal
objectives of the government.



Create an operational fund for contingencies (at 3½ percent of the previous annual budget) to
address unforeseen expenditures and disasters. This will protect the budget from cuts to finance
supplementary pressures.



Strengthen the links between budget preparation, execution, and oversight by allowing parliament
to review budget submissions together with audited performance for the previous year.



Provide for the implementation of a TSA to improve existing banking and cash management
arrangements.

B. Monetary Policy: Modernizing the Inflation Targeting Framework
29. Inflation has been successfully reduced and current policies are appropriate to contain
core inflation close to the BoU’s medium term target of 5 percent. Nonetheless, risks to price
stability remain as the strength of demand pressure is hard to assess given recent volatility in the
cycle, and foreign exchange flows appear more persistent than earlier anticipated. Moreover, the
stock of liquidity sterilized by the BoU through short-term repurchase agreements and its new
deposit facility remains large—in the order of 2 percent of GDP—implying the potential for volatility
in the interbank and foreign exchange markets. The space for easing policy further could be

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

UGANDA

constrained by an expected increase in bank credit once the Land Registry, closed in December for
computerization, begins issuing titles for use as collateral for non-corporate shilling-denominated
loans. Against this background, staff suggested maintaining a broadly neutral policy stance at this
juncture, and urged the authorities to stand ready to adjust the central bank rate should indications
of inflationary pressures re-emerge.
30. Successful use of the ITL framework in monetary management presents a case for
moving to inflation as the nominal anchor in the new PSI. The BoU requested inclusion of an
inflation consultation clause in the new program as its monetary policy decisions are not based on
the evolution of monetary aggregates, such as net domestic assets, as assumed in the current PSI.
Staff supported this request, recognizing that in fact the central bank policy rate has become the
operational target to influence short-term rates, and through this channel lending rates, aggregate
demand, and inflation.
31. The authorities intend to improve their inflation targeting regime during the course of
the successor PSI arrangement. This would require setting inflation control as the primary policy
objective, even if this involves, at times, that growth would have to dip below potential. The current
framework supports forward-looking policies, with the use of inflation forecasts as a feedback
variable, and management of expectations through communication with the public. Over the course
of the new program, the BoU would like to refine the ITL framework in a number of areas. A key
action would be to strengthen the BoU’s independence and policy autonomy—now hampered by
capital deficiency, lingering fiscal dominance, and insufficient legal protection. Other improvements
include enhancing the communications strategy to properly guide public perceptions, refining policy
instruments, and improving coordination with the MoF, including by addressing the issue of
government borrowing (Box 5). Technical assistance from the IMF will support these efforts.
32. Commitment to exchange rate flexibility sustains the inflation targeting framework.
While the BoU’s interventions in the foreign exchange market to deal with large foreign exchange
inflows were well calibrated and successful in halting nominal appreciation, public understanding of
the central bank’s policy intentions was not necessarily clear. Staff considered that a more
rules-based intervention policy, including by announcing the volume of expected daily intervention,
would be helpful in improving market participants’ understanding of BoU’s objectives, and would
contribute to a well-functioning market with efficient price formation. The authorities were
concerned, however, that this might limit their flexibility to respond rapidly to events in a shallow
and unpredictable market. However, with potential demand pressures and reserves already at a
comfortable level, there was broad agreement that intervention should be used only to maintain
reserve cover and to smooth excessive volatility.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

Box 5. Uganda: Refining the Monetary Policy Framework
Underpinned by a flexible exchange rate, the BoU announces an inflation target, issues monthly statements
on monetary policy developments, communicates the policy stance through its central bank rate, and carries
out market-based liquidity operations aimed at keeping the interbank rate within a predefined band around
the policy rate. However, a number of improvements to the administrative, operational and legal frameworks
are needed to complete the transition to full-fledged inflation targeting:
Ensuring policy independence. The recent agreement to recapitalize the BoU is a major milestone, but
follow-up legal arrangements are needed to bring the BoU’s capital in line with its liabilities, guarantee
independence of policy instruments, end central bank financing of the budget, and, in general, avoid any
threat of fiscal dominance.
Enhancing communications. Greater specification of the inflation target and the length of the policy
horizon would solidify the public understanding that low inflation is a credible objective and help anchor
inflationary expectations.
Refining the interbank market architecture. Introducing a deposit facility to create an interest rate floor
and establishing an intervention timetable would ensure that banks are not left with daily surplus or deficits
positions, reduce interest rate volatility, and promote a stable transmission channel.
Increasing transparency in the foreign exchange market. Clearer procedures for BoU’s foreign exchange
transactions would give greater predictability and transparency to BoU intervention. To the extent possible, a
more rules-based approach to intervention should be adopted and clearly explained.
Improving modeling and inflation forecasting capacity. A more comprehensive BoU’s understanding of
the transmission mechanism and refinement of the methodology for gauging inflationary expectations
would better inform short-term policy decisions.
Strengthening fiscal and monetary policy coordination for operations and liquidity management.
Closer cooperation between the BoU and the MoF—coinciding with capacity improvements for public debt
management—would enable development of longer-term liquidity instruments, improved liquidity forecast
quality, and thereby support inflation control.
Promoting operating efficiencies. To gain credibility, BoU’s non-monetary policy related costs need to be
streamlined over time, while continuously improving the quality of technical staff.

C. The Financial Sector: Sound but Still Shallow
33. Despite persistently high capital and profit levels in the banking sector, there is a need to
remain vigilant to potential risks. Nascent recovery notwithstanding, the damage inflicted by the
economic downturn on corporate and households was severe, and may not yet have had its full
impact on the quality of banks’ portfolios. Though reduced somewhat from their peak,
nonperforming loans as a share of total lending still stood at 4¼ percent in December—twice the
amount a year ago. Moreover, with nearly all new credit over the past year extended in foreign
currency, indirect credit risk will likely increase in the months ahead. Strengthened supervisory

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

UGANDA

efforts and reduced tolerance for regulatory infraction are called for during this uncertain period.
The authorities were in broad agreement with staff’s recommendation to prepare contingency plans
to deal with excessive foreign inflows through macroprudential means should this prove necessary.
Moreover, existing measures to limit foreign currency lending to borrowers with foreign currency
income should be maintained and strictly implemented; loan-to-deposit ratios and liquidity
requirements should be consistently enforced; and efforts should be made to improve assessment
of credit and currency risk, and upgrade consolidated supervision to better detect cross-border and
systemic risk. Enacting and implementing the anti-money laundering act and establishing an
operational financial intelligence unit would prevent the misuse of the financial sector to launder the
proceeds of fraud.
34. Low levels of financial deepening and inclusion limit the financial system’s contribution
to economic development. Financial depth and access of the population to related services is

business models would be required to increase services to SMEs as the availability of financing and
leasing facilities beyond the large corporate sector and select clients remains limited.

35. The authorities are moving forward with a three-pillar approach to pension sector
reform. A technical memorandum has been submitted to cabinet outlining ways and means of
improving the financial viability of the public pension scheme, including by transforming it into a
contributory scheme with a separate management agency. In addition, liberalization of the sector is
proceeding with the aim of allowing all licensed retirement benefit schemes to compete for
mandatory pension contributions. Finally, the regulatory framework is being upgraded, including
through the establishment of a specific pension regulatory agency.

D. Achieving Broad-Based and Inclusive Growth: Economic Diversification
and Efficient and Transparent Use of the Oil Wealth
36. A recently adopted long term development plan will underpin the authorities’ policy
framework over the next few years. The Vision 2040 plan envisages the achievement of middle
income status within 30 years, through high annual rates of growth that would allow per capita
income to increase from the current US$506 to US$9500 and the share of population living below
the poverty line to decline to 5 percent (Box 6).
Box 6. Uganda: Vision 2040
The vision. The 2040 national vision lays out the country’s long-term aspirations to move from an agrarian
based economy to a modern and prosperous economic system within 30 years. Elaborated through a
participative approach over several years, the plan aims at exploiting Uganda’s currently underutilized
opportunities. The private sector is expected to be the engine of growth, with the government ensuring a
supportive policy framework with tailored structural reforms and sectoral policies.
The resources. Uganda’s assets include an abundant labor force, a wide range of minerals, commercially
viable oil and gas deposits, and abundant fresh water resources. Moreover, the scope for value addition in
agriculture, nature-based tourism, knowledge and information technology, and geographical location create
significant opportunities for regional and international trade.
The strategy. To better exploit these opportunities, a strong boost in investment is needed, mainly in
transport infrastructure (rail, road, water and air); energy (mainly electricity); manufacturing production;
science, engineering and innovation; and urban development. The transformation from subsistence farming
to commercial agriculture and agro-processing is a key priority. All of this would require continued
investment in education and efforts to increase access to finance.
Implementation challenges. The vision will be implemented through six five-year development plans,
sector master plans, and annual budgets. To ensure consistency with annual budgets, a mid-term review is
being carried out in coordination with a multi-stakeholder technical committee.

37.
The fast-growing population requires accelerated job creation and rising living
standards. Sound policies and reforms have supported poverty reduction efforts, but there is a
higher role for fiscal policy and planning in safeguarding the most vulnerable groups (Annex IV:
Inclusive growth in Uganda: achievements and challenges). Staff called for a gradual establishment
of a well-tailored social safety net to help vulnerable groups share prosperity, including through
school meals, public transportation subsidies, and the use of cash transfers—which could be
channeled through the mobile money network. The authorities see provision of infrastructure and

basic services as the best means of sharing wealth. Targeted support through cash transfers would,
in their view, be expensive, hard to implement in rural areas where most of the potential
beneficiaries are, and would require governance schemes not currently in place. However, a pilot
cash transfer scheme is underway to support poor families and the elderly.
38. Improving the business environment will be key to supporting economic diversification.
Uganda still ranks low in doing business and governance indicators, which constrain
competitiveness despite good export performance (Box 7). Strengthening the rule of law and
controlling corruption, together with the planned infrastructure upgrades, are important
preconditions to attracting investment and promoting growth.
Box 7. Uganda: Competitiveness
Addressing key infrastructure bottlenecks, improving the business environment, and strengthening regional
integration are key priorities for further competitiveness gains.

Uganda’s export performance has been strong. During the
last decade, exports of goods and services increased from 10 to
23 percent of GDP. Export growth has been mainly volumebased, translating into substantial export diversification. The
degree of export concentration is lower than predicted by the
GDP per capita level. Uganda has a comparative advantage in
the region in agricultural crops, services, and resource-based
value-added activities.

39. Over the medium term, the policy framework will have to prepare for the start of oil
production. Staff recommended pursuing oil policies that preserve macroeconomic stability and
increase productivity and competitiveness. Based on simulations from a fiscal analysis of resource
industries (FARI) model, staff illustrated the expected benefits and costs of oil production, taking
into account the authorities’ recent decision to set up a small-capacity refinery and to export crude

22

through a pipeline. Discussions also covered fiscal rules that could be employed to govern savings
and expenditure. The authorities indicated that investment in infrastructure will be the primary use
of future oil revenues and that savings in the envisaged oil fund would provide a safeguard to future
generations (Annex V: Oil revenues in Uganda: from resource wealth to growth).

THE NEW PSI
40. The authorities’ policy commitments under the proposed PSI are detailed in their Letter
of Intent and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). It is proposed that the
new PSI program period begins on June 28, 2013, and that quantitative assessment criteria (QACs)
be established for end-June and end-December 2013 for monitoring program performance (MEFP
Table 1). Innovations in program design include an inflation consultation clause in lieu of the former
QAC on net domestic assets of the BoU in order to reflect the current monetary policy framework.
The new PSI will set a path for core inflation to converge to the 5 percent medium-term target—a
breach of the 2 percent inner band around the target would trigger consultation with staff, while a
breach of the 3 percent outer band would trigger a consultation with the IMF Executive Board. Other
innovations include an increase in the ceiling on contracting non-concessional debt to US$1.5 billion
to accommodate additional infrastructure investment; the addition of an indicative target on
government revenues; and replacement of the QAC on net claims on the central government with
the banking system (NCG) with a QAC on net domestic financing (NDF).3 Structural benchmarks for
the first year of the new PSI are intended to facilitate inflation targeting implementation, improve
revenue collection, and advance PFM reforms (MEFP Table 2). Details concerning the monitoring of
the QACs and reporting requirements under the program are outlined in the Technical
Memorandum of Understanding (Attachment II).

STAFF APPRAISAL
41. Recent policies have been effective in fighting inflation and reviving economic activity.
Despite significant foreign exchange inflows, the authorities were successful in bringing inflation
down to the mid-single digit target level. A welcome accumulation of international reserves
accompanied the disinflationary process, creating a useful buffer in the context of decreasing donor
support. These developments and recent indications of growth recovery—mainly driven by a
rebound in trade and investment—support a favorable outlook. Observation of all quantitative
targets and some structural benchmarks set for the sixth PSI review allow for the completion of the
program review.

This change has no material impact and is intended to simplify program conditionality and increase
transparency. The NCG target in the current PSI contains an adjustor for nonbank financing, effectively
transforming it into a ceiling on NDF.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

42. The new PSI will usefully support the authorities’ ambitious reform agenda. The strong
package of planned reforms to improve institutional frameworks, develop the financial sector, and
set up an environment favorable to private investment—including in the nascent oil industry—
underpins the authorities’ achievement of their medium-term growth objectives. The PSI will back
these reforms while continuing to support sound policy making, foster inter-institutional
coordination, signal Uganda’s economic achievements, and leverage external financing for
infrastructure investment—an area that has attracted renewed attention.
43. In the short term, growth and stability will be underpinned by supportive fiscal and
monetary policies. The budget will focus on increasing tax collections and allocating significant
resources to development spending to promote growth and employment. The central bank’s
policies will remain vigilant to potential demand pressures that could have a toll on inflation. Bank
supervision will aim at addressing bank risks posed by the sharp increase in foreign currency
lending. Closer policy coordination and a clearer distinction between monetary and fiscal policy
instruments will result in a consistent policy mix.
44. The decision to improve the inflation targeting framework reflects the authorities’
commitment to keep inflation low and stable. Successful use of the central bank rate as the
monetary policy signaling device helped the BoU gain credibility. The introduction of a consultation
clause and the envisaged institutional and operational reforms to strengthen independence,
accountability, and technical capacity of the BoU are expected to strongly contribute to the
objective of moving inflation to the medium-term 5 percent target. Continued exchange rate
flexibility will support these efforts.
45. The planned progress in strengthening fiscal institutions is welcome. While plans for
resumption of donor budget support remain unclear, the authorities are rightly counting on
improved revenue collections and use of the existing borrowing space to finance public sector
operations. The government is strongly encouraged to continue to improve tax collection and
tighten spending controls. Commitments to undertake a study to assess the cost of VAT exemptions
with a view of reducing them, move all transactions to the official systems, and introduce a TSA are
welcome steps to enhance public financial management. Importantly, they will also help address
society demands for better governance.
46. In the longer term, the start of oil production and prospects for regional integration
provide additional growth and poverty reduction opportunities. A business-friendly
environment—based on governance, institutional and financial sector improvements—should
promote the envisaged diversification of the economy and add to the gains of planned job-creating
infrastructure investments. These reforms would also maximize the benefits of EAC integration and
prepare the economy better for oil production to ensure that the resource wealth benefits the
population as a whole. In the process, enhancement of safety nets to protect the most vulnerable
segments is strongly recommended.

24

47. The outlook is positive but not without risk. Uganda is vulnerable to a deterioration of
economic conditions in trading partners and to a rise in import prices, particularly of oil. Domestic
risks center on capacity constraints and policy coordination weaknesses and their impact on efficient
policy making. Uganda continues to have a low risk of debt distress as confirmed by the updated
debt sustainability analysis.
48. The mission recommends completion of the sixth review and Executive Board approval of
a successor PSI. This involves cancellation of the current PSI immediately upon conclusion of the
sixth review. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held in accordance with the
decision on consultation cycles adopted September 28, 2010, as amended.

Annex I. Joint Bank-Fund Staff Debt Sustainability Analysis Update 2013
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) updates the joint IMF/IDA DSA from May 18, 2012, reflecting
the most recent macroeconomic developments and borrowing needs.1 The results indicate that
Uganda remains at a low risk of debt distress.
Main changes in assumptions. Compared to the previous joint IMF/IDA DSA, conducted in the
context of the fourth review under the PSI,2 key changes are:


External borrowing. The total amount of new borrowing by 2021 is somewhat lower and
more back-loaded.



Primary deficit. Reflecting the planned scaling up of infrastructure investment, the average
primary deficit is expected to be 0.9 percent of GDP higher over the medium-term.



Domestic borrowing. Higher investment and the recapitalization of the BoU are expected
to raise domestic debt by about 4¼ percent of GDP by 2018 .



Profile of concessional borrowing. External financing from multilaterals, projected to
remain at about 1½ percent of GDP throughout the projection period, will be granted on a
fully concessional basis until Uganda attains blend status in 2025 and as a blend of
50 percent concessional and 50 percent non-concessional resources afterwards. Therefore,
the share of non-concessional borrowing is projected to rise over the projection period.



New oil scenario. The oil scenario has been revised in line with the assumptions discussed
below and in Box 1.



Discount rate. A reduction from 4 percent to 3 percent leads to a decline in the grant
element of new borrowing and an increase in the net present value of debt.

The DSA incorporates the higher non-concessional borrowing ceiling of US$1.5 billion proposed in
the new PSI arrangement. While the authorities will continue to rely primarily on highly concessional
resources to finance their investment needs, they are planning to scale up the use of nonconcessional resources to address the acute infrastructure gap by developing three critical projects.
To this end, feasibility studies have already been completed for the Isimba hydro power project
(US$575 million), the Kampala-Mpigi highway (US$402 million), and the Kampala-Jinja highway
(US$519 million). These loans are expected to be contracted in FY 2013/14 and disbursed over five
years. Although the DSA assumes conservative terms for this new borrowing, the authorities plan to
seek loans carrying at least 20 percent grant element. These infrastructure projects will support the

In line with the 2010 Staff Guidance Note, a full joint LIC DSAs is expected to be prepared once every three years for
PRGT-eligible IDA-only countries. In between, short annual updates are expected to be produced unless
macroeconomic conditions since the last full DSA have significantly changed. See Staff Guidance Note on the
Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (www.imf.org).

projected potential growth of 7 percent, conservatively assuming no change in the growth path
compared to the previous DSA.
Improvements in implementation capacity and availability of financing will be critical for the
planned scaling up of infrastructure spending. The authorities acknowledged weaknesses in
implementation capacity, as highlighted by Uganda’s poor performance on the Index of Public
Investment Efficiency (PIMI). In order to streamline and improve project identification, selection and
execution, the authorities intend to complete the review of the Public Investment Program (PIP) by
end May 2014. The PIP will include only projects for which cost-benefit analysis and feasibility
studies have been conducted and sources of financing have been secured. To this end, the
authorities will strengthen their capacity to carry out cost-benefit analysis and prepare feasibility
studies. Moreover, quarterly project portfolio reviews will be conducted to ensure efficient
implementation of projects.
Both baseline public and external DSA suggest that public sector debt is sustainable.
External debt. The present value (PV) of the external debt-to-GDP is expected to increase from
11¼ percent to 20½ percent by 2033. The public and publicly guaranteed external debt position
remains sustainable in the face of all standardized shocks (Figure 1a, Tables 1b and 2a). All stress
tests show a low risk of debt distress with the debt-to-GDP, debt-to-exports, debt-to-revenue, debt
service-to-exports, and debt service-to-revenue indicators remaining below their indicative
threshold values throughout the projection period.
Public sector debt. The PV of public sector debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase moderately
from 24 percent in 2012 to 33½ percent by 2033, mainly driven by infrastructure-related borrowing.
Of all alternative scenarios and bound tests, fixing the primary deficit at the level of 2013 would have
the most adverse effect on the debt dynamics. The historical scenario, fixing GDP growth and the
primary balance at historical averages, and the scenario incorporating a permanently lower GDP
growth would increase the debt burden to about 50 percent of GDP by 2033.
With the onset of oil production the debt outlook is projected to improve significantly
(Box 1). The oil sector scenario is based on preliminary assumptions just intended to illustrate the
impact of oil revenues on the DSA. With an investment/saving strategy yet to be developed,
expenditures are kept unchanged with respect to the baseline. The scenario suggests that external
financing needs for oil sector development would lead to a marginal temporary increase in debt,
with the risk rating remaining low. Not surprisingly, when oil revenues come on stream, the DSA is
projected to improve significantly with external debt expected to be fully repaid by 2024, which
would create further useful borrowing space to frontload growth-enhancing infrastructure projects.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 37

Box 1. Assumptions for the oil sector debt scenario
Cost and financing of the envisaged pipeline and small refinery. Construction is planned to
start in FY2015/16. Total capital expenditure is estimated at $15-$20 billion, and would be
financed primarily through FDI. The government will need to increase external borrowing only
marginally to meet the expected equity commitments in both projects.
Real GDP growth would pick up during the investment phase and the onset of full
production. Based on the investment and production profile, real GDP growth over 2016–
2023 is expected to be 2–4 percent higher than under the baseline scenario.
With the start of full scale oil production and exports in 2018, government revenue is
projected to increase sharply. Oil reserves are anticipated to last for about 30 years. Oil
production is expected to account for close to 15 percent of Uganda’s GDP during the peak
extraction period, while oil revenues would contribute over 50 percent of total government
revenues. For the exercise, oil export prices are conservately assumed to be constant in real
terms at 80 dollars per barrel. Domestically-refined oil is priced at import-parity minus a
20 percent discount.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

and/or
setbacks in
fiscal and

reforms)
Delays in

issues
resulting in
deferrals in
the

of

Exposure to weak
external demand,
falling commodity
prices
(commodities
constitute ¾ of
exports), and
declining FDI
(7¾% of GDP) and
remittances (3.9%
of GDP).

Medium: Growth would
slowdown in the near-term,
which could lead to
permanent output losses.
Reserves would fall, but
probably remain adequate, as
weaker exports, FDI, and
remittances would be, partly
offset by declining imports,
including on account of lower
oil prices.

Continued exchange rate flexibility coupled
with moderate fiscal easing (allowing for full
operation of automatic stabilizers) to limit the
impact on growth while preserving external
stability. Use of existing fiscal space to
frontload spending in public investment. Ease
monetary policy somewhat (facilitated by
weakening commodity prices and the
widening output gap) to alleviate output
losses.

Vulnerability of
the external
accounts to a
protracted
suspension of
budget support in
place since
October following
misappropriation
of public
resources.

High: If budget support is not
replaced by project financing,
resort to excessive domestic
borrowing would crowd out
the private sector. A negative
impact on investor
confidence could trigger
capital outflows, hurting
external balances and
generating hard-to-manage
pressures on the exchange
rate.

A forceful fight against corruption is crucial, and
should include anti-money laundering
components. A persistent aid shock would call
for fiscal adjustment and greater exchange rate
flexibility. Prioritization of spending in favor of
key infrastructure projects and social
expenditures would lessen the adverse impact
on long-run growth and poverty. Nonconcessional debt could be raised (while
preserving debt sustainability) to limit cuts on
capital spending. Raising revenue and
enhancing PFM would be key structural
priorities.

Medium

Constraints on
technical
implementati
on capacity
affecting key
infrastructure
projects.

Medium: A delay in
infrastructure projects would
significantly weaken growth
and lead to a pro-cyclical
fiscal stance, complicating expost coordination of
monetary and fiscal policy.

Weakening growth would abate price
pressures, creating room for additional
monetary easing and calling for vigilance in
coordinating monetary and fiscal policies. Key
structural priorities would be to enhance
budget credibility, strengthen implementation
capacity, address governance problems, and
protect the poor.

Low

Global oil
shock due to
geopolitical
events
(driving oil
prices to $140
per barrel)

Low: The shock would worsen
the external balance sharply
while having limited impact
on growth and inflation. The
reserve buffer could absorb
the shock.

Continuation of full pass-through of global
fuel prices to retail prices would ensure no
impact on the fiscal balance. Greater exchange
rate flexibility would help maintain external
stability and limit reserve losses.

Low

Global food
price increase
caused by
supply shocks

Risk of delaying
growth recovery,
reflecting
Uganda’s weak
track record of
budget execution,
and complicated
procurement
processes.
Exposure to a
deterioration of
the external
position, as oil
imports account
for 4.9 percent of
GDP.
With food
accounting for
about one-third of
the consumption
basket, the poor
would be hard hit.

Medium: Pressures on
inflation and demands for
higher subsidies may emerge.
The external balance impact
would be positive (Uganda is
a net food exporter).

Careful monitoring of second-round effects on
inflation and readiness to tighten monetary
policy to counter pressures on core inflation.
Reliance on a well-targeted social safety net to
cushion the impact on poor would be an
essential policy response.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in
the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff's subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline. The

3. Global oil shock triggered by geopolitical events (driving oil prices to $140 per barrel).
Under such a shock, external balances would deteriorate significantly, reducing the reserve coverage
by about ½ months of imports, while the impact on growth and inflation would be limited (headline
inflation is projected increase by 2–3 percentage points).
4. Global food price increase caused by supply shocks (driving food and beverage prices up
by 40 percent). As Uganda is a net food exporter, the external balance would improve and reserve
coverage would increase by about 0.4 months of imports. However, the impact on inflation and
poverty would be substantial. Under this shock, headline inflation would rise by 8–9 percentage
points, reflecting the high food share in the consumption basket (roughly one-third).

A growth decline vulnerability index (GDVI) was introduced as part of IMF’s Vulnerability Exercise for LICs (VE-LIC), to assess
vulnerabilities and emerging risks arising from changes in the external environment (see Dabla-Norris and Bal Gündüz, 2012, the
IMF Working Paper WP/12/264, and the IMF Policy Paper “Managing Volatility-A Vulnerability Exercise for Low-Income Countries”,
2011). A growth crisis is defined as a country having negative per capita real GDP growth in the year of the shock and below-trend
output per capita level in two post-shock years.

Annex III. Strengthening Revenues in Uganda: Challenging but Necessary1
Tax Policy
It has often been argued that many of Uganda’s structural features as a small landlocked country
with large agricultural and informal sectors have made it harder to close the revenue gap with
neighboring countries. However, a comparison with other SSA countries shows that Uganda’s tax
gap cannot be fully explained by several features typically thought to affect the tax yield such as the
share of rural population, the contribution of natural resources to GDP, the share of manufacturing
to total value-added. As Figure 1 shows, even after controlling for these country features in a simple
regression framework, Uganda stills faces one of the highest revenue gaps among SSA countries.

A gap in revenue collection is present for all the major taxes, but especially for the value-added tax
(VAT). Figure 2 shows productivity indicators for the VAT, the personal income tax (PIT) and the
corporate income tax (CIT) for Uganda and averages for groups of comparator countries.2 Whereas
low-income countries across the world and countries in SSA and the EAC have on average seen
productivity gains in all major tax categories, the productivity levels of Uganda’s major taxes have
failed to grow.

These productivity indicators are calculated by dividing the tax yield as a percent of GDP by the headline rate for
each tax. For example, if VAT revenues are 10% of GDP and the standard rate is 20%, then the VAT productivity is
0.50.

Because it is a tax on consumption, the VAT is an ideal candidate for increasing revenue while
maintaining competitiveness and promoting growth through savings and investment. When
originally implemented, the VAT was well designed and in line with international standards. Revenue
yields steadily improved until 2009, but since then, the VAT’s efficiency has been declining and is
today something closer to a manufacturer’s turnover tax. Of particular concern is the large number
of exemptions for intermediate inputs.
Tax Administration
While the tax-to-GDP ratio has remained low, efficiency of the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) has
improved. The cost of collection ratio—defined as the ratio of the URA’s annual budget to total
collections—has decreased by close to 50 percent compared to its peak of 2002. Key tax
administration gains included the re-establishment of a large-taxpayers unit, the strengthening of
tax and customs administration operations, and a vast computerization effort. However, as with
many other countries at a similar stage of development, tax abuse is eroding revenue. Informality,
failure by taxpayers to file and pay on time, under-reporting of income and over-claiming of
deductions, aggressive tax planning, and tax fraud contribute to low revenue yields.

Going forward, continued URA reform will play a crucial role in increasing the tax-to-GDP ratio. This
will require developing comprehensive risk-based approaches to improving tax compliance as well
as intensifying collaboration and information exchange, both within the URA, with other
government agencies, and with EAC partners. It will also be important to keep building capacity of
the workforce to fully exploit the new information technology and to prepare to deal with the
complex issues involved in taxing multinational companies once oil revenues come on stream.
Impact of the EAC Policies
Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, later joined by Burundi and Rwanda, adopted a common external tariff
(CET) and a free trade agreement within a customs union. The introduction of the CET among these
countries, however, meant an increase in tariffs for Uganda’s trade with the rest of the world.
The EAC free trade agreement did not have a sizeable impact on Uganda’s international trade tax
revenues. Effective tariffs were already low (average of around 3 percent) and the share of imports
coming from EAC countries is relatively low and declining in importance (12 percent of total imports
in 2011). Surprisingly, the increase in tariffs with the rest of the world did not lead to any permanent
increase in trade tax revenue.

Promotion of intra-regional trade has been complicated by requests for exemptions, difficulties in
the harmonization of rules of origin (because most EAC countries are also members of other trade
groups, like COMESA, SADC and ECCAS), and imposition of non-tariff barriers. The latter include
differences in imports and exports standards, cumbersome documentation requirements,
weighbridges, police roadblocks, and unnecessary delays at border posts. Uganda’s performance in
the “Trading across Borders” indicator is still poor.

Box 1: Revenue Gap Analysis
The revenue gap analysis is performed using a simple econometric model relating total revenue as a percent of GDP to
several structural factors considered to be important determinants of this ratio. The analysis is done for 2009. The equation
is displayed below along with the values of the estimated coefficients.

percent of total variation in government revenue levels across SSA countries. Interestingly, the point estimate for Landlocked
is positive and quite large, meaning that on average, landlocked countries have 2.76 percentage points higher revenue than
similar countries with access to the sea.

Annex IV. Inclusive Growth in Uganda: Achievements and Challenges1
Key developments
Growth. Uganda has grown well-above the Sub-Saharan Africa average, which has allowed for
average gains of 4¼ percent in real per capita income in the past ten years despite the rapidly rising
population. The different sectoral growth patterns are leading to a structural transformation of the
economy, in which the share of agriculture in GDP and employment is declining, and that of services
increasing.
Employment. The ratio of employment to working-age population has increased substantially, but
the official unemployment rate has increased from 2 percent in 2005 to 4¼ percent, mostly in urban
areas. Total factor productivity has increased, with productivity gains outpacing those of other
countries during the growth takeoff period. However, agricultural productivity has not improved,
and increases in production are still driven by larger crop area and more abundant labor force.
Poverty. The poverty headcount dropped from 56 percent in 1992 to 25 percent in 2010, allowing
early achievement of the Millennium Development Goal of halving poverty by 2015. Progress was
made on reducing hunger and addressing gender inequality, but less so on achieving universal
primary education. Moreover, 2015 targets on reducing child mortality and improving maternal
health are unlikely to be met. Despite some improvements in the war-torn region in the north,
poverty also remains very uneven between regions.
Inclusiveness. Despite rising inequality, especially between regions, growth in consumption per
capita in the poorest 40 percent of households was relatively high and outpaced growth in all other
income groups. This appears to have afforded the most vulnerable groups a significant participation
in ongoing economic growth.
Factors behind growth and poverty reduction
Macroeconomic and structural policies. Price stability and sound structural reforms laid the
groundwork for sustained growth. Liberalization of key sectors (including foreign exchange and
banking), privatization and restructuring (telecommunications and electricity), tax reform and
improved banking supervision played a role. Export diversification has been successful particularly in
agriculture (where the share of coffee fell from above 50 to 17 percent of total exports between
1996 and 2012).
The role of fiscal policy. Low revenue mobilization undermines capacity for poverty reduction. The
Gini coefficient before and after tax is practically the same, showing that the tax system is neutral

from a redistributive point of view.2 There is a larger number of taxpayers at the highest income
segments, but also a very low average effective tax rate. One third of the budget has been devoted
to finance development projects in the last 10 years. Initial emphasis in education and health has
been declining in favor of infrastructure, which the authorities expect to provide high returns in
terms of poverty reduction.
The role of planning. Following the use of poverty eradication action plans in 1997–2008, Uganda
moved to comprehensive planning frameworks with long-term visions. The process of building
consensus through a participatory process is positive, but medium-term plans are not consistent
with annual budgets.
Structural factors. The decrease in the number of households relying on subsistence farming from
about 50 to 40 percent in only 4 years reflects a move to non-farm household enterprises, and a
strong growth in formal wage employment (second largest in Africa after Ghana). The number of
people entering the labor market each year outnumbered the number of new wage earners by a
factor of 4.
Remaining challenges to growth and inclusiveness
Low productivity in agriculture. Since high population growth constraints access to land,
agricultural productivity enhancing measures are required. The sector has suffered from
poorly targeted input subsidy schemes and unproductive spending. Improvements in agricultural
technologies, better connectivity and strengthening the security of land tenure would contribute to
unleashing the sector’s potential.
Uneven distribution of public services on education and infrastructure. The quality and access
to education differs significantly among regions, being lower in the north. This results in differences
in income-earning opportunities and increased inequality. A more even distribution of education,
including through vocational training, would make growth more inclusive. Similarly, the rural road
system suffers from project under execution and lack of maintenance, which affects transportation
of goods and services.
Limited access to financing and regulatory obstacles. Low access to financing results in low
capital, rudimentary technology, and low productivity. The agricultural support credit is a step in the
right direction. High license fees and permits, collected by local governments, lead to high effective
tax rates for non-farm household enterprises, which are also highly regressive (over 50 percent for
lower earning enterprises, which is twice the rate for formal sector corporations).

2

This calculation includes income tax, property tax, user fees and charges, and local service tax and post-tax, as
information on these payments is available in the survey questionnaire from the Ugandan Bureau of Statistics (UBOS)
Household Survey of 2009/10.

Annex V. Oil Revenues in Uganda: From Resource Wealth to Growth1
Oil production
The existence of potentially commercial oil fields in Uganda was confirmed in 2006. Although
development of the sector has been marked by delays and uncertainty, oil exploration activities have
continued in the Albertine Graben in western Uganda and current reserves are estimated at
3.5 billions of barrels. This places Uganda among the 30 largest in the world and fourth in SSA
behind Nigeria, Angola and South Sudan. Negotiations with the oil companies over the
development of the sector have progressed in recent weeks but uncertainty remains about the
volume, costs and timing of production.
The current fiscal regime for the petroleum sector in Uganda is based on production sharing
agreements (PSA) for specific exploration areas. Under these arrangements, oil companies are
contracted by Government and are compensated through a specified share in production. Although
the PSAs differ in their terms, they rely on broadly the same main components: (i) royalty payments
with rates that vary according to the total daily rate of production; (ii) contractors are able to recover
their costs from total oil production after paying royalties; (iii) the remaining oil, termed “profit oil’, is
split between the contractor and the government; (iv) contractors pay the corporate income tax at a
rate of 30 percent on their share of profit oil after allowable tax deductions.2
Figure 1: Sources of revenue in Uganda (percent of GDP)

Preliminary estimates suggest that oil could account for close to 15 percent of Uganda’s GDP, and
over 50 percent of total government revenues at peak production. Oil reserves are currently

UGANDA

expected to last for around 30 years and offer a unique opportunity to raise income levels. However,
the substantial size of oil revenues combined with their short duration and inherent volatility will
pose significant challenges for macroeconomic management.
Challenges
Uganda faces the challenge of transforming resource wealth into other assets that support sustained
development and growth. As a low income country, Uganda faces specific challenges such as low
per capita incomes, scarcity of domestic capital and limited access to international capital markets.
Resource revenues are an opportunity to make progress on key development goals, such as poverty
reduction, infrastructure and growth. Development policy should steer public investment towards
building human capital, domestic public and private capital, and foreign financial assets.
Natural resource wealth creates a specific set of challenges. These include price volatility which
complicates fiscal planning because it leads to volatile revenue. Optimal management of the
country’s resources will require the adoption of sound fiscal rules to limit pro-cyclicality of fiscal
policy because volatile government spending is less effective and productive. Moreover, higher
macroeconomic volatility is a main channel for the growth-damaging “resource curse”. Prudent fiscal
policy should aim to de-link expenditures from volatile resource revenues to avoid the boom-bust
cycles.3 In the 2012 Oil and Gas Revenue Management Policy, the Ministry of Finance announced its
plan to invest all revenues from the oil sector in a sovereign wealth fund and to use the non-oil and
non-grant balance as a fiscal anchor, coupled with a limit in the growth of Government
expenditures. Such a rule if implemented in a consistent manner would help mitigate the adverse
effects of volatility of natural resource revenues.
Given the size of Uganda’s oil reserves, the country must also consider carefully the exhaustibility of
its resources. This raises the important issues of sustainability and intergenerational equity which will
require smoothing government consumption over time. A sustainable fiscal framework should allow
for a gradual drawdown of financial assets to build human and physical capital to deliver permanent
gains in non-resource revenues. However, public investment should only be front-loaded once
implementation capacity and fiscal transparency have been strengthened to avoid misuse. To ensure
a balanced growth path in the long run and avoid the need for massive fiscal adjustment once
resource wealth has been depleted, Government has announced that it will revert to only spending
the interest accumulating on the Petroleum Fund’s assets—similar to a Permanent Income
Hypothesis-based rule—after an initial period of ramp up in infrastructure.

A recent IMF board paper on “Macroeconomic Policy Frameworks for Resource-Rich Developing Countries”
addresses these issues in detail and develops new macro-fiscal frameworks and policy analysis tools for low income
countries such as Uganda.

58 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

Preparing to manage the oil wealth
Uganda needs to “invest in investing” by building capacity for public and private investment and by
reducing the unit cost of capital. Capacity for public investment depends crucially on appraisal,
selection, implementation and evaluation of investment projects. Government must prioritize this
area for reform. Sustainable public investment must also make room to fund recurrent costs
(operation and maintenance) of a higher public capital stock, so that the growth benefits can last.
Public investment such as schools and hospitals for example require higher recurrent spending to be
made productive. Capacity for private investment depends on the business environment. To this
end, government must tackle corruption, improve infrastructure, and ensure fair rules of the game
investors with a fair judicial system and a minimum of red tape. It is also important to enhance the
financial sector’s effectiveness.
The importance of sound institutions cannot be overemphasized. Resource wealth can undermine
institutions by promoting rent-seeking and corruption, risking dissipation of government savings
and poor investment quality. Resource-rich countries with stronger economic and political
institutions tend to have better macroeconomic and growth performance. Fiscal institutions need to
ensure the transparent and efficient use of resource wealth. It will therefore be crucial for the Public
Financial Management Bill to reflect international best practice and for government to improve its
cash management and budget processes before oil revenues start flowing in Uganda.
Government will need to develop a comprehensive communication strategy to enhance
transparency and manage expectations. Some of the challenges will include increased pressures on
Government to deliver on public services and account for oil revenues as well as unrealistic
expectations on wealth prospects shifting private consumption patterns. To this end, staff welcomes
the authorities’ intention to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Government
will also have to resist temptation to borrow against future oil revenue to finance unsustainable
increases in public consumption. While increased demand for non-tradables and appreciation of the
shilling cannot be avoided, well-designed policies can increase productivity and preserve
competitiveness. There is considerable scope, for example, to lower production costs through
investment in public infrastructure, skills training, and reforms to land and other input markets.

Appendix I. Uganda: Letter of Intent

Kampala, Uganda
June 13, 2013

Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431

Dear Ms. Lagarde:

On behalf of the Government of Uganda, I would like to provide you with an update on the progress
we have achieved under our economic program supported by the IMF’s Policy Support Instrument
(PSI). Economic growth has been stronger than expected, inflation has been reduced close to our
5 percent medium-term target, credit growth is accelerating, and the external position has been
strong enough to allow an accumulation of reserves significantly higher than programmed. In light
of these favorable developments, and in consideration that all December 2012 quantitative
assessment criteria under the program were met, we request completion of the sixth and final
review under our PSI-supported program.
Going forward, we have developed a strong program of economic reform aimed at achieving broadbased growth, generating employment, and eradicating mass poverty. Specific measures will center
on maintaining macroeconomic stability, improving public financial management, raising revenue,
improving the business climate, preparing the economy for oil production and revenue, and
completing the transformation towards full-fledged inflation targeting. To assist us in carrying out
this ambitious reform agenda, the government of Uganda wishes that our existing PSI arrangement,
which runs to August 10, 2013, be cancelled, and that a new three-year PSI-supported program be
approved in support of our reform agenda.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) sets out Government’s
objectives for the three-year PSI-supported program, and provides details of the policies to be
pursued in the first year. Government believes the policies set forth in the MEFP are fully sufficient to
achieve the objectives of our PSI-supported program, but as always we stand ready to take any
further measures that may become appropriate for this purpose.

60 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

We intend to work with the IMF and other development partners in the implementation of our
program, and will consult with the Fund on the adoption of any such further measures, and in
advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on
such consultation. We will provide the IMF with such information as the Fund requests in connection
with our progress in implementing the policies and reaching the objectives of the program. We also
consent to publication of the documents for the sixth review under the PSI.

Sincerely yours

Attachment 1. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
This Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies lays out Government’s objectives for the next
three years, and provides details of the policies Government intends to implement over the next
year to stimulate growth and job creation while maintaining overall macroeconomic stability.

I. Performance Under the Current PSI
1.
The objective of macroeconomic policy under the current three-year PSI was to ensure that
the economy could adjust to a much less benign external economic environment following the
global crisis and could sustain broad-based growth. Key policy reforms to achieve these objectives
included a re-orientation of budgetary resources towards growth-promoting public investment and
the modernization of the central bank’s monetary policy framework. Despite several
shocks—including a severe food price shock in 2011 and the suspension of budget support by
donors in 2012—progress has been made. Economic growth is recovering, inflation has been
brought down to close to the policy target and the balance of payments has been restored to
surplus.
2.
All quantitative assessment criteria for the sixth PSI review have been met. Fiscal
performance for the first half of 2012/13 was in line with program projections and the ceiling on net
claims on government by the banking system was observed. The ceiling on net domestic assets was
met and the floor on the stock of net international reserves of the Bank of Uganda (BoU) was
exceeded by a substantial margin. The indicative target on the increase in base money was not met,
but this did not pose any risks to inflation control. All indicative targets for end-March 2013 were
achieved.

II. Recent Economic and Policy Developments
3.
Economic growth was stronger than expected over the first half of FY2012/13 indicating
that the economy has begun to recover from the recent supply side shocks. For FY 2012/13 as a
whole, the economy is expected to expand by 5.3 percent—a full percentage point more than our
previous projection and significantly higher than the 3.4 percent recorded in 2011/12. Growth has
been broad based, with the largest contributions coming from telecommunications, construction,
services and manufacturing. Aggregate demand has been boosted by, inter alia, an increase in net
exports, while aggregate supply has benefitted from the expansion in electricity generating capacity
arising from the commissioning of the Bujagali hydropower facility and from better agricultural
harvests.
4.
Annual headline and core inflation have both fallen sharply in the first 11 months of the
fiscal year, as a result of the dissipation of supply side shocks and the much slower growth in
domestic demand, which was brought about by a tightening of monetary policies. The BoU policy
rate—the cCntral Bank Rate (CBR)—which is the operating target of monetary policy under the
inflation targeting lite (ITL) monetary policy framework, was raised from 13 percent in July 2011

62 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

(when it was first introduced) to 23 percent in October 2011. As inflationary pressures subsided, the
CBR was reduced gradually, beginning in February 2012. It stood at 12 percent between December
2012 and May 2013, and was reduced to 11 percent in June 2013 as inflation remained at low levels.
In May 2013 annual headline and core inflation stood at 3.6 percent and 5.6 percent respectively,
compared to 18 percent and 19.6 percent in June 2012.
5.
Private sector credit growth is projected at about 15 percent for 2012/13, compared to
11 percent in 2011/12. Credit growth up to March was entirely attributable to foreign currency
lending. In contrast, domestic currency lending stagnated because of a combination of high lending
rates and structural factors, including the recent closure of the Land Registry, which administers the
land titles needed for loan collateral. With the resolution of these issues, domestic currency lending
is now showing signs of recovery.
6.
The banking sector is in a healthy financial condition, recording strong profits in 2012, in
part because of high net interest margins. Non-performing loans edged up to 4.2 percent of total
loans at end-December 2012, but the banks’ capital position remained very strong, with core capital
for the banking system as a whole standing at 18.8 percent of risk weighted assets. At the beginning
of March 2013, the statutory increase in the minimum paid up capital of banks from Shs 10 billion to
Shs 25 billion took effect, with all 24 banks in operation now in compliance.
7.
The BOP has been stronger than expected because of a decline in the current account
deficit and larger than projected net capital inflows. The current account deficit is projected to fall to
9.3 percent of GDP (10.4 percent excluding project grants) in 2012/13 from 13 percent of GDP in
2011/12 (12 percent excluding project grants), mainly because of a reduction of imports and
stronger export growth. As a result of the large overall BOP surplus, projected at $414 million, gross
international reserves are projected to rise to just over US$3 billion at end June 2013, from
US$2.6 billion at end June 2012.
8.
The overall fiscal deficit in 2012/13 is projected to be 3.9 percent of GDP, 0.5 percent GDP
larger than programmed. The larger deficit is attributable mainly to lower than programmed
revenues and grants, slightly higher than expected current expenditures and the need to recapitalize
the central bank (0.7 percent of GDP), which were only partially offset by underperformance of the
development budget primarily due to delays to the start of the Karuma hydropower project. Lower
tax revenues partly reflected the disruption caused by the imposition of a cash bond by Kenya
earlier in the year and logistical problems with the fuel pipeline. A supplementary budget was
appropriated in the last quarter of the year, of which over 50 percent was allocated to paying
outstanding certificates in the road sector.
9.
Uganda has already met the MDG target on poverty and is on track to meet the one on
hunger as well. Between 1992 and 2010, the share of the population living below the poverty line
has declined from 56 to 24.5 percent, and the prevalence of underweight children aged under 5
from 26 to 13.8 percent. However, the global economic crisis may have negatively impacted these
gains.

III. Macroeconomic Objectives
10.
To meet the strategic objectives of achieving broad-based growth, generating employment
and eradicating mass poverty, Government will continue strengthening the business climate;
implement targeted public investments, especially in roads and energy; enhance production and
productivity of agriculture and promote agro-processing; enhance human capital formation,
particularly through vocational skills development; and maintain price stability and a competitive
real exchange rate through sound macroeconomic management.

IV. Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks
11.
Real economic output is expected to pick up during 2013/14, as implementation of key
infrastructure projects (notably the Karuma hydropower and the Kampala-Entebbe express highway)
intensifies, while bottlenecks are alleviated. GDP growth is projected to rise to 6 percent during
2013/14 and further to an average of 7 percent per annum over the medium term. The BoU will aim
to achieve its target for annual average core inflation of 5 percent over the medium term which,
after incorporating base effects, implies an inflation rate of 6.3 percent in 2013/14. Moreover,
foreign exchange reserves will be kept at a level of at least the equivalent of 4 months of import
cover.
12.
Government is focusing on improving the quality of essential services and the efficiency with
which they are provided without compromising on equity in access. Government will put in place a
framework to enable public private partnerships (PPPs) to be used to finance and deliver essential
services in most sectors while also safeguarding against fiscal risks.
13.
Regarding support for the poor and vulnerable households, Government’s efforts are
concentrated on enhancing their participation in economic activities. Interventions to this end are
mostly geared at eliminating barriers to the uptake of essential services by these households
(e.g. improving access roads, extending coverage of services, improving staff motivation and
supervision especially for hard-to-reach and hard-to-stay areas).
14.
Government policies are guided by the National Development Plan (NDP). Experience in the
implementation of the NDP has shown that reconciling investment demands with fiscal sustainability
and a stable macroeconomic framework remains challenging. In order to address these challenges,
Government will update and improve project cycle management capacities, which will not only
ensure the highest possible value for money of key projects, but will also allow mobilization of
additional resources and optimally combine different financing options without undermining sound
macroeconomic management. The new PSI will support government efforts to mobilize finance for
infrastructure investments and to implement them efficiently.

64 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

15.
Areas of concentration of the new PSI-supported economic reform program, that will run
from June 2013 to June 2016, will be:


Supporting revenue enhancement through measures to broaden and deepen the tax base
and achieving more effective tax administration;



Reforming PFM to enhance the effectiveness with which public funds are used;



Preparing the economy for oil production and optimal management of petroleum revenues;



Moving from inflation targeting ‘lite’ to full-fledged inflation targeting during the course of
the program; and



Improving the business environment, supporting the development of the financial sector,
and continuing to maintain financial sector stability.

16.
The main risks to the outlook include domestic and external shocks. On the domestic front,
the economy remains vulnerable to the impact of weather-related agricultural shocks on domestic
food prices. On the external front, Uganda’s increasing integration into global markets generates
vulnerabilities to a sudden reversal of short-term portfolio flows, and to terms of trade shocks,
notably through increased oil prices or a decline in external demand. The likely rapid scaling up of
investment in the oil sectors may also pose risks to domestic stability if spending on nontraded
goods—e.g. in the construction sector—outstrips supply capacities. Government will ensure that it
retains sufficient policy space (e.g. through prudent fiscal policy and the holding of adequate foreign
reserve cover) to counter the impact of negative shocks without compromising macroeconomic
stability.

V. Macroeconomic Policies Under the Program
17.
The fiscal strategy for 2013/14 will seek to address the weaknesses in domestic and external
revenue mobilization and improve the allocation of resources to key strategic priorities, as identified
in the NDP. Revenues are projected to be higher than in the current fiscal year as Government
expects to collect taxes on capital gains from oil transactions. Capital expenditure prioritizes
infrastructure development, increasing agricultural production and productivity, enhancing human
skills including technical capacity, and improving service delivery. Current expenditure will support
maintenance of infrastructure and payments of services to sustain the efficiency of government
offices. Government will make all efforts to avoid accumulation of arrears in FY 2013/14.
18.
Government has developed a comprehensive five-year debt management strategy, which
sets out guidelines and benchmarks for external and domestic debt to guide debt policy over that
period. The main objectives of the strategy are to: i) ensure that the level of public debt remains
sustainable; ii) meet Government’s financing requirements; and iii) promote the development of the
domestic financial market. Government will mobilize external resources in line with its debt strategy
and the private sector will be invited to participate in infrastructure projects. To support these
objectives, Government is requesting a ceiling on nonconcessional external debt with a maturity of
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 65

UGANDA

more than one year, during the programme period, of US$1.5 billion to be used to finance priority
infrastructure projects, particularly in roads, railways, energy and water for production.
19.
The BoU will continue to focus its Central Bank Rate (CBR) on the primary policy objective of
maintaining price stability by holding core inflation to 5 percent over the medium term. A secondary
objective—subordinated to the inflation objective—will be to help ensure that real output is in line
with the economy’s potential. The CBR will continue to be set every month on the basis of forecasts
for inflation and output, and the interest rate decision will be explained to the public through a
press briefing and monetary policy statement.
20.
The BoU pursues a flexible exchange rate regime, and implements sterilized interventions in
the foreign exchange market to dampen excessive exchange rate volatility.

VI. Reform Agenda
Tax Policy and Tax Administration
21.
Government is committed to raising total revenue and especially the tax-to-GDP ratio to
improve tax efficiency and fund critical projects. A Government’s key objective within the PSI
supported program is to raise the tax-to-GDP ratio by at least 0.5 percentage points annually from
2013 to 2016 (indicative target). Government will submit to cabinet a new tax procedure code by
June 2013. Government will achieve the objective of raising revenue through a combination of tax
policy and tax administration measures.
22.
In the coming financial year Government will review the exemptions inherent in the tax
system with the aim of eliminating those that are not cost efficient. The objective is to improve tax
efficiency, facilitate tax administration, enhance compliance, and increase revenue collections. To
this end, Government, with technical assistance from IMF, will undertake a VAT gap analysis, which
will inform the course of action addressing exemptions, and will publish such analysis (structural
benchmark). Government will then prepare an action plan to implement the recommendations on
addressing exemptions from the VAT gap analysis (structural benchmark). As a usual undertaking,
Government will continue publishing on the internet the names and beneficiaries (whether
individual or corporation) of all tax expenditures. Further, Government will also move to VAT
accounting on a net basis rather than budgeting for VAT refunds as a spending item.
23.
Government will take tax measures to strengthen revenues for next fiscal year’s budget.
In FY 2013/14 Government will terminate VAT exemptions on: i) hotel accommodation; ii) water for
domestic consumption; iii) the textile sector and iv) feeds for poultry and livestock.
24.
In the FY 2013/14 budget, Government will also: i) increase the registration fee and stamp
duty on third party insurance policies for motor vehicles; ii) introduce capital gains tax on the
disposal of commercial buildings by individuals; iii) amend the thin capitalization rule to limit
excessive use of related party debt; iv) increase excise duty of cigarettes; v) eliminate income tax
exemptions on income derived from agro processing (structural benchmark); vi) expand the number

66 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

of withholding tax agents; vii) increase excise duty by 50 shillings on petrol and diesel; viii) restore
excise duty of 200 shillings on kerosene; ix) introduce a transaction levy on mobile money transfers;
and x) review the taxation of the petroleum and mineral sector. In this regard, Government will seek
TA from IMF in the area of natural resource taxation. Implementation of these measures will be
structural benchmarks under the PSI.
25.
Tax administration has improved tremendously in service delivery in recent years. In the
coming year, the Uganda Revenue Authority’s (URA) efforts will be focused more explicitly on the
major taxpayer segments: large, medium, small and micro. It will rank compliance risks by taxpayer
segments and define response across functions. In particular, URA will ensure that the taxpayer
service and enforcement functions that support the large taxpayers are improved. This will be
accomplished by ensuring that staffing and training needs are met to promote compliance and
improve auditing capacity. As part of implementing an effective system of binding public rulings,
URA will publish in the gazette all public rulings it makes on interpretation of the law.
Public Financial Management
26.
Government will continue implementing PFM reforms to strengthen controls on use of
public funds and protect priority areas of the budget. The Public Financial Management Bill (PFMB),
currently in Parliament, aims at consolidating the existing 2003 Public Finance and Accountability
Act (PFAA) and the Budget Act 2001, and strengthening the fiscal and macroeconomic framework
and the budget process. Key milestones include ensuring that the budget is passed before the start
of the financial year; providing for a contingencies fund to help manage in-year expenditure
pressures and reduce the stock of domestic arrears; setting out a legal framework for the
management of oil revenues; and introducing a charter for fiscal responsibility.
27.
Government will submit to Parliament a set of amendments to the PFMB 2012 to bring it up
to international best practice Amendments will include, inter alia: i) a chapter to strengthen and
enforce sanctions; ii) an explicit reference to the decision to establish a Treasury Single Account
(TSA); iii) a requirement to specify the source of financing of any supplementary expenditure; iv) a
requirement to specify an annual ceiling for the issuance of Treasury securities that is not subject to
change without Parliamentary approval; v) a requirement that proceeds from Treasury securities
issuance for monetary policy purposes be held in a special fund which is not available for spending
by Government; and vi) amendments to the Bank of Uganda Act to significantly tighten access of
Government to advances from the BoU. It is expected that the bill will be enacted into law during
FY 2013/14.
28.
Misappropriation of funds and payment arrears were made possible by the incomplete
migration of payroll and pensions votes to the Integrated Personnel and Payroll System (IPPS). To
address this issue, Government will complete the rollout of IPPS to cover personnel management
and payroll of all entities within central government by December 2013 (structural benchmark).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 67

UGANDA

Treasury Single Account
29.
Government is committed to introducing a TSA to improve cash management, control, and
transparency of government operations, and to avoid unnecessary interest costs. The Ministry of
Finance will submit to cabinet in May 2013 a cabinet information paper reflecting the decision to
introduce a TSA. The implementation of the TSA will be undertaken in a phased approach starting
with a pilot scheme involving 6 votes followed by a roll out to the rest of Central Government.
Government will start introducing a TSA for all Integrated Financial Management Systems (IFMS)
related transactions, including for the Treasury General Accounts (TGAs), salaries, and IFMS projects
by March 2014 (structural benchmark). Prior to this, by December 2013 Government will complete
the expansion of IFMS to all central government votes (structural benchmark).
Management of Arrears
30.
Government will reduce the stock of unpaid bills, as measured by the Accountant General,
by at least 50 billion shillings between July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2014. The PFMB will require
accounting officers to prepare work plans, procurement plans, and recruitment plans to be
approved by the Secretary to the Treasury, which will thereafter form the basis for issuing cash limits
and releases. This is expected to prevent over committing of government expenditures beyond
available resources. In the interim period, as a structural benchmark, Government will continue to
submit to Cabinet regular quarterly reports on unpaid bills of nine ministries based on data in the
Commitment Control System for the previous quarter of the fiscal year. In addition, Government will
publish, on a quarterly basis, releases by the MoFPED for utilities (water, power and telephone)
obligations of spending ministries and actual payments for them. This will enhance transparency and
facilitate control and elimination of domestic arrears.
Improvements in Implementation Capacity
31.
In order to streamline and improve project identification, selection and execution,
government will complete the review of the Public Investment Program (PIP) by end May 2014. The
review is intended to ensure that the program only contains projects for which cost-benefit analysis
and feasibility studies have been conducted and sources of financing have been secured. To this
end, Government will ensure that capacity to carry out cost benefit analysis and prepare feasibility
studies is developed. Moreover, quarterly project portfolio reviews will be conducted to ensure
efficient implementation of projects.
Management of Oil Revenues
32.
The PFMB provides for the establishment of fiscal rules that will be designed upon approval
of the law with a view to determining a clear framework for savings and investment of oil resources.
Under this structure, the non-oil primary balance will be the main measure of the fiscal stance.
Government will establish a petroleum fund into which all oil revenues will be deposited and held. A
proportion of oil income will be spent through the budget through transparent annual

68 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

appropriations. The petroleum fund will belong to the Government of Uganda and be held abroad
and managed by the BoU, separately from the foreign exchange reserves.
33.
Tax revenue from capital gains from oil company transactions has been accumulated in a
special fund in the BoU. Government will use these resources exclusively for the construction of the
Karuma hydroelectric project. Similarly, resources in the energy fund will be exclusively used for
energy projects.
Other Reforms
34.
While delays have impeded the issuing of national identity cards, Government remains
committed to bringing this project to completion. This will facilitate tax administration and financial
sector development. By May 2014, Government will issue at least 1 million cards under the new
national identification system (structural benchmark). To accelerate implementation of the project,
budgetary funds have been allocated to it and in addition voluntary payment for ID cards will be
encouraged.

VII. Transition to Fully Fledged Inflation Targeting
35.
The ITL framework has now been in operation for almost two years and has proved
successful in bringing down inflation to its current level which is only slightly higher than the BoU’s
medium-term target. The BoU is determined to continue to improve the current ITL regime to
ensure low inflation over the medium term and allow a transition to Fully Fledged Inflation
Targeting, through a combination of institutional reforms and technical capacity building.
36.
On the institutional front, Government is finalizing arrangements to carry out by July 2013
the first stage of recapitalization of the BoU with marketable securities to the amount stipulated by
law (structural benchmark). To this end, a formal agreement will be signed by the Minister of Finance
and the Governor of the BoU that will also enhance operational independence of the BoU by
ensuring that the BoU has sufficient instruments at market interest rates and adequate maturities to
implement monetary policy; will reflect the BoU’s commitment to control inflation and to streamline
its operating expenditures; and will recognize that a second phase of recapitalization will be needed
in the future.
37.
By February 2014, the Ministry of Finance will submit to cabinet amendments to the Bank of
Uganda Act including provisions for capital adequacy of BoU as an adequate percent of monetary
liabilities as well as other measures to support comprehensive reforms in support of inflation
targeting (structural benchmark) and central bank modernization.
38.
On the operational side both the MoFPED and BoU are strengthening their technical
capacities for macroeconomic modeling. In improving its inflation forecasting skills, the BoU is
receiving TA from the Research Department of the Fund. The BoU will improve the efficacy of its
monetary policy instruments and enhance its communications strategy to facilitate understanding
by the public of monetary policy decisions and forecasts of macroeconomic variables.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 69

UGANDA

39.
To support the transition to a fully fledged inflation targeting framework, the Government
requests that the quantitative performance criteria on net domestic assets (NDA) be replaced with
an inflation consultation clause, while retaining the net international reserves (NIR) floor for external
stability.

VIII. Financial Sector Soundness and Development
40.
The BoU is implementing Basel III reforms in a phased manner. It has carried out a pilot
exercise on the use of a liquidity coverage ratio by large banks, and now intends to enforce the use
of this ratio by all banks. A capital conservation buffer will be also imposed. Using the methodology
recommended by the Bank for International Settlements, the BoU is identifying the systemically
important financial institutions that will be subject to higher capital requirements. Legislations to
introduce a capital charge to cover market risk, prevent money laundering, and amend the Financial
Institutions Act are under Parliament and will be implemented as soon as they are approved.
41.
Most of the commercial banks operating in Uganda are subsidiaries of regional or
international banks. The BoU has signed Memorandum of Understanding with several home
supervisors to facilitate consolidated supervision and sharing of information. The BoU is also
participating in supervisory colleges of international banks.
42.
Government is advancing reforms in the pension sector. It will ensure the financial viability
of the Public Service Pension Scheme, and improve oversight of the pension sector including the
National Social Security Fund. The Uganda Retirement Benefits Regulatory Authority Board has
enacted licensing regulations and guidelines for the establishment of private retirement benefit
schemes and has started issuing provisional licenses.
43.
To promote financial deepening and inclusion, the BoU will improve financial literacy, ensure
consumer protection, and promote financial innovation (including through mobile money and
agency banking). The BoU will also reinforce efforts to regulate mobile money transactions by
preparing legislation governing the national payment system. We expect this strategy will increase
access of the population to financial services.

IX. Enhancing the Business Environment
44.
Uganda’s competitiveness agenda aims at attracting foreign investment to generate growth
and employment. The agenda comprises infrastructure development, institutional and legal reforms
to lower the costs of doing business, reduction of red-tape, and access of small and medium
enterprises to credit. In addition, Government has developed a policy and legal framework to
support the PPP model as an option for providing long-term value and reliability to critically
important infrastructure sectors. To enhance transparency, by March 2014 Government will include
in the Budget Framework Papers a status report of ongoing PPP programs, including individual
estimates of each project’s contingent liability (structural benchmark).

70 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

45.
Government has introduced an approach called Contractor Facilitated Financing, a system
that integrates supplier credits into the tendering process, which is aimed at reducing delays in the
implementation of Government projects. Government considers that this approach has potential to
improve the efficiency of project execution, but is fully mindful of its inherent risks. Consequently,
Government will ensure full transparency in the use of CFF including by publishing details of all
agreements and clearly assessing and differentiating the cost of both the projects and the financing
terms. The applicable terms and conditions will be detailed in the Revised National Debt strategy to
be published by end June 2013.

X. Program Monitoring
46.
Progress in the implementation of the policies under this program will be monitored
through quantitative assessment criteria (QACs), indicative targets (ITs), and structural benchmarks
(SBs) detailed in the attached Tables 1 and 2 and through semi-annual reviews. Quantitative
assessment criteria are proposed for end-June 2013 and end-December 2013, to be monitored
respectively at the first and second reviews. The first review is expected to be completed by endDecember 2013 and the second review by end-June 2014. The attached Technical Memorandum of
Understanding—which is an integral part of this Memorandum—contains definitions and adjustors.

Attachment 2. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
I. Introduction
1. This memorandum defines the quarterly assessment criteria and indicative targets described in
the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) for the financial program supported by
the IMF Policy Support Instrument (PSI) over the period of June 30, 2013—March 31, 2014 (until
June 2014 for inflation consultation clause), and sets forth the reporting requirements under the
instrument. For the first year of the PSI-supported program, all foreign assets and liabilities will be
converted into U.S. dollars at each test date using the average cross exchange rates referred to in
the table below for the various currencies and then converted into Uganda shillings using the
program average U.S. dollar-Uganda shilling exchange rate for March 2013.

II. Consultation Mechanism on Inflation
2. The quarterly consultation bands for the twelve-month average rate of consumer price
inflation (as measured by the core consumer price index (CCPI) published by the Uganda Bureau of
Statistics (UBOS)) are specified in the text table: Inflation Targets. Projected CCPI inflation for endJune 2013 and end-December 2013 will be subject to the consultation mechanism, while those for
end-September 2013, end-March 2014 and end-June 2014 are indicative targets.

3. Should the observed average CCPI inflation for the test date linked to a PSI program review
(i.e., end-June 2013 for the first review and end-December 2013 for the second review) fall outside
the outer band as specified in the above table, the authorities will complete a consultation with the
Executive Board of the Fund on their proposed policy response before requesting completion of the

74 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

review under the program. The authorities will not be able to request completing a review under the
PSI-supported program if the average CCPI inflation has moved outside of the outer band as of the
test date linked to such review, until the consultation with the Executive Board has taken place. In
line with the accountability principles, the BoU will report to the public the reasons for any breach of
the outer bands, and its policy response. In addition, the BoU will conduct discussions with the Fund
staff when the observed average CCPI inflation falls outside the inner band as specified for the end
of each quarter in the above table.

III. Base Money
4. Base money is defined as the sum of currency issued by the BoU and the commercial banks’
deposits in the BoU. The commercial bank deposits include the statutory required reserves and
excess reserves held at the BoU and are net of the deposits of closed banks at the BoU and
Development Finance Funds (DFF) contributed by commercial banks held at the BoU. The base
money limit for June 2013 will be a ceiling on the cumulative change from the monthly average
based on daily data for June 2012 to the same monthly average for June 2013. The base money
limits for September 2013 and December 2013 will be ceilings on the cumulative change from the
monthly average based on daily data for June 2013 to the same monthly averages for September
2013 and December 2013, respectively. Base money limits for June 2013, September 2013, and
December 2013 will be indicative targets under the PSI-supported program.

IV. Ceiling on the Cumulative Increase in Net Domestic Financing of the
Central Government1
5. Definition. The cumulative increase in net domestic financing of the central government (NDF)
is defined from below the line on a cash basis as the sum of:
a. the change in net claims on the central government by the banking system: Net claims on the
central government by the banking system is defined as the difference between the outstanding
amount of bank credits to the central government and the central government's deposits with the
banking system, excluding oil revenues in the petroleum fund and deposits in administered
accounts and project accounts with the banking system, including the central bank. Credits comprise
bank loans and advances to the government and holdings of government securities and promissory
notes. Central government’s deposits with the banking system include the full amount of resources
freed by the IMF Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). NDF by the banking system will be
calculated based on data from balance sheets of the monetary authority and commercial banks as
per the monetary survey.
b. the change in net claims on the central government of domestic nonbank institutions and
households: net claims on the general government of domestic nonbank institutions and households
are defined as treasury bills, bonds or other government securities held by nonbank institutions and
1

UGANDA

households (including nonresidents and nonresident financial institutions), plus any other liabilities
of the central government to domestic nonbank institutions or households;
6. All changes will be calculated as the difference between end-of-period stocks, net of any
valuation changes resulting from currency movements.

V. Floor on Net International Reserves of the Bank of Uganda
7. Net international reserves (NIR) of the BoU are defined for program monitoring purpose as
reserve assets of the BoU net of short-term external liabilities of the BoU. Reserve assets are defined
as external assets readily available to, and controlled by, the BoU and exclude pledged or otherwise
encumbered external assets, including, but not limited to, assets used as collateral or guarantees for
third-party liabilities. Short-term external liabilities are defined as liabilities to nonresidents, of
original maturities less than one year, contracted by the BoU and include outstanding IMF purchases
and loans.
8. For program-monitoring purposes, reserve assets and short-term liabilities at the end of each
test period will be calculated in U.S. dollars by converting the stock from their original currency
denomination at program exchange rates (as specified in paragraph 1). The NIR limit for June 2013
will be a floor on the change of the NIR stock from June 2012 to June 2013. The NIR limits for
December 2013 and March 2014 will be floors on the change of the NIR stock from June 2013 to
December 2013, and March 2014, respectively. The NIR limit for December 2013 will be quantitative
assessment criteria under the PSI-supported program; the floor for March 2014 will be an indicative
target.

VI. Expenditures on Poverty Alleviating Sectors
9. The indicative target on poverty alleviating expenditures includes domestic expenditures
inclusive of wages and salaries in the Health, Education, Water and Environment and Agriculture
sectors as defined by the Government of Uganda’s functional budget classification. Compliance with
the indicative floor for poverty alleviating expenditures will be verified on the basis of releases.

VII. Ceiling on Issuance of Guarantees by the Government or Bank of
Uganda
10. The indicative target on issuance of guarantees by the Government or Bank of Uganda aims to
prevent accumulation of contingent liabilities by the Government (including Government entities
such as ministries, agencies and authorities). Included against the ceiling are any direct, contingent
liabilities of Government (including entities that are part of Government such as ministries, agencies
and authorities) issued after June 30, 2012, and including any guarantees issued prior to July 1, 2012
but which are extended after June 30, 2012. This excludes guarantee programs which have explicit
budget appropriations.

UGANDA

VIII. Share of Oil Revenue Placed in Petroleum Fund
11. The purpose of this assessment criterion is to avoid a situation whereby petroleum revenues
bypass the Ugandan budget framework. A petroleum fund will be created upon passage of the
revised PFMB; in the meantime, government has established a petroleum revenue account in the
Bank of Uganda. This QAC will be deemed satisfied if 100 percent of petroleum revenues are
transferred to this account upon collection by URA. These resources may then be spent or saved as
governed by the organic budget law in force at the time (PFAA 2003 until the new PFMB is enacted).

IX. Tax Revenue
12. A floor applies on tax revenue of central government measured cumulatively from the
beginning of the fiscal year. For program monitoring purposes, tax revenue is defined as the sum of
direct domestic taxes (PAYE, corporate tax, presumptive tax, other direct taxes, withholding tax,
rental income tax, tax on bank interest, casino tax and unallocated receipts), excise duty and valueadded taxes net of refunds and taxes on international trade minus temporary road licenses as
defined by the Government of Uganda’s revenue classification.

X. Adjusters
13. The NIR target is based on program assumptions regarding budget support, assistance
provided under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the MDRI, external debtservice payments. The NIR target is based on program assumptions regarding automatic access by
commercial banks to the BoU’s rediscount and discount window facilities.
14. The Uganda shilling equivalent of projected budget support (grants and loans) plus HIPC
Initiative assistance in the form of grants on a cumulative basis from July 1 of the relevant fiscal year
is presented under Schedule A. The ceilings on the cumulative increase in NDF will be adjusted
downward (upward), and the floor on the cumulative increase in NIR of the BoU will be adjusted
upward (downward) by the amount by which budget support, grants and loans, plus HIPC Initiative
and MDRI assistance, exceeds (falls short of) the projected amounts.

payments of external debt arrears less deferred payments (exceptional financing) falls short of
(exceeds) the projections presented in Schedule B. Deferred payments are defined to be (i) all debt
service rescheduled under the HIPC Initiative; and (ii) payments falling due to all non-HIPC Initiative
creditors that are not currently being serviced by the authorities (that is, gross new arrears being
incurred).

XI. Ceiling on the Contracting or Guaranteeing of New Nonconcessional
External Debt by the Public Sector, and Ceiling on the Stock of External
Payments Arrears Incurred by the Public Sector3
18. The assessment criterion on short-term debt refers to contracting or guaranteeing external
debt with original maturity of one year or less by the public sector. Excluded from this assessment
criterion are normal import-related credits and non-resident holdings of government securities and
government promissory notes. The definition of “debt” is set out in paragraph 20.
19. The program includes a ceiling on new nonconcessional borrowing with maturities greater than
one year contracted or guaranteed by the public sector.4 Nonconcessional borrowing is defined as
loans with a grant element of less than 35 percent, calculated using average commercial interest
rates references (CIRRs) published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD). In assessing the level of concessionality, the 10-year average CIRRs should be used to
discount loans with maturities of at least 15 years, while the 6-month average CIRRs should be used
for loans with shorter maturities. To both the 10-year and 6-month averages, the following margins
for differing payment periods should be added: 0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than
15 years; 1 percent for 15–19 years; 1.15 percent for 20–25 years; and 1.25 percent for 30 years or
more. The ceiling on nonconcessional external borrowing or guarantees is to be observed on a
continuous basis. The coverage of borrowing includes financial leases and other instruments giving
rise to external liabilities, not only current as defined below, but also contingent, on nonconcessional
terms. External debt for the purpose of this assessment criterion means borrowing giving rise to
liabilities to non-residents. Excluded from the limits are changes in indebtedness resulting from nonresident holdings of government securities and government promissory notes, refinancing credits
and rescheduling operations, and credits extended by the IMF. For the purposes of the program,
arrangements to pay over time obligations arising from judicial awards to external creditors that

Public sector comprises the general government (which includes the central government, local governments, and
monetary authorities), and entities that are public corporations which are subject to ‘control by the government’,
defined as the ability to determine general corporate policy or by at least 50 percent government ownership.

Contracting and guaranteeing is defined as approval by a resolution of Parliament as required in Section 20(3) and
25(3) of the Public Finance and Accountability Act, 2003.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 79

UGANDA

have not participated in the HIPC Initiative do not constitute nonconcessional external borrowing.
Excluded from these limits are also nonconcessional borrowing within the limits specified in Table 1
of the MEFP. The ceiling also excludes nonconcessional borrowing by one state-owned bank,
Housing Finance Bank, which poses limited fiscal risk and is in a position to borrow without a
government guarantee.
20. The definition of debt, for the purposes of the limit, is set out in point 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt (Executive Board’s Decision No. 6230-(79/140),
as amended by Decision No 14416-(09/91), effective December 1, 2009). It not only applies to the
debt as defined in Point 9 of the Executive Board decision, but also to commitments contracted or
guaranteed for which value has not been received. The definition of debt set forth in No. 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements reads as
follows:
(a) For the purpose of this guideline, the term "debt" will be understood to mean a
current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement
through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services,
and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of
assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these
payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the
contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
(i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of
an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including
deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers' credits) and temporary
exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the
obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the
collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official
swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers' credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits
the obligor to defer payments until sometime after the date on which the goods
are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under
which property is provided which the lessee has the right to use for one or more
specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service
life of the property, while the lesser retains the title to the property. For the
purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the
lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or
maintenance of the property. (b) Under the definition of debt set out in point
9(a) above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the
failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt.
Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this
definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.

80 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

21. The ceiling on the accumulation of new external payments arrears is zero. This limit, which is to
be observed on a continuous basis, applies to the change in the stock of overdue payments on debt
contracted or guaranteed by the public sector from their level at end-June 2013. External debt
payment arrears consist of external debt service obligations (reported by the Statistics Department
of the BoU, the Macro Department of the Ministry of Finance) that have not been paid at the time
they are due as specified in the contractual agreements but shall exclude arrears on obligations
subject to rescheduling.

XII. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements
22. The Government of Uganda will submit information to IMF staff with the frequency and
submission time lag as indicated in Table 1. The quality and timeliness of the data submission will be

Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund's safeguards policy, assessments with respect to the PSI are voluntary. An update
assessment of the Bank of Uganda (BOU) was completed on April 10, 2007 and concluded that the
BOU had strengthened its safeguards framework since the 2003 assessment. The main
developments included implementation of International Financial Reporting
Standards, publication of financial statements, establishment of an audit committee, and
strengthening of the internal audit function. Staff made recommendations to address remaining
vulnerabilities in the legal and internal control areas.
Exchange Rate Arrangement:

The official exchange rate is determined on the interbank market for foreign exchange. As of endMay, 2013 the official exchange rate was USh 2595.01 per U.S. dollar. The exchange system is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. Uganda’s
exchange rate regime is classified as floating.
Article IV Consultation:

The Executive Board concluded the last Article IV consultation on February 11, 2011. Following the
completion of the current Article IV, the next Article IV consultation with Uganda will be held in
accordance with the decision on consultation cycles adopted September 28, 2010, as amended.
Technical Assistance:

Uganda has continued to receive extensive technical assistance from the Fund in recent years.1
In the last year, FAD has provided TA to the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) in the areas of
taxpayer compliance and effectiveness of administrative actions—with a view to raising tax revenue
levels. Significant assistance has been provided to estimate the VAT gap, with a mission in May and
an initial estimate expected by mid-June, 2013. FAD also provided support on the drafting of the
Public Finance Management Bill (PFMB), with a visit in March 2013 for a workshop held for
Parliamentarians. Another mission took place in April 2013 on the introduction of a Treasury Single
Account, and suggestions on a draft concept note for Cabinet were provided. A follow-up mission is
planned for June to meet with key officials to continue supporting implementation.

For a description of technical assistance provided prior to June 2012, see the staff report for Uganda’s third review
of the PSI (IMF Country Report No. 12/125).

MCM also continued to provide TA to Uganda, mainly supporting the Bank of Uganda’s (BOU)
transition to full-fledged inflation targeting, enhancing bank regulation and supervision,
modernizing the national payments system, and recapitalizing the central bank. A November 2012
mission focused on assisting the BOU to formulate a national payments system modernization
strategy. A December 2012 mission assessed progress and current challenges in the adoption of
inflation targeting, and made recommendations. Similarly, a January-February 2013 mission
proposed a strategy for ensuring sustainable income for central bank and its recapitalization. TA was
also provided for the establishment of a medium-term debt strategy, in May 2013, as well as to
enhance the banking regulatory framework and to assist with the implementation of risk-based
supervision (missions in February, March and one planned in June 2013). Finally, TA was provided to
the Insurance Regulatory Authority of Uganda (IRA) to enhance insurance regulation (March 2013).
While several missions are planned in these areas, in the near term, a mission in June/July 2013 will
assist the BOU in implementing stress testing as part of the broader financial stability analysis.
STA has also provided TA in the areas of balance of payments statistics, price statistics and quarterly
national accounts, to the Ugandan Bureau of Statistics (UBOS).
LEG provided TA in March to assist in drafting the National Payment System Act with a view to
developing the comprehensive legal framework for payment systems and instruments. A Fiscal Law
mission in March 2013 focused on the review of the Tax Procedures Code Bill.
Resident Representative

The Fund has maintained a resident representative in Uganda since July 1982. Currently, the Senior
Resident Representative, Ms. Ana Lucía Coronel, is also Mission Chief for Uganda.

1. World Bank
Work Program

The current IDA portfolio consists of 17
operations with net commitments of US$1.4
billion, and 5 regional projects with net
commitments of US$95.7 million. Key sectors
of support include agriculture, transport,
energy, water, urban, education, and health. In
addition to the ongoing projects in these
areas, new projects to come on board shortly
include the Municipal Infrastructure
Development Program, the Competitiveness
and Private Sector Development Project, and
the Albertine Region Development Project.
The PRSC 8-10 series was designed to
improve efficiency of public expenditures and
value for money in health, education,
transport, and water and sanitation by
addressing both cross-cutting (such as public
financial management) and sector-specific
bottlenecks. The series could have sharpened
its focus on governance by incorporating
policy actions supporting all aspects of the
accountability chain (detection, inspection,
and sanctions) and a stronger demand for
good governance. The Bank and the
Government have decided to terminate the
current PRSC series once the active PRSC 9 is
disbursed.

STATISTICAL ISSUES (AS OF MAY 31, 2013)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Overall data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes, although some shortcomings
remain.
Real sector statistics: Since 2004 Uganda has been receiving technical assistance from the East
African Technical Assistance Center (AFRITAC East) and, more recently an external expert, on the
compilation of annual and quarterly national accounts. In late 2011 the authorities started to
disseminate quarterly GDP estimates at 2002 constant prices by economic activity. Significant
progress has been made by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) in populating supply and use
tables (SUTs) that include preliminary product balances for 155 activities by 161 products. An April
2013 an AFRITAC East mission proposed some modifications that should allow final estimates to be
available before the end of the current fiscal year. This will put the GDP rebased (2009/10) estimates
on a firm footing. Labor market indicators such as employment, unemployment, and
wages/earnings are infrequently compiled and disseminated. UBOS aims to compile and disseminate
these data categories on an annual basis, but due to resource and data unavailability, these data are
compiled with a two year lag. From January 2010 the consumer price index (CPI) benefited from a
rebasing using the (out-of-date) 2005/2006 Uganda National Household Survey. Its coverage was
extended from six to eight urban areas, and improved formulas were adopted (at the elementary
level, a geometric average—in accordance with COMESA regulations, and at the higher-level, a
modified Laspeyres-type to facilitate incorporation of replacement items and better imputations).
UBOS compiles and disseminates a Producer Price Index for Manufacturing (separately for domestic
and local output) and for hotels. AFRITAC East will be providing technical assistance to rebase,
improve and expand the PPI during the next two years.
Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development
(MoFPED) compiles fiscal statistics following the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2011 (GFSM
2011), but for budgetary central government and local governments only. UBOS has recently been
given official responsibility for compiling and disseminating these statistics and have been requesting
technical assistance for two years.
Monetary and financial statistics (MFS): TA in FY2014 will aim at improving the institutional
coverage and classification of other depository corporation (ODCs) and initiation of the collection and
compilation of data for other financial corporations, mainly insurance companies and pension funds.
This would build on previous missions financed by the Department for International Development
(DFID) on the standardized report forms (SRFs). Uganda began publishing SRF-based monetary data
from 2002 in IFS beginning in early 2009.

External sector statistics: The focus of an external sector statistics mission, conducted during
February 2013, was on aligning Uganda’s balance of payments and IIP data to the sixth edition of the
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6), and further enhancing
source data collection. Particular areas of concern include: (i) net errors and omissions for the
published BOP with respect to the financial year 2011-12; (ii) data collection on transactions in nonresident securities; and (iii) reliable current/capital transfer split for foreign aid and more detailed data
on the costs of embassies abroad.

Financial Statistics (IFS). The BoU reports regularly monetary data for the central bank and other
depository corporations (ODCs) in the format of Standardized Report Forms (SRFs).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 8, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with
Uganda
On June 28, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Uganda,1 completed the sixth and final review of the country’s
performance under an economic program supported by a Policy Support Instrument (PSI)
arrangement and approved a three-year PSI (see Press Release No. 13/239).
Background
Growth has started to pick up following the lowest rate of economic expansion in a decade,
and—driven mainly by investment and trade—is projected to reach 5¼ percent this fiscal year.
Private sector activity was boosted by a good harvest, by the inauguration of the Bujagali
hydropower plant, which lowered manufacturing costs, and by a loosening of the fiscal stance
towards the end of the year due to faster than expected implementation of road projects.
Inflation was brought down to close to the 5 percent target level as a result of careful monetary
management by the Bank of Uganda.
External performance was stronger than anticipated, owing to strong non-coffee exports and a
temporary deceleration of imports. Aided by foreign exchange inflows attracted by high shilling
rates, international reserves grew significantly and now stand at a comfortable level equivalent
to four months of imports, providing a welcome buffer to the economy in the context of an
uncertain international environment. Uganda is assessed at a low risk of debt distress, while
the banking sector remains solvent, liquid and profitable despite some increase in the stock of
nonperforming loans.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

UGANDA

Growth is projected at 6–7 percent in the medium term in the context of low inflation.
A moderate expansion in the underlying fiscal deficit to support growth, a flexible exchange
rate, and monetary management supportive of low and stable inflation, underpin a favorable
macroeconomic outlook.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ successful policies to reduce inflation, revive
economic activity, and accumulate international reserves, while noting that progress on
structural reform was mixed. They stressed the importance of maintaining prudent
macroeconomic policies and stepping up governance and structural reforms to underpin plans
for oil exploitation and economic diversification.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ plans to boost infrastructure and development spending to
support growth. They stressed the importance of decisive action to increase revenue collection
through tax reform and improved revenue administration. They encouraged the authorities to
prepare an action plan to reduce tax exemptions, including implementing the
recommendations of the ongoing VAT gap analysis. This will underpin efforts to reduce
reliance on donor support and external borrowing, and to limit nonconcessional borrowing to
high-economic return projects.
Directors acknowledged the progress in strengthening public financial management. They
encouraged the authorities to continue to tighten spending controls and to move swiftly toward
introducing a Treasury Single Account to improve budget execution, transparency, and cash
management. Directors welcomed submission to parliament of the draft public finance
management bill and its amendments.
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to maintaining price stability and urged
strong policy coordination to keep inflation under control. They advised the Bank of Uganda
(BoU) to remain vigilant and adapt the monetary policy stance to domestic demand
developments and possible external spillovers. Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to
further strengthen the operational and institutional aspects of their inflation targeting framework
and to formally introduce inflation as a program target. They supported the inter-institutional
agreement to implement the first stage of the recapitalization of the BoU, as well as the plans
to further strengthen the independence, accountability, and technical capacity of the central
bank.
Directors noted staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with
economic fundamentals, and supported the exchange rate flexibility that underpins the
monetary framework. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to limiting interventions to
smoothing excessive exchange rate volatility and maintaining reserve cover.
While the banking sector remains solvent, liquid, and profitable, Directors recommended
strengthened bank supervision and regulation enforcement to mitigate vulnerabilities resulting
from increased foreign currency lending. A few Directors suggested that macroprudential or
capital flow management measures could be considered. Directors welcomed plans to expand
financial deepening and inclusion.
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

Directors looked forward to the authorities’ long-term development plan to promote inclusive
growth. They underscored the importance of accelerating structural reforms and addressing
governance weaknesses to strengthen the business environment, raise competitiveness, and
maximize the benefits of integration in the East African Community. In preparation for oil
production, Directors recommended setting a framework for efficient use of the resource
wealth, and welcomed Uganda’s plan to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
A well-tailored social safety net will be important to help vulnerable groups share in prosperity.

IMF Executive Board Completes Sixth Review Under Policy Support Instrument for
Uganda and Approves a New Three-Year PSI
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the sixth review
under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Uganda and approved a new three-year PSI. To this
end, the Executive Board took note of Uganda’s cancellation of the current PSI, which was
scheduled to expire on August 10, 2013 (see Press Release No. 10/195).
The PSI for Uganda aims at maintaining macroeconomic stability and alleviating constraints to
growth. The IMF’s framework for PSIs is designed for low-income countries that may not need, or
want, IMF financial assistance, but still seek IMF advice, monitoring and endorsement of their
policies. PSIs are voluntary and demand driven (see Public Information Notice No. 05/145).
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Uganda, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Ugandan authorities are to be commended for the broadly satisfactory implementation of
their economic program under the Policy Support Instrument. Prudent policies were successful in
bringing inflation under control, raising economic growth, and strengthening the external position.
“Monetary and fiscal policies have been consistent with the growth and inflation objectives, and
the authorities have managed large foreign exchange inflows successfully. In the short term, fiscal
policy will need to focus on increasing tax revenue collection—currently low compared to the
regional East African Community peers—and allocating significant resources to development
spending. The central bank is encouraged to remain vigilant to potential demand pressures and
stand ready to adjust the monetary policy stance if needed. Continued exchange rate flexibility
will help support these efforts.
“Important progress has been achieved in institutional modernization. Public financial
management has been significantly strengthened, and efforts to introduce a Treasury Single
Account and pass a public finance management bill are expected to improve budget execution,
transparency, and cash management. Moreover, progress toward improving the inflation targeting
framework is ongoing, with the recent decision to recapitalize the Bank of Uganda representing a

major milestone to enhance its independence and credibility.“To ensure inclusive growth and deal
effectively with the challenges posed by natural resource production, further structural reforms to
improve the business environment, enhance competitiveness and productivity, promote
diversification, and strengthen the social safety net remain essential. This will require additional
efforts to strengthen governance and accountability.”

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Mr. Saho on Uganda
Executive Board Meeting
June 28, 2013
My Ugandan authorities appreciate the Fund Executive Board and Management for their
continued engagement and support. They are grateful for the productive policy discussions
and advice offered by the IMF mission team during the 2013 Article Consultation and sixth
review under the Policy Support Instrument. The authorities agree with the thrust of the
report as it addresses the main challenges to the successful implementation of Uganda’s
growth strategy.
Program performance
Despite the daunting challenges, my authorities continue to demonstrate a steadfast
commitment to pursuing prudent macroeconomic and structural policies within the context of
the IMF program. This is reflected in the strong performance in respect of the end-December
2012 program targets, as all quantitative assessment criteria were met. However,
performance on the structural benchmarks was mixed. While there were some delays on
avoidance of domestic arrears and transparency of fiscal operations, progress was made on
publication of vital statistics. Against this backdrop, my authorities request for Executive
Directors’ support for the completion of the sixth and final review of the current PSI and
approval of a successor PSI.
Recent economic development
Uganda’s economic growth remains strong driven by construction, services and
manufacturing. The economy is expected to expand by 5.3 percent in FY 2012/13, higher
than the 3.4 percent recorded in 2011/12. Aggregate demand has been boosted, inter alia, by
an increase in net exports, while aggregate supply has improved by the expansion in
electricity generating capacity and better agricultural harvests. Inflation has fallen sharply as
a result of the softening of supply side shocks and the tight monetary policy that has
dampened the growth in domestic demand. On the fiscal front, the overall fiscal deficit in
2012/2013 is expected to be 3.9 percent of GDP, exceeding the program target by 0.5 percent
of GDP. The larger deficit is largely on account of the lower than expected revenues and
grants, slightly higher than programmed current expenditures and the need to recapitalize the
central bank. Owing to the strong non-coffee exports and the decline in imports, the external
current account deficit (including grants) is expected to narrow to 9.3 percent of GDP in
FY12/13 from 13.0 percent of GDP in the preceding year. As a result, the gross international
reserves of the central bank increased to US $3.0 billion from US $2.6 billion during the
same period. However, in months of import cover, reserves remain unchanged at 4.2 months
of imports of goods and services.
Medium-term outlook and polices
As the recovery from the recent supply side shocks is gradually consolidated, my authorities’
policy focus has shifted to returning the economy to a higher and sustainable growth
trajectory in order to increase employment and reduce poverty. Continued scaling up of

UGANDA

investment in infrastructure and improved delivery of basic social services, in line with the
authorities’ National Development Plan (NDP) will be pursued in the medium term. Against
this background, my authorities are in agreement with staff on the growth path of GDP to 6.0
percent during 2013/2014 and further to an average of 7.0 percent per annum over the
medium term. Core inflation in the medium term, is expected to average 5.0 percent while
gross international reserves will be maintained at a level of at least 4.0 months of import
cover.
The new PSI will support government endeavors to expand the fiscal space for infrastructure
investment while maintaining debt sustainability. In this regard, efforts will focus on revenue
enhancement, reforming PFM to improve effectiveness of public spending, bolstering the
new oil economy, and improving the business environment.
Fiscal policy
My authorities remain committed to a near and medium-term macroeconomic framework
that aims at consolidating the recovery of the economy. To achieve this objective, the
authorities intend to slightly increase budgetary spending levels for FY2013/14, in particular
scaling up expenditures on infrastructure and agriculture in line with their NDP. In this
regard, the authorities intend to consolidate current expenditures, while increasing spending
on social services.
On the revenue side, my authorities are determined to increase revenue mobilization through
the broadening of the tax base and reducing discretionary tax exemptions. Also, the
authorities will continue implementing additional tax reform measures to raise domestic
revenue resources over time. To this end, efforts will focus on enhancing the efficiency of
VAT and strengthening tax administration.
To ensure budget credibility and make public spending more effective, the authorities
reaffirmed their commitment to enhance public financial management. They are dedicated to
strengthening external debt management in order to maintain debt sustainability. In this
respect, my authorities will pursue concessional borrowing and grants. Non-concessional
financing will be contracted for projects that have high economic returns.
The authorities will continue the implementation of PFM reforms. The Public Financial
Management Bill will be amended according to international best practice. In order to avoid
misappropriation of funds and payment arrears, my authorities will complete the rollout of
the Integrated Personnel and Payroll System (IPPS) to cover personnel management and
payroll of entities within central government. In addition, a Treasury Single Account (TSA)
to improve cash management, control, and transparency of government operations will be
established.
Monetary and financial sector policies
My authorities are committed to maintaining inflation below the Bank of Uganda’s mediumterm
target. To this end, the current ITL regime will be strengthened through a combination
of institutional reforms and technical capacity building in order to smoothly transition to
fully fledged inflation targeting. As a result, efforts are being made to recapitalize the central
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

bank and strengthen its operational independence and by enhancing the potency of monetary
policy instruments for the effective implement monetary policy. Accordingly, work is at an
advanced stage to submit a revised Bank of Uganda Act to cabinet by February 2014.
Furthermore, my authorities are building capacity in macroeconomic modeling in both the
Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Uganda. In view of this, my authorities’ appreciate the
TA from the Research Department of the IMF.
In the financial sector, the medium term strategy of the authorities is to produce a
significantly changed financial sector, which is stronger, more stable and vibrant and a
vanguard for supporting broad-based economic growth and development. In this regard, the
Bank of Uganda is implementing Basel III in segments, starting with a pilot exercise on the
use of a liquidity coverage ratio by big banks. All banks will soon be required to use this
ratio as well as a capital conservation buffer. Legislations to change the Financial Institutions
Act and other financial sector regulations are at the parliament for ratification. Also, to
deepen financial intermediation and the extension of credit, the central bank intends to
improve public financial literacy and promote financial innovation while strengthening the
regulation of the non-bank financial institutions.
Conclusion
The authorities remain steadfast to maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment,
creating conditions for sustained broad-based economic growth and poverty reduction, and
persevering with the structural reform agenda. Efforts to create employment opportunities
through significant public investment in infrastructure and reforms to the business
environment remain priorities. It is in this regard that my authorities consider the Fund’s and
other development partners’ policy advice and technical support critical to successfully
implementing their national development plan and poverty reduction.
