DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation and First Review Under the
Three-Year Arrangement Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Jean A. P. Clément and Scott Brown
February 15, 2006
•

On August 1, 2005, the Executive Board approved a three-year arrangement under the PRGF for
São Tomé and Príncipe in the amount of SDR 2.96 million (40 percent of quota). So far, São
Tomé and Príncipe has drawn SDR 0.423 million under the arrangement.

•

Discussions on the 2005 Article IV consultation and First Review under the PRGF arrangement
were held in São Tomé during November 5–19, 2005. The staff team comprised Messrs. Pastor
(head), Iimi, Ronci, and Segura (all AFR). Mr. Randriamaholy, the Fund resident representative,
assisted the mission. The mission met with the Prime Minister and Minister of Planning and
Finance, the Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, the Acting Governor of the Central
Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe (BCSTP), other senior government officials, as well as the
President of the National Assembly, the Chairman of the Oil Commission at the National
Assembly, representatives of the donor community, labor unions, and private sector businesses.

•

The current government, in place since early June 2005, has expressed a strong commitment to
implement the Fund-supported program with a view to reaching HIPC completion point by mid2006. Parliamentary elections, and the formation of a new government, are expected around
April 2006, ahead of Presidential elections, which are scheduled for late 2006.

•

In the attached letter dated February 9, 2005 (Attachment I), the authorities request the
completion of the First Review and the disbursement of the second tranche under the PRGF in an
amount equivalent to SDR 0.423 million, equivalent to 5.7 percent of quota. The memorandum of
economic and financial policies (MEFP), attached to the letter, reviews economic policy
implementation in 2005 and proposes performance criteria for end-June 2006.

•

The Sãotomean authorities appreciated the advice provided by the Fund Executive Board in the
context of the Article IV consultations. They particularly welcomed the Board’s recommendation
during the latest consultation to develop strong institutions with a view to secure a proper
management of prospective oil revenue. The authorities stressed the need of continued technical
assistance in the areas of Fund expertise to buttress administrative capacity and policy decision
making.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Performance under the program supported by the PRGF has been broadly satisfactory to
date. All quantitative performance criteria set for end-September 2005 were observed. In
addition, all structural performance criteria set for end-July 2005 were met, and three out
of four structural benchmarks were observed as scheduled. The submission to the
National Assembly of legislation criminalizing money laundering and the financing of
terrorism is still pending because of the need to update related pieces of legislation.
However, the government intends to finish updating the legislation during 2006.

•

São Tomé and Príncipe needs to continue to address macroeconomic imbalances and set
the conditions for sustained economic growth and poverty alleviation. Fiscal
consolidation, while preserving an adequate level of pro-poor spending, would be
critical to sustain macroeconomic stability. Over the medium term, a main task would be
to develop strong institutions to secure a transparent management of oil revenue. As the
oil sector is likely to be an enclave, the authorities need to secure a proper execution of
the government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper that would strengthen growth in the
non-oil economy, reduce poverty, and support the attainment of the MDGs.

•

In 2005, economic growth remained strong, although inflation picked up in 2005 against
the background of a sharp increase in international oil prices that were passed-through to
domestic consumers. Fiscal consolidation advanced in line with the program, and the
fiscal targets for end-2005 are likely to have been met. Broad money grew rapidly on
account of resilient economic growth and an increase in the central bank’s NIR position.
The managed floating exchange rate regime has served the country well and with the
latest changes it better reflects market conditions. The import coverage of reserves
remains above 3.5 months of imports of goods and services.

•

Prospects for 2006 remain favorable, including strong growth, a reduction in inflation,
and maintenance of a sustainable external position. The 2006 program seeks to
consolidate the fiscal measures launched in 2005, including efforts to address tax arrears
and overhaul customs administration procedures. A better control of the growth of
current expenditure, particularly the wage bill, will help to change the composition of
government spending in favor of pro-poor expenditure. Monetary policy will be
consistent with a deceleration of inflation. To foster private sector growth in the non-oil
economy, structural reform efforts will continue, including actions to address the
financial position of the water and electricity company (EMAE).

•

On program risks, a main concern is that the process of fiscal consolidation may be
disrupted against the background of the elections scheduled for 2006. Policy credibility
could also be damaged if the authorities fail to demonstrate their readiness to follow suit
with ongoing investigations about alleged irregularities in the licensing round for oil
Blocks 2–6. Moreover, possible shortfalls in foreign assistance triggered by the future
oil boom could exacerbate the government’s budget constraint in the short run.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Following a decade of large macroeconomic imbalances and state intervention in
the economy, the Sãotomean authorities have pursued economic reforms since 1998 that
have helped increase real GDP growth, lower inflation, and push forward key
structural reforms. Financial aid from international donors increased substantially in
support of these reforms. At the same time, a successful implementation of a staff monitored
program in 1999 led to the approval of a three-year arrangement under the PRGF in
April 2000. São Tomé and Príncipe reached the HIPC Decision point in late December 2000.
2.
However, fiscal performance has been uneven over the years, reflecting
expenditure pressures arising from the domestic political cycle and anticipated large oil
signature bonuses. In 2001, as presidential elections approached, the government failed to
meet a number of fiscal and monetary targets under the Fund supported program. Fiscal
management improved in 2002, but it deteriorated again in 2003 as the government raised
social spending significantly in the aftermath of a “coup d’état” in July 2003. In 2004, the
fiscal position deteriorated even further as

3.
Political stability has remained a challenge in São Tomé and Príncipe since the
1990s, resulting at times in disagreements among senior civil servants belonging to
different political parties. This has led to administrative deadlocks from time to time and to
stop-and-go in economic policy implementation and reform.
4.
The current PRGF arrangement, approved by the Executive Board on
August 1, 2005, seeks to support the government’s efforts to address macroeconomic
imbalances and set the conditions for sustained economic growth and poverty
alleviation.1 The policy agenda is threefold. First, São Tomé and Príncipe needs to continue
fiscal consolidation efforts, while preserving an adequate level of pro-poor spending, to
sustain macroeconomic stability. Second, it needs to reach the HIPC completion point
through a steady implementation of its PRGF-supported program to reduce the external debt

São Tomé and Príncipe’s relations with the Fund are summarized in Appendix II. Relations with the World
Bank and the African Development Bank are described in Appendices III and IV. The staff’s debt sustainability
analysis (DSA) and a summary of statistical issues are discussed in Appendices V and VI, respectively.

service burden and liberate resources to increase pro-poor spending. Third, São Tomé and
Príncipe needs to safeguard an effective management of the prospective vast oil revenue
against the background of weak institutional and absorptive capacities (Box 1). As the oil
sector is likely to be an enclave, reducing poverty and attaining the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) would need high non-oil GDP growth supported by a thorough
implementation of the government’s structural reform program included in the PRSP.
Box 1. São Tomé and Príncipe: Oil Sector Prospects1/
•

Geological analysis in the early 1990s identified large oil and natural gas deposits off-shore
from the islands on São Tomé and Príncipe. The 2001 territorial agreement with Nigeria resulted
in the creation of a Joint Development Zone (JDZ) to be administered by the Joint Development
Authority (JDA) headquartered in Abuja. It was agreed that São Tomé and Príncipe would receive
40 percent of all oil revenue from the JDZ. An Exclusive Development Zone (EDZ), which has been
recognized internationally, will be exploited solely by São Tomé and Príncipe.

•

Oil revenue in the pre-production period will be in the form of oil signature bonuses paid by
field operators. The tax regime, embodied in the Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs) that are
being negotiated with oil companies, would determine the government’s oil receipts during the
production period starting around 2012/13. The oil signature bonus on Block 1 in the JDZ, totaling
US$49.2 million (equivalent to about 75 percent of GDP), was received in July 2005. Negotiations
of PSAs for Blocks 2–6 are currently underway, with signature bonuses, totaling US$54.7 million,
expected during the first half of 2006.

•

Preliminary staff estimates indicate that oil production could have a sizeable effect on São
Tomé and Príncipe’s economic prospects. The country’s oil output share could be about
30 thousand barrels per day around 2013, under the rather conservative assumption that only one out
of six blocks located in the JDZ is found to be commercially exploitable. Under this scenario, an
assuming a constant real price of US$30 per-barrel of oil, annual budget revenue from oil could
stabilize at around US$92 million over the long term (equivalent to 130 percent of 2006 GDP), with
the Permanent Fund reaching a steady state level of US$3.1 billion in constant 2006 dollar terms. If
São Tomé and Príncipe’s share of oil output were to reach 80,000 barrels per day, government
budget receipts and the size of the Permanent Fund would roughly triple.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
5.
Economic performance in 2005 has been generally satisfactory, although
inflation has picked up (Tables 1–7 and
Inflation Rate, January 2004-December 2005

Performance under the program has been broadly satisfactory to date. All eight
quantitative performance criteria set for end-September 2005 were observed (Table 8). Also,
all structural performance criteria set for end-July 2005 were met. This included the
submission to the National Assembly of (i) a new investment code that would provide equal
treatment for domestic and foreign investors, (ii) a new tax code on personal income taxation
that would broaden the tax base and update tax brackets to provide progressivity to the tax

system, (iii) a new tax code on corporate taxation that would substantially limit the granting
of tax holidays to new licensed investors, and (iv) a new tax procedural code establishing tax
tribunals at different levels of government to handle tax issues and disputes, including tax
penalties and fines. In addition, for end-September, three out of four structural benchmarks
were observed (Table 9). The submission to the National Assembly of legislation
criminalizing money laundering and the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT legislation) is still
pending because of the need to update related pieces of legislation. However, the government
intends to submit the legislation to the National Assembly by end-December 2006.
7.
The external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) in 2005 is
expected to remain broadly unchanged with respect to 2004, at about 59 percent of
GDP. A worsening in trade balance due to a strong growth of oil and non-oil imports will be
offset by an improvement in the balance of services owing to increased tourism receipts and
lower-than-expected payments for technical assistance. The overall balance of payments is
expected to show a surplus of about 38 percent of GDP in 2005 due mainly to the receipt of
the oil signature bonus on Block 1, which was deposited in the government’s national oil
account held with the central bank. Gross central bank international reserves (excluding the
National Oil Account) remained at around 3.5 months of imports of goods and nonfactor
services by end-2005.
8.
Fiscal consolidation is progressing as envisaged. At end-September 2005, the
domestic primary deficit was

however, as manifested by a persistent

10.
The monetary authorities have reacted to the increase in inflation. The central
bank reference rate, which had been unchanged since 2003 at 14.5 percent was increased to
18.2 percent in September 2005 (Figure 2). Banks’ reserve requirements were increased from
22 to 24 percent in September, as well. Subsequently, commercial banks increased their
lending and deposit interest rates, which, according to preliminary staff estimates, triggered a
slow-down in bank credit to the economy.
11.
The dobra depreciated against the U.S. dollar in 2005. Most of the dobra
depreciation (18.1 percent) took place in the last quarter of 2005, following technical changes
to the central bank foreign exchange auction, which were implemented in consultation with
the Fund’s Monetary and Financial Systems Department (MFD). Changes included: (i) an
increased frequency, and (ii) changes in the cut-off exchange rate setting for the auctions.
These changes were made to improve the price discovering mechanism of the existing
managed float and to ensure, through an increased auction’s frequency, that sufficient
liquidity is in the market to meet the foreign exchange demand of importers. The real effective
exchange rate appreciation which occurred during the first three quarters of 2005 was reversed
in the last quarter of 2005 (Figure 3).

For comparison purposes with the program's monetary numbers (IMF Country Report
No. 05/323, Tables 4 and 5, and Appendix IV, Table I.1), balance sheet data for endSeptember and end-December 2005 have been adjusted in Tables 4, 5, 8 and Appendix I,
Table I.1, attached, by removing the balances in the government's National Oil Account
(Conta Nacional de Petroleo, CNP) from the definition of central bank net international
reserves and net domestic assets. Originally, the CNP was supposed to be held in the
government’s account with the New York Federal Reserve, not at the central bank.

12.
Compliance with banking sector prudential regulation improved in 2005. The
central bank launched an off-site banking supervision reporting system to shore up
surveillance over the quality of banking sector’s assets, liquidity ratios, capital adequacy, and
profitability. A review of on-site examination guidelines is also well advanced, with an onsite surveillance of the leading deposit money bank (Banco Internacional de São Tomé and
Príncipe, BISTP) expected in the first half of 2006. A preliminary assessment by the bank
regulators indicates that the BISTP is in sound footing according to off-site prudential
regulation indicators.
13.
The implementation of the government’s structural reform program moved
forward in 2005. Structural conditionality under the existing PRGF arrangement was
implemented on schedule, except for delays in the submission of AML/CFT legislation to the
National Assembly. In parallel, consistent with the government’s PRSP, the authorities are
embarked in a process of institutional development of the oil sector, improved public
expenditure and external debt management, public enterprise reform, judicial sector reform,
and improved business climate (Table 10).
14.
However, achieving full transparency in oil sector related issues has remained
challenging. Following the completion of the licensing round of Blocks 2–6 in 2005, the
National Petroleum Council, which includes the President of the Republic, the Prime
Minister and key cabinet members, issued a communiqué acknowledging allegations about
lack of transparency and technical flaws in the awarding of the blocks. Nonetheless, the
Council concluded that these flaws were not detrimental to the country’s long-term interest
and decided to go forward with the process. A subsequent report by the Attorney General’s
Office of São Tomé and Príncipe has confirmed the existence of irregularities in the process.
To date, no decision has been taken by the authorities regarding the Attorney General’s
findings and the appropriateness of any remedial measures. The staff have emphasized to the
authorities the seriousness of these issues and the need to strengthen good governance and
transparency in the oil sector.
15.
São Tomé and Príncipe is current with its obligations with multilateral creditors
and has cleared its arrears with Paris Club creditors as part of a new multilateral debt
rescheduling agreement on Cologne terms. The authorities are currently in the process of
reconciling debt records with Paris Club creditors, with the expectation of settling any
outstanding amounts before end-March 2006. Contacts with non-Paris Club bilateral
creditors are also being pursued to start reconciliation of debt records.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
16.
Policy discussions focused on the need to fundamentally address the economy’s
macroeconomic imbalances and avoid the fiscal slippages that characterized the stopand-go policy implementation in recent years. The authorities concurred that fiscal
consolidation, while preserving an adequate level of pro-poor spending, was critical to
sustain macroeconomic stability. They acknowledged that the poor are usually the most
affected by high inflation and sluggish economic growth.

- 11 -

17.
The authorities recognized the policy challenges at stake, including the need to
manage the prospective large oil revenue against the background of weak institutional
and absorptive capacities. In the immediate future, fiscal consolidation would require
striking a balance between (i) the population’s expectation about the government’s ability to
increase priority spending in the wake of the oil era and (ii) the available budgetary resources
stemming mainly from foreign aid and a gradual use of the oil signature bonuses of 2005–06
in line with the Oil Revenue Management Law. Over the near- and medium-term, a main
task would be to develop strong institutions to secure an effective, transparent, and fullyaccountable management of oil revenue. The gradual build up of Permanent Oil Fund for
future generations would also be part of this endeavor. As the oil sector is likely to be an
enclave, the authorities are actively engaged with development partners to secure a proper
execution of the government’s PRSP that would strengthen growth in the non-oil economy,
reduce poverty, and support the attainment of the MDGs.
18.
The Sãotomean authorities appreciated the advice provided by the Fund
Executive Board in the context of the Article IV consultations, and have been working
towards their implementation in the context of the PRGF arrangement
(www.imf.org/external/country/STP/index.htm). The authorities particularly welcomed
the Board’s recommendation during the latest consultation (concluded in March 2004) to
adopt policies that are conducive to macroeconomic stability, a reduction in poverty and
achieving high growth in the non-oil sector. A key element was the development of strong
institutions to ensure a proper management of prospective oil revenue. The Board’s advice
was instrumental in supporting the adoption of the Oil Revenue Management Law (ORML)
in December 2004 and has helped in forging consensus among policymakers toward a
successful implementation of the PRGF-supported program to date. Ongoing work at various
levels of government seeks to attain an effective development of the supporting institutional
framework devised in the ORML. Furthermore, to increase potential output in the non-oil
economy, the PRGF-supported program includes a comprehensive structural reform agenda.
The authorities also stressed the need of continued technical assistance in the areas of Fund
expertise to buttress administrative capacity and policy decision making.
A. Macroeconomic Outlook
19.
The medium-term outlook seems relatively promising in the aftermath of the
recent awarding of oil Blocks 2 to 6, located in the zone jointly operated with Nigeria. In
this regard, the baseline medium-term scenario discussed with the authorities illustrates a
likely evolution of the economy as the local oil sector develops under conditions of increased
macroeconomic stability and continued structural reform. In this context, and in line with
past Fund surveillance, the authorities stressed the importance of continued Fund technical
assistance in buttressing administrative capacity and helping the deepening of major reforms
in revenue, expenditure management, and the monetary and exchange rate policy areas.
Domestic investment would increase sharply from 36 percent of GDP in 2003–05 to
42 percent in 2006, and to an average of 54 percent of GDP in 2007–10, largely on account
of oil sector investment initiatives. The rise in the investment ratio will require a continuous
reliance on foreign savings, although national savings are forecast to rise on account of a

- 12 -

robust financial position of the government and increased private savings once stability and
economic growth become firmly established. Under the baseline scenario, external financing
gaps (after revenue measures) would be around 2.5–3.5 percent of GDP per-year between
2007 and 2010, despite the envisaged significant consolidation of the fiscal stance. While the
MDRI could liberate about 2 percentage points of GDP, on average, to finance pro-poor
spending (see paragraph 31, below), there will be a need for additional external financing of
about 1.5 percent of GDP per-year during this period.

20.
The authorities broadly agreed with the baseline scenario, but noted that to
significantly reduce poverty by 2010, as targeted in the PRSP, higher economic growth
than envisaged was necessary. In particular, the economy would need to grow at an annual
average growth rate of 8 percent during 2006–12, compared with a 6 percent average growth
rate in the baseline scenario, to achieve the MDGs (Table 11). The staff agreed with the
authorities that achieving the MDGs would require a substantially higher donor support than
envisaged in the baseline scenario. A gradual and transparent use of the oil signature
bonuses—consistent with the Oil Revenue Management Law and as included in the baseline
scenario—could, in part, substitute for the ongoing decline in foreign assistance and
traditional short-term borrowing to finance the budget. However, these oil resources would
not be enough to fill the resource gap.
B. Fiscal Policy
21. The authorities stressed their determination to sustain the process of fiscal
consolidation that started in 2005. They underlined the need to increase tax revenue,
reduce wasteful expenditure, improve the composition of government spending by
increasing the share of capital and pro-poor expenditure in line with the government’s
PRSP, and seek to eliminate government recourse to central bank financing.
22.
The authorities are implementing measures to strengthen revenue collection
over the short and medium term (Box 2). A public campaign is currently underway
stressing the government’s decision to improve tax compliance and reduce tax arrears,

- 13 -

particularly in the case of direct taxes. The authorities are also working with the Millennium
Challenge Corporation to launch an overhaul of the customs administration system during
2006. Over the medium term, the emphasis would be to review the existing personal and
corporate income tax codes; draft legislation of these codes is currently under review by the
National Assembly.

•

23.
On the expenditure side, the government’s objective is to change the composition
of government outlays in favor of pro-poor expenditure. This implies implementing a
number of investment projects in agriculture and fisheries, which are in line with the PRSP
and the government’s efforts to address the MDGs. Specifically, the spending envelope for
capital expenditure financed by the treasury and HIPC-related social expenditure will
increase from 6.2 percent of GDP in 2005 to 9.1 percent in 2006, and 11.3 percent of GDP in
2007. Current expenditure (excluding budgetary allocations for the holding of parliamentary,
regional, and presidential elections in 2006) will decline gradually as a share of GDP over the
medium term. A key element will be the wage bill, which is projected to increase above the
inflation rate, but to gradually decline in terms of GDP over the medium term. This objective
will be achieved by pursuing a strict management of the payroll through the activation of the
civil servants’ register that is being developed in consultation with the UNDP.
24.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal plan embraces a number of policies aimed
at improving expenditure management. These measures include the implementation of a
fully integrated, computerized budget and public expenditure management system (SIGFE),

- 14 -

and the launching of a reform of the auditing practices of the financial operations of the
general government and public enterprises by the Inspectorate-General of Finance.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
25.
The authorities discussed with staff the factors contributing to the acceleration
of inflation in 2005. The authorities acknowledged the role of monetary variables in
explaining inflation, but noted that the volatility of monetary aggregates reflected the impact
of intermittent inflows of foreign aid and the monetization of oil signature bonuses. In this
regard, the authorities argued that inflation in 2005 reflected mainly supply shocks stemming
from increases in international oil prices that were passed-through to domestic consumers
and the inflationary impact stemming from food shortages due to a poor agricultural harvest
and temporary breakdowns in the commodity import distribution channels into the islands.
The staff discussed with the authorities some preliminary econometric analysis showing that
inflation in São Tomé and Príncipe is positively correlated with both the depreciation of the
exchange rate and broad money growth. The staff also stressed the transitory nature of some
price increases driven by supply shocks. The authorities welcomed the staff’s analysis and
restated their support for the development of indirect monetary instruments, an area in which
the central bank is receiving technical assistance from the Fund. 4
26.
The staff agreed with the authorities that monetary policy continues to play a
key role in achieving the program’s inflation target, with base money as the nominal
anchor. The central bank will use a judicious mix of monetary instruments, primarily foreign
exchange sales and the issuance of central bank certificates of deposit (CDs), to sterilize
excess liquidity. In this context, it was agreed that base money will be closely monitored in
the program. The authorities also reiterated the view that the central bank reference rate
should be kept above the inflation rate and, if needed, banks’ reserve requirements will be
used until indirect instruments of monetary policy are further developed. Coordination of
fiscal and monetary policies will also be enhanced in 2006 through regular meetings between
the BCSTP and the Ministry of Planning and Finance aimed at forecasting liquidity
constraints.
27.
The authorities and the staff concurred that the existing managed float exchange
rate system has served the country well so far, as it helps cushion exogenous shocks. The
temporary appreciation of the real effective exchange rate during the first three quarters of
2005—which fully reverted to its end-December 2004 level by end-2005—does not seem to
have had an adverse effect on non-oil export activities, international reserves remain broadly
adequate, and the exchange rate does not appear to be currently misaligned. The cumulative
depreciation of the real effective exchange rate between mid-2001 and end-December 2005
has been about 15 percent. Nevertheless, cocoa export volumes have reflected mainly supply
conditions and are mostly directed to niche markets in Western Europe. Tourism, which has
benefited from a trend increase in foreign direct investment, is a high value added sector
4

See Chapter III in the accompanying Selected Issues Paper.

- 15 -

attracting a selected group of wealthy outdoor adventure and eco-tourists. Also, import
coverage of reserves, excluding the National Oil Account, is above three and a half months
of imports of goods and services; reserves are equivalent to about 150 percent of base money,
on average.5 The monetary authorities expressed their appreciation of the Fund’s advice on
exchange rate policy and its timely provision of technical assistance. The staff commended
the authorities on their commitment to improve the foreign exchange market and the work
done so far in this area.
D. Banking Sector
28.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to enhancing the central bank’s
banking sector supervisory capacity, while securing an effective implementation of the
reforms introduced in 2005 (Box 3). Decisive action regarding weak banks, including
recapitalization or closure of affected banks, when appropriate, would be critical to foster the
development of an efficient and sound domestic banking system.

Box 3. São Tomé and Príncipe: Financial Sector Reform–Action Plan for 2006
•

Strict implementation of new procedures for licensing financial institutions.

•

Regular compilation of banks’ consolidated reporting statistics.

•

Implementation of scheduled on-site banks’ examinations.

•

Issuance of new guidelines on banks’ capital requirements, including elements of Basel II
recommended benchmarks.

•

Development of a “credit bureau” to assess overall financial sector’s credit risk.

E. External Sector Policies
29.
Discussions on external sector policies focused on ways to diversify exports of
goods and services, while creating employment in the non-oil economy (Box 4). The
authorities indicated that actions in all these areas were proceeding according to plan. Also,
the authorities informed the staff that São Tomé and Príncipe applied for membership at the
World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 2005. The Working Party on São Tomé and
Príncipe’s accession will meet following the authorities’ submission of the required
Memorandum on the Foreign Trade Regime.

5

Information collected by the central bank indicates that the spread between the official and the parallel
exchange rates of the dobra was 2 percent at end-2005. However, there are neither consistent time series data on
parallel exchange rates, nor independent sources of information to confirm the quality of the central bank data.

- 16 -

Box 4. São Tomé and Príncipe: External Sector Policies—Status Report
•

Draft legislation is currently with the National Assembly to eliminate tariff exemptions granted to
public institutions on imports of raw materials and capital equipment, and to political parties on
imports of goods and vehicles during the pre-election campaign.

•

A newly-completed Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) recommends a number of measures
to expand and diversify exports. Key measures included in the 2006 Fund-supported program are
(i) the approval of a new investment code and new codes for personal and corporate income
taxation, (ii) the simplification of customs procedures, and (iii) the preparation of a strategy for the
electricity sector and the restructuring of the public enterprise administering seaports (ENAPORT).

•

São Tomé and Príncipe has an observer status in CEMAC and is participating in preparations for
upcoming Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) negotiations with EU.

30.
The mission agreed with the authorities that São Tomé and Príncipe’s trade
regime is relatively open. The tariff regime schedule was adjusted in mid-2002, shifting
some agricultural and industrial goods among the three tiers of 5 percent, 10 percent, and
20 percent.6 The only remaining non-tariff barrier protecting the domestic
telecommunications company from competition expired on December 31, 2005.
31. São Tomé and Príncipe no longer maintains exchange restrictions under the
transitional arrangements of Article XIV of the Articles of Agreement. The authorities
have expressed their intentions to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 (a),
3 and 4 in the near future. In December 2005, a joint LEG/MFD mission visited São Tomé
to conduct a review of the exchange system. While staff found evidence that suggests that
São Tomé and Príncipe may maintain a number of restrictions subject to Fund approval,
staff and the authorities are still in the process of finalizing the review of the exchange
system, and staff intends to present the findings and recommendations at the time of the
second review under the PRGF arrangement.
32.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s public debt will remain high over the medium term
(Appendix V). Even after assuming debt rescheduling from the Paris Club in 2005, and
further debt relief after reaching HIPC completion point in 2006, the NPV of debt-to-export
ratio is only projected to fall from 500 percent at end-2005 to 246 percent by end-2011.
However, preliminary staff calculations suggests that the country would benefit from a
significant reduction in debt service under the MDRI once the HIPC completion point is
reached, hopefully in mid-2006.7

6

Basic goods are in the 5 percent band, while luxury goods are taxed at the 20 percent rate. All other goods are
taxed at the 10 percent rate. There are surcharges, notably for vehicles, fuel, tobacco, and alcohol.
7

Tables 1-7 do not include the impact of the MDRI.

- 17 -

F. Structural Reform and Governance Issues
33. The authorities are committed to accelerate structural reform with a view to
foster private sector development and increase the growth potential of the economy. In
line with the government’s PRSP, the authorities intend to revisit property rights for land
tenure, deepen the process of judicial reform, implement measures to improve the country’s
business climate, and push forward with public enterprise reform and restructuring.
34.
The authorities also intend to assess ways to maximize the spillover effects of the
development of the oil sector on the non-oil economy. To this end, the National Petroleum
Agency (ANP) is developing a master document to identify local businesses and/or joint
ventures based in the islands that could become suppliers of intermediate goods or services to
the oil exploration industry. The expectation is to safeguard the efficiency of spending in the
oil sector, while increasing the local content of intermediate demand and other income
multiplier effects in São Tomé and Príncipe.

In regards to governance issues, the authorities re-affirmed the government’s
commitment to zero tolerance for acts of corruption. The authorities stressed the need to

establishing the Petroleum
Oversight Commission, the Public Registration and Information Office, and a special law
regulating the civil, criminal, and administrative responsibilities to handle violations of the
ORML. The authorities concurred with the staff on the seriousness of the allegations
regarding the lack of transparency and technical flaws in the licensing round of Blocks 2–6.
In line with the Treaty between São Tomé and Príncipe and Nigeria on the Joint
Development Zone, the authorities intend to raise the issue at the forthcoming Joint
Ministerial Committee meeting, scheduled for early February 2006.
G. Poverty Reduction Strategy
36. The authorities informed the mission that the first PRSP annual report is
currently under preparation by the Ministry of Planning and Finance. The report
should provide a candid description of the PRSP’s implementation setbacks to date.
Nevertheless, the report will recommend giving a strong boost to the strategy during the
next three years, through an effective implementation of the Priority Actions Program (PAP)
that was discussed with donors at the recent roundtable meeting in Brussels (December 6,
2005). The PAP identifies financial needs of US$170 million for 2006–08, of which some
U$70 million were pledged at the Brussels roundtable, marginally above previously existing
commitments.
37.
Steady progress has been accomplished towards the implementation of all
trigger points laid out in the HIPC decision point document (Table 12). The sectoral
strategies for health and education have already been developed and costed. Public
expenditure management is progressing, including a close monitoring over the use of HIPC
funds, better programming and execution of foreign-financed capital expenditure, and the
ongoing development of a computerized public expenditure management system. In addition,
the government established the Auditor General’s Office in mid-2003 and issued the Oil
Revenue Management Law in December 2004.

IV. PROGRAM FOR 2006
39. The program for 2006—detailed in the attached Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Polices—is consistent with the authorities’ medium-term policy framework
and focuses on consolidating macroeconomic stability and structural reforms
(Appendix I). Real GDP growth is projected to increase to 4.5 percent, while inflation is
expected to decline to 13 percent in 2006. The external current account deficit (excluding
transfers) is expected to remain large (at about 60 percent of GDP) against the background
of a high oil import bill and large investment-related imports. Gross international reserves
(excluding the National Oil Account) will remain above three and a half months of imports
of goods and services.
40.
Fiscal consolidation will continue. However, the domestic primary deficit will
increase by one percentage point of GDP to 15 percent in 2006, on account of increased
priority spending consistent with the government’s PRSP (MEFP, ¶8). Net central bank
credit to the government will be negative to allow adequate financing to the private sector.
41.
The government’s efforts to increase tax revenue will be maintained (MEFP, ¶9).
The program’s revenue targets will be supported by (i) the full-year effect of the tax
measures introduced in late 2005, (ii) increases in tax-related receipts on oil, (iii) the
collection of tax arrears on corporate and individual income taxes, and (iv) the
implementation of the reform of the customs administration to facilitate trade and align
customs’ inspection and verification systems with best international practices.
42.
During 2006, the share of pro-poor spending in the government’s overall
expenditure envelope will increase in tandem with an upgrading of public expenditure
management systems (MEFP, ¶10–13). Efforts to contain the growth of current expenditure,
particularly the wage bill, will continue. The latter objective will be addressed through a
strict management of the payroll using the civil servants’ register that is being developed in
consultation with the UNDP.
43.
Monetary policy will continue to be prudent in the context of a flexible exchange
rate regime (MEFP, ¶14–18). The central bank will continue to implement a judicious mix
of sterilization instruments to mop up excess liquidity. The staff welcome the intention of the
monetary authorities to continue strengthening banking supervision.
44.
In the structural front, the focus will be to reform key public enterprises to
further improve the private sector environment (MEFP, ¶24–26). A comprehensive
strategy has been launched to improve the finances of EMAE and safeguard an adequate
supply of electricity over the medium term. Key measures in this regard include an increase
in utilities tariffs to cover costs of electricity production and the introduction of a system of
prepayment through electricity metering keypads to address customers’ arrears. Feasibility
studies of the public enterprises administering the airports (ENASA) and seaports
(ENAPORT) will be prepared with World Bank financial support. A key objective would be
to assess the scope for private sector investment in the sector. Also, to improve the business
climate, the government will (i) repeal legislation unduly increasing the number of days

- 21 -

needed to establish a business in São Tomé and Príncipe, and (ii) develop tribunals of
arbitration for business litigation. In addition, approval of critical legislation—including a
new tax procedural code and new tax codes for personal and corporate income taxation—by
the National Assembly is targeted for 2006. Finally, in support of full transparency in oil
revenue management, the authorities have recently submitted a formal request to the Joint
Development Agency (JDA), recommending the prompt publication of the PSA on Block 1
that was signed between the JDA and the selected oil operator. All other regulations
governing the oil sector are already public information.
V. PROGRAM MONITORING, RISKS, AND SAFEGUARDS ASSESSMENT
45.
The second review under the PRGF arrangement is expected to be completed no
later than end-June 2006, and will make available the third disbursement (Tables 13
and 14), subject to the observance of the quantitative performance criteria set for endDecember 2005 and the definitions set out in the corresponding technical memorandum of
understanding (IMF Country Report No. 05/323, Appendix IV, Attachments II and II). The
fourth disbursement which will become available upon completion of the third review
scheduled for November 2006, will be subject to the end-June 2006 performance criteria
specified in Tables I.1 and I.2 in the MEFP (Appendix I, Attachment I). The attached
technical memorandum of understanding (TMU; Appendix I, Attachment II) details the
design of the program. Minor changes were made to the TMU to clarify a few definitions.
46.
The program is subject to a number of risks. First, the process of fiscal
consolidation may weaken in the wake of legislative and presidential elections scheduled for
late-March and the second half of 2006, respectively, and intense social pressures for a
prompt delivery of priority spending before oil production starts. Second, inaction by the
authorities to follow suit on the allegations of irregularities in the bidding process of
Blocks 2–6 could hamper the credibility of the country, thus hindering the development of
the oil sector. Third, possible shortfalls in foreign assistance triggered by the prospective oil
boom could exacerbate the government’s budget constraint in the short run.
47.
The monetary authorities are continuing to address the weaknesses identified in
the Fund’ safeguards assessment conducted in 2004 (MEFP, ¶25). The BCSTP has
published the external audit of its 2003 and 2004 financial statements, and will publish its
audited financial statements on a regular basis from now on.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
São Tomé and Príncipe needs to continue to address macroeconomic imbalances
and set the conditions for sustained economic growth and poverty alleviation. Over the
medium term, a main challenge would be to develop strong institutions to secure a
transparent management of oil revenue. As the oil sector is likely to be an enclave, the
authorities need to secure a proper execution of the government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper that would strengthen growth in the non-oil economy, reduce poverty, and support the
attainment of the MDGs. Lasting and enhanced donors’ support to finance the PRSP would
be vital in this regard.

- 22 -

49.
The staff supports the authorities’ decision to sustain the process of fiscal
consolidation that started in 2005, while safeguarding an adequate level of pro-poor
spending. The staff concurs on the need to increase tax revenue, reduce wasteful
expenditure, and improve the composition of government spending by increasing the share of
pro-poor expenditure in line with the PRSP. Fiscal consolidation would also be enhanced by
the implementation of a fully integrated, computerized budget and public expenditure
management system (SIGFE), and the reform of the auditing practices of the general
government’s and public enterprises’ financial operations.
50.
The staff concurs that the overall stance of financial policies remains broadly
adequate, with monetary policy continuing to play a key role in achieving the
government’s inflation target and safeguarding the central bank’s international reserve
position. To control liquidity, the staff encourages the authorities to continue to make
judicious checks between foreign exchange sales and the issuance of liquidity absorbing
instruments, such as central bank certificates of deposits. The staff supports the authorities’
commitment to keep the central bank reference rate above the inflation rate and to improve
the coordination of fiscal and monetary policies to better forecast liquidity. Recent progress
in bank supervision is welcome.
51.
In the staff’s view, São Tomé and Príncipe’s managed floating exchange rate
system remains appropriate. It allows the monetary authorities to address the volatility of
external inflows and cushion exogenous shocks. The staff commends the BCSTP for
improving its foreign exchange auction system to strengthen the price discovering
mechanism of the existing managed float rate.
52.
Helped by the tariff reforms in 2002, São Tomé and Príncipe has a relatively
open trade regime. The staff commends the authorities for the termination, in endDecember 2005, of the only remaining nontariff barrier protecting the domestic
telecommunications company from competition.
53.
The staff commends the authorities on their efforts to enhance the central bank’s
banking sector supervisory capacity. Critical in this regard would be an effective
implementation of the measures introduced in 2005 regarding the licensing of new banks and
the development of on-site and off-site prudential regulation indicators. Decisive action
regarding weak banks, including recapitalization or closure of affected institutions, when
appropriate, would be also important to foster the development of an efficient and sound
domestic banking system.
54.
The staff supports the authorities’ commitments to accelerate structural reform
and achieve full transparency in oil revenue management. A key goal for 2006 will be to
implement the action plan to improve the finances of EMAE and complete the feasibility
studies of ENASA and ENAPORT. Also essential would be to improve the business climate,
including the elimination of administrative barriers to start-up businesses, the establishing of
tribunals of arbitration, and the approval of new codes for personal and corporate income
taxation. Publication of the PSAs signed between the JDA and the selected oil operators

- 23 -

would be an important milestone toward securing accountability and good governance in the
nascent oil sector.
55.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to improve the coverage,
timeliness, and periodicity of basic macroeconomic statistics.
56.
The staff recommends the completion of the first review under the PRGF
arrangement. All the quantitative and structural performance criteria set for endSeptember 2005 under the current PRGF arrangement were met.
57.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ stated interest in accepting the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2 (a) , 3 and 4 and the progress made in the review of the
exchange system.
58.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to publish the staff report, the letter of
intent, and the MEFP. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with São
Tomé and Príncipe take place within 24 months subject to the provisions of the decision on
consultation cycles in program countries.

1/ For comparison purposes with the program's monetary numbers (Country Report No. 05/323) balance sheet data for end-September and end-December 2005 have been adjusted by removing the government's National Oil Account
(Conta Nacional de Petroleo, CNP) from the definition of central bank net international reserves and net domestic assets. Originally, the CNP was supposed to be held directly by the government in an account with the Federal Reserve,
not with the central bank.

Perf. criteria
Ind.Target

1/ Equal to government domestic expenditure, as defined in the TMU, excluding all interest payments.
2/ The ceiling will be adjusted downward (upward) by the cumulative negative (positive) deviations in external debt serviceand the cumulative positive (negative) deviation of actual from projected disbursements of external program support.
The downward adjustment of higher than programmed external program support will not take place to the extent that the additional support is used to accommodate higher capital outlays of the government, up to US$1 million.
3/ The ceiling will be adjusted downwards by the amount of accumulated domestic arrears.
4/ For 2005, actual for end-September and projected for end-December excludes the National Oil Account, consistent with the assumption under IMF Country Report No. 05/323 that such resources would be deposited in a correpondent bank and would not be reflected in Central Bank accounts.
For 2006, includes the National Oil Account within the balance sheet of the Central Bank, consistent with the new TMU.
5/ The floor on net international reserves will be adjusted upwards (downwards) by the cumulative negative (positive) deviation in external debt service and the cumulative negative (positive) deviation of actual from projected disbursements of external program support
The upward adjustment of higher than programmed external program support will not take place to the extent that the additional support is used to accommodate higher capital outlays of the government, up to US$1 million.
6/ This is a continuous performance criterion.
7/ This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt
adopted on August 24, 2000, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received.
8/ With a grant element of less than 50 percent.
9/ Debt is defined as in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted on August 24, 2000.

APPENDIX I

São Tomé, February 9, 2006

Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
This letter and the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
(MEFP) supplement the letter of intent dated June 30, 2005, and the MEFP of June 2005.
The attached MEFP reviews economic developments and policy implementation in 2005. It
also sets out the policies that our government intends to implement in 2006 in order to
achieve the program objectives. The policy framework for next year is consistent with the
macro stabilization and structural reform pursued under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement that was approved by the IMF Executive Board on
August 1, 2005. Subject to continued satisfactory performance under the PRGF-supported
program and implementation of other applicable conditions, we hope that São Tomé and
Príncipe will attain the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative around mid2006.
2.
The government of São Tomé and Príncipe has made progress in increasing revenue
and controlling the growth of nonprioritary spending to make room for increased povertyrelated spending, strengthening public expenditure management, and using appropriate
monetary policy to contain inflation despite a large increase in international oil prices which
was fully passed-through to domestic consumers. Looking forward, the policies set out in the
attached memorandum, together with a continuing implementation of the government
poverty reduction strategy (Estratégia Nacional para Redução da Pobreza; PRSP), aim at
solidifying these gains. The performance criteria and benchmarks for end-June 2006 related
to the fourth disbursement scheduled for mid-November 2006, as well as the indicative
targets for end-March, end-September, and end-December 2006, are set out in Tables I.1 and
I.2 of the MEFP. Our intention is to establish end-December 2006 quantitative performance
criteria related to the fifth disbursement, scheduled for mid-May 2007 and subject to the
fourth review, at the time of the third review scheduled for November 2006, when a new
government—following the scheduled parliamentary elections in March 2006—is fully
abreast of the economic situation and ready to ratify the policy commitments under the
PRGF-supported program.
3.
In support of our objectives and policies, the government of São Tomé and Príncipe
hereby requests the completion of the First Review and the disbursement of the second
tranche under the PRGF in an amount equivalent to SDR 0.423 million, equivalent to

- 44 -

APPENDIX I

5.7 percent of quota. In strengthening its overall economic program, the government will
continue with a steadfast implementation of the program understandings and resolute efforts
to seek additional donor support, as it was done on the occasion of the donor roundtable held
in Brussels, under UNDP’s auspices, on December 6, 2005.
4.
The government of São Tomé and Príncipe will provide the Fund with such
information as the Fund may request in connection with the progress made in implementing
the economic and financial policies and achieving the objectives of the program.
5.
The government of São Tomé and Príncipe believes that the policies and measures set
forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to achieve the objectives of the 2006 program
supported by the PRGF arrangement, but will take further measures to that end if deemed
necessary. During the implementation of the arrangement, the government of São Tomé and
Principe will consult with the Managing Director on the adoption of any measures that may
be appropriate, at the initiative of the government or whenever the Managing Director
requests such a consultation.
6.
The government intends to make the contents of this letter and those of the attached
MEFP, the technical memorandum of understanding (TMU), and the staff report for this
review and the 2005 Article IV consultation, available to the public. In this regard, it
authorizes the IMF to arrange for them to be posted on the Fund’s website, subsequent to
Board completion of the review and conclusion of the 2005 Article IV consultation.
7.
We can assure you, Mr. Managing Director, that the government of São Tomé and
Príncipe is determined to fully implement the program and we hope we can count on the
continued support of the Fund in our endeavors.

Sincerely yours,
/s/
Maria do Carmo Trovoada
Prime Minister and Minister of Planning and Finance

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

São Tomé and Príncipe: Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies for 2006
February 2006
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) supplements that of
June 2005, as well as the letter of intent dated June 30, 2005. It describes (i) performance
under the PRGF-supported program up to September 2005, (ii) progress vis-à-vis the
December 2005 program targets, and (iii) the government’s economic program for 2006. The
thrust of the policies embodied in this MEFP is consistent with the medium-term strategy
underpinning the three-year arrangement under the PRGF, which was approved by the IMF’s
Executive Board on August 1, 2005. Subject to continued satisfactory performance under the
PRGF-supported program and implementation of other applicable conditions, we hope that
São Tomé and Príncipe will attain the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative
around mid-2006.
II. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE 2005 PROGRAM
2.
During 2005, macroeconomic developments have been broadly satisfactory despite a
worsening of the external environment. Leading indicators on the real economy are up:
nonoil commodity imports increased by 30 percent between January and August 2005,
compared with the same period a year ago, and electricity consumption increased by
13 percent during the same period. Also, the programmed increase in the monthly minimum
wage from US$31 to US$40 dollars in late-July has kept aggregate demand buoyant. At the
same time, however, the large increase in international oil prices registered this year has put
pressure on domestic inflation, as these price increases were passed-through to domestic
consumers. The (end-period) annual inflation rate for 2005 is currently projected to increase
from 15.2 percent in December 2004 to 17 percent in 2005. Our assessment is that at least
two percentage points in the current inflation rate are explained by rising international oil
prices in the first half of 2005. Electricity tariffs were also increased significantly on
November 1, 2005, to address the difficult financial position of the water and electricity
company (EMAE). To keep inflation in check and strengthen our program’s policy
credibility, the Central Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe (BCSTP) increased its reference
interest rate from 14.5 percent to 18.2 percent in September 2005. An increased frequency of
the foreign exchange auctions during November and December 2005 has also helped to
satisfy uphold demand for foreign exchange by relatively large importers, effectively
tightening base money at the end of the year. In our view, these monetary policy measures,
should lower inflation expectations and deliver a decline in average monthly inflation rates in
2006, consistent with the inflation rate assumed under the program for that year. The tight
fiscal stance projected through the end of 2005 should also help arrest aggregate demand
pressures in the near-term: the domestic primary deficit is projected at 14 percent of GDP by
end-2005, compared with deficit of 17.5 percent of GDP under the PRGF-supported
program.

- 46 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

3.
Performance under the PRGF-supported program has been satisfactory. All
quantitative performance criteria were observed for end-September 2005. All the structural
performance criteria and three structural benchmarks were also met by their scheduled date.
This included, notably, the submission to the National Assembly by end-July 2005, of new
tax codes on personal and corporate taxation, a new investment code leveling-off the ground
for domestic and foreign investors, and new tax administration and tax procedural codes.
However, the submission to the National Assembly of legislation criminalizing money
laundering and financing of terrorism (structural benchmark for end-September 2005) is still
pending while related pieces of legislation are updated. Our plans are to expedite the
legislation-updating required during 2006, with a view to submit the legislation to the
National Assembly by end-December 2006.
III. THE MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK FOR 2006
4.
The macroeconomic outlook is favorable, particularly following the awarding of five
additional oil fields located in the zone jointly operated with Nigeria and the rapid progress
expected in the completion of the corresponding Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs)
with the selected field operators. With respect to Block 4, the expectation is that a new oil
consortium would soon be formed following the recent unexpected withdrawal from the
group of the selected company to operate the block. Our assessment is that the economy’s
medium-term growth outlook has improved dramatically. The main challenge for
policymakers being the need to secure an orderly transition from the low levels of domestic
consumption to those consistent with a fully developed oil sector. Oil revenue in the preproduction period will remain in the form of oil signature bonuses paid by field operators,
while the tax regime embodied in the PSAs would determine the government’s oil receipts
when production starts around 2012/13.
5.
Social demands for an increased—and prompt—delivery of basic public services
remain unabated. A recent outbreak of cholera in São Tomé highlights the weaknesses of our
health services, including the supply of minimum sanitary standards for potable water, as
well as shortages with the provision of medical services for those affected by the disease.
Social tensions have also been accentuated in recent months among rural population
suffering from inadequate roads and infrastructure to access cities. In this context, our view is
that these social needs should be a reference benchmark from which to devise and implement
economic policies throughout.
6.
The 2006 macroeconomic framework is based on gradually accelerating economic
growth and declining inflation supported by continued prudent macroeconomic policies and
further progress with structural reforms. Real GDP growth is projected to increase from
3.8 percent in 2005 to 4.5 percent in 2006, reflecting fresh initiatives in the infrastructure
sector consistent with the implementation of the government’s PRSP. This increase is also
attributed to private sector investments such as in construction, banking, and trade services,
in anticipation of strong growth in the domestic oil sector. Thanks to a prudent monetary
policy, inflation is expected to decline from 17 percent in 2005 to 13 percent in 2006. Given
the projected private investment, as well as the still-high oil import prices, the external

- 47 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

current account deficit (including transfers) will remain large, at an equivalent of about
33 percent of GDP. International reserves (excluding the National Oil Account) will remain
above three and a half months of imports of goods and services, and will be equivalent to
about 150 percent of base money by end-December 2006. Assuming completion point under
the Enhanced HIPC initiative by mid-2006, the country’s debt service ratios would decline
drastically from 56 percent of exports of goods and services in 2005 to 16 percent in 2006.
The implementation of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative would further improve São
Tomé and Príncipe’s debt service ratios after reaching HIPC completion point.
7.
Since the debt rescheduling agreement—on Cologne terms—concluded with Paris
Club creditors in September 2005, São Tomé and Príncipe has cleared its arrears with the
Paris Club creditors. The signature of bilateral agreements with Paris Club creditors is
expected to be concluded by April 1, 2006. With respect to its debt to non-Paris Club
bilateral creditors, São Tomé and Príncipe will soon start contacting creditors to negotiate
debt restructurings in comparable terms to those included in the Paris Club agreement. Our
assessment is that the regularization of debts with non-Paris Club countries will only take
place in 2006. Under these circumstances, the US$1.3 million appropriated in the 2005
budget for this debt settlement would remain in an escrow account held by the government at
the Central Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe (BCSTP), until payment of these external
obligations is made.
A. Fiscal Policy
8.
The fiscal stance during 2006 will be in line with the program supported by the PRGF
arrangement, while taking into account recent developments in the oil sector and building
upon the various tax measures implemented in 2005. The budget will incorporate part of the
second round of oil bonuses concluded in May 2005, with the bulk of the bonus receipts
being accumulated in the government’s National Oil Account at the BCSTP. The utilization
of the oil bonuses will cover projected shortfalls in foreign assistance and the termination of
short-term foreign borrowing to finance government spending. Calibration in the use of the
bonuses will permit an increase in pro-poor investment outlays consistent with the
government’s PRSP and will seek to avoid bottlenecks in terms of absorptive capacity.
Specifically, the domestic primary deficit will increase from about 14 percent of GDP in
2005 to 15.2 percent in 2006, on account of increased priority spending consistent with the
government’s PRSP. The composition of total government expenditure will shift in favor of
priority spending. Total capital expenditure plus HIPC spending is expected to increase by
roughly 7 percentage points of GDP, while current expenditure (excluding budgetary
allocations for the holding of parliamentary, regional, and presidential elections) will be
decline somewhat as a share of GDP between 2005 and 2006.
9.
Total budget revenues (excluding grants and the oil signature bonus receipts) are
expected to reach dobras 285.6 billion (i.e., 32.1 percent of GDP, compared with
30.2 percent in 2005), of which dobras 237.6 billion are tax revenues and dobras 48.1 billion
are nontax revenues. Attainment of the tax revenue targets for 2006 will be supported by a
number of policy initiatives:

- 48 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

•

The full year effect of the tax measures introduced in late 2005--this includes notably
the increase in the excise tax levied on services from 2 to 5 percent, and the
termination of the deduction on the excise duty charged on domestically-produced
beer. Energy taxes will also increase on account of a more depreciated average
exchange rate vis-à-vis 2005, and still high international oil prices.

•

Legislation is currently in place to expedite the settlement of tax arrears on corporate
and individual income taxes while tackling tax evasion. In particular, for the case of
tax arrears accumulated through end-December 2003, settlement with the budget can
now be done in up to 18 consecutive monthly tranches rather than requiring a full
lump sum payment of the tax liability, as it is currently required by the law. We
expect the measure to yield about dobras 1.5 billion through end-June 2006 and
dobras 4.0 billion through end-2006 (or 0.45 percent of GDP). To the extent that the
end-June target of dobras 1.5 billion fails to materialize, the government will
activate, in absence of additional revenue measures, expenditure cuts in consultation
with the Fund.

•

The reformulation of existing customs procedures with a view to increase the tax
base and the effective taxation rate at customs. Currently, many aspects of the
Customs Law (Codigo Aduaneiro), and customs procedures and accounting practices
date back to the colonial times, thus highlighting the need for reform. Accordingly, it
is the government’s intention to approve and submit draft proposals to the National
Assembly by end-June 2006 (structural benchmark) to revise the Customs Law, the
customs’ organic law (Estatuto das Alfandigas), and the General Code on Customs
Infractions (Regime Geral das Infracós Aduaneiras).

•

A strengthening of customs services through better surveillance capacity and an
increased number of random inspections of importers’ warehouses. The improved
customs services will be financed by technical assistance provided by the
Millennium Challenge Corporation under its Threshold Program with São Tomé and
Príncipe.

10.
The effort to control current expenditure is continuing—particularly the wage bill,
which will decline marginally as a share of GDP between 2005 and 2006. This objective will
be achieved by pursuing a strict management of the payroll through the activation of the civil
servants’ register that has been recently developed in consultation with the UNDP. Following
the sizeable wage increase of July 2005, any further wage increases—consistent with the
program’s overall wage bill—will only be implemented in the second half of 2006, once a
new government is in place. This policy should provide an additional degree of freedom to
the new administration, while safeguarding the program’s overall spending envelope for
2006. With regard to nonwage expenditure, the government is planning to make savings in
several fronts to compensate for new spending connected with the holding of parliamentary,
regional, and presidential elections, all of which are scheduled for next year. Despite
increases in fuel and electricity prices, expenditure in goods and services will be reduced by
0.7 percentage points of GDP in 2006 on account of expenditure controls across-the-board.

- 49 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

The projected increase in other expenditure, from 3.5 percent of GDP in 2005 to 4.6 percent
in 2006, reflects outlays on three general elections scheduled for 2006, with a total cost to the
budget of US$1 million (i.e., equivalent to 1.4 percent of GDP or US$2.2 dollars per capita
cost, per election).
11.
The 2006 budget targets an increase in the investment envelope financed by the
government’s own resources and HIPC (i.e., poverty related) spending. A number of propoor investment projects in agriculture and fisheries have been already prioritized and costed
in the context of the PRSP implementation program. Regarding HIPC spending, the
challenge from the authorities will be to strike a balance between three competing objectives:
(i) a timely compliance with the country’s external debt service obligations, particularly
following a long period of customary accumulation of debt service arrears, (ii) execution of
new poverty-related spending mandated under the HIPC initiative, and (iii) the maintaining
of a hard budget constraint for the government (i.e., the level of the domestic primary
deficit).
12.
As a consequence of this fiscal policy, including the partial utilization of oil signature
bonuses and the rescheduling agreement with the Paris Club, net domestic financing of the
government in 2006 (excluding the accumulation of deposits in the National Oil Account)
will be negative and equivalent to 0.5 percent of GDP. The accumulation of government
deposits with the central bank mainly reflects appropriations for poverty-related projects
identified under the HIPC initiative, but which are yet to be utilized depending on the outlook
for the budget deficit and the preparation of project proposals that could be financed by HIPC
resources.
13.
To secure compliance with our program’s targets for the domestic primary deficit and
the domestic primary expenditure, the government will reinforce its expenditure/cash
management system underpinning the quarterly projections of government revenue.
Specifically, expenditure commitments will be prioritized in line with expected revenue. This
approach will allow the Budget Directorate at the Ministry of Planning and Finance to better
identify and monitor the seasonality/delays in revenues, grants, and major nontax revenue
items (such as fishing licenses, for example), and adapt the expenditure path accordingly.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
14.
Monetary policy will aim at reducing inflation to 13 percent by end-2006. Our
economic program will keep inflation in check through ceilings on the expansion of the
BCSTP’s net domestic assets, banking sector credit to the government, and a restrained
government expenditure path, against the background of a managed floating exchange rate
regime. For end-2006, the stock of net domestic assets of the BCSTP and banking sector
credit to the government (excluding the National Oil account) will be negative and limited to
dobras 123.1 billion and dobras 13.3 billion, respectively, while the floor on the stock of net
international reserves (NIR) of the BCSTP will be set at US$19.8 million. This floor should
allow end-2006 gross international reserves (excluding the National Oil Account and
guarantee deposits of banks pending operating licenses) to remain at 3.5 months of imports
of goods and services and above 150 percent of base money throughout the year. The

- 50 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

monetary program assumes a broadly stable velocity of money, which is consistent with
broad money growth projected at 16.1 percent. This, in turn will be consistent with a
slowdown in private sector credit growth of 19.8 percent in 2006, while safeguarding the
banking sector’s net external position.
15.
During 2006, monetary policy will also aim at buttressing the pre-conditions for
successful monetary targeting. Currently, the only central bank instrument to significantly
regulate monetary aggregates is the sale of foreign exchange. It is for this reason that our
program fast-tracks the development of indirect monetary instruments—in line with technical
recommendations from the Fund’s Monetary and Financial Systems Department (MFD)—
which would provide additional instruments to simultaneously target the central bank’s NIR
and the growth of base money which, in our view, is an important determinant for inflation
behavior in the economy. Consistent with this strategy, we have decided to closely monitor
base money in our 2006 program.
16.
In the meantime, however, the government remains committed to an active monetary
policy and will reassess the monetary stance and take actions as needed. The BCSTP’s
position is that the central bank reference rate should be kept above the inflation rate. Also,
depending on the outlook for inflation, the BCSTP will continue to address liquidity concerns
through central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets, as well as appropriate
changes in banks’ reserve requirements, and/or the issue of liquidity absorbing instruments,
such as central bank certificates of deposit (CDs). Coordination of fiscal and monetary
policies will also be enhanced in 2006 through regular meetings between the BCSTP and the
Ministry of Planning and Finance aimed at forecasting liquidity constraints in the week(s)
ahead.
17.
The BCSTP will also continue to work closely with MFD regarding the
implementation of the technical assistance recommendations in the areas of: (i) banking
supervision, (ii) development of interbank money markets, and (iii) foreign exchange
auctions. The scope and timing of the foreign exchange auctions will be consistent with the
NIR targets set under the program.
18.
The BCSTP remains committed to the continuation of the existing managed float
exchange rate arrangement, which has allowed the monetary authority to appropriately
address the volatility of external inflows and outflows in a context of limited nominal wage
flexibility.
C. External Sector Policies
19.
During 2006, our government will continue to assess major trade policy issues
affecting the economy and further strengthen external debt management. However, in
assessing São Tomé and Príncipe’s participation in bilateral and regional trade arrangements,
the government will be mindful of the impact of these memberships on domestic tax revenue
collections.

- 51 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

20.
With a view of increasing the tax base and improving customs tax collections, the
government has submitted draft legislation to the National Assembly abolishing customs
duties exemptions granted to public institutions on imports of raw materials and capital
equipment. Tariff exemptions would only remain for grants in kind received by the
government. Legislation is also under review by parliament to limit ad hoc customs tax
exemptions granted on imports of goods and vehicles by political parties during the preelection campaign. In addition, during 2006, the government will conduct a survey of
existing ad hoc customs exemptions with a view to their gradual elimination during the
coming years, except for those exemptions contemplated in international agreements. The
spirit of this review would be to make legislation consistent with the new investment law
currently under consideration by the National Assembly (see paragraph 24, point e, below).
21.
The lasting non-tariff barrier related to the privately-managed (though partially stateowned) telecommunications company (CST) will be eliminated by end-December 2005.
Existing regulations protecting CST from competition will expire on that date, opening the
sector to new operators. Bidding rounds for different telecommunications services will only
start in the second half of 2006, once the sector’s regulatory body finalizes all the legislation
required for this endeavor as well as the technical analysis and guidelines required for an
effective functioning of the telecommunications sector.
22.
The government is committed in accepting Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the
Fund’s Articles of Agreement in the near future, and will continue working closely with the
Fund’s Legal and Monetary and Financial Systems departments to review the relevant laws
and regulations. A mission from the IMF visited São Tomé in early-December 2005 to
follow-up on these issues.
23.
In order to continue improving its external debt management capacity, the
Government of São Tomé and Príncipe will install the Commonwealth Secretariat debt
recording management system (CS-DRMS) and train the appropriate staff. This will allow
the debt unit at the Ministry of Planning and Finance to record all debt transactions and
improve debt service programming as well as serve as basis for debt management decision
making and analysis. The project is expected to be completed by end-2006 (structural
benchmark).
D. Structural Reforms
24.
The government is committed to building upon current structural reforms, which are
critical to enhancing efficiency in fiscal management and stimulating private sector
participation in the economy. Some of these measures are also critical to fulfill the floating
completion trigger points under the HIPC initiative. In this regard:
a.

A comprehensive strategy has been launched to fundamentally improve the
financial position of the water and electricity company (EMAE). Key areas of
reform include: (i) in line with a resolution (despacho) from the Ministry of
Infrastructure, dated October 30, 2005, the phasing-in of an electricity tariff
increase, during a six-month period starting November 1, 2005, up to 33 percent

- 52 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

in the case of individuals and 60 percent in the case of public administration and
businesses (e.g., public and private enterprises, international organizations, and
parastatal); (ii) the recent establishment of judicial procedures to settle
outstanding payments arrears of large electricity customers to EMAE;
(iii) completing the installation of pre-paid electricity metering systems in
designated urban locations in April 2006 (structural benchmark); (iv)
implementation of a computerized clients’ information management system that
was developed in December 2005; and (v) the adoption , by end-September 2006,
of a sectoral strategy with a view to address, inter alia, the development of
suitable infrastructure for electricity production, transportation, and distribution,
as well as business modalities to secure dynamic private sector participation in the
sector (structural benchmark). In assessing potential public investment for the
sector, the government will be mindful of the need to secure concessional
financing to avoid exacerbating the already high external indebtedness.
b.

A fully integrated, computerized budget and public expenditure management
system (SIGFE), developed with assistance from the World Bank, is slated to
replace the existing system by end-December 2006 (structural performance
criterion). This timing will secure that this accounting system: (i) is tested and
operated in parallel with the current reporting system and (ii) is in place for the
2007 budget cycle.

c.

The government reaffirms its intention to support the growth of private sector
entrepreneurship. In consultation with the World Bank, work is progressing
regarding the preparation of terms of reference for the conduct feasibility studies
on the public enterprises administering the airports (ENASA) and seaports
(ENAPORT). Under the circumstances, however, we will not be able to complete
those feasibility studies by end-December 2005 (structural benchmark), as
initially programmed. A new deadline for the completion of these studies could be
possibly set during the next program’s review mission.

d.

Necessary actions have been undertaken to improve the business climate in the
country. Specifically, by end-January 2006, the government will review the
legislation that legalizes businesses only after the company’s statutes are
published in the national journal (Diario da Republica). At the same time, in an
effort to support private entrepreneurship and divulgate best practices to reduce
the administrative burdens on start-ups, the government along with the World
Bank International Financial Corporation, plans to address ways to modernize the
business registration process. This includes the advisability of implementing a
one-stop-shop for business registration, reduce informality in the economy, and
disseminate information to the general public. Also progressing is the setting of
the legal basis to establish tribunals of arbitration to handle business litigation and
contract matters. By end-January 2006, the government will submit to parliament
a draft law for the judicial sector (Lei Base do Sistema Juridico) that includes
regulations on the establishment of these type of tribunals. Also, the government

- 53 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

has prepared a detailed draft law on tribunals of arbitration (Proposta de Lei de
Arbitragem Voluntária) defining the rules of engagement, scope, and
responsibilities of those tribunals. It is the government’s intention to submit this
draft legislation to the National Assembly in February 2006.
e.

Approval of critical tax legislation by the National Assembly will take place in
two stages during 2006. This legislation was submitted to the National Assembly
in the context of the government’s 2005 program. The first stage, possible
covering through end-March 2006, will include the approval of a new investment
code that provides equal treatment to domestic and foreign investors and limits
the granting of any tax breaks and exemptions. A new tax code (Codigo General
Tributario), a new tax procedural code (Codigo de Procedimiento Tributario),
and new guidelines on urban property taxation will also be approved during this
first stage of implementation. The second stage will cover the National
Assembly’s approval of new codes for personal and corporate taxation, and new
legislation on inheritance taxes and taxes on transfers of fixed assets (SISA).
Significant technical work in consultation with the Fund staff is still underway,
given the relevance of these taxes in total tax collections and the potential revenue
loss from any drastic reduction in current rates.
E. Transparency and Good Governance

25.
Our government remains committed to strengthening governance and transparency in
the management of government resources. The government notes that a formal request has
been recently submitted to the Joint Development Agency (JDA) recommending the prompt
publication of the PSA on Block 1 signed between the JDA and the selected oil field
operator. Also, in support of the rule of law, the government has recently issued an formal
declaration ratifying the Supreme Court’s ruling that nullified the telecommunication license
granted to a second national operator granted in 2004, due to irregularities in the selection
process and inconsistencies of this operating permit with the existing provision granted to
CST under the existing telecommunications concession agreement (see paragraph 21 above).
In addition, the BCSTP has posted in its internet website the external audit of its 2003 and
2004 financial statements, as agreed in the context of the safeguards assessment of the
BCSTP conducted by the Fund’s Finance department in early 2004. Publication of the
audited financial statements will become the norm for the central bank from now on.

- 54 -

26.

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

For 2006, envisaged policies consistent with the government’s PRSP include:
a.

The regular updating of the newly-established internet website of the National
Petroleum Agency (ANP), with a view to publicize and update all relevant
information related to the oil sector on a regular basis.

b.

The launching of a thorough reform of the internal oversight/auditing of the
financial operations of the central government, public enterprises, and local
authorities, performed by the Inspectorate-General of Finance (IGF). As a first
step, by end-March 2006, the government will amend the laws defining
internal control and administrative regulations governing the IGF’s actions
(structural benchmark). Also, by end-June 2006, the government will establish
a database to record and monitor follow-up actions of problems identified by
the IGF in each inspected sector, including the applicable sanctions and
penalties (structural benchmark).

c.

In cooperation with the World Bank, our government is developing an
implementation manual/handbook of the Oil Revenue Management Law of
December 2004, which should be divulgated to the population and posted on
the internet websites of the National Assembly and the National Petroleum
Agency (ANP) by March 2006. The main goal is to identify the administrative
bodies that are needed to secure an effective implementation of the letter and
spirit of the Law. In addressing this goal, however, the government will
remain mindful of the need to strike a balance between a growing bureaucracy
and the need to secure transparency and accountability in the management of
oil revenue.

d.

In cooperation with the Fund’s Legal and Monetary and Financial
Systems departments, our government will continue reviewing related pieces
of legislation to establish a legal framework criminalizing money laundering
and the financing of terrorism. Our target is to develop an action plan on the
technical steps required for a successful submission of the referred legislation
to the National Assembly by end-December 2006. Prospective technical
support from USAID to the Prosecutor General’s office will also be
instrumental in this endeavor.
IV. PRSP AND HIPC INITIATIVE

27.
Our government remains committed to a thorough implementation of São Tomé and
Príncipe’s PRSP. We intend to submit the first PRSP annual progress report to the Bretton
Woods institutions by mid-February 2006. In this regard, the government is working in close
collaboration with main donors and civil society to finalize this report as planned.
28.
The government is also working in close conjunction with development partners to
advance preparations for reaching the HIPC completion point by mid-2006. These tasks

- 55 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

include the fulfillment of the floating completion triggers and data compilation work required
for the preparation of a comprehensive Debt Sustainability Analysis by the staff of the World
Bank and the IMF in February 2006.
V. PROGRAM MONITORING FOR 2006
29.
Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). The program will be
monitored using the definitions, data sources, and frequency of monitoring set out in the
accompanying TMU. The definition of the central bank’s net international reserve position
(NIR), net domestic assets of the central bank, and banking system net financing to the
central government in the TMU reflect the fact that São Tomé and Príncipe’s National Oil
Account was established with the central bank on behalf of the government, rather than with
a foreign custodian bank selected by the government, as it had been initially assumed under
the PRGF-supported program. The National Oil Account is properly identified within the
central bank accounts, allowing for a transparent management of the oil resources. The
government will make available to the Fund all necessary data, appropriately reconciled and
on a timely basis, as specified in the TMU.
30.
Performance criteria. Table I.1 shows the quantitative performance criteria set for
end-June 2006. Structural performance criteria and benchmarks for 2006 with corresponding
dates are identified in Table I.2. In addition, the nonaccumulation of external payment arrears
(as defined in the TMU) will constitute a continuous performance criterion, as will the
standard injunctions against imposing or intensifying restrictions on current payments,
introducing or modifying multiple currency practices, concluding bilateral payments
agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII, or imposing or intensifying import
restrictions for balance of payments reasons.

The domestic primary balance is defined as the difference between government
domestic revenue and noninterest government domestic expenditure. This balance for the
year 2004 was assessed at dobras -128.1 billion, broken down as follows:
Government domestic revenue:

Db 165.0 billion

Less: government primary expenditure, excluding foreign-financed investment,
foreign-financed scholarships, and transfers to the JDA:
Equals: Domestic primary balance:

Db 293.1 billion

The program exchange rate for the purposes of this memorandum will be Db10,104
per US dollar. The exchange rate of the dobra against the euro will be 12,314 and against the
SDR will be 15,558.
9.
Net domestic financing of the government is defined as the change in net credit to
government by the banking system—that is, the stock of all outstanding claims on the
government held by the BCSTP, less all deposits held by the central government with the
BCSTP, plus the stock of all outstanding claims on the government held by deposit money
banks (DMBs)10, less all deposits held by the central government with DMBs--as they are
reported monthly by the BCSTP to the IMF. All foreign exchange denominated accounts will
be converted to dobras at the program exchange rate. At end-December 2004, outstanding net
credit to the government was assessed at dobras 35.8 billion, broken down as follows:
BCSTP credit, including use of IMF resources:

Db 83.6 billion

10.
Base money is defined as the sum of currency issued—which consists of currency
outside banks and cash in vaults—and bank reserves. Bank reserves refer to reserves of
commercial banks held with the central bank, and include reserves in excess of the legal
reserve requirement. At end-December 2004, base money was assessed at dobras 119.2
billion, calculated as follows:
Currency issued:

11.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the BCSTP are defined for program monitoring
purposes as short term-term foreign assets of the BCSTP minus short-term external
liabilities. All short-term foreign assets that are not fully convertible external assets readily
available to and controlled by the BCSTP (i.e., they are pledged or otherwise encumbered
external assets, including, but not limited to, the HIPC umbrella SDR account, and assets
used as collateral or guarantees for third party liabilities) will be excluded from the definition
of NIR. All values are to be converted to U.S. dollars at actual market exchange rates
prevailing at the test date. At end-December 2004, NIR was assessed at dobras 169.2 billion,
calculated as follows:

The performance criterion on short-term external debt refers to the outstanding
stock of external debt with original maturity of one year or less, including overdraft positions
and debt owed or guaranteed by the government or the BCSTP.11 At end-December 2004, the
stock of short-term external debt stood at US$1.0 million.
14.
The performance criterion on nonconcessional medium- and long-term external
debt refers to the contracting or guaranteeing of external debt with original maturity of more
than one year by the government of BCSTP.12 13 Debt reschedulings and restructurings are
excluded from the ceilings set on nonconcessional borrowing. Medium- and Long-term debt
will be reported by the Debt Management Unit of the Ministry of Finance and Planning and
(as appropriate) by the BCSTP, measured in US dollars at current exchange rates. The
government of São Tomé and Príncipe will consult with Fund staff before contracting
obligations if it is uncertain as to whether those obligations are included in the performance
criterion limits. At end-December 2004, nonconcessional medium- and long-term external
debt stood at US$15 million.
15.
The nonaccumulation of new external payment arrears is a continuous performance
criterion. Government external payment arrears are defined as all unpaid external public debt
obligations, according to the data established by the Debt Management Unit of the Ministry
of Planning and Finance and (as appropriate) by the BCSTP, with the exception of arrears
pending rescheduling arrangements. Debt would be deemed to be in arrears when it has not
11

The term “debt” is defined in accordance with point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with respect
to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85) August 24, 2000).

12

This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted on August 24, 2000 but also to commitments
contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received.
13

The concessionality of loans is assessed according to the reference interest rate by currency published by the
Development assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
For loans of terms of no less than 15 years, the ten-year average of commercial interest reference rates (CIRR)
for the currency in which the loan is denominated will be used. For loans of shorter terms, the six month
average will apply. A loan is deemed to be on concessional terms if, on the initial date of disbursement, the ratio
of the present value of the loan, calculated on the basis of the reference interest rate, to the nominal value of the
loan is less than 50 percent (in other words, a grant element of at least 50 percent, excluding Fund resources).
For currencies with no available reference interest rates, the SDR rate will be used.

been paid by the time it is due, unless the definition of an arrear has been otherwise
contractually defined. The performance criterion relating to external arrears does not apply to
external arrears pending the conclusion of a debt-rescheduling agreement with the Paris
Club. The outstanding stock of external arrears pending debt-rescheduling agreement at endDecember 2004 stood at US$18 million.
16.
Official external program support is defined as grants and loans provided by
foreign official entities that are received by the budget—excluding project grants and
loans—and other exceptional financing. Amounts assumed in the program consistent with
this definition are shown in the memorandum item entitled “external program support” of
Table I.1.
Adjusters
17.
Deviations in official external program support from the amounts programmed in
Table I.1. will trigger adjusters for domestic financing of the government, net domestic assets
of the BCSTP and net international reserves as indicated below. These and other adjusters as
set out below will be measured cumulatively from December 31, 2005.
18.
Ceilings on net domestic financing (NDF) of the government and net domestic
assets (NDA) of the BCSTP. Monthly differences between projected and actual official
external program support and external debt service payments in foreign exchange will be
converted to dobras at the actual monthly average exchange rate and cumulated to the test
date. The ceilings on NDF and NDA will be reduced by the sum of: (i) excess official
external program support (as defined in paragraph 16 above); and (ii) the shortfall in external
debt service payments. Both ceilings will be increased by 100 percent of any cumulative
shortfall in official external program support, or excess in external debt service. The
downward adjustment to NDF and NDA for higher than programmed official external
program support will not take place to the extent that additional external program support is
used to accommodate higher capital outlays by the government, up to US$1 million,
converted to dobras at actual exchange rates, as indicated in Table I.1.
19.
Floor on net international reserves (NIR) of the BCSTP. Quarterly difference
between projected (see Table I.1) and actual official external program support and external
debt service payments will be converted to U.S. dollars at the actual exchange rates
prevailing at the test date. The floor on NIR will be raised by the sum of: (i) excess external
program support and (ii) any shortfall in external debt service payments. The upward
adjustment to NIR for higher than programmed official external program support will not
take place to the extent that additional external program support is used to accommodate
higher capital outlays by the government, up to US$1 million, converted to dobras at actual
exchange rates, as indicated in Table I.1. The NIR floor will be lowered by 100 percent of
any shortfall in official external program support and excess in external debt service
payments.

Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of São Tomé and
Príncipe is subject to a full safeguards assessment with respect to a forthcoming
arrangement. The assessment, which was completed on August 2, 2004, found
vulnerabilities in the area of financial reporting, internal audit and internal control and
measures to strengthen the control framework and help safeguard Fund resources were
proposed. Recommendations are in the process of implementation.
IX.

Exchange Arrangements:

São Tomé and Príncipe’s exchange rate regime is currently classified by the Fund as
managed floating. The official exchange rate is determined on a daily basis as a weighted
average of the previous day’s selling rates in the commercial banks, and the outcomes of
central bank’s foreign exchange auctions. The spread between the official and parallel
market exchange rates has been less than 1 percent since 1999. The intervention currency
for the dobra is the U.S. dollar. The official exchange rate was Db 11,929.7 per US dollar
on December 31, 2005.

SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
IDA operations
1. São Tomé and Príncipe joined the World Bank and IDA in 1977. New lending was
suspended between 1992 and 2000 owing to the lack of an appropriate
macroeconomic framework.
2. The World Bank FY06–09 country assistance strategy was well received by the
Board in June 2005: its two principal objectives are: (i) to support the implementation
of the PRSP; and (ii) to provide timely assistance to ensure that the country is
sufficiently prepared to maximize the benefits of oil revenues. Given the small size
of our program, the CAS remains tightly focused on on-going activities in the oil
sector, social sectors, public sector management and assistance with the HIPC
Initiative.
3. Despite its small project portfolio, the Bank’s program is relatively large for such a
small country as there is a broad ESW and AAA program currently covering oil
issues, support to PRSP implementation, assistance with achieving HIPC Completion
Point and analysis of trade issues through the multi-sectoral Trade Diagnostic study.
The World Bank also supports government reforms by providing advisory services in
the petroleum sector, telecommunications and environment. An IDF (Institutional
Development Grant) was approved in early 2005 to assist the government in its
Judicial reform program. A GEF (Global Environmental Fund) was approved in late
2004 to support the development of a national action plan to adapt to environmental
and global warming impacts.
4. Current IDA commitments for the 2 ongoing projects amount to US$11.5 million
with US$9.9 million undisbursed. The Bank supports the health and the education
sectors through its Social Sector Project of US$6.5 million (of which US$1.5 million
is in the form of an IDA grant) and supports the PRSP, public expenditure
management and petroleum sector through its Governance Capacity Building
Technical Assistance Project of US$5 million. The two projects are rated Satisfactory
although portfolio performance is hampered by weak management and absorptive
capacity.
IFC operations
5. São Tomé and Príncipe is not a member of the IFC. FIAS has reviewed the country’s
tax system and private sector investment.

country. The net commitments amount to UA 87.56 million, comprising
UA 86.56 million of African Development Fund (ADF) 14 and Technical Assistance
Facility (TAF) resources and UA 1.00 million of Nigerian Trust Fund (NTF)
resources. The beneficiary sectors of AfDB Group financing are: transport
(26.2 percent), multisector 15 (22.3 percent), agriculture (22.2 percent), social sector
(17.9 percent), and public utilities (11.5 percent). These operations have contributed
to building and rehabilitating the key basic economic and social infrastructures
(roads, airport, electricity, water, schools, health centers), as well as the economic and
institutional capacities of the Country. The AfDB has a National Program Office in
São Tomé since 1999 and Príncipe.
2. The AfDB’s active portfolio is composed of three projects, with an overall
disbursement rate of 47 percent (as of August 2005). The three projects, in
accordance with the PRSP objectives, have focused on the main factors affecting
poverty in STP: institutional and human capacity building, access to water and
sanitation, and health, specifically, malaria. The water supply, sanitation and control
of water-borne diseases project aims at improving health conditions through an
integrated approach, while the poverty reduction project contributes to improve the
livelihood of the vulnerable population through targeted actions such as: studies and
analysis of poverty profile, census and surveys, statistics capacity building, microinfrastructures, and micro-credit. In other hand, the human resource development
project will tackle cross-sectoral capacity building problems by providing for training
in the areas of literacy, information, community organization, as well as specialized
vocational training, which is suitable for specific demand, particularly in the oil and
tourism sectors.
3. The AfDB Group assistance strategy for the 2005–09 period (CSP 2005–09) rests on
two key pillars: poverty reduction in rural area and promotion of governance in public
finance management. The indicative country allocation on ADF-X resources
(2005–07) is UA 5.3 million in form of grants. The first pillar will contribute to
promoting and diversifying the economic base of the Country, especially the
agricultural and rural sector, and reinforce the operations in the social sectors. The
second pillar will focus on supporting macroeconomic reforms and governance,

which will help improve public finance management and institutional capacity
building to prepare the forthcoming oil era. Given the considerable needs for
institutional capacities building, the AfDB will finance strategic economic and sector
studies, such as the Country Governance Profile, the Joint study with the World Bank
on the Integrated fiduciary assessment (PER/CFAA/CPAR), and the transport sector
study. Furthermore, the AfDB will finance regional capacity building initiatives,
within the CEMAC and STP zone, the ECCAS, the African Portuguese-speaking
countries and the small insular countries.
4. In addition, the AfDB will continue providing STP with financial assistance through
the enhanced HIPC initiative. Within this framework, the AfDB approved in
April 2001, a debt relief of US$ 34.20 million at end-1999 NPV. Due to the delay in
the HIPC process, as the completion point is expected to be reached in 2006, the
AfDB approved in June 2005 the extension of the interim debt relief period to end2006.

SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE: JOINT IMF-WORLD BANK DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS 16
1.
The staffs’ assessment of São Tomé and Príncipe’s external debt outlook
remains essentially unchanged since the latest World Bank Country Assistance Strategy
(IDA/R2005–0087, May 2005) and IMF staff report (IMF Country Report No. 05/323,
July 18, 2005). The country faces a high risk of debt distress as the baseline scenario
indicates a breach of debt thresholds prior to the production of oil expected to start in early
the next decade (Box 1). Indeed, while the attainment of HIPC completion point and the
implementation of sound macroeconomic policies will bring about an improvement in the
country’s debt outlook—particularly in terms of debt service due—São Tomé and Príncipe’s
external debt stock ratios will remain well above the policy-dependent debt burden thresholds
until 2012–13.17 The debt stock ratios are highly vulnerable to exchange rate depreciations, a
deceleration in export growth, and a reduction in foreign grants and FDI. External debt
vulnerabilities (assessed in terms of NPV of debt-to-GDP and NPV of debt-to-revenue ratios)
are expected to become more acute under a “no reform scenario,” characterized by a lack of
fiscal adjustment during the projection period with respect to 2004. The Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI), supported by sound macroeconomic policies, would further
improve the country’s debt indicators starting in 2006.
2.
Background information on external debt developments is presented in section I. The
evolution of debt since HIPC decision point is briefly discussed in section II. Sections III
and IV present the staff’s debt sustainability with respect to the relevant policy-dependent
thresholds in a scenario that assumes the conduct of prudent macroeconomic policies and the
attainment of HIPC completion point in mid-2006. Section V modifies the baseline scenario
to include MDRI relief from the Fund and other IFIs. Section VI summarizes the appendix’s
main findings.

16

This debt sustainability analysis for São Tomé and Príncipe was prepared under the Joint World Bank/IMF
Debt Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries of May 2005.

17

São Tomé and Príncipe is currently classified as a “Poor Performer” according to the World Bank’s Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index.

APPENDIX V

Box 1. São Tomé and Príncipe’s Oil Prospects: An Approximation
•

Preliminary staff estimates indicate that, even under the conservative assumption that only
one out of the six blocks auctioned in the Joint Development Zone (JDZ) operated with
Nigeria is found to be commercially exploitable, oil production would have a sizeable
effect on São Tomé and Príncipe’s economic prospects.

•

The country’s oil output share of 30 thousand barrels per day in the JDZ, at a constant
price equivalent to US$30 per barrel, would yield an average of US$450 million in exports
per year (equivalent to approximately 650 percent of the estimated 2006 GDP) for twenty
years, and would require a total share of investment of US$750 million in the country.

•

Under this scenario, annual budget revenue from oil could stabilize at around
US$92 million over the long term (equivalent to 130 percent of the estimated 2006 GDP),
with the Permanent Fund for Future Generations reaching a steady-state level of
US$3.1 billion in constant 2006 dollar terms.

•

The sensitivity analysis shows that oil price changes would not significantly change the
staff’s assessment about the sustainability of debt once oil production begins.

VI. BACKGROUND
3.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s medium- and long-term external debt is estimated at
US$316 million in nominal terms at end-2005, corresponding to a NPV of debt-toexport ratio of 500 percent. The multilateral debt share of total debt is mostly owed to the
World Bank and African Development Bank, while the share of official bilateral debt is
about 40 percent, of which half is owed to France, Germany, Portugal, the Russian
Federation, and Angola. São Tomé and Príncipe is current with its obligations with
multilateral creditors and has cleared most of its arrears with Paris Club creditors as part of a
new multilateral debt rescheduling agreement on Cologne terms (Box 2). The authorities are
currently in the process of reconciling debt records with Paris Club creditors. Contacts with
non-Paris Club bilateral creditors are also being pursued to start reconciliation of debt
records.
4.
HIPC completion point is projected to be reached in mid-2006, provided that
the PRGF-supported program has been satisfactorily implemented. Progress toward
reaching completion point objectives has been satisfactory so far, especially regarding the
preparation of the first annual PRSP report, and meeting its health and education triggers.
Satisfactory progress has also been made in improving governance and transparency.18

APPENDIX V

Box 2. São Tomé and Príncipe: Paris Club Rescheduling
• On September 13, 2005 Paris Club creditors agreed to provide São Tomé and
Príncipe exceptional debt relief during the interim period of the HIPC Initiative.
Regarding non-Official Development Assistance, the rescheduling agreement
consists of a treatment under Cologne terms of the amounts due of principal and
interest (excluding late interest) and not paid from May 1, 2001 to December 31,
2007. Debt repayments on Official Development Assistance (ODA) for the same
period are rescheduled over 40-years with 16 years of grace. São Tomé and Príncipe
commits to pay 100 percent of the amounts of principal due up to April 30, 2001
inclusive and not paid and of interest accrued up to the same date, inclusive and not
paid.
• The interim relief granted by Paris Club creditors will be credited towards total
relief at the HIPC Initiative completion point. Regarding non-Paris Club creditors,
São Tomé and Príncipe shall inform in writing to the Paris Club no later than
April 1, 2006, of the progress made in its negotiations with these creditors;
comparability of treatment of debt due would be paramount in this regard.

VII. THE EVOLUTION OF DEBT SINCE HIPC DECISION POINT
5.
São Tomé and Príncipe
reached decision point under the
Enhanced HIPC Initiative in
December 2000 (www.imf.org). In
that context, the NPV of debt-toexports ratio was assumed to
decline sharply from about
690 percent in 2001 to 143 percent
in 2003 and remain at about that
level during 2004–08.

6.
Latest staff estimates show significant differences vis-à-vis the levels of NPV of
debt-to-exports ratios projected at HIPC decision point. For example, as of end-2006, the
level of this ratio is more than twice its original projection. These discrepancies reflect the
following factors:19
19

An estimation of the relative contribution of each of these factors to the increase in the NPV of debt-to-export
ratios could not be done at this point as it would require a loan-by-loan reconciliation. Such an analysis will
only be conducted in the context of the full-DSA exercise to be included in the HIPC completion point
document.

•

A change in the methodology used to calculate the debt indicators from the HIPC
DSA framework to the Low Income Countries DSA framework (DSF). These
changes are reflected in the definition of exports, the discount rate used to calculate
the NPV of debt and the exchange rates used to calculate the debt service
projections.20

•

HIPC completion point is currently assumed for mid-2006. By contrast, the decision
point document assumed the attainment of HIPC completion point in 2003.

•

Discount rates used to estimate NPV values in the current analysis are lower than
those used in 2000.

•

São Tomé and Príncipe’s export performance since 2000 has been much weaker than
expected.

•

There has been some unanticipated new external borrowing, due to a more
expansionary fiscal stance than originally envisaged.

VIII. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

7.
The macroeconomic framework in the staff baseline scenario (Box 3)21 assumes a
steady increase in economic activity over the medium term, supported by sound
macroeconomic policies and the development of the domestic oil sector. Domestic
investment would rise sharply from about 36 percent of GDP to an average of 54.7 percent of
GDP in 2008–10, largely on account of oil sector investment initiatives. The rise in the
investment ratio will require a continuous reliance on foreign savings, although national
savings are forecast to rise on account of an improved financial position of the government
and increased private savings once stability and economic growth become firmly established.
Key risks to the macro framework arise from a possible weakening of the fiscal consolidation
effort in the wake of elections scheduled for 2006. Also, potential shortfalls in foreign
assistance triggered by the future oil boom could exacerbate the government’s budget
constraint in the short run.

20

The DSF uses same-year exports, as opposed to the 3-year backward average used for the decision point.
Regarding the discount rates, the DSF methodology uses a fixed 5 percent rate compared to the currencyspecific discount rates under the HIPC methodology. Finally, debt service is projected using WEO assumptions
in the DSF, as opposed to fixed (end-1999) exchanges rates used for the decision point. See: "Debt
Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Proposal for an Operational Framework and Policy
Implications"www.imf.org and IDA/SecM2004–0035 and "Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries—
Further Consideration on an Operational Framework and Policy Implications,"www.imf.org and
IDA/SecM2004–0629/1.
21

The baseline scenario assumes the attainment of HIPC completion point by mid-2006.

- 78 -

APPENDIX V

Box 3: São Tomé and Príncipe: Macroeconomic Assumptions in Baseline Scenario
Real GDP growth is projected to average 6 percent in 2005–10 reflecting the implementation
of the PRSP and continuous donors’ support. The average growth rate is projected to increase
to 8 percent in 2011–25 on account of increasing oil production.
Exports of goods and services are projected to increase at an average rate of 10 percent
during 2005–10 as a result of strong growth in tourism and a gradual recovery of cocoa export
volumes. Oil exports explain the strong export performance projected for 2011–25.
The external current account deficit is expected to average 30 percent of GDP in 2005–10;
i.e., roughly unchanged with respect to recent years. The current account is projected to turn
into a surplus of about 30 percent of GDP in 2011–25 due mainly to oil exports.
Fiscal projections assumes overall fiscal deficits declining from 18 percent of GDP on
average in 2005–06 (excluding oil signature bonuses) to 6 percent in 2010, and a balanced
budget thereafter, largely reflecting oil tax receipts.
Multilateral external loan financing is projected at an average of about US$7.5 million per
year during 2005–09, leveling off to US$6 million in 2010–25.

8.
In the baseline scenario, São Tomé and Príncipe’s debt outlook shows gradual
improvements over the medium term, but it will remain a source of vulnerability until
oil production starts in 2012. The NPV of public debt-to-GDP ratio falls from 153 percent
in 2005 to 110 in 2006, and to 92 percent in 2010, reflecting a prudent public expenditure
envelope underpinning the government’s medium-term fiscal strategy (Table 1a).22 Only in
2012, the ratio falls significantly to 22 percent of GDP, due mainly to a large increase in
GDP associated with the start in oil production. The NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio, at
278 percent in 2005 (Figure 1 and Table 1b), improves significantly in 2006 and remains
around 160 percent during 2007–12, before declining gradually thereafter. The debt serviceto-revenue ratio drops significantly following HIPC completion point in 2006 and remains
sustainable thereafter.
9.
The debt dynamics are particularly vulnerable to shocks. Sensitivity analysis
indicates that under the most extreme stress test, defined as a 30 percent depreciation of the
dobra exchange rate (measured in U.S. dollar terms), the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio increases
to 186 percent in 2006, compared to about 110 percent in the baseline scenario (see Figure 1
and Table 1b). This reflects the fact that São Tomé and Príncipe’s public debt is denominated
22

All public debt is owed to foreign residents (i.e., external public debt).

- 79 -

APPENDIX V

in foreign currency. The scenario of no-fiscal-reform (defined to include an unchanged
primary fiscal balance from its 2004 level, in terms of GDP) brings about an explosive debt
burden, underlying the importance of fiscal consolidation to improve the external debt
outlook.
IX. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
10.
The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio improves steadily in the baseline scenario, but
will remain significantly above the policy-dependent thresholds until oil production
starts. The NPV of debt-to-export ratio decreases from 500 percent in 2005 to 315 percent in
2006, to 271 percent in 2010 (Table 2b). The ratio falls significantly below the 100 percent
policy-dependent debt-burden threshold only in 2012, when oil production and exports are
projected to begin. The debt service-to-exports ratio declines from 56 percent23 in 2005 to
about 11 percent during 2007–10, before declining steadily during the following decade,
reflecting the delivery of HIPC debt relief and the high concessionality in which new debt is
contracted.
11.
Sensitivity analysis shows that the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is particularly
vulnerable to a deceleration in export growth. Specifically, a decline in the export growth
rate by one standard deviation from historical levels increases the ratio assessed at
300 percent under the baseline scenario to 424 percent in 2007 (Figure 2 and Table 2b).
X. THE EFFECTS OF MDRI
12.
The implementation of the MDRI would help reduce São Tomé and Príncipe’s
debt vulnerability (Figure 3, Table 3, and summary table below). The MDRI would
reduce the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio from 315 percent in the original baseline scenario to
176 percent in 2006, under the modified baseline; roughly 70 percent higher than the
sustainable level in the case of a poor performing country. While NPV ratios would remain
above the policy dependent thresholds, the debt service-to-exports ratio would be cut
significantly during 2006–10 under the MDRI resulting in substantial savings. The latter
reflects the relatively large share of debt to the World Bank and the African Development
Bank in the country’s total debt.

23

In 2005, debt service refers to debt service due before HIPC completion point and excludes HIPC
interim debt relief, rescheduling and cash payments on account of arrears.

XI. CONCLUSION
13.
As noted in the latest World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (IDA/R20050087, May 2005) and IMF staff report (IMF Country Report No.05/323, July 18, 2005),
the country faces a high risk of debt distress until oil production starts early in the next
decade. Also, São Tomé and Príncipe’s public debt will remain high and vulnerable to
shocks to the exchange rate, exports and foreign grants, at least until oil production starts in
2012/13. Debt vulnerability would be further exacerbated in the absence of sound
macroeconomic policies and undue delays with oil production. Calculations indicate that the
country would benefit from a significant reduction in debt service under the MDRI starting in
2006.

1/ External public debt only.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

APPENDIX VI

São Tomé and Príncipe: Statistical Issues
Introduction
21.
Although economic data are generally adequate for surveillance, serious
shortcomings persist despite the efforts made and the technical assistance provided.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s statistical system is still developing and suffers from serious
financial, human and technological resource constraints, which have slowed down efforts to
strengthen the system.
22.
São Tomé and Príncipe began reporting monetary and balance of payments statistics
in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS) in March 1998 and has participated in
the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since April 20, 2004. In addition,
the country has benefited since 2003 from technical assistance provided by the Statistics
Department (STA) under the GDDS project for Lusophone Africa.
National accounts
23.
Since the mid-1990s, some technical assistance for the compilation of the national
accounts has been provided by the World Bank and the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP). As a result, the national account estimates compiled for 1994–97 followed
to some extent the 1993 System of National Accounts (1993 SNA) methodology, and
incorporated improvements in the source data, compilation methodology, and statistical
techniques. However, improvements could not be sustained and beginning in 1998, the
quality of national accounts data deteriorated mainly due to a decline in the availability of
source data and dwindling resources allocated to statistical work. Since 1998, only
preliminary flash estimates of GDP at current and constant prices have been compiled using
industry coefficients and growth rate estimates.
24.
Since 2003, the Fund has also provided technical assistance in the context of the
GDDS Lusophone project. With this assistance, the National Institute of Statistics (INE) has
made considerable efforts, mainly to improve source data. The INE has approved
classification systems for the compilation of national accounts that are broadly consistent
with internationally accepted classifications, and efforts are underway to compile national
account aggregates with an improved methodology. An important goal of this project is to
elaborate a new GDP series in broad conformity with the 1993 SNA by mid-2006, and to
assist in compiling a quarterly production index. The Lusophone Project has been extended
by another year aiming at further improvements in the national accounts of the covered
countries. However, the progress achieved in strengthening the INE’s statistical capacity is
very fragile mainly because of the lack of incentives to retain qualified staff and allocate
adequate human, financial and computer resources.
25.
The CPI is calculated monthly and reported to AFR with a lag of one month. Since
1997, the compilation of the CPI has been based on a household survey, financed by the

- 90 -

APPENDIX VI

UNDP. Price surveys only cover the capital, although the authorities intend to develop
regional price series.
26.
In 2003, the authorities completed the first comprehensive survey of unemployment,
with assistance from the World Bank, which provides a detailed breakdown of
unemployment by age, gender and geographic location.
Government finance statistics
27.
A summary of fiscal data is compiled on a monthly basis, and reported to AFR with a
lag of about three weeks. The main weaknesses in the data reported are found in:
(i) expenditures on projects financed by donors, which are not adequately monitored by the
Ministry of Finance (MOF); and (ii) the below-the-line financing items are not yet
sufficiently reliable.
28.
In the context of the GDDS Lusophone project, the first government finance statistics
(GFS) technical assistance mission was undertaken in October 2004. Its main objective was
to assist the MOF in compiling and disseminating GFS for the general government in
accordance with the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001(GFSM 2001). An
immediate objective of this project is to enhance the usefulness of existing fiscal data for the
formulation, implementation, and monitoring of fiscal policy in São Tomé and Príncipe.
29.
The mission prepared tables bridging the national budget classifications and those
recommended in the GFSM 2001. These bridge tables are to be used to compile GFS for
reporting to STA and AFR, as well as for policy analysis within the MOF. Given the
importance of the oil-related revenues, the mission also reviewed in detail the classification
of the oil revenues regulated under the recently approved Oil Revenue Management Law,
and made recommendations on the classification of these transactions. The mission’s report
contains an action plan for implementing its recommendations that were agreed with the
MOF officials. It would be useful to follow up with the authorities on progress with the
implementation of these recommendations.
30.
Currently, no GFS are reported to STA for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) and International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Monetary statistics
31.
An STA mission provided technical assistance on monetary and statistics in
December 2004. Since then, the lags with which monthly monetary data are being reported
by the Central Bank of São Tomé and Principe (BCSTP) to STA have been reduced to a twomonth lag.
32.

The mission conducted a review of the current collection and compilation procedures

- 91 -

APPENDIX VI

of monetary statistics compiled by BCSTP. It developed a work program to address
shortcomings, including the statistical issues recently raised by the Safeguards Assessment
mission, and provided training to the CBSTP staff to facilitate the compilation of the
monetary statistics.
33.
The mission found that the CBSTP monthly balance sheets were adequate to compile
monetary statistics in line with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Although the accounting treatment of revaluation adjustments (holding gains) is not
consistent with recommended practices, data are available for the correct reclassification of
the revaluation adjustments. The plan of accounts of the other depository corporations is not
fully consistent with the MFSM, particularly for recently created banks.
External sector
34.
The authorities record the rates of the official exchange bureaus, commercial banks,
and the parallel market. These rates are available on the internet with a one-day lag. The
official rate is the simple average of the market rates for the previous day.
35.
With respect to merchandise trade, there are significant weaknesses in the source data
collection. Some transactions, including some imports related to investment, are not being
fully captured in the balance of payments. Monthly data on the main exports and imports are
reported to AFR regularly, but unit prices and volumes of exports are only occasionally
included.
36.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the BCSTP. Annual balance of
payments data are reported to STA and published in the IFS, albeit with long lags and subject
to substantial revisions.
37.
In the context of the GDDS Lusophone project, STA launched a technical assistance
program to improve balance of payments compilation and dissemination. The GDDS project
targets a substantial improvement in the source data, including the response rate to the
surveys, and in the methodology for compiling the balance of payments consistent with the
Fund’s Balance of Payments Manual. The first mission, in June 2003, reviewed the
shortcomings of current and financial account transactions that are reported, and concluded
that the weaknesses were mainly due to the under coverage of several important sectors,
including foreign direct investment and commercial banks’ reports on international
transactions.
38.
The follow-up mission undertaken in early June 2004 found that despite the effort to
implement the previous mission’s recommendations, several measures, in particular those
related to improving source data, were only partially implemented or, in some cases, not
implemented at all. As a result, inconsistencies in the classification of BOP operations still
persisted and the disaggregated BOP components continued to be largely estimated because
of weak source data. Resource constraints, particularly with regard to qualified staff,

- 92 -

APPENDIX VI

contribute to the lack of improvement in the response rate to the balance of payments
surveys.
39.
The mission recommended improving the coordination and data sharing among data
producing agencies; intensifying contacts with survey respondents, and using alternative
sources in order to substantially improve the source data to compile the balance of payments.
40.
The authorities have built on previous efforts to strengthen debt data management. A
new unit was created in late 2003 within the Ministry of Finance, incorporating staff from the
debt department of the BCSTP. New staff, including a director, has been appointed, which
should improve the monitoring of debt statistics. However, since 2003 a technical assistance
mission on balance of payments statistics noted that the data available for external debt are
incomplete and do not conform to international guidelines.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
March 6, 2006
The following information has become available since the issuance of the staff report for the
2005 Article IV consultation and First Review Under the Three-Year Arrangement Under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
1.

Recent developments under the program

•

Based on preliminary information, all quantitative performance criteria for
end-December 2005 appear to have been met. The monthly inflation rate for
January 2006 (2.7 percent) continued to be relatively high reflecting seasonal factors
and the pass-through of the rather large depreciation of the dobra during the last
quarter of 2005. However, the exchange rate was stable in January and
February 2006.

•

On the fiscal side, revenue was slightly below the program target on account of
delays in payment of fishing licenses granted to the European Union, while current
domestic primary expenditure was lower than programmed resulting in a smaller
domestic primary deficit than under the program. All domestic payment arrears
incurred in late 2005 were eliminated in the first two weeks of 2006.

2.

Oil sector developments

•

Exploratory drillings: Chevron-Texaco, the designated operator for Block 1 in the
Joint Development Zone administered with Nigeria, started exploratory drilling
operations on January 14, 2006. The offshore drilling is estimated to last 40–60 days.
Chevron-Texaco has indicated that, if significant amounts of crude are discovered,
commercial production could begin in 2010.

•

Licensing round of oil Blocks 2-6: The Sãotomean authorities have informed the
staff about the outcome of the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) meeting held in
Abuja in early February 2006.
►The Sãotomean delegation raised the concerns noted in the report from the
Attorney General’s Office of São Tomé and Príncipe about lack of transparency and
irregularities in the bidding process of Blocks 2-6, which were mentioned in
paragraph 14 of EBS/06/23.
►The Nigerian delegation indicated that they would reply in writing to the Attorney
General’s report, while noting that they disagreed with the report’s conclusions.

- 95 -

►The Sãotomean authorities stated that they intend to strengthen transparency of oil
sector transactions at three different levels: first, the government will support the
country’s Attorney General’s Office in conducting further investigations and needed
legal actions; second, the Sãotomean delegates at the JMC will propose that the
Attorney General’s recommendations regarding the implementation of international
standards be applied to future oil bidding rounds; and third, São Tomé and Príncipe
will work towards the implementation of Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI) principles, as stated in the Abuja Declaration.
•

Status of Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs): The signature of the PSAs on
Blocks 3 and 4, between the Joint Development Agency and the designated oil
consortiums, is expected during the coming weeks. The signature of PSAs for other
blocks is expected in the next 2-3 months.

3.
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP): The Sãotomean authorities submitted
the first PRSP annual progress report to the Fund and the World Bank on February 24, 2006.
The preparation of the PRSP annual progress report—which is currently being translated into
English—and the related joint staff advisory note (JSAN) constitute a floating completion
point trigger as specified in the HIPC Decision Point document of December 2000
(EBS/00/254). The JSAN will be circulated to the Board in conjunction with the staff report
for the Second Review under the existing PRGF arrangement in June/July 2006. It is
expected that the HIPC Completion Point document would also be circulated to the Board at
that time, provided that all floating completion point triggers are met. The mission on the
Second Review under the PRGF arrangement is scheduled for early-May, once a new
government is in place, following the Parliamentary elections in late-March 2006.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
São Tomé and Príncipe
On March 6, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with São Tomé and Príncipe.1
Background
Following a decade of large macroeconomic imbalances and state intervention in the economy,
the Sãotomean authorities have pursued economic reforms since 1998 that have helped
increase real GDP growth, lower inflation, and push forward key structural reforms. Financial aid
from international donors increased substantially in support of these reforms. At the same time,
a successful implementation of a Staff Monitored Program in 1999 led to the approval of a
three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) in April 2000.
São Tomé and Príncipe reached the Decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative in late December 2000.
However, fiscal performance has been uneven over the years, reflecting expenditure pressures
arising from the domestic political cycle and anticipated large oil signature bonuses. In 2001,
as presidential elections approached, the government failed to meet a number of fiscal and
monetary targets under the Fund-supported program. Fiscal management improved in 2002,
but it deteriorated again in 2003 as the government raised social spending significantly. In 2004,
the fiscal position deteriorated even further as the government increased expenditures to
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

- 97 unsustainable levels in anticipation of a large oil signature bonus, which was only
realized in July 2005. The fiscal gaps were financed mainly through external borrowing,
central bank financing, and the accumulation of arrears. The current PRGF
arrangement, approved by the Executive Board on August 1, 2005, seeks to support the
government’s efforts to address macroeconomic imbalances, deepen structural reforms,
and set the conditions for sustained economic growth and poverty alleviation.
In 2005, economic growth remained strong, although inflation picked up against the
background of a sharp increase in international oil prices that were passed through to
domestic consumers. Fiscal consolidation advanced in line with the program, and the
fiscal targets for end-2005 are likely to have been met. Broad money grew rapidly on
account of resilient economic growth and an increase in the central bank’s Net
International Reserve position. The managed floating exchange rate regime has served
the country well, allowing the authorities to address the volatility of external inflows and
cushion exogenous shocks. The import coverage of reserves remains above 3.5 months
of imports of goods and services.
Prospects for 2006 remain favorable, with an expectation of strong growth, lower
inflation, and a relatively favorable external position. In the fiscal area, the 2006 program
seeks to consolidate the measures launched in 2005, including efforts to address tax
arrears and overhaul customs administration procedures. A better control of the growth
of current expenditure will help to change the composition of government spending in
favor of pro-poor expenditure. Monetary policy will be consistent with a deceleration of
inflation. To foster private sector growth in the non-oil economy, structural reform efforts
will continue, including actions to address the financial position of the water and
electricity company (EMAE).
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the commitment of the Sãotomean authorities to continue
addressing macroeconomic imbalances, while strengthening the conditions for
sustained economic growth and poverty reduction. Over the medium term, a main
challenge will be to develop strong institutions to secure a transparent management of
oil revenue and to secure a proper execution of the government’s Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) that would strengthen growth in the non-oil economy and
support the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Lasting and
enhanced donor support to finance the PRSP will be vital in this regard.
Directors commended the satisfactory performance under the PRGF-supported
program. In particular, they welcomed the authorities’ decision to sustain the process of
fiscal consolidation. They commended the government’s efforts to increase tax revenue
and reduce wasteful expenditure, while increasing the share of pro-poor expenditure in
line with the PRSP. Fiscal consolidation will also be supported by a modernized budget

- 98 and public expenditure management system (SIGFE), and the reform of the auditing
practices of the general government and public enterprise financial operations.
Directors observed that the monetary policy stance remained broadly adequate,
supporting the achievement of the authorities’ inflation target and safeguarding the
central bank’s international reserve position. Directors encouraged the authorities to
continue the judicious mix between foreign exchange sales and the issuance of liquidityabsorbing instruments. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to keep the central
bank reference rate above the inflation rate and to improve the coordination of fiscal and
monetary policies to better forecast liquidity. Directors supported continued technical
assistance by the Fund in the area of indirect monetary policy management.
Directors considered that São Tomé and Príncipe’s managed floating exchange rate
system remains appropriate, allowing the authorities to address the volatility of external
inflows and cushion exogenous shocks. In this context, Directors commended the
authorities for improving the foreign exchange auction system to strengthen the price
setting mechanism.
Directors welcomed the improvements in banking sector supervision and underscored
the need for effective implementation of the measures regarding the licensing of new
banks and the development of on-site and off-site prudential indicators. Directors
underscored the importance of decisive action with respect to weak banks, including
possible recapitalization or closure, which would play a critical role in developing a
sound domestic banking system.
Directors noted that São Tomé and Príncipe has a relatively open trade regime and
welcomed the termination in 2005 of the only remaining nontariff barrier protecting the
domestic telecommunications company from competition.
Directors urged the authorities to accelerate structural reforms and achieve full
transparency in oil revenue management. In this respect, they emphasized the need to
implement during 2006 the action plan to improve the finances of the water and
electricity company and complete the feasibility studies of the airport and seaport
authorities. To improve the business climate, Directors recommended to eliminate
administrative barriers for start-up businesses, establish tribunals of arbitration, and
approve new codes for personal and corporate income taxation. They stressed that the
publication of the Production Sharing Agreement signed between the Joint Development
Agency and the selected oil operators and the participation in the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative would be key elements toward securing accountability and good
governance in the nascent oil sector.

- 99 Directors encouraged the authorities to improve the coverage, timeliness, and
periodicity of basic economic statistics.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ stated intention to accept the obligations of Article
VIII, Sections 2 (a), 3 and 4 in the near future and looked forward to the staff’s findings
in the ongoing review of the exchange system, expected for the next review under the
PRGF arrangement.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Completes First Review of São Tomé and Príncipe's Three-Year
PRGF Arrangement and Approves US$600,000 Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the first review
of São Tomé and Príncipe's economic performance under a three-year Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The completion of the review enables the release of an
amount equivalent to SDR 0.4 million (about US$600,000), which would bring total
disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 0.8 million (about US$1.2 million).
The Executive Board approved the three-year arrangement on August 1, 2005 (see Press Release
No. 05/187), for a total amount of SDR 2.96 million (about US$4.26 million) to support the
government's economic program for 2005-2007.
In commenting on the Executive Board's discussion on São Tomé and Príncipe, on
March 6, 2006 Mr. Agustín Carstens, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The authorities of São Tomé and Príncipe are committed to continue to address macroeconomic
imbalances, while strengthening the conditions for sustained economic growth and poverty
alleviation. Over the medium term, a main challenge will be to develop strong institutions to
secure a transparent management of oil revenue, while implementing the government’s Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) to strengthen growth in the non-oil economy and advance
towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals. Donor support also has an important role
to play in this process.
“Performance under their PRGF-supported program has been satisfactory. The authorities are to
be commended for their intention to sustain the process of fiscal consolidation that started in
2005. Within this strategy, the authorities intend to increase tax revenue, reduce wasteful
expenditure, and increase the share of pro-poor expenditure in line with the PRSP. Fiscal
consolidation will also be enhanced by the implementation of a fully integrated, budget and
public expenditure management system, and the reform of the auditing practices of the general
government and public enterprise financial operations.
“The overall stance of monetary policy remains broadly adequate, with the objective to achieve
the authorities’ inflation target and safeguarding the central bank’s international reserve position.
To control liquidity, the authorities will continue their judicious mix between foreign exchange
sales and the issuance of liquidity absorbing instruments. The authorities are committed to

- 102 keeping the central bank reference rate above the inflation rate and improving the coordination of
fiscal and monetary policies.
“São Tomé and Príncipe’s managed floating exchange rate system remains appropriate, as it
allows the monetary authorities to address the volatility of external inflows and cushion
exogenous shocks. The improvement of the foreign exchange auction system is commendable
as it strengthens the price mechanism of the managed floating exchange rate system.
“The efforts to enhance the banking sector supervisory capacity are welcome. Critical in this
regard will be effective implementation of the procedures regarding licensing of new banks and
the development of on-site and off-site prudential regulation indicators. Decisive action
regarding weak banks will be also important to foster the development of an efficient and sound
domestic banking system.
“Key challenges for the future are to accelerate structural reforms and achieve full transparency
in oil revenue management. Publication of all critical information regarding the management of
oil revenue will be important in securing accountability and good governance in the sector. In
addition, there is a need for steadfast implementation of the action plan to improve the finances
of the water and electricity company and the completion of the feasibility studies of the airport
and seaport authorities. Necessary measures to improve the business climate will include the
elimination of administrative barriers to start-up businesses, the establishing of tribunals of
arbitration, and the approval of new codes for personal and corporate income taxation.
“The authorities’ commitment to improve the coverage, timeliness, and periodicity of basic
macroeconomic statistics is most welcome,” Mr. Carstens said.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are
consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to
foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are
repayable over 10 years with a 5½-year grace period on principal payments.

- 103 Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director
for the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe
March 6, 2006

On behalf of my Saotomean authorities, I would like to express my appreciation to
Management and the staff for their continued assistance and advice to São Tomé and
Príncipe. My authorities are of the view that the staff report describes well the economic
developments in São Tomé and Príncipe as well as the challenges facing the country. In
addition they think that the Selected Issues paper highlights adequately relevant topical oilrelated issues.
I - Recent Economic Developments
Macroeconomic performance has been satisfactory in 2005. Output is estimated to have
grown by 3.8 percent last year, mostly driven by strong demand, despite an adverse external
environment. Inflation, however, rose on account of higher international oil prices and the
depreciation of the dobra. Indeed, it should be noted that over the last year, my authorities
adjusted local petroleum prices to reflect changes in international oil prices. Consequently,
the electrical company EMAE, which petroleum product is an intermediate good for the
production of electricity, also raised its tariffs to cover the additional costs. As a result,
inflation was above the program target by 2 percentage points, at 17 percent in December
2005.
Fiscal policy implementation has also improved, as the authorities pursued their fiscal
consolidation policy over the course of 2005, despite strong social demands, and they
managed to achieve the fiscal objectives set for 2005. In particular, large cuts were made in
domestic primary spending to cope with the shortfalls in tax revenues and the increase in the
minimum monthly salary in the public sector from US$ 31 to US$ 40. As a result of spending
restraint, the fiscal deficit was slightly lower-than-programmed. Fiscal reforms progressed
well as all draft new codes on personal income, corporate taxation and tax tribunals
(structural performance criteria) as well as the new guidelines on urban property taxation and
the new legislation on inheritance taxes (benchmark criteria) have been submitted to the
National Assembly for approval. Public expenditure and external debt management are being
improved with the assistance of the World Bank.
Monetary policy aimed at controlling the inflation surge, with notably increases in the bank
reference rate and banks’ reserve requirements. Preliminary information indicates that this
move has been successful in lowering bank credit to the economy. The dobra depreciation
occurred following the technical changes to the central bank foreign exchange auction in the
last quarter of 2005. Reforms to improve the operations of the central bank and the conduct
of monetary policy advanced well, with the assistance of the Fund. The BCSTP has posted
on its internet website the external audit of its 2003 and 2004 financial statements, as agreed

- 104 in the context of the safeguards assessment of the BCSTP conducted by the Fund’s Finance
Department in early 2004. Publication of the audited financial statements will become the
norm for the central bank from now on.
The resumption of the tourism activity, after a period of sluggishness in the aftermath of the
Coup in 2003, as well as lower payments for technical assistance contributed to offset the
deterioration of the trade balance, thus keeping the current account balance (excluding
official transfers) in 2005 at the same level as that of 2004, at around 59 percent of GDP. The
overall external balance, however, is estimated to improve due mainly to the receipt of oil
signature bonuses, which are held in an account, the National Oil Account (NOA), at the
central bank. The latter’s gross international reserves, excluding the above-mentioned
account, remained at around 3.5 months of imports by end-2005.
For years now, São Tomé and Príncipe has embarked in a wide range of structural reforms
aiming at promoting private sector and strengthening the business environment. A new
investment code that provides for equal treatment of domestic and foreign investors, which is
consistent with the new code on corporate taxation is before the National Assembly for
examination. There has been substantial progress in the public enterprise and judicial
sectors reform. A comprehensive strategy has been launched to fundamentally improve the
financial position of the water and electricity company (EMAE). To this end, in addition to
the tariffs above-mentioned, a timetable for the reduction of outstanding payments arrears to
EMAE has been established. In consultation with the World Bank, work is progressing
regarding the preparation of terms of reference for the conduct of feasibility studies on the
public enterprises that administer the airports (ENASA) and seaports (ENAPORT). The longlasting non-tariff barrier related to the privately-managed telecommunications company
(CST) has been eliminated in December 2005, thus opening the sector to new operators.
Regulations for an effective functioning of the telecom sector are being finalized, which will
allow for the launching of bidding rounds for different telecommunications services. The
submission to the National Assembly of a legislation criminalizing money laundering and
the financing of terrorism has been delayed, due to the need to update related pieces of
legislation. With the assistance of Fund’s LEG and MFD, the government intends to continue
a review of these pieces of legislation and will submit this legislation in the course of the
year.
Turning to the debt situation, São Tomé and Príncipe is current with its obligations vis-à-vis
the multilateral creditors and has cleared its arrears with Paris Club creditors as part of the
Paris Club debt rescheduling agreement reached in September 2005. The authorities are
currently in the process of reconciling debt records with Paris Club creditors, with the
expectation of signing bilateral agreements by April 1, 2006.
Concerning the oil sector, as I stated in my Buff statement in August 2005, the institutional
framework for developing the national petroleum strategy and for the supervision and
regulation of the sector became operational in the first half of 2004, with the settings of

- 105 National Petroleum Council (NPC) and the National Petroleum Agency (NPA) as well as the
adoption of an Oil Revenue Management Law (ORML). The NPA is receiving technical
assistance to develop advisory capacity and has launched its internet website in December
2005. Public information campaigns on oil-related issues took place through national forums
with the civil society in 2005. An overall strategy to develop the oil sector has been
completed in mid-2005 and is to be submitted to the National Assembly.
My authorities remain committed to ensuring transparency and good governance in the
management of the oil sector. Following the recent disclosure by the Attorney General’s
Office of São Tomé and Príncipe of irregularities in the awarding of oil Blocks 2-6, my
authorities have stated that they will support the Attorney General’s Office in conducting
further investigations and needed legal actions on this issue. In addition, they will propose
that the Attorney General’s recommendations regarding the implementation of international
standards be applied to future oil bidding rounds while working towards the implementation
of Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) principles.
Performance under the PRGF has been satisfactory, as all eight quantitative performance
criteria set for end-September 2005 and all structural performance criteria set for end-July
2005 were met. In addition, all structural benchmarks for end-September 2005 have been
met, with the exception of the one on AML/CFT. In light of this satisfactory performance,
my authorities request the completion of the first review under the PRGF.
II - Program for the Medium-Term and Policies for 2006
The medium-term macroeconomic outlook for São Tomé and Príncipe is favorable,
following particularly the recent developments in the oil sector. Real GDP is expected to
increase by at least 5 percent on average over the next three years, on account of higher
investment in several sectors in anticipation of the oil era. However, as I stated in previous
meetings, São Tomé and Príncipe is not an oil-producing country yet and, therefore, it
will very likely remain a low-income country at least until oil production starts, which is
expected in 2012. Thus, São Tomé and Príncipe, as any other low-income country, is still
facing – and will continue to face in the near to medium term - daunting challenges. These
include among others, consolidating macroeconomic stability, while addressing pressing
social needs, as highlighted by the recent cholera outbreak in the archipelago. My authorities
are of the view that part of oil bonuses from the awarding of oil blocks could be used to
complement foreign assistance in satisfying these needs, consistent with the PRSP. They do
not lose sight of the need to avoid Dutch disease and, accordingly, they remain committed to
a proper and transparent use of these resources.
In 2006, the economic activity is expected to grow by 4.5 percent and inflation to decline to
13 percent from 17 percent in 2005, owing to a prudent monetary policy. Overall, my
authorities intend to pursue their prudent macroeconomic and structural policies.

- 106 Fiscal policy takes into account recent developments in the local oil sector and in the tax
reform, and gives more weight to pro-poor spending. Specifically, revenues (excluding oil
bonuses) are expected to increase by 2 percentage points of GDP with the coming into effect
of several revenue-enhancing measures adopted last year. Expenditures will increase by 5
percentage points, reflecting mainly higher investment spending in agriculture and fisheries,
and greater outlays in social sectors on one hand, and continued control of the wage bill on
the other hand. On the wage bill, my authorities will enforce a strict management of the
payroll through the activation of the civil servants’ register that has been recently developed
with the UNDP. Further increase in the wage bill will be implemented once a new
government is appointed following the holding of parliamentary, regional and presidential
elections scheduled this year. As noted above, the larger fiscal deficit expected in 2006 will
be financed by part of the oil bonuses and foreign assistance.
In order to improve public finance management, a fully integrated, computerized budget
and public expenditure management system (SIGFE), developed with assistance of the World
Bank is slated to replace the existing system by end-December 2006 (performance criterion).
My authorities also intend to launch a thorough reform of the Inspectorate-General of
Finance. They will amend internal control laws and administrative regulations governing the
IGF’s actions by end-March 2006 (structural benchmark), with the aim of increasing the
IGF’s powers regarding the oversight and auditing of the financial operations of the central
government, public enterprises, and local governments. By end-June 2006, the government
will establish a database to record and monitor follow-up actions addressing problems
identified by the IGF in each inspected sector, including the applicable sanctions and
penalties (structural benchmark).
Monetary policy will aim at bringing inflation to a lower level by end-2006, through notably
ceilings on the expansion of the central bank’s domestic assets and banking sector credit to
the government. Nevertheless, the central bank (BCSTP) stands ready to reassess its
monetary policy stance whenever it deems necessary. In particular, the central bank will keep
its reference interest rate above the inflation rate and will use its available instruments to
address liquidity concerns. The BCSTP will pursue the strengthening of its operational
capacities, with technical assistance from Fund’s MFD on the development of additional
instruments, in the areas of banking supervision, development of interbank money markets,
and foreign exchange auctions. The BCSTP remains committed to the continuation of the
existing managed float exchange rate arrangement, which has allowed the monetary authority
to appropriately address the volatility of external inflows and outflows.
My authorities intend to pursue their structural reforms aiming at improving the business
climate and supporting private sector entrepreneurship. In particular, in order to alleviate
administrative burdens on start-ups, my Saotomean authorities, along with the IFC advice
and assistance, plan to address ways to modernize the business registration process, through
notably the establishment of a one-stop shop. A deadline for the completion of the feasibility

- 107 studies of ENASA and ENAPORT will be set this year in consultation with the Fund and
World Bank staffs.
My authorities also intend to pursue efforts to increase transparency. In the oil sector, they
will ensure a regular updating of the newly-established internet website of the NPA. In
addition, in cooperation with the World Bank, they are developing an implementation
manual/handbook of the oil revenue management law that will be posted on the websites of
the National Assembly and the NPA by the end of the first quarter of 2006.
Regarding poverty reduction, my authorities have recently submitted the first PRSP annual
progress report to the Fund and the World Bank, which has been prepared in a participatory
process, in collaboration with the country’s main donors and civil society. The preparation of
the PRSP annual report constitutes one of the floating completion point triggers specified
under in the HIPC Decision Point Document of December 2000. The completion point is
expected to be reached in mid-2006.
III - Conclusion
My Saotomean authorities have demonstrated great degree of ownership of their program,
and they are resolved to pursue prudent macroeconomic policies and sound structural reforms
over the medium-term. In particular, with the advent of the oil era, work is being done to
ensure that the regulatory framework for a proper development of the oil sector and an
efficient management of oil resources is in place. Nevertheless, São Tomé and Príncipe
remains a low-income country, at least until oil revenue flow into its economy, and it is still
facing challenges inherent to this group of countries. Addressing these obstacles during this
transition phase toward the oil era will require continuous support from the international
community. My authorities are particularly grateful to the latter for its support so far through
notably the debt rescheduling agreement with the Paris Club in September 2005 and the
pledges for the Priority Actions Program at the recent roundtable meeting with donors that
took place in Brussels last December. They look forward to the completion point under the
HIPC Initiative and, subsequently, to immediate debt reduction under the MDRI this year.
My authorities are of the view that all these actions will be critical to a successful
implementation of their growth-enhancing and poverty reduction strategy.
