Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for
the 2006 Consultation with the Republic of Lithuania
Approved by Poul Thomsen and G. Russell Kincaid
April 12, 2006
The Article IV discussions were held in Vilnius during February 1–14, 2006. The mission
comprised Mr. Mody (Head), Ms. Ohnsorge, and Ms. Igan (all EUR), Ms. Ribakova (MFD),
Mr. Sierhej (EUR, Warsaw Office), and Mr. Lugaresi (external FAD expert).
Mr. Sigurgeirsson (Alternate Executive Director) and Mr. Minkevicius (Advisor to the
Executive Director) joined the discussions. The mission met with President Adamkus, Prime
Minister Brazauskas, Finance Minister Balcytis, Central Bank Governor Sarkinas, members
of the Budget Committee of the Parliament, leaders of political parties, financial institutions,
investors, and experts at think tanks.
Lithuania maintains a currency board, has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, and
maintains an exchange rate system free of restrictions (Appendix I). In accordance with UN
Security Council resolutions, Lithuania maintains restrictions and imposes sanctions against
individuals, groups, and organizations associated with terrorism. Anti-money-laundering
legislation is now largely harmonized with EU directives, and a forthcoming Moneyval
report will provide more details.
Lithuania subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard. Data provision is timely
and facilitates effective surveillance (Appendix II). The authorities have agreed to the
publication of the staff report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Following exceptional economic progress—based on macro stability and economic
flexibility—demand pressures have emerged. In 2005, GDP grew by 7½ percent, driven
by growth of consumption and investment in non-traded goods and services. Revenue
overperformance made possible a small fiscal contraction, but was offset by the demand
impact of European Union (EU) funds. Evidence of resource bottlenecks suggests that
growth has been above its potential of about 6 percent a year. External shocks, amid
domestic demand pressures (and helped by rapid credit growth), contributed to rising yearon-year inflation of about 2¾ -3 percent, which may delay euro adoption.
Emergent domestic and external imbalances deserve precautionary steps. In 2006,
ongoing momentum should keep growth at about 6¾ percent, still somewhat above its
potential. Inflation will likely pick up as the pass-through from energy price increases
continues and substantially increased use of EU funds adds to demand pressures. The current
account deficit (expected in the range of 7½ -8 percent of GDP) and the accumulating
external short-term debt need close monitoring. The authorities have taken welcome
prudential steps with respect to the banking system, though additional measures, especially to
cool the property market, would be appropriate.
A short postponement of euro adoption would not impose an immediate economic risk.
The currency board, fiscal policy, and the process of trade and financial integration with
Europe can be expected to stay on course. Further delays in euro adoption, however, cannot
be ruled out if the upside risks to inflation projections materialize. More pro-active fiscal
tightening would, at this point in the business cycle, relieve inflationary pressures and signal
Lithuania’s commitment to euro adoption.
Since long-term fiscal pressures are set to increase, forward-looking revenue and
expenditure rationalization measures are needed. Aging and public sector wage increases
in response to emigration will exert pressures on expenditures. The elimination of the social
tax will reduce revenues from 2008. A widening of the tax base and expenditure
rationalization will be needed. Examples of expenditure rationalization include streamlined
social assistance benefits to ensure a better social safety net with fewer labor market
distortions, formalized co-payments in the health care system, and more competition in the
delivery of health services. All measures need to be integrated into a more ambitious
medium-term expenditure framework, integrated into a Fiscal Responsibility Act.
EU funds need to be harnessed carefully to ensure that they improve competitiveness.
Export growth faces new challenges as capacity constraints are reached in the oil refining
industry and international competition in labor-intensive goods increases. The absorption of
EU funds is expected to rise steeply in the next few years. Effective use of these funds for
developing public goods, without distorting market competition, will help maintain
competitiveness. Easing labor market regulations will support small and medium-sized
companies, the main source of employment in the economy.

These are not, as yet, a source
of alarm. As such, needed measures should aim at anticipating risks and exercising caution.
The authorities have moved in the right direction (Box 1), and a stepped-up momentum
would provide valuable insurance.

Box 1. Implementation of Fund Policy Advice
Financial sector. The 2001 FSAP recommendations have been implemented, and, against the
background of rapid credit growth, monitoring, informal credit guidelines, and consultations with
foreign supervisors are in line with the recommendations of the 2004 Article IV consultation (see
paragraph 16).
Fiscal consolidation. Staff’s recommendation of fiscal consolidation, with a general government
deficit below 2 percent of GDP in 2005, was implemented. A midyear supplemental budget was not
approved. The deficit (including savings and property restitution), at 1.3 percent of GDP, largely
reflected revenue overperformance in a buoyant macroeconomic environment, but was also helped by
improved tax administration (see paragraph 5).
Improved government efficiency. Limited progress has been made in response to Fund calls for
greater government efficiency. Advice on fiscal decentralization and on improving expenditure
management has not yet been implemented (see paragraph 23). Initial steps in the health and
education systems are constructive, but a significant task lies ahead. The interest in a Fiscal
Responsibility Act, for long-term fiscal discipline, has waned.
Competitiveness. The authorities have moved to lower the personal income tax and have adopted the
framework of EU structural funds to foster competitiveness, especially in small and medium-sized
enterprises (see paragraph 26). Further labor market flexibility will help labor absorption.

year in the first half of 2005 to about
eight times the annual average income (Figure 2). The stock market index surged until
October and, despite a recent correction, grew by 37 percent in 2005 (Figure 3). The
authorities agreed with staff that, though precise calculation is difficult, the potential
growth rate was about 5¾ percent a year.1 On that assumption, the economy has been
operating above potential since 2004, with a current gap of 1¾ percent of GDP. The
Lithuanian economic cycle has continued to move in opposition to the euro zone cycle,
which shows output below potential (Text Figure 4).

The economy has received stimulus from the combination of fiscal and European
Union (EU) expenditures—and the risks of overheating have risen. The fiscal deficit,
unbudgeted outlays for savings and property restitution, and the injection of EU funds

This rate is close to the average growth of the last 10 years and also to that predicted by
EUR’s cross-country growth analysis (SM/06/46).

Box 2. Migration: Short-Term Pressures
Migration outflows have picked up, despite strong economic growth and bright prospects.
Lithuania’s population, which stands at 3.4 million people, has declined over the past 10 years
from a high of 3.6 million in 1995. In recent years, migration has contributed considerably to
the decline; 9,600 migrants in 2004 formed over 40 percent of the population reduction
(Figure 1). The differences in income relative to the more advanced European nations make
emigration an attractive option (Figure 2). The authorities estimate that about 15,600 people
emigrated in 2005, and emigration incentives could continue for the next 25 years, during
which period about 200,000 people, or more than 8 percent of working-age population in 2005,
could leave (see forthcoming Selected Issues Paper).

Emigrants tend to be of working age, creating labor market pressures. The top
destinations for Lithuanians presently are the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Sweden.
According to Irish and UK immigrant records, about three quarters of immigrants are between
the ages of 18 and 34. Also, more than 40 percent of immigrants have college degrees. In 2005,
the sectors most affected by emigration were construction, wholesale and retail trade
(with nominal wage increases of around 12 percent), and health care (where salaries increased
almost 20 percent).

Inflation has trended upward. Annual average inflation of 2.7 percent in 2005 rose
from 1.2 percent in 2004. This rise

increases were offset by large drops in

the prices of textiles, footwear, and furniture. The increase was more pronounced in prices of
nontradable goods which, year on year, rose by 3.5 percent at end-2005.
7.
The current account deficit has remained sizable, with significant reliance on
bank and market-based financing to cover it. Helped by temporarily favorable factors
strengthening export growth (a boost to food and chemical exports from EU accession), the
deficit narrowed to about 7.0 percent of GDP in 2005 from 7.7 percent of GDP posted in
2004 (Figure 4). Net factor income outflows were 2.5 percent of GDP in 2005, driven mainly
by the large stock of FDI, with remittances and worker compensation from emigrants
contributing to inflows of about 2.1 percent of GDP. FDI and EU funds are expected to have
financed about one-half of the current account deficit in 2005 (Table 2), with the rest covered
by bank and market-based financing.
8.
Despite the current account
deficits, external indebtedness remains
among the lowest in the new Central and
Eastern European members of the EU
(the CEE-8), though an increasing share
is in the form of short-term debt. At
38 percent of GDP, the net international
liabilities position at end-2004 was among
the lowest in the CEE-8 (Text Table 2).
As of end-December 2005, gross debt had
risen to 48.7 percent of GDP, from
47 percent of GDP a year earlier. The share
of short-term debt (on a remaining-maturity
basis) in external debt has increased
steadily and at end-December 2005 stood
at 49 percent; foreign currency reserves
covered 63 percent of this short-term debt.

Credit growth has picked up once again. This pickup reflects not only the pace and
composition of economic growth, but also the low base of credit penetration, especially for
mortgage lending (Figure 5 and Box 3). Bank lending to households grew in 2005 by
90 percent year on year, supporting consumption growth and raising the share of household
credit by 7 percentage points, to more than one-third of outstanding private sector credit.
Credit to enterprises has been expanding most rapidly to nontradable sectors, particularly to
real estate and construction.

- 10 -

Box 3. Financial Sector Developments
Lithuania’s credit growth rate was one of the highest in the region during 2002-05 (Figure 1).
This rapid growth was fueled, in part, by residential mortgage lending, which now stands at
19 percent of total outstanding loans. Strong mortgage growth was partially driven by households’
demands for higher quality residences, but also reflected a small share of mortgages in bank
portfolios (and a low level of household indebtedness) consistent with the international evidence
(Figure 2). Mortgage lending can, therefore, be expected to slow as the market matures. While
presenting risks, residential mortgage lending provides useful diversification from large corporate
exposures.

The buoyant nontraded goods sectors have had a strong appetite for credit. Commercial real
estate and construction have increased their share in the corporate loan portfolio by 10 percentage
points since 2002 to about 22 percent (Figure 3) in 2005. The other large corporate exposures are to
financial intermediation and wholesale and retail trade. In contrast, the share of manufacturing has
decreased by 5 percentage points to about 20 percent.

While financial sector earnings and liquidity ratios held steady, asset quality and
capital adequacy indicators deteriorated somewhat in 2005. The competition among
banks to satisfy the demand for credit has led to more aggressive lending practices, as seen in
narrower interest margins and increasing loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios of new
loans. Nonperforming loans, though still low by international standards, have risen
somewhat, to 2½ percent of gross loans (Text Table 3). With the introduction of International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in October 2005, the authorities now compile a loan
impairment ratio, which also shows a similar increase. Provisioning against nonperforming
loans remains low by international standards. At the same time, the capital adequacy ratio has
come down to 10 percent (though is still above the regulatory minimum of 8 percent). Loans
to large borrowers (those with loans exceeding 10 percent of bank capital) as a ratio of bank
capital have increased to 135 percent. The stock of foreign currency loans as a share of
outstanding credit has risen to 62½ percent.

III. DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHORITIES
11.
While commending the authorities for prudent management, the mission called
for a combination of measures that insured against downside risks while sustaining
growth. Solid growth with moderate inflation can continue but the level of achievement will
depend on the policy environment. The authorities were receptive to the principle of
precaution in guiding policy decisions. In this context, the discussion centered around four
themes: (a) short-term outlook and vulnerabilities; (b) euro adoption; (c) long-term fiscal
reforms; and (d) structural measures.

- 12 -

A. Outlook and Vulnerabilities
12.
The authorities expect the economy’s growth potential to be lower than the very
rapid growth achieved recently. Lithuania has enjoyed an extended period of significant,
even accelerating, growth. Between 1995 and 1998 average annual GDP growth was
5.6 percent. The growth rate fell to 3.1 percent a year during the next three years, which
included the decline in output following

unfinished redeployment of productive
resources, combined with rapid consumption growth based on a more optimistic view of the
future. The authorities and staff agreed that some part of recent growth cannot be presumed
to continue, and since a precise evaluation of potential growth was difficult, a conservative
view of about 6 percent a year, was desirable, especially for fiscal planning.

The authorities expect that GDP growth in 2006 will moderate in line with its
potential. There are conflicting forces at work. The authorities project real GDP growth of
6–6¼ percent in 2006, based on an

Staff projects somewhat higher inflation, and greater upside risks, in 2006
than do the authorities. The authorities expect year-on-year inflation in 2006 to remain in
the 2¾ to 3¼ percent range, while staff forecasts an inflation rate of 3½ percent. The
authorities consider domestic demand

increase (on January 1, 2006) in the price
of Gazprom supplied natural gas (Text Figure 7), the remaining pass-through from last year’s
rise in world oil prices, and further increases in world oil prices projected by the World
Economic Outlook. Continued convergence to EU price levels can be expected, since most
tradable prices are about 50-70 percent of the EU-25 average price level and, in the medium
term, excise taxes will have to be raised to comply with EU regulations.

15.
Though important, the authorities consider the external vulnerabilities to be as
yet in a manageable range. The current account deficit is projected to fall between 7½ and
8 percent of GDP in the next two years. Staff analysis suggests that a deficit of this size is
consistent with Lithuania’s relatively low per capita income, and permits higher investment
rates and more consumption smoothing (IMF Country Reports Nos. 05/122 and 05/123). FDI

credits and lending from parent banks to
their Lithuanian subsidiaries. Because the banking sector is largely owned by reputable
foreign banks (Text Table 5), the likelihood remains high that much of the short-term debt
will be rolled over. Also, the currency board has been well tested in adverse conditions.

The authorities view the risks to the domestic financial system to be generally
under control. They are monitoring financial system stresses—especially the key credit

risks—arising from domestic credit growth and agreed that direct measures to cool down the
property market would be helpful. Four policy measures were discussed:
•

In a welcome step to improve transparency, the Bank of Lithuania (BOL) will soon
publish a financial stability report to discuss the state of the financial system.

•

The BOL has appropriately been in contact with banks to discuss guidelines for loanto-value and debt-to-income ratios as well as on adequate capitalization and
provisioning.

•

Coordination between Lithuanian
and foreign bank supervisors has
been active.

•

priority. A broad-based property

Staff took a more cautious stance and recommended additional steps to
strengthen financial sector surveillance. In particular, staff was concerned about the
consequences of continued rapid credit growth, alongside a decline in the net foreign asset
position of the banking system. Aggressive lending risked deterioration in lending quality
and increased vulnerabilities. With the FSAP recommendations and the EU guidelines in
place, staff did not recommend administrative measures to slow down the pace of credit
expansion. Staff did recommend that the supervisor undertake forward-looking analysis to
identify emerging risks and ensure that banks’ information and risk management systems are
adequate. Besides publishing the loan “impairment ratio,” continuing to publish and regulate
banks on the basis of the conventional NPL ratio remains essential for consistent tracking of
the financial system’s health. Regulations for disclosing banks’ fees and posting borrowing
guidelines on the BOL’s website would provide additional consumer protection. The
authorities agreed to an FSAP update, targeted for April 2007.

Euro adoption in January 2007 is likely to be a close call—a short postponement,
while unfortunate for Lithuania, would not pose an immediate economic risk. The
authorities remain optimistic that the

target date will be met. Until recently,

domestic demand pressures contributed
to a rising inflation rate, which could
breach the reference value and, hence, delay euro adoption (Text Figure 9). The authorities
took the view, and staff agreed, that a year’s delay is unlikely to concern financial markets:
the currency board, fiscal policy, and the process of trade and financial integration with
Europe can be expected to stay on course.
Sources: Eurostat; and IMF staff estimates.

19.
To prevent continuing delays, the discussion focused on signaling by the
authorities of an additional commitment to euro adoption—guided in doing so by their
own medium-term fiscal goals. The authorities agreed that if the January 2007 date is not
met, a continued breach of the inflation

significant medium-term gains from euro
adoption. With fiscal policy as the main available tool, the authorities recognize that their
continued commitment to macro stability and euro adoption could be reiterated through fiscal
restraint in the current year. The current budget envisages a substantial procyclical impulse
(about 3 percent of GDP) from a combination of fiscal policy and EU funds in 2006 (Text
Table 1). Given the lags from fiscal restraint to reduced inflation, an immediate commitment
to a countercyclical fiscal stance is warranted. A reduction in the ESA ’95 budget deficit and
in the savings and property restitution payments of 1 percent of GDP could well bring the
inflation rate just below, rather than just above, the Maastricht limit. Short-term expenditure

moderation could be achieved in goods and services, wages (taking into account the need to
retain some high-skill employees), health, social assistance, and farm subsidies.
C. Long-Term Fiscal Issues
20.
The authorities agreed with staff that fiscal pressures are set to increase. The
authorities recognize that increased regional competition for foreign investment and the goal
of reducing the informal economy are generating pressures to lower tax rates, as staff
analysis also confirms (EB/06/[SIP]); moreover, the demand for safety nets and public goods
continues to grow. In addition, the authorities’ Convergence Program projects that, at the
current legal retirement age, the first pillar of the pension system will start running a deficit
by 2020 (Box 4). The authorities agreed with staff analysis that, under plausible emigration
projections, the pressures on the pension system could start earlier and worsen more rapidly,
increasing the urgency of raising the retirement age; also, the rise in doctors’ salaries could
hurt the financial position of the public health care delivery system.
Box 4. Migration: Implications for Public Finances
Since emigrants are drawn largely from the working-age population, migration will exacerbate
the impact of aging on the State Social Insurance Pension Fund. Under current demographic
trends and retirement ages of 60 for women and 62.5 for men, the pensioner-to-contributor ratio will
increase from the current 73.9 percent to 101.7 percent in 2030. Emigration could bring this ratio to
125.3 percent in 2030. The pension fund budget deficit would then reach 2.7 percent of GDP, of
which 1.3 percentage points would be attributable to emigration (Figure 1). Gradually increasing the
retirement age for both men and women to 65 by 2020 could bring the deficit down to 0.9 percent of
GDP even with high emigration.

Migration also creates challenges for the Health Insurance Fund. A study by the Kaunas
University of Medicine reports that 26.8 percent of physicians and 60.7 percent of medical residents
interviewed expressed their intention to migrate. In an effort to limit emigration of doctors and nurses,
the government has planned annual salary increases of up to 20 percent, subject to the availability of
funds. Such a policy, however, could induce a deficit of around 1 percent of GDP in the Health
Insurance Fund budget by 2010 (Figure 2).

- 17 -

21.
The authorities remain committed to a medium-term target of 1 percent of GDP
for the structural budget deficit (in ESA’95 terms), but staff cautioned that this may not
be feasible absent additional efforts. Concerns regarding the relatively wide tax wedge
have led to a planned gradual reduction of the personal income tax (PIT). Especially from
2008 onward, the revenue shortfalls from income tax cuts and the elimination of the social
tax (the surcharge on the profit tax) could reduce revenues by about 2 percent of GDP,
jeopardizing the deficit target of 1 percent of GDP (Text Table 6). The Convergence Program
projects that buoyant revenues—especially from indirect taxes—will partly offset losses from
reduced income tax rates. The authorities pointed to progress made in tax administration; the
staff responded that, though commendable, a continued increase in the revenue-to-GDP ratio
could not be presumed. The authorities noted that the Convergence Program also projects
wage restraint.

22.
To ensure that the downward deficit path envisaged in the Convergence
Program is achieved, the authorities agreed that a variety of measures could be helpful.
On the revenue side, reducing exemptions associated with PIT and the VAT should broaden
the tax base and help improve administration. Staff cautioned that suggestions to eliminate
the social tax earlier than planned may be premature; indeed, making the tax permanent, thus
raising the profit tax to 19 percent, may be worth considering. While the authorities agreed
that a broad-based property tax would be valuable—not only for cooling down the property
market but also for providing municipalities with an independent revenue base—they were
concerned that it may not be politically feasible. Staff also noted that the long-proposed
vehicle tax deserved continued consideration as did the possibility of caps on social security
contributions and payments.
23.
Staff emphasized expenditure rationalization to create space for the provision of
needed public goods as well as likely increases in pension and health care expenses. In
line with the technical assistance provided in 2004, staff recommended that the budget and its
execution should both be reported on a consolidated basis with consistent classifications,
budget preparation information should be provided to municipalities earlier, and a clear
sanctions regime should be established to dissuade arrears. The authorities noted that legal
changes, approved by parliament, are needed for their implementation. Staff reiterated that,
with the deployment of EU funds for enhancing agricultural productivity and EU income
transfers to farmers, the need for additional top-up payments from government resources to
farmers was reduced. Several options were discussed with respect to expenditure
rationalization in health expenditures and social assistance, where, despite progress, the
agenda remains a challenging one:

- 18 -

•

Health care. There was general agreement that further private initiative was possible,
allowing for greater price and quality competition, including through selling or
leasing surplus public facilities to private enterprises, contracting territorial funds
with private providers, and providing a greater role for private insurance companies.
Staff emphasized also the formalizing of co-payments for health care (Box 5) and
making the criteria for consolidating health care public institutions and the listing of
reimbursable pharmaceuticals more transparent.

•

Social assistance. Staff noted that while individual social benefits are often small,
they cumulate, making them expensive to administer and creating, in some instances,
disincentives to work (Box 5). In this context, staff viewed with some concern the
new system of child benefits, additional to the existing tax exemptions, and the
proposed increase in the scope of unemployment benefits and employment subsidies.
The authorities pointed to the centralized database of benefits as a first step in
providing a unified view of benefits. Staff urged consolidation and improved
targeting, reflecting criteria such as poverty alleviation and social insurance.

24.
Staff noted that a more ambitious medium-term expenditure framework
(MTEF), integrated into a Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA), would provide for greater
fiscal discipline. Staff commended the authorities for initial steps taken in operationalizing
the MTEF concept within the central government (through budget ceilings for a three-year
period). The authorities agreed that these could be usefully supplemented by (i) bottom-up
estimates of ongoing expenditure, based on cost drivers of their individual budgets and (ii)
detailed presentation to parliament. Such a framework would also help prioritize EU funds.
In this context, staff urged more careful scrutiny of spending requests by line ministries and
municipalities. The authorities were less enthusiastic this year about adopting an FRA. Staff
continued to view an FRA that tightened Ministry of Finance control and monitoring over
general government budget preparation and execution as an important tool for fiscal
management.
D. Structural Reforms for Competitiveness
25.
Export growth faces new challenges. On the favorable side, the real exchange rate
shows either a modest depreciation (in consumer price terms) or a flat trend (in unit labor
cost terms) (Figure 6). Lithuania’s share of world trade has continued to increase. Also,
based on the unchanging relative productivity of tradable to nontradable goods and services
and the net international investment position (Figure 7), the real exchange rate appears in line
with fundamentals. The authorities agreed, however, that the challenges ahead were
significant. Price margins are likely to be squeezed in some sectors, such as fertilizers, which
rely on gas supplied at increasingly higher prices. The oil refinery Mazeikiu Nafta, which
experienced a surge in output and exports of petroleum products, is operating closer to
capacity. Rising wage costs are generating more general pressures, not least because of the
emigration of workers. Price competition for labor-intensive products, such as textiles,
footwear, and furniture, is on the rise. Also, the shift of the export structure toward highertechnology products has slowed (Figure 8).

- 19 -

Box 5. Making Health Care and Social Assistance More Efficient
Though public expenditures for health care are in line with Lithuania’s per capita income, the system is
under cost pressures and patients often need “informal” payments to gain access. At between 4 and
5 percent of GDP, public expenditure on health is somewhat higher than in the other Baltic countries, but lower
than the EU average. Cost pressures are high on account of rising salaries of doctors and needed modernization.
Moreover, expenditures are spread thinly over a system with considerable overcapacity, leading paradoxically
to rationing of services, especially in urban areas and for key services. As a consequence, queues and informal
payments to medical staff are widespread (Tables 1 and 2).

Formal co-payments would ease the pressure on HIF resources and make patients more responsible. So
far, co-payments have been introduced only for pharmaceuticals. Copayments that average 10 percent of the
cost of services would raise roughly LTL 190 million, or 0.3 percent of GDP. This would be roughly equivalent
to LTL 45 per service unit, which is well below the average informal payment for health care. Co-payments
should not be applied to clearly cost-effective preventive services; a limit should be set on any family’s out-ofpocket expenses; and the lowest-income families should be exempted.
Consolidation of social benefits may reduce work disincentives. A low-income family with three children,
with a long-term unemployed head of family, is entitled to the social assistance benefit, child benefits,
unemployment benefits, housing support, and other benefits (Table 3). The total family income is higher if the
family head is long-term unemployed than if she or he is short-term unemployed or working at the minimum
wage, once work-related costs (e.g., transport, meals) have been taken into account. Benefit consolidation could
be financed by better targeting (see forthcoming Selected Issues Paper).

The authorities view the injection of EU funds as a unique opportunity to
maintain high productivity growth through investments in infrastructure and human
capital. They noted that, after a slow start, the use of Structural Funds had picked up, with
the strongest pipeline in transport projects, energy efficiency measures, and science and
education infrastructure (Text Figure 11

•

Special care must be taken in awarding funds to individual companies to avoid
creating the perception of political influence in their allocation. Competition for
subsidies should not become a substitute for competition in the market place.

•

Independence of the project evaluators should be guaranteed by the system.

•

Transparency should be ensured by publishing more data on awarded contracts and
unsuccessful bids, without compromising sensitive commercial information.

•

Caution should be exercised in shifting cofinancing obligations to the private sector
through public-private partnerships.

•

Looking ahead, the integration of the use of EU funds with structural reforms in such
sectors as health and education will maximize their effectiveness.

Staff welcomed the headway Lithuania has made in improving its business
climate but noted that the task remained unfinished. Progress has continued on the reform
front, with recent high-profile privatizations. Anticipating the decommissioning of the second
unit of the Ignalina nuclear power plant in 2009, the authorities are engaged in increasing
domestic electricity supply and are in discussion with neighboring nations to improve energy
security, through such initiatives as the Baltic Energy Market. International indices of
regulatory burden typically place Lithuania in the middle of the new Central and Eastern
European members of the EU. The World Bank’s Doing Business report gives high marks to
Lithuania for ease in setting up new businesses. However, the virtual prohibition of overtime
work and the difficulties in hiring temporary workers limit the flexibility of small enterprises
which are the dominant source of employment generation. Greater flexibility will be of
particular importance in the context of the evolving competitive environment. Investments in
effective vocational training and world-class tertiary education are priorities for dealing with
skill shortages.

Box 6. Utilization of EU Funds in 2004-06
At an annual average of 5.4 percent of GDP, Lithuania has the largest commitment of EU funds
(relative to GDP) among the new member countries, and uptake is increasing gradually. This
reflects Lithuania’s relatively low per capita income and the large project of decommissioning the
Ignalina power plant. In 2005, spending of EU funds amounted to 2.5 percent of GDP, compared with
1.3 percent of GDP in 2004. According to budget projections, spending will accelerate further to
4.3 percent of GDP in 2006 (Table 1). The authorities expect utilization of EU funds to remain high
also beyond 2006. Structural funds committed for 2004-06 can be drawn until 2008, and cohesion
funds can be drawn until 2010.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
In pursuing long-term growth, the authorities must anticipate and deal with
emerging imbalances and longer-term challenges. Lithuania’s impressive run of growth
has been fueled by rapid credit growth that has contributed to consumption growth and
investment in the property and construction sectors. While these developments represent
progress along the catch-up path, they are creating new financial and inflation pressures and
vulnerabilities. Longer-term challenges arise from international tax competition, the demand
for public goods, aging, emigration, and new competition in export markets, with
implications for fiscal goals and international competitiveness. A sustained commitment to
addressing these evolving challenges is necessary for continued growth with stability.
29.
In the financial sector, the authorities have taken initial steps to contain
aggressive lending practices and should continue with measures to stay ahead of market
developments. The recommendations of the 2001 FSAP have been implemented, and the
regulatory and supervisory system is in line with EU guidelines. Steps taken by the BOL to
coordinate with foreign supervisors, publish a financial stability report, and provide guidance
to banks on prudential lending are all welcome. However, since rapid credit expansion may
continue with deterioration in credit quality, the onus now shifts to supervisors to conduct
their own forward-looking analysis and ensure—through additional supervisory measures, if
needed—that banks’ risk management systems are keeping pace with market developments.
Continuing to publish and regulate on the basis of the NPL ratio remains essential for
consistent tracking of the financial system’s health. Disclosure of banks’ fees and further
efforts to disseminate borrowing guidelines will provide additional consumer protection. Tax
measures should be taken to cool down the property market before large vulnerabilities
emerge.
30.
Inflation has crept up, and controlling it would be helped by more ambitious
medium-term fiscal goals. At about 3 percent, the yearly inflation rate is still modest, but
the risk of reinforcing wage price movement cannot be ruled out. The fiscal stance for 2006
is unhelpfully procyclical. Moreover, at their expected absorption rate, EU funds will add to
the stimulus. Therefore, with fiscal restraint as the only available macroeconomic tool, a
countercyclical fiscal stance would help contain the incipient inflationary pressures.
31.
Fiscal conservatism would also help signal commitment to early euro adoption.
With a track record of generally prudent macroeconomic policies, structural reforms, and
flexible markets, Lithuania stands to benefit from euro adoption. A short delay is unlikely to
have a material bearing on risks or prospects, as the currency board, which has served
Lithuania well, remains strong. But if inflation continues on its current trajectory, a longer
delay is possible. Efforts to ensure early euro adoption are desirable to eliminate the residual
uncertainty associated with the currency board and to further benefit from trade and financial
ties with the rest of Europe.
32.
A variety of measures, embedded in a forward-looking procedural framework,
are needed to deal with the growing claim on fiscal resources. With the proposed
reduction of the personal income tax rate, the medium-term deficit target of 1 percent of GDP
is at risk. On the revenue side, broadening the tax base through reduction of exemptions and

- 23 -

incentives (not least for mortgages), a more far-reaching property tax, and a vehicle tax
deserve serious attention. Recent efforts to strengthen tax administration need further
reinforcement. On the expenditure side, greater spending efficiency must be the goal. This
can be achieved in current spending, including in education, health, and social assistance. For
example, the introduction of co-payments for public health services will strengthen patient
responsibility, and more competition in service provision will help contain cost and improve
quality. In social services, consolidation of benefits will allow for better targeting and reduce
incentives to move into long-term unemployment. But these efforts must be placed within a
more fully fledged MTEF. In this context, a more careful scrutiny of spending by line
ministries and municipalities remains an urgent task. In turn, the MTEF must be integrated
with a FRA that creates the necessary checks and balances, not least because, with euro
adoption, an important anchor for political commitment to budgetary discipline will be
removed.
33.
The single most important influence on Lithuanian competitiveness is likely to
be the deployment of EU funds, which, therefore, need to be harnessed carefully. The
real exchange rate appears reasonably valued, and the business climate has continued to
improve. Looking ahead, EU funds will provide needed public goods and help raise
productivity. Their effectiveness will likely be enhanced by maintaining centralized
management in the Ministry of Finance, taking special care to avoid creating the perception
of political influence in the allocation of funds, ensuring transparency on contract awards,
and integrating the use of EU funds with structural reforms in such sectors as health and
education.
34.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Lithuania be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Including public debt and debt by banks, monetary authorities, other sectors, and related to direct investment.
2/ Including debt by other sector and related to direct investment.
3/ Gross external debt minus debt securities held abroad and other investments abroad.
4/ Short-term gross external debt excluding trade credits and currency and deposits held abroad.
5/ Debt service excludes amortization of short-term debt. Servicing of short-term debt reflects also the turnover of very short-term claims. The authorities are examining the reasons for a
rise in such claims and a STA technical assistance mission is expected to help establish a methodology for their reporting. The stock of short-term debt used for such prudential measures
as the reserve to short-term debt ratio is not affected by these developments. Staff projections in the 2004 Article IV staff report indicate that debt service on short-term debt is, on average, on the order
of 45 percent of exports of goods and services over the medium term.
6/ At remaining maturity.

presentation, but were not in previous staff reports.
2/ Grants from EU and related expenditures are not included prior to 2002.

1/ Gross official reserves reported here differ from the monetary table due to valuation differences.
2/ On an remaining maturity basis, estimated as short-term debt at year-end plus amortization of medium- and long-term debt of the following year.
3/ On an original maturity basis.
4/ Gross external debt minus debt securities held abroad and other investments abroad.
5/ Short-term gross external debt excluding trade credits and currency and deposits held abroad.
6/ Excludes amortization on short-term debt. Servicing of short-term debt reflects also the turnover of very short-term claims. The authorities are examining the reasons for a
rise in such claims and a STA technical assistance mission is expected to help establish a methodology for their reporting. The stock of short-term debt used for such
prudential measures as the reserve to short-term debt ratio is not affected by these developments. Staff projections in the 2004 Article IV staff report indicate that debt service on
short-term debt is, on average, on the order of 45 percent of exports of goods and services over the medium term.
7/ CPI-based REER against the 17 major trading partners in 2000.

* Core financial soundness indicators.
General notes:
A. FSI calculations were based on the definitions in Compilation Guide on Financial Soundness Indicators, except if otherwise stated.
B. Sector level data was compiled by data aggregating. Adjustments to the sector-level balance sheet and income statement in order
to eliminate intra-sector positions, transactions and gains and losses were not made. Adjustments for goodwill were not made.
C. Most FSI were derived from supervisory consolidated (cross sector) data and comprise all banks and foreign bank branches, incorporated in Lithuania.
Thus, if not otherwise stated, the sum of banks' Capital and reserves and Bank branches funds received from the head office were used as capital
in the ratios for the whole banking system.
1/ Without foreign bank branches.
2/ Unconsolidated data.
3/ The increase in the ratios as of September, 2005 is to a large extent attributable to the reclassifying of the loans to some enterprises in
some industries after they have encountered some financial difficulties.
4/ Large exposure - means loans granted to the borrower the net value of which equals to, or exceeds, 10 per cent of bank capital that is
calculated having regard to the national Rules for Calculating Capital Adequacy. In this particular case Loan - means all bank’s monetary
claims to the borrower, acquired shares (contributions or other portions of equity), reflected in the bank balance-sheet and off-balance sheet
items, also monetary obligations of the bank recognised in the bank’s off-balance.
5/ Exposures to affiliated entities and other connected counterparties means connected lending.
6/ As of September of 2004 and 2005, data is annualised.
7/ Net income before extraordinary items and taxes.
8/ Excluding loans and deposits to / from credit and financial institutions.
9/ Core Liquid Assets comprise currency and financial assets available on demand or within 3 months or less.
10/ Information is based on interbank deals of all maturities (mostly overnights) made between resident banks in national currency litai within
the last quarter of the period.
11/ The major part of foreign currency loans and foreign currency liabilities are in Euros. Due to the Currency board arrangement and pegging
litai to Euro this does not represent such foreign exchange risk as it would be in the other cases.
12/ N.B. On-balance assets position in equities is used instead net open position in equities.

APPENDIX II

LITHUANIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Over the past several years, Lithuania has made good progress in establishing a
macroeconomic database. Official data for all sectors are generally of sufficiently good
quality to support economic analysis.
Lithuania subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in May 1996, and
its metadata have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB) since April 1997. Lithuania meets the SDDS specifications for coverage, periodicity
and timeliness of the data, and for the dissemination of the advance release calendars. A
significant amount of information is now available on various websites through the Internet
(see section on Dissemination of Statistics, below). A ROSC Data Module was completed in
November 2002.
National Accounts
The national accounts are compiled by the Department of Statistics (DOS) in accordance
with the guidelines of the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95). Quarterly GDP
estimates at current and at constant prices are compiled both from the production and
expenditure approaches. GDP estimates by production are considered to be more reliable
than the corresponding estimates by expenditure, but no statistical discrepancies between
these two estimates are shown in the published figures as the discrepancies are included in
the estimates of changes in inventories. In general, good data sources and sound methods are
used, for the compilation of the national accounts, but difficulties remain in measuring the
economic activity of the informal sector. These latter estimates are compiled at detailed
levels of economic activity using fixed coefficients derived from a benchmark survey
conducted in 1996. The base year for the fixed price series was changed to 2000 in early
2003.
Price Data
Since December 1998, CPI weights have been updated annually. The monthly CPI is
available in the second week following the reference month. The producer price index is
calculated according to the chain-linked Laspeyres formula with weights updated every year.

- 46 -

APPENDIX II

Public Finance
Data on the central government budget execution are available quarterly, although these data
are subject to frequent revisions. The ongoing treasury project is expected to improve fiscal
data quality substantially. However, further work is needed to clarify the treatment of public
health care providers and of EU transactions, and the consolidation procedure for
government operations. Monthly and quarterly data on consolidated central government are
not reconciled because they are on different recording basis. A new classification,
incorporating the GFSM2001 was approved in mid-2003. Since then, the MoF has been
reporting to STA general government’s annual data on an accrual and cash basis (except for
local governments, which are still on a cash basis) for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY).
Money and Banking
The Bank of Lithuania (BoL) reports monetary and financial statistics (MFS) to STA on a
timely and regular basis. The scope, concepts and definitions of monetary statistics are
broadly in line with the guidelines of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
In compliance with the ECB requirements on pre-accession countries, the BoL’s Banking
and Monetary Statistics Division generally follows ECB regulations (1995 ESA) on
sectorization, valuation and classification of financial instruments.
External Sector
The BoL is responsible for compiling the balance of payments, the international investment
position, the external debt and the international reserves statistics. The BoL compiles balance
of payments statistics on a monthly and quarterly basis using the format recommended in the
Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). The monthly data correspond to several
key balance of payments components, compiled on the basis of a sample survey covering the
public sector, commercial banks, and some nonfinancial private sector institutions. The Data
Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity is disseminated
according to the operational guidelines and is hyperlinked to the Fund’s DSBB.
Dissemination of Statistics
The Lithuanian authorities publish a range of economic statistics through a number of
publications, including the DOS's monthly publication, Economic and Social Developments,
and the BoL's monthly Bulletin. A significant amount of data are available on the Internet:
•

Lithuania’s metadata for data categories defined by the Special Data Dissemination
Standard are posted on the IMF’s DSBB (http://dsbb.imf.org);

•

The BoL website ( http://www.lbank.lt ) provides data on monetary statistics, treasury
bill auction results, balance of payments, the international investment position, and
main economic indicators;

- 47 -

APPENDIX II

•

The DOS website (http://www.std.lt) provides quarterly information on economic and
social development indicators;

•

The MoF (http://www.finmin.lt) home page includes data on the national budget, as
well as information on laws and privatization; and

•

The National Stock Exchange website (http://www.nse.lt) has information on stock
trading.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Lithuania
On May 1, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Lithuania.1
Background
Following exceptional economic progress, based on macro stability and economic flexibility,
imbalances and cautionary signals have emerged. Centered around nontraded goods
production, GDP grew 7.5 percent in 2005. Most indicators suggest a tightening of resource
use: a declining unemployment rate, high capacity utilization, and buoyant asset prices.
Through external price shocks, adjustment of administered prices, and domestic demand
pressures, inflation has been on the rise, creating the risk that the Maastricht inflation reference
rate will be exceeded and euro adoption delayed beyond the targeted January 1, 2007.
The economy has continued to receive stimulus from the combination of fiscal and European
Union (EU) expenditures. The stimulus in 2005 would have been greater absent some
unexpected, one-off revenue gains, especially for the value added tax (VAT) and profit tax
revenues. The reorganization of tax administration in late 2004 yielded further revenue gains.
Fiscal pressures, however, are set to increase as expenditure pressures will arise from aging
and public sector wage increases to discourage emigration, and as the elimination of the social
tax reduces revenues from 2008. To offset these fiscal pressures, a widening of the tax base
and expenditure rationalization will be needed.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2The current account deficit has remained sizable, with significant reliance on bank and
market-based financing to cover it. External indebtedness, however, is among the lowest in the
new Central and Eastern European members of the EU (the CEE-8). The accumulating
short-term debt is composed of trade credits and lending by parent banks to the Lithuanian
subsidiaries. As such, while the reserve cover of short-term debt is lower than conventionally
accepted threshold values, the sound reputation of the foreign banks and their long-term
relationships with the Lithuanian banking system mitigate the rollover risk.
Rapid credit growth has supported growing household appetite for mortgages and corporate
demands in non-traded sectors. While financial sector earnings and liquidity ratios held steady,
asset quality and capital adequacy indicators deteriorated somewhat in 2005. The competition
among banks to satisfy the demand for credit has led to more aggressive lending practices, as
seen in narrow interest margins and increasing loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios of new
loans.
Increased use of EU funds has revealed the need to harness them carefully to ensure that they
improve competitiveness. The real exchange rate appears fairly valued and export growth has
been sound. Lithuania has also made significant advances in improving its business climate.
Nevertheless, export growth faces new challenges as capacity constraints are reached in the oil
refining industry and international competition in labor-intensive goods increases. In per capita
terms, Lithuania is to receive substantial EU funds and their absorption is expected to rise
steeply in the next few years. Effective use of these funds for developing public goods, without
distorting market competition, will help maintain competitiveness.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the continued rapid growth with low inflation, and observed that Lithuania’s
performance over the past five years ranks among the best within the European Union (EU).
Directors attributed this impressive outcome to strong macroeconomic policies, firmly supported
by the currency board arrangement that has served the economy well, the implementation of
wide-ranging structural reforms, and integration with the EU. They noted that generally flexible
product and labor markets, as well as the strong international trade and financial links, have laid
the foundation for Lithuania’s success in the euro zone with sustained, productivity-based
growth.
Directors cautioned, however, that imbalances are emerging and that longer-term challenges
have to be addressed. Consumption as well as investment in the property and construction
sectors have grown rapidly, contributing to inflation and new financial vulnerabilities.
Longer-term challenges are also likely to arise from international tax competition, the demand
for public goods, emigration, and pressures on international competitiveness.
Most Directors noted that external shocks, administered price changes, and domestic demand
pressures had caused the inflation rate to pick up in 2005, and rise above the Maastricht
reference value. A few Directors pointed out that the rise in price levels could also reflect
changes in relative prices related to EU integration. It remains a close call whether the inflation
rate will fall below the Maastricht reference value in time for the euro to be adopted in January
2007. In this context, a number of Directors considered that the rise in inflation may delay euro

-3adoption. Directors agreed that a year’s delay is unlikely to concern financial markets: the
currency board, fiscal policy, and the process of trade and financial integration with Europe
could be expected to stay on course. More generally, Directors encouraged the authorities to
ensure that the right policies are in place to achieve early euro adoption, in order to benefit
further from trade and financial ties with the rest of Europe.
Most Directors stressed that a more ambitious fiscal goal would help contain the rise in the price
level. They noted that the fiscal stance envisaged for 2006 is procyclical and suggested
reducing the projected 2006 budget deficit. Fiscal restraint would also help signal a commitment
to early euro adoption.
Directors welcomed the steps taken by the authorities to contain vulnerabilities from aggressive
lending practices. They took note of the Bank of Lithuania’s efforts to increase coordination with
foreign supervisors, publish a financial stability report, and provide guidance to banks on
prudential lending. The implementation of the measures recommended in the 2001 FSAP has
also been helpful. At this point, Directors did not see the need for administrative measures to
slow the pace of credit growth. Instead, Directors encouraged the authorities to conduct
forward-looking supervision. In particular, the authorities should ensure that banks’ risk
management systems keep pace with market developments. Directors urged the authorities to
take measures to cool down the property market, encourage disclosure of bank fees,
disseminate borrowing guidelines, and continue to report and regulate on the basis of the
nonperforming loan ratio. Directors welcomed the planned FSAP update, which they considered
would serve to strengthen financial sector surveillance and allow a more forward-looking
approach to identifying vulnerabilities. In this context, a regional perspective and cooperation
were seen as important.
Directors suggested that the risks from accumulating external short-term debt need close
monitoring. Nevertheless, they agreed that there are important mitigating factors. In particular,
they noted that the short-term debt mainly comprises trade credits and lending from reputable
foreign banks to their Lithuanian subsidiaries.
Directors called for measures to address the growing medium-term fiscal pressures. They
observed that the planned personal income tax cuts will weaken the revenue base from 2008
onward. These cuts would put at risk the medium-term target of a structural deficit of 1 percent
of GDP. Several Directors underscored that the tax base could be increased by eliminating
exemptions related to mortgages, by introducing a more far-reaching property tax and a vehicle
tax, and by strengthening tax administration.
Directors encouraged the authorities to aim for greater expenditure efficiency, including in the
social sector. In the health sector, the introduction of co-payments would formalize the existing
system of informal payments and strengthen patient responsibility. Increased competition would
help contain the cost and improve the quality of health care delivery. In the area of social
assistance, consolidation and improved targeting of the currently fragmented system would
reduce incentives to move into long-term unemployment.

-4Directors noted that these measures needed to be embedded in a more fully fledged
medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). In this context, Directors called for stricter
scrutiny of expenditures by line ministries and municipalities. Directors encouraged integration
of the MTEF into a Fiscal Responsibility Act that could help fiscal discipline.
Directors noted that export growth would face new challenges. The real exchange rate appears
broadly in line with fundamentals. However, price competition for labor-intensive goods is
intensifying, while rising domestic wages are adding to cost pressures. Directors stressed that
EU funds could help enhance competitiveness and, therefore, need to be harnessed carefully.
Maintaining centralized management of these funds in the Ministry of Finance would support
their effective use. Directors encouraged the authorities to ensure transparency of contract
awards and to integrate the allocation of EU funds with structural reforms, for example in the
social sector.
