IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Papua New Guinea
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV
consultation1 with Papua New Guinea on November 29, 2016, and considered and endorsed the
staff appraisal without a meeting on a lapse-of-time basis.2
Papua New Guinea is facing headwinds stemming from low commodity prices and is recovering
from a major drought, which have weighed on economic growth, weakened the external position,
and created fiscal challenges. Foreign exchange (FX) remains in short supply but inflows have
recently picked up somewhat, and the gross foreign reserve position is expected to remain
broadly stable. Revenues fell short of the budget in response to recent commodity price declines,
prompting the Parliament to pass a supplementary budget 2016 that entails expenditure cuts.
Inflation has increased somewhat, partly reflecting the exchange rate depreciation.
After strong economic growth driven by the new liquefied natural gas (LNG) project coming on
stream in 2014-15, the underlying growth is expected to slow down reflecting base effects
following the commencement of LNG production, as well as modest growth in the non-resource
sector. The large LNG exports and import compression caused by the shortage of FX led to a
strong current account surplus, largely offset by financial account outflows consistent with
project development agreements. Inflation is expected to continue edging upwards in the near
term due to the gradual exchange rate depreciation and prices of seasonal agricultural items.
Near-term risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, as fiscal retrenchment may have a
greater impact on the economy than currently expected and the limited availability of FX
continues to constrain imports and economic activity. A further drop in commodity prices would
weaken the external and fiscal positions. In addition, natural disasters, climate change and

weather-related shocks pose continual downside risks. Over the medium term, risks are more
balanced due to the upside potential of new resource sector projects.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2016 Article IV consultation with Papua New Guinea (PNG), Executive
Directors endorsed the staff’s appraisal, as follows:
As a commodity exporter, the PNG economy has been hit hard by the drop in world commodity
prices and a major drought. The authorities have responded to these shocks through fiscal
tightening and a combination of modest exchange rate depreciation and FX sales. Strong
economic growth driven by the start of the PNG LNG project has tailed off amidst weak nonresource sector growth. Inflation has begun to pick up reflecting earlier exchange rate
depreciation and increases in prices of seasonal agricultural items. Prudent macroeconomic
policies are therefore essential for maintaining debt sustainability and safeguarding the external
position.
Additional fiscal adjustment is needed to ensure debt sustainability over the medium term. While
the authorities should be commended for promptly passing a supplementary 2016 budget, further
adjustment may be needed in view of financing constraints. Passage of a prudent 2017 budget
should be commended, which will facilitate continued fiscal consolidation over the medium
term, anchored by the existing 30 percent public debt-to-GDP fiscal anchor. The pace of
adjustment should continue to balance the need to maintain debt sustainability against the costs
of excessive fiscal adjustment in terms of growth and poverty reduction.
Greater revenue mobilization would create fiscal space for expenditures that would help address
PNG’s huge development and social needs. Measures drawn from the National Tax Review
should be adopted going forward. In the near term, efforts should be undertaken to improve tax
compliance. There is considerable scope for improving the fiscal regime for extractive industries.
Government expenditure quality should be improved through public financial management
(PFM) reform. There is much scope for better deploying existing public sector resources towards
effective public service delivery, including on core areas of health and education. Further PFM
reforms should build upon the recently published public expenditure and financial accountability
(PEFA) document and successes in rolling out the new information management system to
encompass cash management issues. The sovereign wealth fund should be put into operation as
soon as possible to help improve transparency and ensure that resource revenue is used in a
manner that is consistent with macroeconomic stabilization and saving for future generations.
Greater exchange rate flexibility and a more efficient and transparent FX allocation mechanism
are urgently needed. Lack of exchange rate flexibility has impeded PNG’s adjustment to sharply
lower world commodity prices, weakened the external and fiscal positions, and reduced the
growth contribution from net exports. The pass-through of more rapid exchange rate depreciation
into inflation would need to be countered through monetary policy tightening but transmission

3
channels are impeded by excessive banking system liquidity, implying the need for measures to
absorb excess liquidity. Staff does not recommend Fund approval of the retention of the
exchange restriction arising from FX prioritization and rationing of FX, of the tax clearance
certificate requirement, and of the multiple currency practices (MCPs), because they are not
temporary and in the absence of a timetable for their elimination.
An acceleration of structural reform is key for private sector development, in support of PNG’s
inclusive growth strategy. The business environment, particularly for agriculture and SMEs,
needs to be strengthened through providing better infrastructure, access to financing, and law and
order.
While staff welcomes the recent progress, more decisive action is needed to improve
macroeconomic statistics. Noteworthy progress has been made to strengthen national accounts
and government finance statistics. Priorities for further reform include balance of payments,
international investment position, and debt data.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 11, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a resource-rich economy, but low commodity
prices and a major drought have weighed on economic growth and created fiscal
challenges. Inflation has increased somewhat, partly reflecting the gradual exchange
rate depreciation. Foreign exchange (FX) is in short supply, although inflows have
recently picked up somewhat and the gross foreign reserve position is expected to
remain broadly stable. Non-resource sector growth remains modest, underscoring the
need for structural reform. In the lead-up to mid-2017 elections, the political situation
has been more fluid than usual.
Risks: Near-term risks are tilted to the downside, as fiscal retrenchment may have a
greater impact on the economy than currently expected and a restrictive FX allocation
mechanism may prove unsustainable. Medium-term risks are more balanced due to the
upside potential of new resource sector projects.
Main policy recommendations:


The authorities recently adopted a prudent 2017 budget that helps lay the
foundation for continued fiscal consolidation and maintenance of debt
sustainability over the medium term. Nevertheless, further efforts are needed to
boost revenues by adopting measures highlighted in the recent National Tax
Review.



Greater exchange rate flexibility, together with a more efficient and transparent FX
market, would help facilitate the adjustment to external shocks while maintaining
adequate foreign reserves, and yield a greater growth contribution from net
exports.



Monetary tightening would moderate the inflationary effects of faster exchange
rate depreciation. The authorities were advised to absorb excess liquidity by active
sterilization, refraining from direct monetary financing of the fiscal deficit, and
improving liquidity management, to strengthen monetary policy transmission
channels.



A renewed focus is needed on creating the conditions for private sector
development, particularly by improving infrastructure and financial access for nonresource sectors such as agriculture.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
A. Context and Background
1.
Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a resource-rich country with significant potential facing
daunting challenges. In addition to mineral, oil, and gas deposits, PNG enjoys abundant fisheries,
forestry, and potential for expanded agriculture and tourism. However, economic growth is impeded
by structural factors that weaken the environment for private sector development, and poverty
remains widespread.1 Public expectations of benefits to the broader economy from resource wealth
have yet to be realized, and there is much still to be gained from effective implementation of
structural reforms to facilitate growth and development. In the lead up to the mid-2017 elections,
the political situation has been more fluid than usual. The Prime Minister recently survived a vote of
no confidence by a margin of 85 to 21.
2.
Strong real GDP growth has been driven by the new gas sector project coming on
stream, while underlying growth is modest and inflation has increased. The large liquefied
natural gas project (PNG LNG) led to high real GDP growth during the project construction phase
through 2014, and again in 2015 as LNG production reached full capacity. The current account
surplus reflects LNG exports and import compression, largely offset by financial account outflows.2
However, underlying (non-resource sector) growth has moderated since 2012, running below trend
(a rough proxy for potential), which staff estimates to be around 3½–4½ percent per annum.
3.
The recent decline in commodity prices and drought in 2015 and early 2016 have
weakened the external and fiscal positions and lowered economic growth. Commodity price
declines have reduced the profitability of resource sector firms, leading to sharply lower tax
revenues. An El Niño-related drought caused widespread food shortages and led to the closure of a
river-linked large mining operation (Ok Tedi) for several months.
4.
The authorities responded to the recent shocks by cutting budgetary expenditures in
supplementary 2015 and 2016 budgets and adopting a prudent 2017 budget. Fiscal spending
and deficits were ramped up in 2012–14, financed through domestic borrowing. Late last year,
expenditures were adjusted downwards sharply through a supplementary budget, spurred by lower
revenue and tightening domestic financing constraints. Revenues fell short of the budget again in
the first half of 2016 in response to recent commodity price declines, prompting the Parliament to
approve a supplementary 2016 budget in late August that offsets roughly half the revenue shortfall
through expenditure cuts. The 2017 budget approved by the parliament in early November

The most recent official poverty rate estimate is 40 percent (from the 2009/10 Household Income and Expenditure
Survey).

2

The current account shifted from deficit during the LNG project construction phase, to surplus following the
commencement of LNG exports. However, FX receipts are largely held offshore (consistent with project development
agreements), so increases in exports have been largely offset by capital outflows.

maintains fiscal discipline by targeting a fiscal deficit broadly consistent with PNG’s Medium Term
Fiscal Strategy (MTFS), as elaborated below.
5.
The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) responded to the terms of trade decline with a
gradual depreciation of the Kina and FX rationing. Concerned about excessive currency
depreciation, it imposed an FX trading margin in June 2014. As a result, the Kina appreciated by
about 17 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar initially, although it has since depreciated by 23½ percent.
Despite significant unmet demand and FX queues, the exchange rate has been largely stable since
May 2016. Consequently, and in contrast to many other commodity exporters, PNG’s real effective
exchange rate (REER) remained broadly unchanged between end-2012 and end-2015. Gross foreign
reserves were US$1.7 billion (3 months of imports) as of October 21, well short of the Fund’s reserve
adequacy metric. Further reserve losses have been avoided thus far by FX rationing. There are,
however, signs that a pick-up in agricultural exports such as coffee, the higher gold price, and the
resumption of operations at the Ok Tedi mine have led to increased FX inflows, while compressed
imports have reduced FX demand. Monetary policy transmission has been impeded by excess
liquidity (Figure 4).
6.
Improved GDP compilation has found 2013 nominal GDP to be around 40 percent
above earlier National Statistics Office (NSO) estimates. The NSO has released revised nominal
GDP estimates for 2006–13, which incorporate improvements in GDP compilation. The new
estimates make better use of taxation and business survey data, resulting in a significantly expanded
view of economic output (Box 1).3 The new GDP estimates imply lower tax, fiscal deficit, and debt
ratios.

B. Outlook and Risks
7.
Near-term economic growth is expected to decline from recent highs, and inflation is
edging upwards. Lower real GDP growth rates in 2016 and 2017 reflect base effects following the
commencement of LNG production, as well as more modest growth in the non-resource sector
(Tables 1–5). The latter will be supported by pre-election and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) related spending in 2017,4 but growth is expected to remain subdued in the absence of
further private sector development.5 Headline inflation is expected to continue edging upwards in
the near term, from 6 percent in 2015 to 7 percent in 2016, due to the gradual exchange rate
depreciation and increases in prices of seasonal agricultural items. Continued moderate real GDP
growth is consistent with a moderate expansion of private sector credit. Banks are expected to
remain highly liquid, sound, and profitable.

3

Final estimates of real GDP levels have yet to be released. In the meantime, staff’s macro framework assumes
unchanged GDP deflators. On this basis, the revised nominal GDP data imply lower real GDP growth.

4

PNG will host APEC in 2018.

5 The historical average for the last 20 years is around 3 percent for total real GDP growth and 4 percent for nonresource real GDP growth. Long-run average working age population growth is nearly 3 percent.

Near-term risks are weighted to the downside, but medium-term risks are more
balanced (Appendix I).


Downside risks include the potential for fiscal consolidation to have a greater impact on the
economy than currently expected. The political cycle could also increase fiscal pressures. In
the external sector, there is a risk that the current FX allocation mechanism will prove
unsustainable, which could lead to more rapid currency depreciation, possibly under
disorderly conditions. A further drop in commodity prices would weaken the external and
fiscal positions. In addition, natural disasters and other weather-related shocks pose
continual downside risks, as demonstrated by the recent drought, although such drought
conditions occur very infrequently.



On the upside, the medium-term outlook could be boosted by additional LNG capacity
expansion. Papua LNG (for which a final investment decision could be taken in 2017, with
construction to commence as early as 2018, although this timetable is subject to delays) and
the PNG LNG extensions, which together are expected to amount to around the same size as
the initial PNG LNG project (which had an approximately US$19 billion investment cost), are
not included in the baseline projections pending final investment decisions. Other resource
sector developments such as the Wafi-Golpu gold mine, pose similar upside risk (Box 2). For
inclusive growth, upside risk derives from the potential for improved structural reform
implementation to boost non-resource sector growth, as well as increased regional trade
integration.



The Debt Sustainability Analysis indicates that the risk of debt distress in PNG remains low,
based on an assessment of public and publicly-guaranteed external debt. In line with the
2015 Article IV consultation, factoring in public domestic and private external debt, the
overall risk of debt distress remains heightened.

POLICIES FOR MACROECONOMIC STABILITY
9.
Against this background, staff’s view is that modifying the macroeconomic policy mix
would facilitate PNG’s adjustment to the large terms of trade shock. The 2017 budget targets a
prudent fiscal deficit that balances the need to bring down the debt ratio against the costs of
excessive fiscal adjustment in terms of growth and poverty reduction, with a view to bringing the
gross government debt-to-GDP ratio below 30 percent by 2021, consistent with the debt ratio
ceiling in the authorities’ Medium Term Fiscal Strategy (MTFS). Going forward, additional revenue
measures should be implemented to lessen the need for expenditure cuts. Greater exchange rate
flexibility would help strengthen the external and fiscal positions, yielding a larger growth
contribution from net exports. More rapid exchange rate adjustment implies a need for monetary
policy tightening to moderate the inflationary effects of the depreciation; in this regard, measures to
strengthen monetary policy transmission channels are needed given the large stock of excess
liquidity. Partially sterilized foreign exchange intervention and large money-financed fiscal deficits
have played central roles in the liquidity build up, while limited central bank independence and weak

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

government cash management have constrained efforts to absorb it. Thus far, excess liquidity has
not led to inflationary pressures because structural impediments constrain private credit growth but
this could change if the economy picks up.

A. Improving Fiscal Stability
Fiscal policy should balance the need to maintain macroeconomic stability against the needs of an
inclusive growth agenda. In the near term, expenditure cuts should offset the revenue shortfall and any
financing gap. While the 2017 budget targets strike an appropriate balance, financing constraints may
force additional expenditure cuts in the remainder of 2016. Over the medium term, improvements in
public financial management (PFM) and elimination of unproductive government expenditures should
also contribute. A comprehensive tax reform package that would enhance efficiency and raise revenues
based on the recent National Tax Review should be another pillar of medium-term adjustment.
10.
In 2015, fiscal pressures stemming from the sharp drop in world commodity prices and
tightening domestic financing constraints necessitated significant expenditure adjustment:


Revenues were K3.0 billion (or 5.0 percent of GDP) below original budget estimates, with
three-quarters of the shortfall due to lower resource revenues. Expenditures were reduced
by K2.7 billion (or 4.6 percent of GDP) relative to the budget. Spending cuts were
concentrated at the national government level, and included large reductions in expenditure
relative to original budget projections for health and education with virtually no reduction in
provincial/district government expenditure. There were reports of payment arrears
(particularly public sector wages).

The asset is a 4.27 percent interest in the PNG LNG project, and was budgeted at K2.5 billion. The sale was delayed
due to disagreements concerning the sale price and a slow vetting process to verify the relevant landowners under
the communal land ownership system. The future timing of this asset sale is unclear.

Prospects for additional domestic budgetary financing are limited as banks and

12.
The 2016 supplementary budget included expenditure cuts and one-off revenue
measures to offset the effects of declining world commodity prices and the weak domestic
economy. Total revenue and grants in 2016 were expected to fall K1.9 billion (or 3.1 percent of
GDP) short of the budget. In response, parliament passed a supplementary budget in August that
included expenditure cuts of K0.9 billion (1.5 percent of GDP) and K1.0 billion in higher revenues
from state-owned enterprise (SOE) and statutory authority dividends and asset sales. The timing of
the asset sales is unclear and the dividends may not be consistent with the financial performance of
the SOEs and statutory authorities. In light of external financing of US$500 million (equivalent to
nearly K1.6 billion) from the syndicated bank loan, it is unlikely that financing could be secured for
the entire projected K3.1 billion deficit, necessitating further expenditure cuts. Such cuts should be
concentrated in provincial/district government spending, which would have the least adverse
growth impact according to a recent ADB study.7 In addition, PFM processes and governance are
weakest for such expenditures. Cutting expenditures further, however, could be difficult in a preelection year.
13.
The 2017 budget targets a fiscal deficit that is consistent with a steadily declining
debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term, built upon broadly realistic revenue projections.
The fiscal consolidation in 2017 will be driven mainly by spending, as revenue measures were limited
primarily to enhanced tax compliance efforts. Revenues and grants are budgeted at K11.5 billion, an
increase of K0.7 billion over the projected 2016 level, declining by 0.7 percentage points of GDP,
with limited revenue measures having been included in the pre-election environment. Expenditures
are budgeted at K13.4 billion, K0.2 billion lower than in the 2016 level. This implies a fiscal deficit of
K1.9 billion (equivalent to 2.8 percent of GDP) and a debt-to-GDP ratio of 33½ percent. The public
debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline over the medium term, to just under 30 percent of GDP in

2021, in line with the legislated limit of 30 percent in the MTFS, which serves as the fiscal anchor.8
The pace of fiscal consolidation should be carefully calibrated to avoid a sharp contraction, implying
a more gradual adjustment than specified in the MTFS. The staff’s view is that the 2017 budget
strikes an appropriate balance between the need to maintain debt sustainability and avoiding an
economic contraction. Over the medium term, the authorities will need to specify the revenue and
expenditure measures they will implement to achieve the targeted reduction in the fiscal deficit. As
elaborated below, the National Tax Review provides a variety of recommendations on the revenue
side but the contribution of each measure would need to be carefully assessed and quantified. On
the expenditure side, also as elaborated below, there appears to be ample scope for increasing
expenditure efficiency, particularly for provincial/district government capital expenditures.

Going forward, a comprehensive revenue reform would help raise revenue collections
and create space for maintaining efficient public spending. The National Tax Review completed
in October 2015—while falling short of providing a quantified list of possible revenue measures—
assessed the changes needed to PNG’s tax and non-tax revenue systems in support of the
government’s sustainable development objectives. Key recommendations included reductions in
personal and corporate income tax rates, broadening the personal and corporate income tax bases
through reduced tax exemptions, improving the return from natural resource extraction, and
increasing consumption tax rates. The Review recommends reduced state equity participation in the
resources sector, to be offset by reforms to the Additional Profit Tax, as well as reforms to other
aspects of the mining and petroleum tax regime. The Tax Review echoes 2013 FAD TA by noting
that the tax arrangements for PNG’s mining and petroleum sectors are very generous compared to
other resource rich countries and do not reflect the maturity of the PNG resource sector. Therefore,
fiscal revenues from the resource sector may not improve significantly unless the government avoids
granting tax holidays and concessions for subsequent resource projects. Finally, modernization of

the Internal Revenue Commission (IRC) and the PNG Customs Service is urgently needed to improve
tax administration and compliance.
15.
The need to strengthen PFM was underscored by the recently published Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment (Box 3). Much scope remains to
better deploy existing public sector resources towards effective public service delivery, including in
core areas such as education, health, and law and order. The revenue shortfalls have provided
impetus for stricter expenditure controls. The authorities have developed a high-level PFM reform
strategy, known as the PEFA Road Map 2015-18, to address the deficiencies of the PFM systems
identified in the PEFA. The first priority is placed on strengthening core PFM functions which will
underpin and provide the platform for more advanced reforms, including the roll out of the new
information management system (IFMIS). The road map is only a first step in the reform strategy,
which should be complemented by fully articulated action plans and present more explicitly the role
of line ministries.
16.
Commendable progress has been made towards the rollout of the IFMIS, while other
PFM reforms should be accelerated. Further steps to improve cash management are urgently
needed to ensure effective use of public financial resources, beginning with tracking inflows from
tax and other sources, and ending with tracking of outflows through payments by line ministries.
Thirty-three agencies that account for 95 percent of the national budget are nearly covered by the
IFMIS. These efforts have been supported by TA from the European Union. Work is underway to
strengthen cash management supported by IMF TA. Passage of an amended PFM Act in August is
another major reform since this brings greater accountability through mandatory audits and
enhanced financial controls to statutory bodies such as the IRC and local level governments as well.
Financial monitoring and performance of SOEs should also be improved. Severe cash management
problems should be urgently addressed, including by implementing a new government banking
framework, drawing upon recent IMF cash management TA recommendations. There are plans to
improve the public procurement act next year.
17.
The sovereign wealth fund (SWF) should be operationalized. With the legislation to
establish the SWF now in place, the SWF should be operationalized as planned in 2016, even though
little is expected to be saved in the near term under the current contribution rules and conditions.
The Treasury Department is working on the establishment of a SWF for PNG, including the
formation of the board, while the BPNG is examining possible models for the setting up of an
administrative secretariat at BPNG. A technical report on the assessment of existing capacity in
managing the assets and possible models for the establishment of the secretariat was completed in
July 2016. BPNG is now working on developing a suitable model for the establishment of the
secretariat.
Authorities’ Views
18.
The government remains firmly committed to existing fiscal anchors. Fiscal discipline
through expenditure cuts last year and this year in supplementary budgets are important steps in
the direction favored by staff. The additional revenue raising and expenditure cutting measures in

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

the 2016 supplementary budget maintains the fiscal deficit in the original budget. The government
aims to achieve the MTFS objective of a balanced budget by 2021. Thus, public debt will remain
sustainable through the medium term. The two new priorities for the 2017 budget are the general
election and APEC preparations. Government will likely be unable to increase national infrastructure
spending next year. It is committed to including a realistic revenue projection in the 2017 budget.
The prospect of issuing a debut sovereign bond has served as a helpful disciplining device for macro
policies. The authorities are assessing and evaluating the National Tax Review recommendations. It
will be difficult to include revenue raising tax policy measures in the 2017 budget given the
upcoming elections but the government will nevertheless consider raising indirect taxes such as ‘sin
taxes’ (excises on alcohol, gambling, and tobacco) and the General Sales Tax (GST). Modernization of
IRC and Customs will continue.

B. Monetary Policy and the Exchange Rate
The current FX allocation mechanism poses risks for sustainability of the external position and could
result in disorderly exchange rate adjustment. Greater exchange rate flexibility and improved market
efficiency and transparency would reduce the cost of adjustment to lower commodity prices and curtail
risks. Steps to strengthen monetary policy effectiveness are urgently needed, as a tighter monetary
policy stance may be called for to manage the pass-through from greater exchange rate depreciation
to inflation.
19.
Since the introduction of a trading margin for FX transactions in mid-2014, exchange
rate adjustment has stalled in real effective terms. While the lower Kina/USD exchange rate has
pushed up import prices, limited access to FX has been equally, if not more, challenging for
businesses than if the Kina had depreciated more quickly. Since mid-2014, the nominal value of the
Kina depreciated by around 5 percent against the Australian dollar, a key trading partner currency,
and in real effective terms has depreciated by only 2 percent. Despite this depreciation, the FX
market has remained short as reflected in the long queues of unmet import payment orders
reported by banks, importers, and business associations, although the tightness of the FX market
has moderated somewhat recently as FX inflows have picked up and imports have been
compressed.
20.
Staff found an additional restriction on current international payments and two
multiple currency practices (MCPs) that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the IMF's Articles
of Agreement (see Informational Annex). In last year's Article IV consultation, staff found that the
tax clearance certificate regime was inconsistent with Article VIII and this restriction remains in place.
This year, the mission found that the authorities had prioritized FX orders related to import
payments, and among these, had given priority to the payments of selected importers and rationed
FX causing shortages, delays, and arrears in current international payments (e.g., those related to
non-priority imports, dividend payments, and consultancy fees). There are also indications from
market participants that the reference rate/mid-rate is not truly market determined. The mission
observed the presence of two MCPs. One MCP arises from the actual deviation of more than
2 percent between the rates used by the BPNG for its FX allocations to authorized FX dealers

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

(AFEDs) and the rates used by the AFEDs in transactions with their clients. In addition, a MCP arises
from potential spread deviations of more than 2 percent between the rates set by the BPNG for its
transactions with the government and embassies, and the exchange rates used by AFEDs in
transactions with their clients.
21.
Faced with an excess demand, BPNG has intervened to supply small amounts of FX
and slow the rate of Kina/USD depreciation. Between 2010 and 2012, FX supply was abundant
due to partially sterilized inflows associated with the PNG LNG project construction phase, and
strong commodity prices. This upswing reversed in 2013, as FDI inflows declined and commodity
prices fell, and the subsequent increase in LNG exports was not matched by increased FX inflows.
BPNG has been providing limited FX amounts to the market, and in 2015 spent nearly US$830
million in FX intervention, which was however insufficient to clear FX demand. By limiting its FX sales
to the market, BPNG has avoided large reserve losses. Despite the FX shortage, the Kina/USD
exchange rate has remained overvalued, which is expected to dissipate assuming a gradual
depreciation into the medium term (Box 4). In addition, FX rationing has increased the risks of
balance of payments problems, and hampered private sector investment by compressing imports,
discouraging non-resource exports, and impeding dividend transfers abroad. Import compression
has lifted the import coverage of foreign reserves. Staff found no evidence of a parallel FX market
given recent actions by the authorities to monitor and close vostro bank accounts that could
previously be used to channel parallel market transactions. However, there are clearly strong
incentives for such a market to develop.
22.
Staff urged BPNG to allow greater flexibility in the Kina/USD exchange rate and
promote market efficiency and transparency. More flexibility in the exchange rate would allow
the exchange rate to act as a shock absorber, which would help facilitate the adjustment to external
shocks while maintaining adequate foreign reserves. It would also promote a greater economic
growth contribution from net exports. Coupled with fiscal adjustment, more exchange rate flexibility
would likely reduce overvaluation over time. At the same time, a return to a more effective auction
system for FX would help allocate reserves more transparently and efficiently.9 An auction system
would need to be underpinned by appropriate macroeconomic policies. Follow-up Fund TA could
be helpful in this regard, including to develop measures that would increase market efficiency and
transparency. Risks of faster depreciation include higher inflation, which should be contained by
tightening liquidity as elaborated below, while balance sheet effects are limited given the low public
external debt, and the bulk of private external debt has a natural hedge in the form of LNG exports.
23.
A tighter monetary policy would likely be needed to manage the pass-through to
inflation if faster currency depreciation were to take place, but monetary policy effectiveness
appears constrained by excess liquidity. BPNG has kept the monetary policy interest rate (the Kina
Facility Rate (KFR)) on hold at 6.25 percent since early 2013, which is roughly zero in real terms.
However, changes in the monetary policy interest rate are not effective due to excess liquidity, as

9

Country Report No. 15/219).

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

explained below. Moreover, bank lending rates are significantly higher in part due to pricing of
credit risk. The liquidity build-up reflects domestic financing of large fiscal deficits and unsterilized
FX purchases.
24.
The current liquidity overhang has not resulted in rapid private credit growth thus far
because of long-standing structural impediments. Although some interest rates are low or
negative in real terms, private credit remains constrained, as near-zero deposit rates are coupled
with significantly higher lending rates, in part due to pricing of credit risk. Structural factors—
including with regard to law and order, contract enforceability, property rights, and land tenure—are
key impediments to private credit growth that will take time to address. In this environment of
constrained private sector credit, the large volume of banking sector liquidity has not fueled
inflation but this could change if the economy picks up.
25.
Staff advised the BPNG to absorb excess liquidity, following which it would be in a
better position to evaluate whether there is a need to raise the current monetary policy
interest rate. BPNG should absorb excess liquidity by active sterilization, stop monetizing the fiscal
deficit, and improve liquidity management, drawing on MCM TA recommendations. Absorption of
excess liquidity is impeded by the existence of public sector trust accounts held in the banking
system rather than with the BPNG. MCM TA recommendations include: (1) moving government
funds from the banks to the BPNG (which would also assist with cash management); and (2) until
this transfer fully takes place, the BPNG should apply an additional reserve requirement to
government funds held in the commercial banks. Reducing fiscal dominance and strengthening the
BPNG’s capacity to absorb excess liquidity through issuing central bank bills would allow the higher
reserve requirements to be phased out.
26.
The BPNG is reviewing its plans to change the specification of the monetary policy
interest rate to improve monetary policy transmission. BPNG announced in March plans to
change the policy interest rate from the overnight KFR, to the 63-day Treasury bill yield. However,
staff noted that without measures to adjust liquidity, this proposed change is unlikely to be effective.
Moreover, any new monetary policy interest rate should be an overnight or other shorter-term rate,
to better reflect the stance of monetary policy, and the use of a Treasury bill yield for this purpose
should be avoided to preserve central bank independence.
Authorities’ Views
27.
The low FX inflows resulting from continued low export commodity prices, and
persistent import demand, contributed to the FX market imbalance and led to the
depreciation of the Kina. In 2014, the BPNG introduced a trading margin of 75 basis points above
and below the daily interbank rate to abolish the parallel market conducted by AFEDs. This measure
reestablished a single market for FX transactions. The Kina has depreciated significantly vis-à-vis the
U.S. dollar since then and is not overvalued in BPNG’s view. There has been an increase in FX inflows
starting in the second quarter of 2016, particularly from the mining and agriculture sectors, though
supply is still low. Together with the intervention by BPNG, the recent increases in inflows assisted in
meeting some of the import orders in the FX market, reduced the size of FX queues reported by

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

banks, and slowed the pace of depreciation of the Kina exchange rate. The supply of FX from these
sources would have been sufficient to clear the outstanding import orders in the spot market.
However, this did not happen because AFEDs used some of the spot inflows for foreign currency
loans (trade finance) and forward contracts, instead of serving the spot market. The BPNG is
discussing ways to improve the functioning of the spot market with authorized dealers. Further
exchange rate depreciation would not stimulate export volumes due to production constraints but
would only feed through into inflation.
28.
The authorities disagreed with staff’s findings of Article VIII breaches. BPNG’s ability to
draw down reserves is curtailed by the need to hold sufficient reserves for government payments
and to maintain an orderly movement in the exchange rate. FX market efficiency is impeded by the
oligopolistic behavior of commercial banks and importers. The BPNG does not impose any
restrictions on commercial banks’ operations in the spot FX market. The interbank/mid-rate for the
Kina is determined by market participants. This market is not hampered by BPNG and is transparent.
While BPNG advises commercial banks concerning the priorities for its FX allocation, it is entirely up
to the banks to decide how to allocate the FX inflows. The shortages and delays in the FX market are
in large part caused by the AFEDs’ rationing of FX and provision of other products such as trade
finance and forward contracts that divert some of the spot inflows. BPNG’s interventions are either
general or targeted, the former being done more often than the latter. In the general interventions,
FX dealers decide on the allocation of the FX themselves, while for the limited targeted intervention,
FX allocation for strategic imports of food, fuel, communications, medicine, and education, are
decided by BPNG and FX dealers implement accordingly. The tax clearance certificate requirement is
not a restriction on FX flows but rather is imposed by the IRC and BPNG only checks compliance; the
certificate is not required for trade transactions.
29.
Inflation outcomes are still considered manageable and therefore BPNG plans to
maintain a neutral monetary policy stance in the coming months. BPNG is mindful of the
upward trend in inflation and will closely monitor developments and may adjust its monetary policy
stance as necessary, although the interest rate channel to curb inflation is weak. Constrained private
credit growth reflects demand and commercial banks’ risk perception. The BPNG announced in
March its intention to have an alternative policy mechanism to address the weak transmission of the
KFR to market interest rates. Persistently high banking system liquidity is contributing to the weak
transmission of the KFR to market interest rates. The mechanism is still being considered in
consultation with stakeholders, both domestic and external. The aim is to have a mechanism that
will be more effective in ensuring that the policy signaling rate transmits to market interest rates.
The authorities have agreed to open new trust accounts at the BPNG, with payments to be made
using the new payment system (the Kina Automated Transfer System (KATS)), while leaving the
existing trust accounts, whose balances have declined over time and are now very low, in place.

C. Financial Sector Issues
The banking system is sound, but access to financial services remains limited and financial inclusion
efforts should continue.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

30.
The highly liquid banking system is sound and profitable, while PNG’s financial sector
is shallow compared to many other middle-income countries in the region. Three large banks
(two Australian and one domestic) play a dominant role in providing credit to the economy. Return
on assets is around 2.0 percent (June 2016) and has averaged a healthy 2.5 percent over the last
10 years, and the capital adequacy ratio is high (32.3 percent in June 2016). The ratio of nonperforming plus past-due loans to total risk-weighted assets is currently around 6 percent (June
2016), above the stable 10-year average of around 5 percent. However, banks only hold around half
of their assets as loans, with the other half held largely as short-term securities and cash, due to
structural (e.g., collateral) constraints as noted above. PNG’s ratio of domestic private credit to GDP
is well below the average for East Asia and Pacific developing countries, Pacific Island Small States,
and other Middle Income Countries.10 Given high banking system liquidity, and notwithstanding the
aforementioned structural constraints on private credit growth, BPNG should ensure that its macrofinancial surveillance is focused on identifying any pockets of credit growth that could create
spillover risks to the economy.
31.
Work is underway on financial inclusion and the payment system. PNG remains among
the most underbanked countries on several indicators (numbers of branches, ATMs, and loan
penetration). However, mobile access has been expanding, and financial inclusion efforts will benefit
from the BPNG’s new KATS system, which represents substantial progress in payment system
development and efficiency. While tiny compared to the banks, credit unions play a critical role in
extending services to rural areas, in some cases being the only financial services provider. New credit
union legislation will help to modernize the sector, but needs supporting regulations and guidelines.
32.
The authorities continue to strengthen the AML/CFT regime and address the risks of
withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships (CBRs). Owing to significant progress in
enhancing the legal and regulatory framework, PNG successfully exited the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF) “gray” list in June 2016. The authorities are committed to ensuring the effectiveness of
the AML/CFT regime through strengthening institutions and enhancing domestic cooperation. In the
context of increased regulatory compliance costs and the FATF listing, some financial institutions
and money remitters in PNG previously experienced withdrawal of CBRs. The volume of CBR
transactions nevertheless increased, which suggests consolidation of CBRs in other financial
institutions. To mitigate the risks of CBR withdrawals, including in light of Bank of South Pacific’s
branch network in the Pacific, the authorities are encouraged to continue enhancing the compliance
of their regulatory and supervisory frameworks with international standards, including for AML/CFT.
Authorities’ Views
33.
The banking system remains sound and stable. Credit growth was slow last year reflecting
the drought and Ok Tedi mine closure. Real estate prices grew modestly, with excess capacity of
office space and rentals having come down since 2012-13, and banks are very cautious. Banks’
exposure to the government though their holdings of government securities is significant,

Guinea—Selected Issues (IMF Country Report No. 15/319).

accounting for nearly one third of their total assets. Commercial bank lending to SOEs has been
minimal, with the exception of one SOE that borrowed from a commercial bank to make a dividend
payment. A new law on credit unions is potentially important for increasing financial inclusion.
34.
After the passage of a suite of laws in July 2015 on AML/CFT, certain measures were
implemented, including the recruitment of key personnel for the Financial Analysis and
Supervision Unit (FASU). In May 2016, the Asia Pacific Group conducted an onsite audit of
progress made on meeting the requirements of the FATF. These led to the delisting of PNG from the
gray list by the FATF in June 2016.

STRUCTURAL REFORMS FOR INCLUSIVE GROWTH
Despite strong ambitions, gains in inclusive growth have been elusive. In the context of multiple
challenges and capacity constraints, priority should be placed on improving conditions for private
sector development and making the most of non-renewable resource sector wealth.
35.
A renewed focus is needed on improving the conditions for private sector
development, particularly in non-resource sector SMEs.11 Infrastructure (including notably access
to affordable electricity and road construction and air and sea transportation to allow perishable
products to reach markets), access to financing by implementing the authorities’ financial inclusion
strategy, and law and order are key elements of the environment for private sector development.
The non-resource private sector is particularly important to inclusive growth, by increasing
economic diversification and expanding employment opportunities, particularly given the capitalintensive nature of resource sector firms. Agriculture in particular is likely to be a source of
unrealized potential, and the government should continue to move forward with the ADB and World
Bank to enhance productivity (i.e., the World Bank’s Productive Partnerships in Agriculture Project
for smallholder coffee and cocoa producers). Tourism also has considerable potential. The current
SME reform process is a positive step but must be carefully tailored. In this regard, restrictions on
foreign investors may adversely affect private sector growth. Measures to increase competition
would also help increase economic efficiency and support inclusive growth.
36.
Non-renewable resource sector wealth can be better leveraged through tax reform
and transparency. State equity participation increases the economy’s exposure to resource sector
developments through additional fiscal risks, even though those risks can be off-balance sheet in
nature and non-transparent. Against this background, tax reform coupled with enhanced
transparency has the potential to improve the resource sector’s ability to contribute to broader
economic growth. Recent publication of PNG’s first Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)
report represented an important step forward for transparency, and highlighted deficiencies in the
resource sector, including reporting by large multinational firms.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

Authorities’ Views
37.
The government will continue to implement structural reforms to boost investments
and broaden the tax base through growth in the non-mineral sectors, especially agriculture.
This is crucial because PNG will continue to face low world commodity prices and other supply
shocks. The government will encourage and support SMEs by providing training on financial literacy
and entrepreneurial skills, and financial inclusion initiatives. Given the constraints on the
government’s capacity to formulate, implement, and monitor such projects, engaging in programs
such as Public-Private Partnerships, including by SOEs, will be encouraged and the necessary
legislation put in place to help ensure more cost effective service delivery.

STATISTICS AND OTHER ISSUES
38.
Sustained effort is being made to improve macroeconomic statistics but further
progress is needed to support transparency and policymaking. In addition to revised nominal
GDP estimates covered by ongoing TA, the government financial statistics framework is being
updated, and PNG is about to report in the Government Financial Statistics Yearbook for the first
time.12 These improvements have resulted from a sustained and committed effort by the authorities,
leveraging IMF TA. Nevertheless, more progress is urgently needed, including among others, in
balance of payments and international investment position data, and in making data publicly
available.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
As a commodity exporter, the PNG economy has been hit hard by the drop in world
commodity prices and a major drought. The authorities have responded to these shocks through
fiscal tightening and a combination of modest exchange rate depreciation and FX sales. Strong
economic growth driven by the start of the PNG LNG project has tailed off amidst weak nonresource sector growth. Inflation has begun to pick up reflecting earlier exchange rate depreciation
and increases in prices of seasonal agricultural items. Prudent macroeconomic policies are therefore
essential for maintaining debt sustainability and safeguarding the external position.
40.
Additional fiscal adjustment is needed to ensure debt sustainability over the medium
term. While the authorities should be commended for promptly passing a supplementary 2016
budget, further adjustment may be needed in view of financing constraints. Passage of a prudent
2017 budget should be commended, which will facilitate continued fiscal consolidation over the
medium term, anchored by the existing 30 percent public debt-to-GDP fiscal anchor. The pace of
adjustment should continue to balance the need to maintain debt sustainability against the costs of
excessive fiscal adjustment in terms of growth and poverty reduction.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

41.
Greater revenue mobilization would create fiscal space for expenditures that would
help address PNG’s huge development and social needs. Measures drawn from the National Tax
Review should be adopted going forward. In the near term, efforts should be undertaken to improve
tax compliance. There is considerable scope for improving the fiscal regime for extractive industries.
42.
Government expenditure quality should be improved through PFM reform. There is
much scope for better deploying existing public sector resources towards effective public service
delivery, including on core areas of health and education. Further PFM reforms should build upon
the recently published PEFA document and successes in rolling out the new information
management system to encompass cash management issues. The SWF should be put into operation
as soon as possible to help improve transparency and ensure that resource revenue is used in a
manner that is consistent with macroeconomic stabilization and saving for future generations.
43.
Greater exchange rate flexibility and a more efficient and transparent FX allocation
mechanism are urgently needed. Lack of exchange rate flexibility has impeded PNG’s adjustment
to sharply lower world commodity prices, weakened the external and fiscal positions, and reduced
the growth contribution from net exports. The pass-through of more rapid exchange rate
depreciation into inflation would need to be countered through monetary policy tightening but
transmission channels are impeded by excessive banking system liquidity, implying the need for
measures to absorb excess liquidity. Staff does not recommend Fund approval of the retention of
the exchange restriction arising from FX prioritization and rationing of FX, of the tax clearance
certificate requirement, and of the MCPs, because they are not temporary and in the absence of a
timetable for their elimination.
44.
An acceleration of structural reform is key for private sector development, in support
of PNG’s inclusive growth strategy. The business environment, particularly for agriculture and
SMEs, needs to be strengthened through providing better infrastructure, access to financing, and
law and order.
45.
While staff welcomes the recent progress, more decisive action is needed to improve
macroeconomic statistics. Noteworthy progress has been made to strengthen national accounts
and government finance statistics. Priorities for further reform include balance of payments,
international investment position, and debt data.
46.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with PNG will be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Papua New Guinea: GDP Revision 2006-13
In March 2016, The National Statistics Office (NSO) of PNG released a new set of
nominal GDP estimates for 2006-13 after an 8-year hiatus. This was a revision to the
nominal GDP for 2006 which was last released in March 2008 while the estimates for 2007-13
were released for the first time. The release includes new data sources as well as a revised
industrial classification and was presented using the System of National Accounts 2008
standards and conventions.
The PNG Standard Industrial Classification (PNGSIC) 2014 has been derived from the
United Nations International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Revision 4. The ISIC
Revision 4 has been modified to reflect the various forms of economic activity in PNG and
replaces the ISIC Revision 3 which formed the basis of the previous GDP releases. The PNGSIC
2014 is more detailed that the PNGSIC 2000 and identifies new industries separately, especially
the service-related industries.
Taxation and business survey data were the major sources for estimating the formal
sector economic activity. Non-identifiable GST sales data and annual income tax returns data
were collected from the Internal Revenue Commission and this was complemented by the
annual Survey of Business Activities and the quarterly Business Liaison Survey to estimate
output in the non-financial business sector given the absence of business register information.
Similarly, output in the mining sector was estimated using Balance of Payments data. The
BPNG was the primary source for data on the financial sector.
Information from the 2009/10 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) was
used to estimate the informal economy and economic activity by the household sector.
Household production was estimated for the 2009/10 reference year and extrapolated using
the consumer price index and population estimates. The informal sector consists of betel nut
production and trade; household lending activity; retailing by street vendors; transport;
household manufacturing; and household construction.
The revised estimates are a significant upward revision from previous released numbers
by NSO and also from IMF staff and PNG Treasury’s estimates for 2007-13. The revised
volume estimates or Real GDP for 2006-13 have not yet been finalized. Table 1 highlights the
magnitude of the revisions.

Box 2. Papua New Guinea: Upcoming Mining and Petroleum Projects
Interest in PNG’s mining and petroleum sector continues despite the current low oil and gas
prices. As of March 2016, there were 123 active exploration licenses, 68 exploration licenses pending
renewal, and 72 new applications for exploration licenses with the Mineral Resources Authority of PNG.
The three major projects that are currently advanced include the Papua LNG project, Nautilus Minerals
Solwara 1 project, and the Wafi-Golpu mine.
Papua LNG Project
The Papua LNG project is PNG’s largest undeveloped gas resource and its second LNG project
based on the Elk-Antelope gas fields in Gulf province. It is a joint venture project consisting of Total
SA, which will also be the operator (40.1 percent), InterOil (36.5 percent) and Oil Search (23 percent), and
expected to produce around 7 million tons annually. The final development concept and the sizing and
capacity of facilities are currently being finalized and construction had been earmarked for 2018.
However, this could now be delayed due to ExxonMobile’s purchase of InterOil and their plans to
sequence this development with the train extensions at the PNG LNG project and other plans to achieve
synergies with the PNG LNG project.
The Papua LNG project remains viable despite the current low global gas prices. The project is
being touted as the lowest cost LNG project compared to other similar green field investments around
the world and has the added benefit of being close to the world’s major LNG markets in Asia. According
to the joint venture, global LNG demand will exceed contracted supply in the 2020s, just when Papua
LNG is expected to deliver its first gas.
Major Mining Projects in Advanced Stages
The Nautilus Solwara 1 project will be the world’s first deep seabed mining project for copper,
gold, zinc, and silver. The Solwara 1 project is located 30 kilometers offshore from New Ireland in the
Bismarck Sea at a depth of 1,600 meters. Currently, construction of the Production Support Vessel and
other specialized equipment is underway and mining was expected to start in the first half of 2018.
However, given recent funding constraints, this could now be delayed.
The Wafi-Golpu project has 4.8 million tons of copper and 11 million ounces of gold. At its peak, it
is expected to produce 150,000 tons of copper and 320,000 ounces of gold annually with an estimated
mine life of 23–30 years. The project is located 65 kilometers from Lae city and is going through various
stages of feasibility studies.
Others
There are several other mining and gas projects that are in various stages of exploration. One of
the major ones is the Frieda River project in East and West Sepik province which is in an advanced
exploration stage. It is PNG’s largest undeveloped copper-gold project and one of the top
10 undeveloped open pit copper mines in the world. Other notable mining projects include the Crater
Mountain Project in Eastern Highlands province (gold), Mt. Kare project between Hela and Enga
provinces (gold and silver), Yandera project in Madang (copper), Hessen Bay (iron sands), Woodlark in
Milne Bay (gold), Mayur Resources projects in Gulf province (copper, gold, coal and iron sands), and Kili
Teke project in Hela province (gold and copper deposits) as well as possible re-development of the now
closed Paguna copper mine in Bougainville. There are also a number of potential gas developments such
as the Stanley condensate stripping project, P’nyang field to support Papua LNG project expansion,
aggregation of a number of gas accumulations in the Western province, and offshore Pandora gas
project.

Box 3. Papua New Guinea: Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment
The first Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment since 2009 was
finalized in August 2015. It includes a set of 30 indicators organized around seven ‘pillars’ or
core dimensions of PFM performance, with the aim of identifying areas where measures are
needed to improve fiscal discipline, resource allocation, and the efficiency of public service
delivery.
Overall performance was mixed. Scores were relatively stronger for pillars related to the
credibility of fiscal strategy and budget, and policy-based planning and budgeting.
Performance for other pillars was weaker, and the authors concluded that there is much scope
for improvement, particularly regarding fiscal accounting/reporting, management and
acquisition of assets and liabilities, transparency and auditing, and budget control and
execution (Figure 1).
The authorities have developed a high-level PFM reform strategy to address the deficiencies of
the PFM systems. First priority is placed on strengthening core PFM functions, including
notably the new information management system roll out. However, several aspects of the
reform strategy need to be strengthened to ensure a successful implementation of the PFM
reform.
Figure 1. Average Performance by Seven PEFA Pillars

Note: Data used for ratings mainly covered 2011, 2012 and 2013. Average performance of
pillars: indicator score "A" is equal to 3 and score "D" equal to 0. The step between A and
D scores is 0.5. Source: PEFA Report



Credibility of the fiscal strategy and budget was satisfactory, as net deviations from the
budget were small, though expenditure composition varied considerably. Recurrent
spending (e.g., wages, goods and services, etc.) tended to be higher than budgeted due to
weak expenditure controls and data, while the development budget tended to be lower,
offsetting the former.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

Box 3. Papua New Guinea: Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment
(concluded)


Policy-based planning and budgeting was orderly and well understood, and progress
has been made in embedding the medium-term dimension into fiscal planning. However,
expenditure and ceilings for agencies were only applied one year into the future, and did
not cover half of the budget representing capital/development expenditure.



The comprehensiveness and transparency of the budget was limited. First, the
presentation could be more analytical and open to external scrutiny and policy
accountability. But more importantly, the extent of unreported government operations
appears to be large.



Predictability and control in budget execution is weak. Transfers related to the
government’s main operational account are poorly accounted for and bank reconciliations
are often delayed. Cash flow forecasts are prepared, but information provided to executing
departments is not reliable, and rules for reallocation are not always respected. Payroll
controls are weak and compromised by the decentralization of responsibility to
departments and provinces/districts.



External scrutiny and audit performance is weak, and there is little evidence that
recommendations are followed up systematically, reflecting the absence of effective
accountability mechanisms, legal recourse to impose penalties on non-complying officials,
and related concerns.



Asset and liability management is weak, with numerous statutory bodies fulfilling a
range of commercial, social and regulatory functions, often with long delays in reporting.
Preparation of capital budgets appeared fragmented, and few departments undertake
rigorous economic analyses of investment projects. The legal basis for borrowing and
issuing guarantees was deemed unclear, fragmented, and contradictory.



Accounting, recording, and reporting are hampered by unreliable records, bank
reconciliations are not carried out in a timely manner, and the coverage and classification
of data do not allow direct comparisons with the original budget. No recognized
accounting standards are used to prepare public financial statements, which are only
submitted for audit 15-16 months after the end of the year (3-6 months is standard).

Box 4. Papua New Guinea: External Assessment
PNG’s external position is moderately weaker than implied by fundamentals and desirable policies,
given its weak gross foreign reserve position and overvalued real effective exchange rate.
PNG’s real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated in 2015, as LNG production reached
full capacity and LNG exports gained momentum. It has been depreciating in 2016, albeit very
modestly, reflecting the persistent imbalance in the FX market. Notwithstanding the current
depreciation of the Kina, excess demand for FX persists due to low foreign currency inflows.
Restricted access to FX has contributed to a compression of imports.
The extended External Balance Assessment (EBA) methodology, EBA-lite tool, provides
mixed results. Although the REER is likely overvalued if we adjust for LNG production and take
into account FX rationing, the exchange rate misalignment is expected to disappear eventually as
ongoing depreciation continues gradually into the medium term. The EBA-lite current account
balance (CAB) analysis implies a current account norm of -2.7 percent of GDP, compared to an
estimated outcome of 10.9 percent of GDP, suggesting that the REER is undervalued by around
46 percent. However, the 2015 current account surplus should be viewed in conjunction with the
financial account outflows associated with the increase in nonresident bank balances of foreign
LNG project owners. If we exclude LNG exports, the CAB is estimated at -0.4 percent of GDP, and
the EBA-lite CAB analysis suggests that the REER is undervalued by only 10.9 percent. In any case, a
fundamental issue with the EBA-lite methodology is that it does not incorporate the effects of FX
rationing. The market exchange rate does not reflect the premium imposed by FX rationing on
domestic buyers. The EBA-lite REER index model, on the other hand, points to overvaluation of
about 29 percent, consistent with the limited exchange rate adjustment thus far to the large terms
of trade shock.
Despite improvements in the current account, the reserves to import ratio is below the level
implied by the reserve adequacy metric approach.1 Although the metric approach suggests that
reserves should strengthen reflecting the increase in LNG exports starting in 2014, FX receipts are
mostly held offshore consistent with project development agreements, so the net FX inflow from
the LNG exports is limited. Also, declines in commodity prices have led to lower reserve levels.

Source: IMF staff estimates and projections.

Because of the limitation of data, central government’s data is used instead of general government data. The
assessment here is based on staff’s judgement because there is a wide range of adequate levels of reserves,
depending on methods used.

Potential Impact

Given PNG’s poor

impact could be significant.

Staff Advice on Policy
Response
Allow the kina to depreciate to
boost non-resource exports;
accelerate structural reforms to
improve competitiveness;
allow automatic stabilizers to
work if financing constraints
permit.
Tighten the fiscal position
further to reduce financing
needs.

Upgrade regulatory and
supervisory frameworks to
enhance compliance with
international standards,
especially in the areas of
AML/CFT and tax transparency.
Avoid deficit financing by the
central bank, and focus
spending cuts on low impact
areas. Improve cash
management to ensure
effective utilization of existing
financial resources.
Resist monetary
accommodation of a fiscal
expansion, focusing any
increased spending on
improving security, but with
greater fiscal transparency.
Ensure fiscal buffers are
adequate to support affected
groups and spend more on
preparation and prevention;
encourage take-up of disaster
insurance.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of
the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability
between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source
of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may
interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix II. Authorities’ Responses to Fund Advice
Fund Recommendation

Policy Actions

Monetary, Financial and Exchange Rate Policies

 Remove excess liquidity to improve
monetary policy effectiveness and reduce
downside pressure on the kina exchange
rate.

The increased issuance of government securities and the
BPNG’s intervention in FX market assisted in diffusing
some of the excess liquidity. While the CRR has kept at 10
percent since September 2014, the BPNG considers
options to tighten monetary policy if necessary.

 Allow greater exchange rate flexibility to
clear the FX market.

Although excess demand for foreign currency has
persisted, the official interbank exchange rate has been
almost unchanged since May 2016 because the BPNG
thinks that a greater exchange rate depreciation would
only be inflationary.

 Continue to implement AML/CFT
legislation.

The authorities have established the legal and regulatory
framework to meet a high-level political commitment to
address AML/CFT regulatory and operational deficiencies.
In recognition of significant progress made in improving
its AML/CFT regime, PNG is no longer subject to the
FATF’s monitoring since June 2016.

Fiscal Policy

 Adopt a fiscal policy stance consistent with
putting public debt in line with the
government’s targets and ensuring debt
sustainability.

The authorities passed the 2017 budget to address the
revenue shortfalls and cut expenditures in November
2016. This brings the public debt to GDP ratio below the
fiscal anchor in the Fiscal Responsibility Act over the
medium term.

 Improve the quality of spending.
Strengthen revenue collection through
rationalizing tax exemptions and
concessions and other measures
recommended by the Tax Review
Committee.

The budget seeks to identify expenditure-saving
measures from overseas travel and recruitment activities
etc., whereas it also seeks to improve outcomes by
controlling capital expenditures through improved
project approval, monitoring and evaluation activities.
Only minor amendments have done in the tax system in
2016, and the authorities plan to begin implementing tax
reforms based on National Tax Review in the 2017
budget. The tax reforms include extending the tax base
via compliance, increasing the taxable component of
employer provided housing benefit, imposing additional
profits tax to new mining and petroleum projects,
uplifting exemption from interest withholding tax for
foreign lenders lending to resource companies, and
raising some tax rates.

 Safeguard the integrity of the SWF for it to
play a key role in managing PNG’s resource
revenues.

The authorities are formalizing the establishment of the
SWF’s administrative secretariat at BPNG.

Policy Actions

Structural Reform

 Continue investments in health and
education and improve infrastructure and
law and order for the better business
environment. Strengthen the SME sector
by financial inclusion.

The 2017 budget supports key policy priorities such as
free education for children, free primary healthcare,
transport infrastructure and SMEs. It safeguards
expenditure impacting low-skilled jobs and development
enablers such as health, education, key infrastructure,
agriculture, tourism and law and order.

 Strengthen PFM by implementing further
reforms identified in the PEFA assessment
and SOE reform to enhance transparency
and governance.

The IFMIS was rolled out and an amended PFM act was
passed in August 2016. The 2016 budget promoted more
efficient SOEs through a dividend policy that requires
them to operate in accordance with commercial
principles.

Statistics

 Improve macroeconomic statistics and
move forward with the publication of new
GDP estimates.

Safeguards Assessments
Under the Fund's Safeguards Assessments policy, the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) was subject
to a transitional assessment based on its Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund, which was approved
in March 2000 and expired in September 2001. The transitional assessment was completed on
May 4, 2001 and recommendations were made to alleviate identified weaknesses. Currently, the
BPNG is not subject to the Safeguards Assessments policy.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
Papua New Guinea’s de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. From April 2014, the Kina has
reduced its volatility and followed a trend within a 2 percent band against the U.S. dollar.
Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement,
effective April 11, 2014. Papua New Guinea maintains the following exchange restrictions subject to
IMF approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement arising from: (i) the
requirement to obtain a tax clearance certificate evidencing the payment of all taxes prior to making
payments or transfers for certain current international transactions; and (ii) the rationing of FX and its
allocation by BPNG to certain priority items, which results in undue delays and arrears in current
international payments. Papua New Guinea also maintains the following multiple currency practices
(MCPs) subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 3: (i) a MCP arising from the spread of
more than 2 percent between the rates set by BPNG for its FX allocations to authorized FX dealers
(AFEDs), and the rates used by AFEDs in transactions with their clients; and (ii) an MCP arising from
the potential spread deviation of more than 2 percent between the rates set by BPNG for its FX
transactions with the government and embassies, and the rates used by AFEDs in transactions with
their clients.
Article IV Consultations
The 2015 Article IV consultation discussions were held during August 9-21, 2015. It was concluded by
the Executive Board on October 30, 2015 (IMF Country Report No. 15/318). Papua New Guinea is on
the standard 12–month consultation cycle.
TA from Headquarters
FAD: A joint FAD/PFTAC mission in March 2000 assisted the authorities in preparing a Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes Fiscal Transparency Module, published in October 2000. A
mission in December 2000 provided advice on the reconciliation of large and volatile differences in
fiscal reporting based on information provided by the Treasury Department and information
reported by the Bank of Papua New Guinea. A mission in February 2002 assessed progress in
improving fiscal transparency. A joint FAD/PFTAC mission visited PNG to provide advice on the
sovereign wealth fund management in May 2011. A mission in March 2013 provided advice on
reform of the extractive industries fiscal regime. A mission in October 2015 provided advice on Land
and Property Tax and Non-Tax Revenue Reforms.
LEG: A mission in November 2005 provided advice on the drafting of a tax administration law. A
mission in July 2006 provided a comprehensive program of assistance in the development of the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

AML/CFT regime, including legislative drafting and capacity building. A mission in AugustSeptember 2007 assisted the authorities in finalizing the terms of the Revenue Administration Bill.
MFD/MCM: TA through peripatetic visits was delivered on bank regulation and supervision (2001,
February–March 2007, July–August 2009, and February 2010), medium-term monetary policy
formulation (October 2004 and September 2005), reserve management (June 2006, September 2007,

March 2015), macroprudential oversight and financial stability (September 2012), and the sovereign
wealth fund (July 2013).
STA: A multisector statistics mission occurred in September 2006 followed by a high-level STA visit
in December 2007, in collaboration with the ABS. TA was provided on monetary and financial
statistics (April 2005, May 2006, April 2008, November 2009 May 2010, and February 2013); balance
of payments and the international investment position (June 2008, November 2009, May-June 2013,
February 2014, and July 2015); government finance statistics (2012, May and October 2013, AprilMay and October 2014, April 2015, September 2015, March 2016); and GDDS metadata (January
2012). A joint mission with the ABS discussed statistical capacity building and in particular reform of
the National Statistical Office in July-August 2014.
Resident Representative
The Regional Resident Representative Office for Pacific Island Countries based in Suva, Fiji was
opened on September 13, 2010 and the office covers Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia,
Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Mr. Tubagus

RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTRE
(As of July 2016)
The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji, is a regional TA institution
operated by the IMF with financial support of the Asian Development Bank, Australia, Korea, the
European Union, and New Zealand. The Center’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for
effective economic and financial management that can be sustained at the national level. Member
countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru,
Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and
Vanuatu.

A. Public Financial Management
The PFTAC assisted in the preparation of a ROSC, which was published in October 2000. The PFTAC
PFM Advisor has participated in occasional FAD technical assistance missions, and an attachment of
one PNG official to PFTAC was completed in April 2007. PNG participated, with four officials, in the
U.S. Treasury study visit in September 2008. In May 2011, the PFTAC macroeconomic advisor
participated in an FAD mission on advising PNG on the SWF. In July 2013, a PFTAC PFM Advisor
visited PNG at the request of the Treasury Minister to review the budget preparation process, and
discuss with authorities plans for training in the PEFA methodology. In May-June 2014, PFTAC
provided information, communication, and technology (ICT) assessment mission and recommended
a comprehensive reform strategy to better support of operation of the Department of Finance.
In 2014, however, PFTAC PFM assistance expanded greatly. Starting early in 2014, and continuing
through early 2015, PFTAC began training PNG staff to carry out a PEFA Self-Assessment.
Subsequently, in March 2015, PFTAC and a team from FAD conducted an external PEFA assessment
which corroborated most of the findings of the self-assessment. PFTAC and FAD then worked with
Department of Finance officials to develop a PFM Reform Roadmap to address major deficiencies
identified by the PEFA Assessment.
PFTAC’s largest PFM project during the past two years has been assisting PNG in overcoming
roadblocks to the implementation of its Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) and
recommending steps needed to speed up ministry/agency connection to the new system that PNG
decided to purchase in 2005. By early 2014, only three ministries—Finance, Treasury, and Planning—
were connected to the system.
In a series of missions beginning in May 2014, PFTAC’s expert on the PNG project examined a number
of aspects of the implementation effort including highly technical matters, levels of cooperation from
other ministries, IFMS project organizational issues, staffing, and local opportunities for out-sourcing
some aspects of the IFMS support operations. Most of the PFTAC Advisor's recommendations were

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

accepted and, later in 2014, PNG’s Department of Finance started the process of reforming its ICT
delivery operations in order to accelerate the deployment of the IFMS system.
As of the end of July 2016, the TA had enabled expansion of the system to 30 central government
departments (compared to the 3 connected when assistance commenced last year), with the
remaining 30 due to be implemented by the end of 2016, depending on resource availability. The IFMS
team has begun to plan their first implementation in a provincial and district environment, targeting
East New Britain province and its districts as its first pilot. IFMS is currently used on a regular basis by
over 2,000 users across government. PNG's September 2015 PFM Reform Roadmap, prepared with
assistance from PFTAC, placed a high priority on completing the IFMS roll-out recognizing that many
accounting, financial management, and reporting weaknesses could be overcome with full
implementation of the system. The Roadmap's tight prioritization of objectives under the leadership
of Finance Secretary Dr. Ken Ngangan played a significant role in expanded commitments from DFAT
and the EU to provide more TA support to PNG’s Department of Finance to ensure a sustainable rollout and business process reform.
In addition, during 2015 PFTAC supported short-term missions to review cash management,
reconciliation, and reporting processes.

B. Tax Administration and Policy
PFTAC has not supported the Internal Revenue Commission (IRC) in revenue administration as they
are strongly supported by two Australian Programs; (1) the Strongim Gavman Program (SGP) which is
used to engage senior ATO advisors to the IRC; and (2) the Economic Public Sector Program (EPSP)
which provides support for strategic, governance, integrity matters and IT support.
A new IT system continues to be rolled out which includes new applications for withholding taxes,
Goods and Services Tax and Corporate Income Tax. Over 120,000 transactions on average per month
are currently being processed through the new system, with the next phase of development targeted
at the introduction of applications to support modern risk management and case management for
both audit and collection of tax arrears. Additional plans are in place to introduce e-filing, epayment, and a self-service portal that taxpayers can access to obtain information on the status of
their tax accounts.
A tax review diagnostic conducted by an accounting firm has provided numerous recommendations
that are currently under discussion. One recommendation—to modernize taxpayer registration by
issuing a Taxpayer Identification number—is already being implemented.
Peripheral modules will follow over the next twelve months, with project completion by 2017.

C. Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision.
There is no current PFTAC involvement in this area. In September 2014, BPNG hosted the annual
meeting of the Association of Financial Supervisors of Pacific Countries, for which PFTAC is the

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

secretariat. In March 2007, PFTAC funded an attachment for two supervisors from BPNG to assist the
Cook Islands’ supervisory authority to undertake an on-site examination of a domestic bank. In 2008,
PFTAC funded an attachment of one supervisor to assist the Reserve Bank of Fiji to undertake an onsite examination of a local branch of a PNG-based bank. PFTAC has not received any subsequent
request for assistance from the BPNG.

D. Economic and Financial Statistics
In February 2006, an advisor briefly assessed BOP compilation with a view to improving its quality,
and to assessing progress with the implementation of recommendations made by previous missions.
A multi-sector statistics mission in September 2006 assessed the statistical systems (BOP, national
accounts, prices statistics, government finance statistics, and monetary statistics), with the PFTAC
advisor assessing the national accounts and providing overall coordination. In 2008 and 2009, the
advisor undertook BOP statistics missions to review statistical prerequisites, progress in improving
compilation methods and source data, as well as to assist BPNG statistics staff in assessing the
feasibility of electronic data collection.
Since 2013, PFTAC has conducted a series of six TA missions to assist the National Statistical Office
(NSO), BPNG, and Department of Treasury with improving national accounts statistics. PFTAC has
increasingly focused its TA on improving capacities at the NSO in the broader context of the NSO
reform process initiated by the authorities in 2014. Support has been provided in close collaboration
with the ABS, which has provided statistical leadership and management advice as well as TA on data
collection issues including business and household surveys with the secondment of two ABS staff to
the PNG NSO since July 2015 and until June 2016. PNG NSO staff have also benefited from attending
three annual sub-regional statistics workshops since 2013, centered in particular around estimating
GDP by expenditure, the use of household income and expenditure surveys, and their linkage to
consumer price indices.

E. Macroeconomic Analysis
Following a request by the BPNG for assistance in building up financial programming capacity, the
development of a PNG-specific financial programming framework started in 2011. Training in the use
and updating of the framework was provided to staffs of both BPNG and the Department of
Treasury. Staff from both institutions also participated in training on financial programming
techniques provided jointly by PFTAC and the Singapore Regional Training Institute during a
December 2012 regional workshop in Fiji. A separate work program with the Department of Treasury
and BPNG developed in collaboration with the APD country team and the IMF’s Research
Department modeling tools for exploring the macroeconomic impact of the surge in natural resource
revenues from the LNG project. Further development of the financial programming framework
started in 2014 because the existing framework was too detailed and resource-intensive to update,
given day-to-day monitoring and projection needs. More recently work has been undertaken to
improve the BPNG’s inflation forecasting methodology following major revisions to the consumer
price index (CPI) by the NSO in June 2014.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of October 12, 2016)
PNG joined the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1971. In line with the government’s development
agenda and ADB’s Strategy 2020 midterm review priorities, the 2016 – 2018 Country Partnership
Strategy, focuses on supporting rural populations by enhancing transport infrastructure, delivering
health services, and reengaging in water and other urban infrastructure and services. The strategy was
developed in close consultation with the government and other stakeholders, and is aligned with the
government’s Development Strategic Plan, 2010–2030 and National Strategy for Responsible
Sustainable Development, 2014–2030. This focus is consistent with the Midterm Review of Strategy
2020 of the ADB.
ADB will continue to seek opportunities for cofinancing and to produce knowledge products that
inform and influence national policy debates and support country operations. ADB support for private
sector development—through state-owned enterprise reform—will lower business transaction costs,
thereby helping to expand small and medium-sized enterprises and create jobs in the formal economy.
ADB operations will focus on supporting climate proofing infrastructure and increasing the climate
resilience of vulnerable sectors. ADB will mainstream gender in all general intervention projects.
The country operations business plan, 2017–2019 is the second under the country partnership strategy
(CPS) 2016–2020 for PNG. The indicative lending program for 2017–2019 amounts to $1,363.0 million,
comprising of $129.0 million in Concessional Ordinary Capital Resources lending (COL) and $1,234.0
million in Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR). The indicative nonlending program amounts to $5.35
million, which includes project preparatory TA. Additionally, the program includes cofinancing of $300
million.
ADB will increase its total financing for development projects (lending, nonlending, and cofinancing)
by 125 percent, from $743.7 million (2016–2018) to $1,668.4 million (2017–2019). The current
programming period includes new infrastructure development projects, particularly in the transport
sector, that will help increase connectivity and the delivery of basic services to the poorest and most
remote parts of the country. The proposed transport projects will help create opportunities for inclusive
economic growth, improve the delivery of basic services, increase regional connectivity with the rest
of Asia, and build resilience to climate change.
PNG was able to withstand the impact of the global financial crisis in 2008; however, the recent global
commodities downturn has worsened its fiscal position. PNG saw a sharp fall in public revenue (by 21
percent in 2015), necessitating a large fiscal adjustment. The economy remains exposed to global
economic volatility. ADB will provide TA to strengthen the government’s initiative to achieve calibrated
fiscal consolidation, undertake expenditure reform, and strengthen PFM. At the request of the
government, ADB has included a standby policy-based lending option for 2017 to safeguard critical
social outlays. ADB will work closely with Australia, the European Union, the International Money Fund,
the World Bank, and other donor partners to develop a coordinated response to the macroeconomic
crisis and increase the country’s resilience to external shocks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

ADB will increase partnerships with subnational provincial governments to implement infrastructure
projects. Provincial governments have emerged as important stakeholders. The Department of
Planning and ADB hosted an event on May 18, 2016, in Madang, PNG, to share knowledge concerning
infrastructure projects with provincial governors and administrators. The event built upon ADB’s study
of partnering with subnational governments, and the outcome of the event provided a way forward
for deepening the partnership.
Overall project implementation performance remains satisfactory. In 2015, contract awards amounted
to $122 million and disbursements totaled $136 million. Total disbursements in 2015 were 115 percent
of projected disbursements. However, maintaining and improving portfolio performance requires
continued capacity building of counterpart agencies responsible for project implementation.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
PAPUA NEW GUINEA — STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of September, 2016
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most affected
areas are: national accounts, fiscal accounts, and balance of payments.
National Accounts: The accuracy and reliability of the statistics are affected by inadequate source data
and lagged release dates. The most recent official national accounts statistics were published by the
NSO in May 2016, at which time nominal GDP estimates for 2006–2013 were released. These estimates
were compiled using the System of National Accounts 2008 and were released after an eight-year
hiatus. Major improvements in methodology as well as inclusion of new sectors were reflected in this
new data. Real GDP estimates for 2006–2013 are still being verified and checked for accuracy and
consistency. NSO also in the process of revising the 2013 preliminary estimates as well as producing
2014 national account statistics which are earmarked for release in December 2016. Reforming the NSO
is underway with support from the ABS and PFTAC. Source data remain a challenge, with significant
gaps in extractive and financial industries data. While CPI weights are from 2010 HIES, these data are
not useable for expenditure estimates of GDP.
Price Statistics: The NSO currently compiles an unpublished quarterly wholesale price index (WPI) and
a quarterly CPI. In May 2014, the NSO began to publish a new CPI series based on data from the 2009–
2010 Household Income Expenditure Survey, ending a 35-year period during which the CPI used a
consumption basket from the late 1970s.
Government Finance Statistics (GFS): GFS data were reported to STA in 2016 after a 14-year absence.
Data suffers from insufficient coverage and timeliness. Central government tax revenue, nontax revenue,
and public expenditure data are deficient. Development budget expenditures and the utilization of grants
and project loans are recorded with long lags, and few records on the use of trust accounts are available.
Tax revenues collected by authorities (extra-budgetary units) are generally not reflected in the central
government’s financial information. While interest payment records are accurate, there are timing issues
regarding the recording of interest on discounted securities. These weaknesses contribute to discrepancies
in domestic financing between estimates from monetary and debt data and those derived from fiscal
records. Papua New Guinea officials have benefitted from STA GFS technical assistance since June 2012 and
as a result, volume 1 of the 2016 national budget was presented in the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014) format. The authorities also prepared an accompanying 5-year historical time
series of GFS data. Further work is required to enhance both institutional and instrument coverage, as well
as presenting the entire budget on a GFSM 2014 basis. For the migration, the authorities continue to
participate in the Japan Administered Account (JSA)-funded three-year regional GFS capacity-building
project since 2013.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary data are now being produced and reported to STA on a
regular basis. Progress has been achieved by the BPNG in many areas of the collection, compilation, and
dissemination of monetary and financial statistics (MFS), leading to the introduction of the standardized
report form (SRF) for the central bank, other depository corporations (ODCs), and the other financial
corporations (OFCs). A 2013 TA mission introduced general insurance companies into the institutional
coverage of OFCs and an improved SRF for OFCs. Depository Corporations Survey and Survey of OFCs both
have data coverage issues. Most of the monetary statistics published in International Financial Statistics
(IFS) are currently aligned with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Financial sector surveillance: In the area of financial soundness indicators (FSIs), the BPNG has compiled
selected FSIs for deposit takers to support the financial sector assessment. PNG is participating in a threeyear (FY2014–FY2016) TA project on FSIs for selected AFR and APD countries funded by the Government of
Japan and is expected to submit FSI data and metadata to STA for posting on the IMF’s FSI website.
Currently, data is still being compiled and has not been reported yet.
External Sector Statistics: Annual balance of payments data are derived from the International
Transactions Reporting System (ITRS), which is not tightly monitored despite the BPNG reporting
requirements. There are marked differences between the official data on exports and imports of goods and
those reported by trading partners. The financial accounts data are of poor quality because of major
deficiencies in data collection, especially in the area of private external debt and foreign direct investment.
Quarterly data are also published by the BPNG. PNG has been one of the beneficiaries of the JSA Project
on the improvement of external sector statistics (ESS). Under this project, TA missions were provided to
improve BOP and international investment position (IIP) statistics in May-June 2013, February 2014 and July
2015 These missions made recommendations to improve the ESS compilation framework. BPNG is largely
under-equipped in terms of its capacity and collection framework vis-à-vis the volumes and nature of
transactions and positions with nonresidents. Little progress has been made regarding the implementation
of the missions’ recommendations; and overall improvements in the quality of ESS have been very modest.
II. Data Standards and Quality
PNG began to participate in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) in 2012.
III. Reporting to STA
PNG last reported GFS for publication in Government Finance Statistics Yearbook and IFS for 2016, covering
only the budgetary central government. Monetary data are reported to STA for publication in IFS on a
regular monthly basis. BOP data for 2010 were reported to STA for publication in Balance of Payments
Yearbook and IFS. National accounts data for 2006-13 were reported to STA for publication in IFS.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By
Odd Per Brekk and Zeine
Zeidane (IMF) and John
Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the International Development Association (IDA)1

The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that the risk of debt distress in Papua
New Guinea (PNG) remains low, based on an assessment of public and publiclyguaranteed (PPG) external debt.2 In line with the DSA for the 2015 Article IV consultation,
factoring in public domestic and private external debt, the overall risk of debt distress
remains heightened. A failure to consolidate the fiscal position – including through
obtaining more cost-effective and longer-term financing – would worsen debt dynamics.

1
This DSA was prepared jointly with the World Bank, in accordance with the Debt Sustainability Framework for
low-income countries approved by the Executive Boards of the IMF and the IDA.
2
Papua New Guinea is rated as a weak performer for its policies and institutions for the purposes of the IMFWorld Bank low-income country DSA framework.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

BACKGROUND
1.
Although PNG’s public and external debt burdens remain low relative to peer
countries and the risk of debt distress is low, risks remain. The ratio of central government debt
to GDP remains low, at 30 percent as of end-2015. However, liquidity risks remain high. In addition,
central government debt has more than doubled between 2012 and 2015, and interest payments
have also doubled over the same period (expected to triple in 2016) – such that debt servicing costs
now exceed national spending on either education or health. At the same time, the expected
refinancing of a large public sector loan has added to the liquidity risk associated with external debt,
while central government domestic financing has become increasingly shorter-term.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
2.
Over the medium term, PNG’s growth prospects and current account developments
will be heavily influenced by its extractive sector and the LNG price outlook. Box 1 summarizes
the medium-term macroeconomic framework underlying this DSA update. The longer term growth
outlook has been revised up slightly by 0.4 percent, following the incorporation of revised historical
data, which has shifted GDP composition. Despite this, the sectoral growth outlook has remained
largely unchanged. The current account surplus, which was established in 2014 with the
commencement of LNG exports, increased in 2015 due to LNG export growth and strong import
compression. The current account surplus is projected to decline, as imports recover. The possibility
of significant capacity expansion in the resource sector poses a key upside risk to the baseline
outlook for the economy.

EXTERNAL DSA
3.
Under the baseline scenario, all PPG external debt ratios stay well below the indicative
thresholds. The baseline scenario is heavily affected by a reported new US$500 million loan from a
commercial bank, taken in 2016.3 However, it is only in the historical scenario that large breaches
occur. As has been the case in past DSAs, the historical shock scenario shows large threshold
breaches. However, in this case the historical scenario is not considered indicative of future risks, as
the 10-year averages used for the underlying macroeconomic assumptions encompass the
construction phase for PNG LNG and an extremely elevated current account deficit. High levels of
private external debt could potentially create balance of payments pressures by competing with the
public sector for foreign exchange. Nevertheless, such risks are mitigated by the fact that a large
part of the loans are adequately backed by expected cash flows from the LNG project.

3 The loan, reportedly from Credit Suisse, is assumed to have a 5-year term at 7 percent. At present, we assume that
the loan is continually refinanced through the projection period.

PUBLIC DSA
4.
Although public debt dynamics for PNG remain stable, there are risks to the outlook.
Similar to last year’s DSA, the public debt dynamics are stable and the public debt burden is
expected to decline continuously over the projection period. However, liquidity risks are masked as
the debt service-to-revenue ratio is calculated using medium-long term amortization projections.
For example, Treasury bills (less than 1 year to maturity) increased as a share of total domestic
financing, from 45 percent in 2012, to 48 percent in 2015. Using total PPG amortization, and
including amortization of Treasury bills, would raise the debt service-to-revenue ratio to over 100
percent. In addition, the budget remains exposed to the unfunded superannuation liabilities
estimated at 3½ percent of 2016 GDP.

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
5.
The authorities agreed with the DSA findings, noting that the current risk of debt
distress is low, but fiscal consolidation is crucial for debt sustainability. The authorities
acknowledged that further fiscal restraint is needed to keep the debt on a downward path. They also
recognized the importance of more comprehensive data on debt and other liabilities, in particular,
off-budget and public enterprise debt, in assessing PNG’s overall debt burden.

CONCLUSION
6.
PNG’s risk of external debt distress remains low, but the overall risk of public debt
distress is heightened. As was the case in the 2015 DSA, the heightened risk of overall public debt
distress reflects the increased stock of domestic debt with a higher share of short-term Treasury bills
– even though the stock remains low relative to peers. External debt has also become shorter-term
and less concessionary, due to a new US$500 million commercial bank loan.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA Update
Compared to the 2015 DSA, the macroeconomic assumptions underpinning this DSA are largely
unchanged in terms of the sectoral growth outlook – although a slight upward revision occurred in
aggregate growth, due to the effects of revised historical data on GDP component shares. The
current account is also projected to be in surplus for much longer, due to the downward revision in
imports. A more conservative view is taken of the long-term fiscal balance.

4



Real GDP growth is projected to average 3.4 percent in the medium/long run, a slight
increase above the 3 percent long term average growth rate used for the 2015 DSA.



Inflation is expected to peak at 7.5 percent in 2017, before falling back to 6 percent in the
medium/long term. This is an increase of 1 percent above the previous medium/long term
projection, and reflects the baseline projection of continued nominal depreciation.



The current account (including grants) turned to surplus in 2014 due to the commencement
of LNG exports and import compression. However, the current account is expected to decline
in the near term, reflecting in part a weak outlook for commodity exports. In the medium/long
term gradual erosion of the current account surplus is projected, as imports recover.



The grant element of new loans. The proportion of PNG’s debt on concessional terms has
likely reduced, given reports of a new US$500 million commercial bank loan that was
reportedly contracted in 2016 to finance the budget. This has lowered the grant element of
loans in the updated DSA in 2016, and will continue to do so in the projection due to assumed
refinancing.



The primary fiscal balance is estimated to be 2.0 percent of GDP in deficit in 2016. Thereafter
the primary deficit is projected to gradually improve to a deficit of around 0.3 percent.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.
