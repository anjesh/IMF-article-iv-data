EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2009 Article IV consultation discussions with Kuwait focused on policies to contain the
impact of the global financial crisis on the domestic economy.
Economic developments and outlook
Kuwait’s macroeconomic performance in 2008 was strong but the outlook has been
adversely affected by the global crisis and the sharp fall in oil prices. Real GDP is projected
to contract by about 1 percent and inflation is expected to return to single digits. The sharp
drop in oil prices will reduce substantially the fiscal and external current account surpluses.
The outlook is projected to improve gradually over the medium term with the global
recovery, but risks are tilted to the downside. The contentious relationship with parliament
has resulted in the resignation of the cabinet—the fourth in two years—in mid-March 2009
and may delay key legislations, including a financial stability plan.
The authorities’ views
•

The authorities are working on a comprehensive plan to preserve financial stability and
support economic activity. While the related legislation is still being debated in
parliament, the objective is to restructure systemically important financial institutions
that are under stress but solvent, facilitate the exit of insolvent ones, and encourage
lending to productive economic activities.

•

Fiscal prudence through lower transfers and current expenditure while maintaining
capital spending is necessary in light of the sharp decline in revenues and the
uncertainty surrounding future oil prices.

•

The return to a basket peg has enhanced the flexibility of monetary policy and has kept
the Kuwaiti dinar (KD) broadly in line with fundamentals.

•

The authorities will continue their ambitious investment plan in the oil sector despite
the sharp decline in oil prices.

Staff recommendations
•

The authorities’ financial stability plan should not prevent the necessary consolidation
and restructuring of the financial sector, favor upfront recognition of losses, avoid
rewarding excessive risk taking, and minimize fiscal cost. The central bank should
strengthen oversight of risk management practices and conduct comprehensive stress
tests to assess the impact of a further decline in asset prices and a prolonged period of
low growth. These tests would help determine how and whether the authorities should
intervene.

•

The authorities’ financial plan should be complemented by a fiscal stimulus package
focused on key infrastructure projects. Fiscal reform is key to reducing the dependence
on oil revenue and preserving long-term sustainability.

•

The KD is broadly aligned with fundamentals and the basket peg remains appropriate
in the run up to the GCC monetary union.

•

Implementation of structural reforms that are critical to private-sector led growth
should be expedited.

4
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The 2009 consultation discussions were held against the backdrop of the global
economic slowdown and continued political stalemate.
•

While Kuwait continues to enjoy a relatively strong economic and financial position, the
sharp decline in oil prices and possibly large losses to the assets managed by the Kuwait
Investment Authority (KIA) have weakened this position.

•

The cabinet resigned on March 16, 2009⎯the fourth time in two years⎯after
parliamentarians filed a motion against the prime minister. The Emir dissolved
parliament and elections will be held in two months. This contentious relationship with
parliament has significantly hampered the pace of economic reforms.

2.
The main elements of the authorities’ economic strategy is to use oil wealth to
boost non-oil GDP growth in order to generate private sector employment for Kuwaitis while
accumulating public financial assets for future generations. Policy discussions focused on
preserving financial stability and cushioning the impact of the global slowdown.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
The global crisis has started to weaken economic activity and affected adversely
the financial system and the fiscal position.
•

Growth: Reflecting higher oil production, real GDP growth is estimated at 6.4 percent in
2008, up from 2.5 percent in 2007 (Table 1). Non-oil GDP growth remained robust at
about 7.3 percent, supported by strong domestic investment and consumption.

Inflation: Inflation increased during the first eight months of 2008, peaking at
11.6 percent in August 2008 (year-on-year), driven by higher rent and food prices.
It moderated somewhat toward the end of the year, reaching 10.4 percent in November,
owing to weaker domestic demand and lower import prices.

Exchange rate: After switching back
from a dollar to a basket peg in
May 2007, the authorities let the KD
appreciate against the U.S. dollar in
order to slow inflation. This, along with
high inflation, led to a 7 percent
appreciation in the real effective
exchange rate (REER) in 2008.

surpluses. The overall budget surplus
reached 40 percent of GDP in 2007/08 and is estimated at 26 percent in 2008/09, despite
a large increase in spending due mainly to the recapitalization of the pension fund
(10.5 percent of GDP). 1 The non-oil deficit (excluding oil revenue, income from
investments, and recapitalization transfers to the pension fund) as a ratio to non-oil
GDP—a measure of the budget’s contribution to aggregate demand—rose by
2 percentage points to 61 percent of non-oil GDP in 2008/09 (Table 2). Despite rising
imports, the current account is estimated to have recorded a surplus of $70 billion
(45 percent of GDP) (Table 3). Kuwait continues to enjoy a strong economic and
financial position (Table 7), but this position is expected to weaken owing to the sharp
decline in oil prices and potentially large losses in the value of assets managed by the
KIA.

The fiscal year starts April 1.

Money and credit: Broad money and credit growth declined from 19 percent and
36 percent (y-o-y), respectively, in 2007 to 16 percent and 19 percent in 2008, owing to
measures introduced by the Central Bank of Kuwait’s (CBK) to contain credit growth in
the first half of 2008 and tight liquidity conditions in the second half of the year
(Table 4).

Financial system: The global financial crisis has affected adversely Kuwait’s financial
system. Liquidity conditions tightened in the second half of 2008, reflecting capital
outflows and rising concerns about counterparty risk. Since the deepening of the global
crisis after the fall of Lehman Brothers, the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE) index fell by
50 percent, with larger declines in indices for investment and real estate companies. In

7
October 2008, the third largest bank
lost $1.4 billion, mostly on
derivative transactions; in December
2008, the largest investment
company in Kuwait defaulted on
most of its $3 billion debt
obligations (and is currently
negotiating a debt restructuring);
and a large Islamic investment
company was reported to be seeking
to refinance up to $1 billion in debt.

III. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
4.
The economic outturn in 2009 will be driven largely by the fallout from the
global slowdown. Real GDP is projected to contract by 1.2 percent in light of lower oil
production (-5 percent) 2 and a decline in non-oil growth to 1 percent owing to weaker
activity, particularly in the financial and construction sectors. Lower import prices, weaker
domestic demand, and a moderation in rents should bring inflation down from an estimated
10 percent in 2008 to 6 percent in 2009. The fiscal and current accounts surpluses are
projected to decline significantly in 2009, owing to lower oil revenue (Table 5).
5.
The medium-term outlook will depend largely on developments in the global oil
market. Implementation of government investment plans and progress with structural
reforms to promote private investment are also critical to increase annual growth to the
4–5 percent range. The fiscal and current account positions should improve gradually over
the medium-term in line with the projected increase in oil prices.

While Kuwait’s production of crude oil averaged 2.68 million barrels per day (mbpd) in 2008, output was
reduced to about 2.5 mbpd in February 2009, in line with OPEC’s decisions.

8
6.
The major risks to the economic outlook are a rapid deterioration in the balance
sheet of financial institutions and a prolonged global recession that could maintain oil
prices significantly below the fiscal and current account breakeven points. 3 These risks
would affect adversely investor and consumer confidence, limit fiscal space, and worsen the
growth prospects. An illustrative alternative medium-term scenario assuming a 50 percent
reduction in oil prices relative to the
baseline suggests that the fiscal and

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The key challenge for economic policies in the near term is to contain the fallout from the
global crisis on the domestic economy. Therefore, discussions focused on the policy response
to restore liquidity in the interbank market, clear the credit channel to the private sector,
preserve the soundness of the financial system, and support growth.

3

The fiscal/current account breakeven point is the oil price at which the fiscal/current account position is
balanced. The fiscal and current account breakeven points for 2009 are estimated at $33 and $30 per barrel,
respectively.

9
A. Preserving Financial Stability
7.
The authorities have responded forcefully to stabilize the interbank market and
restore liquidity. Following the tightening of liquidity conditions in October 2008, the CBK
resorted to direct injection of liquidity in the banking system, supplemented by deposits from
government institutions. The CBK expanded its monetary policy tool kit by introducing
KD-dollar swaps and repos of varying maturities to facilitate liquidity provision to the
financial system. Consequently, interbank rates have come down significantly but activity in
the interbank market remains subdued. The authorities attributed the low volumes to
heightened uncertainty in global financial markets.
8.
The authorities indicated that the banking sector has shown strong resilience
and remains generally sound, but agreed that risks associated with banks’ exposure to
asset markets and distressed investment companies have emerged. Despite the difficult
conditions, banks maintained a relatively good profitability in 2008. 4 The authorities
reaffirmed that the banking sector have capital adequacy ratios well above the required
regulatory norm, low NPLs, and relatively low liquidity risk, 5 owing in part to the CBK’s
loan-to-deposit prudential ratio that encouraged banks to seek stable domestic sources of
funds (Table 6 (FSI)). Staff argued that banks’ capital and reserve buffers could deteriorate
significantly over the near term as a result of their large exposure to weakening real estate
and equity markets and distressed investment companies (ICs).

Investment companies, which invest heavily in stock markets and depend largely
on leverage, could be the main source of vulnerability in the financial system. ICs have
grown rapidly, their number almost doubling to 99 since 2005, with on-and off-balance sheet

Preliminary results for 2008 (covering only 5 out of 9 local banks) report profits, albeit 20 percent lower than
in 2007, reflecting in part large provisions.

10
assets representing more than 100 percent of the banking system assets, making them
systemically important. Refinancing difficulties and the deterioration of the solvency of some
ICs could affect adversely banks’ profitability and asset quality directly through lending, and
indirectly by exacerbating the negative impact on asset prices, investors’ confidence, and
corporate sector balance sheet (Box 1). If prolonged and in the absence of an appropriate
policy response, these conditions could pose a systemic risk to the financial system and
eventually increase the cost of preserving its soundness (Box 2).
10.
The authorities have taken several measures to preserve financial stability.
In addition to restoring liquidity and stabilizing the interbank market, the CBK eased credit
conditions—especially for ICs (see below). Following losses recorded by the third largest
bank, the CBK successfully facilitated its recapitalization⎯with shareholders providing
68 percent of the new capital and KIA the rest—and a law guaranteeing customer deposits at
local banks was passed. To support the equity market, the government established a
long-term fund to invest in the KSE with an initial capital of about $5.5 billion funded by the
KIA and other public entities.
11.
The authorities have also been working on a comprehensive strategy to maintain
financial stability. A draft Financial Stability Law (FSL) was recently adopted by the
cabinet and submitted to parliament. The authorities view the law as a precautionary step and
while the law covers both banks and ICs, its focus is on preserving the stability of the
banking system. While details are still unavailable (the draft law is still being debated in
parliament), the objective of the FSL is to restructure systemically important financial
institutions that are under stress but solvent, facilitate the exit of insolvent ones, and
encourage lending to productive economic activities. The authorities estimated the upfront
fiscal cost for the initial FSL draft at about $5 billion but the cost is likely to be higher for the
final draft. Potential help to distressed institutions will carry conditionality, including the
right to merge institutions. The draft also provides a resolution framework for insolvent
financial institutions. Some parliamentarians have advocated major changes to the FSL and
have sought to tie its approval to providing public assistance for household debt, a request
that was rejected by the government in the past.
12.
A key element in the overall strategy for financial stability is to restore normal
credit access to the private sector. To facilitate credit growth, the CBK raised the
loan-to-deposit ratio from 80 percent to 85 percent, increased bank-specific caps on credit
growth by 5 percentage points, and encouraged banks to maintain and renew credit lines to
deserving ICs and avoid selling collateral shares in their possession. The FSL envisages
providing partial loan guarantees to encourage lending to productive domestic economic
activities. Nevertheless, the authorities are aware of the need to strike an appropriate balance
between encouraging credit growth and preserving the quality of banks’ assets.

11
Box 1. Investment Companies and Financial Sector Vulnerabilities
Activities and structure: ICs’ activities include both proprietary and fiduciary investments. ICs provide asset
management services such as brokerage, portfolio management, forward trading, IPOs, local and international
fund management and financial services such as corporate finance advisory services (mergers, acquisitions,
underwriting, and private placements) and private equity. ICs have grown rapidly, their number almost doubling
to 99 since 2005, with $65 billion and $95 billion of on- and off-balance sheet assets, respectively, higher than
the banking system’s assets.
Sources of vulnerability: Several structural
characteristics created vulnerabilities in the sector.
These include (i) highly leveraged positions,
(ii) significant dependence on external financing,
(iii) maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities
(long term assets such as private equities are
financed by short term liabilities), (iv) large
exposure to asset markets (equity and real estate),
(v) weak disclosure, and (vi) fragmentation of the
industry (an average of KD 0.40 billion of assets per
investment company).

Global crisis impact: Tight global liquidity conditions exposed vulnerabilities i, ii and iii. Many ICs are facing
difficulties maintaining and renewing existing lines of credit, especially foreign lines ($16 billion), and some
have defaulted or are on the brink of default. The fall in assets prices has exposed vulnerability iv. IC assets
contracted by $30 billion to $148 billion between August and December 2008, reflecting both losses and
redemptions by investors. Preliminary nine-month results for 46 listed ICs show a 27 percent decline
($1 billion) in investment income and $0.3 billion of unrealized losses. The deepening of the global crisis is
likely to have induced further losses and redemptions.

Transmission channels: Bank loans to ICs (12 percent of banks’ total loans) have deteriorated in quality. With
ICs and banks accounting respectively for 13 percent and 34 percent of KSE market capitalization, deterioration
in the solvency of ICs would affect directly the asset quality of banks and indirectly by putting further
downward pressure on equity prices; weakening household and non-financial corporate balance sheets.1 As
banks’ asset quality deteriorates, so will access to credit, setting in motion a vicious circle.
1

For example, at end-September 2008, 35 real estate companies with total assets of $20 billion had invested up
to $4 billion in the KSE. Bank loans to individuals for investing in stocks represent 12 percent of banks’ total
loans.

percent of default in loans and the percent of
losses in investments.
Assumptions: For simplicity and in the absence of detailed information, the analysis assumes that the capital
adequacy ratio (CAR) for the banking sector is 16 percent (September 2008 level), no growth in the credit
portfolio in 2009, a decline in risk weighted assets equivalent to the increase in NPLs, a 75 percent loss-givendefault ratio, a default rate in loans to other sectors equal to ¼ of the default rate of loans to risky sectors, loss in
investment equal to the default rate of loans to risky sectors, and regulatory capital equal to owners’ equity in
December 2008.
Results: The first two scenarios, which assume 5 to 10 percent default/loss rates, indicate that the banking
system would remain adequately capitalized although some banks would become undercapitalized. The third
and fourth scenarios (15–20 default/loss rates) would make the system undercapitalized. Recapitalizing the
banking system to a 12 percent CAR under the fourth scenario would require the injection of at least $5 billion,
equivalent to 5 percent of GDP.

13.
The authorities agreed that the following principles should guide the financial
stability strategy:
•

The strategy should not delay or prevent necessary consolidation and restructuring of the
financial sector.

•

The strategy should favor upfront recognition of losses, as in the case of the recent bank
recapitalization.

13
•

Recapitalization of banks should, to the extent possible, rely on the participation of
existing shareholders or new private investors.

•

To reduce monitoring costs, enhance transparency, and speed up implementation,
measures to address stress in financial institutions should be relatively simple.

•

An effective communication and coordination plan that details actions and
communication at each stage by all necessary parties is key to the success of the strategy.

14.
The authorities plan to tighten regulatory oversight, especially of ICs. The global
financial turmoil has focused attention on the need for stricter regulation and closer
supervision of non-bank financial institutions. The authorities are cognizant of the
importance of conducting comprehensive stress tests for the financial system, including ICs,
particularly to assess the impact of a pronounced decline in real estate prices and further
losses in the stock market. To address difficulties in assessing the value of some ICs’ foreign
assets, the CBK has appointed international experts. The authorities requested an FSAP
update in late 2009.
B. Macroeconomic Policy Mix
15.
While the 2009/10 budget has not been finalized, the authorities announced that
capital expenditures will be maintained but current expenditures could be cut.
Furthermore, the previously-planned transfer of KD 5.5 billion to the pension fund will be
postponed. While some withdrawal of fiscal stimulus is expected, the 2009/10 budget will
not imply a significant change in the fiscal stance, given the limited scope for reducing
current spending. The non-oil deficit as a share of non-oil GDP is estimated to fall by
3 percentage points to 58 percent in 2009/10.
16.
In light of the expected economic slowdown, the mission urged the authorities to
complement the financial stability package with a fiscal stimulus package. The
authorities noted that fiscal prudence was warranted in light of the sharp decline in revenues
and the uncertainty surrounding oil price developments. While they agreed with staff that a
fiscal stimulus would increase demand, shore up investor confidence, and help stabilize asset
markets, they argued that it would have a limited impact on the Kuwaiti economy given the
significant leakages through remittances and imports. They also noted that capacity
constraints limit their ability to expand capital spending significantly, as evidenced by
relatively low implementation rates in recent years.
17.
If oil prices were to remain low for a prolonged period, the fiscal stance would
have to be adjusted to preserve long-term fiscal sustainability and intergenerational
equity. This adjustment could be supported by:

14
•

Reducing subsidies for fuel, electricity, and water which, in addition to their substantial
fiscal cost (9.5 percent of GDP and 25 percent of total government expenditures), distort
prices, misallocate resources, and damage the environmental.

•

Reforming the pension system through a restructuring of the contribution and benefit
rules so as to ensure its long-term viability.

•

Linking salaries and benefits in the public sector to performance in order to limit fiscal
costs and increase the incentives to acquire marketable skills.

•

Stepping up efforts to introduce the VAT in coordination with other GCC countries.

To assess the medium-term impact of short-term policy measures and anchor yearly budgets
by medium-term goals, it would be useful to formulate fiscal policy within a medium-term
framework. A recent IMF technical assistance mission has made detailed recommendations
in this regard.
18.
The authorities’ monetary policy stance remains appropriate in light of the
projected weakening of economic activity. The recent easing of the monetary stance and
supportive measures—such as the injection of liquidity and the relaxation of the
loan-to-deposit ratio—will support macroeconomic and financial stability. Nevertheless, as
in many countries, the interest and credit channels of monetary transmission are likely to
remain impaired until global market confidence returns. Real interest rates should return to
positive territory given the expected decline in inflation.
19.
The CBK noted that the move to the basket peg has enhanced its flexibility in
fine tuning interest rates and managing inflation. The authorities abandoned the peg to the
U.S. dollar in May 2007 and reverted to pegging the KD to a basket of currencies with
undisclosed weights. This move was motivated partly by rising inflation over the past few
years.
20.
The authorities consider that the current level of the KD is consistent with
domestic and external stability. A CGER-type analysis finds the KD to be broadly aligned
with its fundamentals (Box 3). The Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate (ERER) method finds
that the appreciation of the REER in 2008, along with the reversal of terms-of-trade gains
toward the end of the year, have brought the REER broadly in line with its equilibrium level
by end-2008. Both the Macro Balance (MB) and External Sustainability approaches find the
KD to be somewhat overvalued in 2008 but the MB expects the overvaluation to turn to a
small undervaluation by 2013.
21.
The authorities believe that the global crisis provides additional impetus to
expedite preparation for the GCC monetary union. At their last meeting in late 2008, the
GCC Heads of States reaffirmed their commitment to achieving monetary union by 2010 and
agreed to establish a monetary council⎯a precursor to a GCC central bank⎯ by end-2009.

15
Regarding the exchange rate regime for the monetary union, the authorities said that all
options will be considered.

feet (mcf). The second stage
(2011–12) would boost production to 400 mcf, while the third stage (2015–16) would
increase production to 1.0 billion cubic feet. These expansions will not involve international
oil companies (IOCs). The authorities highlighted that these projects would be self-financed,
although a need for borrowing might arise if oil prices declined or remained low for a
prolonged period. They expected the cost ($84 billion) to decline, given market
developments. Expanding production capacity would not only improve Kuwait’s long-term
outlook but would also ensure proper utilization/recovery of current fields. While IOCs
would bring advanced technology that could lower costs and enhance recovery, lack of
political consensus has hindered their involvement.
D. Structural reforms and statistical issues
23.
Progress with structural reforms is slow. With the exception of the capital market
law, little progress has been achieved in enacting companies, competition, public-private
partnership, and privatization laws. While Kuwait has reduced the marginal corporate tax rate
on foreign companies from 55 percent to 15 percent in 2008, some companies underscored
the absence of information about the necessary implementing regulations. Slow pace of
structural reforms, limited access to land, and heavy bureaucracy have discouraged FDI
inflows to Kuwait.
24.
The authorities are revising the Anti Money Laundering and Combating
Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) law to make it compatible with international
standards. The revised draft law is currently with the Ministry of Finance.

16

Box 3. Exchange Rate Assessment
A CGER–type analysis indicates that the KD is broadly in line with fundamentals.
The results are subject to the well-known estimation difficulties, especially for oil
exporting countries.
The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach1 suggests that the
strengthening of the KD in 2008 and the sharp deterioration in the terms of trade in the
second half of 2008 reversed the undervaluation of the KD in 2007 to a small
overvaluation (6 percent) by end-2008. The depreciation of the KD in early 2009 should
help close this small gap.
An assessment based on the macroeconomic balance (MB) approach using panel
estimates for the GCC countries indicates that the current account surplus is slightly
below its “norm”, but the gap is expected to close over the medium term and by 2013
the KD will slightly be undervalued.2
Under the external sustainability (ES) approach, the projected current account
surplus is too low relative to the norm derived from the annuity that would finance a
constant per capita non-oil CA deficit, suggesting larger surpluses might be needed to
maintain intergenerational equity.3

oil prices and the GDP deflator increasing by 3.5 percent a year , real GDP by 2.8 percent, and population
by 2 percent; (v) a nominal discount rate and rate of return on assets of 6.5 percent; and (vi) an initial
financial wealth of $0.3 trillion.

17
25.
More progress is needed to address data weaknesses. The CPI, national accounts,
and especially trade data are made available with a considerable lag.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Kuwait’s economy performed strongly in 2008 but important challenges lie
ahead. The key short-term challenge is preserving financial stability and cushioning the
impact of the global slowdown. Maintaining strong non-oil growth over the medium term
will require public spending focused primarily on expanding the economy’s productive
capacity, as well as implementation of structural reforms that promote private investment.
27.
Policies to safeguard the soundness of the financial sector should not prevent the
necessary consolidation and restructuring of the sector. The government’s financial
stability package should favor upfront recognition of losses, avoid rewarding excessive risk
taking, and minimizes fiscal cost. Staff encourages the authorities to conduct comprehensive
stress tests for the overall financial system to assess the impact of a further decline in asset
prices and a prolonged period of low growth. This would help determine how and whether
the government should intervene. Given the lack of political consensus and low investor
confidence, an effective communication strategy would be key to success.
28.
The central bank should strengthen oversight of risk management practices and
encourage restructuring of the IC sector. This would require ensuring the existence of
adequate policies and procedures for identifying, monitoring and controlling risks, adopting
tighter conditions for granting IC licenses, introducing a minimum set of fit and proper
criteria for the appointment of IC managers and board members, and enhancing disclosure.
These measures, if enforced strictly, would encourage consolidation in the sector, lead to
fewer and well-managed institutions, and provide a quality hurdle to entry. Staff welcomes
the authorities’ interest in undertaking an FSAP update.
29.
In light of the expected economic slowdown, staff urges the authorities to
complement the financial stability package with a well-designed fiscal stimulus package.
These packages along with strengthening capital spending capacity would be key to mitigate
the negative feedback loop between weakening balance sheets of financial institutions and
lower economic activity. A fiscal stimulus would support economic activity not only through
the standard multiplier channel but also by shoring up investor confidence. Kuwait’s fiscal
cushion should allow it to maintain a healthy level of quality capital spending over the next
few years without jeopardizing medium-term fiscal sustainability.
30.
The recent decline in oil prices highlights the importance of fiscal reforms aimed
at reducing dependence on oil revenue and rationalizing fiscal spending. These include
reducing large subsidies and transfers, reforming the pension system to ensure its long-term
viability, linking public sector salaries and benefits to merit, and introducing the VAT in
coordination with other GCC countries.

18
31.
Staff encourages the authorities to continue implementing their investment
program in the hydrocarbon sector to enhance economic prospects and support oil
market stability. Participation of IOCs would bring the necessary know-how for the
efficient development of the sector.
32.
The KD is broadly aligned with its fundamentals. The current exchange rate
regime remains appropriate in the run up to the GCC monetary union.
33.
The authorities should expedite the structural reforms that are vital to
private-sector investment, including key laws regulating private sector activity. Other
important measures include streamlining business registration and other administrative
barriers to investment, and enhancing access to land for private businesses and individuals.
34.
Staff welcomes the signing of the treaty to establish the GCC Monetary Union as
well as the adoption of the charter for the Monetary Council. Meeting the remaining key
prerequisites by the stated deadline of 2010⎯including developing a monetary and exchange
rate policy framework and building the GCC-wide data requirements⎯remains a challenge.
35.
A sustained effort to address weaknesses in macroeconomic statistics is needed.
In this connection, staff encourages the authorities to conduct a comprehensive review of the
role and resources of the General Statistical Office.
36.
Kuwait’s generous external assistance program is commendable. The size of
Kuwait’s foreign aid program is estimated to have averaged about 2 percent of GDP over the
past 20 years. Staff encourages Kuwait to continue providing debt relief to all eligible-HIPC
countries.
37.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

May 2007, the Kuwaiti dinar had been pegged to the U.S. dollar with a margin of 3.5 percent
on either side around the parity exchange rate of 299.63 fils/U.S. dollar. On April 2, 2002
Kuwait notified the Fund, under Decision 144-(52/51), of exchange restrictions it introduced
in order to implement UN Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001), 1333 (2000) and 1267
(1999).

APPENDIX II: KUWAIT—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of January 8, 2009)
The Technical Cooperation agreement between the Government of Kuwait and the World
Bank has been renewed for three years (January 1, 2007–December 31, 2009) for a nominal
allocation of $8 million.
Ongoing Activities—FY 2009/10
•

Country Procurement Assessment (CPAR): The Government of Kuwait is
exploring the possibility of joining WTO; as a part of this process, the Bank was
asked to assist in the preparation of a Country Procurement Assessment Review
(CPAR) and also in drafting new and modernized public procurement law and
regulations. The Bank has analyzed the current public procurement system including
its policies, organization, procedures and practices to help develop/improve the ability
to plan, manage and monitor the procurement process effectively. The CPAR report
has been delivered to the client in June 2008; the government is planning a
dissemination workshop in February–March 2009.

•

Civil Service Council: Review of the Civil Service Remuneration and Benefits
System. In September 2007, the Government asked for the Bank’s assistance to the
Civil Service Commission (CSC) to assess different ways to revise the structure of
salary and benefits offered to government employees. Draft report has been
completed. Once the translation of the report is done, the CSC will present the report
to the Deputy Prime Minister and inform the Bank on the timing of a consultation
mission that would validate the empirical results and jointly agree on needed
revisions, if any. Following the mission, the Bank will submit the report officially.
The Bank is also prepared to initiate a broader labor market study and also assist in a
communications campaign.

•

Enhancing Transparency, Accountability and Service Delivery: A Memorandum
of Understanding on this program was signed in December 2006. In July 2008, the
Council of Ministers passed a resolution approving Bank consulting services for this
project. The decree created an intergovernmental working team (which also includes
representatives from civil society) and designated the Department for Government
Performance under the Council of Ministers as the formal counterpart agency. The
scope of the project involves assistance in development of anti-corruption regulations
and whistle-blower protection legislation, establishment of an agency in charge of
enforcement of these policies, and other measures.

•

Offset Program: The offset program was established to encourage domestic private
investment by providing venture capital and project management. Based on the
recommendations of the review of the offset program conducted by the Bank staff in
2005, the Government established a National Offset Company (NOC). A consulting
firm (Ernst & Young) retained by the World Bank has developed and delivered a

5
proposed business plan for NOC during spring 2008. This project has received
enthusiastic support from NOC’s management.
•

Economic Zones Development. The World Bank is assisting the Foreign Direct
Investment Bureau (KFIB) and the Public Authorities for Industry (PAI) in
conducting assessment of the development opportunities for several economic and
industrial zones in Kuwait. The Bank has procured consulting services for this
purpose and is supervising consultants’ work. Master plans for two PAI sites
(Shadadiyah and Shuaiba) have been delivered, along with engineering drawings for
Shadadiyah in October 2008. KFIB and MOCI have also asked for assistance on
feasibility study for Abdali EZ, and the Bank is currently considering the request.

Education Indicators and Assessment Project: Following the completion of the
“Education Expenditure Analysis” study, the Bank continues to provide assistance in
implementing the recommendations. This is a six-year program, and outcomes of the
2007–08 work include the publication of the annual Kuwait Education Indicators
report, capacity building in policy relevant data analysis, implementation of the
TIMSS and PIRLS, and possible preparation of an education sector review. The MOE
intends to request a second phase of the project which would extend through 2012 to
include participation in the next round of assessments and associated report writing as
well as continued capacity building in other areas of the KEIAP.

APPENDIX III: KUWAIT—STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 13, 2008)
Macroeconomic data are adequate for surveillance, but there is scope for improved
compilation of the national accounts and balance of payments statistics through better
coordination among statistical agencies.
National Accounts and Production
Recent improvements of national accounts include: change of the base year for the constant
price data to 2000 and the estimates of value added for subsidized goods and services of the
public utilities sector through the use of input costs (the household expenditure survey was
used previously). Starting from the final 2002 data, further improvements are planned for
national accounts reflecting the adoption of the 1993 SNA, a sampling frame based on the
establishment survey (2002), and the expansion of the coverage of questionnaires. Continued
progress, especially in the estimation of value added for the oil sector, requires the dedication
of adequate resources and improved coordination between the Ministries of Planning, Oil,
and Finance. STA has provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Planning to improve
national accounts and price data. It would be useful if the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK)
would publish oil sector information in the Quarterly Statistical Bulletin pertaining to output,
refining, domestic consumption, export price for crude and refined products and the domestic
price of petroleum products. These data are available from the Ministry of Oil.
Price Statistics
CPI weights are based on the 1999–2000 household expenditure survey and were introduced
into the index for a reference year of 2002. An improved monthly CPI based on a revised
basket has been published in monthly CPI bulletins with about one-month lag. The wholesale
price index (WPI) needs to be developed into a producer price index (PPI) which is
consistent with the national accounts and includes all domestically produced goods,
ex-factory, for the export and the domestic market. Timely and comprehensive labor force
data are not available.
Government Finance Statistics
Annual GFS data are reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(GFSY). The major components of its extrabudgetary revenues (investment income and
transfers of profits of public institutions), extrabudgetary expenditures (interest on foreign
debt and treasury paper), and financing operations conducted by two reserve funds are not
reported. Data on investment income, and on interest on foreign debt and treasury paper,
however, are usually provided to Article IV consultation missions. The authorities have made
some progress in fiscal data presentation, but the lack of a suitable classification of data on
the execution of the budget remains a constraint on monitoring effectively fiscal

7
developments during the year. Moreover, data on the operations of the Public Institute for
Social Security are not made available. Sharing of information between various government
agencies could be improved. STA has indicated to the authorities that operations of the two
reserve funds should be classified as part of government, as they perform activities for public
policy purposes (management of debt and assets, and financing of the budget). To this end,
reporting subannual GFS in the form of the Statement of Sources and Uses of Cash for the
consolidated central government could be encouraged. The authorities have also been briefed
on the IMF’s ongoing work to enhance the transparency of fiscal accounts and presentations
detailed in the “Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency” and were encouraged to
adopt some of the practices recommended in the Code. The Public Expenditure Management
(PEM) system could usefully be strengthened.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
The CBK reports monetary data to STA on a regular and timely basis. Monetary and
financial statistics based on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) have been finalized and
will be published in the April 2008 issue of the International Financial Statistics Supplement.
CBK needs to work further to distinguish a number of investment companies that accept
deposits from other investment companies that do not accept deposits. Investment companies
that accept deposits should appropriately be classified as part of the depository corporations
sector. In the current SRFs, all investment companies (including those that accept deposits)
are classified as other financial corporations. However, the amount of deposits accepted by
investment companies are considered as not significant. CBK staff attended a workshop on
harmonizing monetary and financial statistics in the GCC region that was conducted by STA
staff in Riyadh in July 2006
Balance of Payments Statistics
The CBK compiles and disseminates detailed annual data in accordance with the
methodology of the BPM5—quarterly data are provided to Article IV consultation missions.
However, data on capital flows of the nonfinancial private sector are limited, which has
likely contributed to the “errors and omissions” item. To improve coverage for inward
foreign direct investment, the CBK is making efforts to obtain more data by surveying direct
investment enterprises identified by the Ministry of Finance. Enhancements have been made
in the estimation of travel services and communication services, but further improvements
are needed in compilation practices and in the estimation of data on several service items and
private transfers.
A major step forward in 2007 was the dissemination of IIP data for 2001–06 in STA
publications. However, IIP data exclude the external assets held by the general government
due to legal constraints on dissemination (however, loans granted by the Kuwaiti Fund for
Arab Economic Development and general government trade credits are included).

8
The CBK also participated in 2007 in the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS)
with data reported for 2003–2006. These data are for the financial sector acting as
end-investors or as intermediaries on behalf of residents and do not include holdings of
foreign securities held by government agencies, which comprise the bulk of Kuwait’s
cross-border holdings.
Data dissemination
Kuwait is one of the first GDDS participants. However, most of its metadata, with the
exception of the real sector and socio-demographic metadata, have not been updated since
October 2002. The CBK maintains its own webpage where it provides the following data to
the public: money and banking statistics; balance of payments statistics; trade balance
statistics; exchange rate; GDP by sector and expenditure at current and constant prices;
public finance statistics; CPI and WPI; and security market indicators. Similarly, the Ministry
of Planning has a webpage where the CSO publishes data on national accounts, prices, and
other related statistics. The Ministry of Finance webpage includes detailed data for actual and
estimated budget operations. In addition, the Kuwait Stock Exchange webpage provides data
on stock market indices, volume and value of securities traded, as well as privatization
schedules and other related information.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Kuwait
April 10, 2009

1.
This statement provides information on recent developments in Kuwait that has
become available since the staff report was circulated to the Executive Board on
March 26, 2009. This information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
An Amiri decree was issued on March 26, 2009 approving the Financial Stability
Law. The law seeks to preserve financial stability by:
•

Addressing possible bank undercapitalization through a combination of capital injections
and government guarantees.

•

Providing support to liquidity-constrained investment companies that are financially
solvent and with a viable business model through several measures, including
guaranteeing 50 percent of new loans to these companies. The support to both banks and
investment companies would be subject to some conditionality, including the authorities’
right to merge institutions.

•

Encouraging lending through government guarantees for 50 percent of new loans from
local banks to economic productive sectors (maximum KD 4 billions in two years).
The new guaranteed loans cannot be used for speculative investments in equity and real
estate markets or for repayment of existing loans.

•

Providing a legal framework for resolution of insolvent financial institutions.

3.
Another Amiri decree was issued on March 29, 2009 approving the 2009/10 budget.
Available information indicates that the budget is broadly in line with the information
provided to the mission by the authorities. Current expenditures allocations would remain
broadly unchanged relative to the staff report projections, with the increase in salaries,
transport and equipment being offset by lower allocations for goods and services. Allocation
for construction and maintenance (capital budget) would decline by 24 percent, owing in part
to a reduction in purchases of land. With an under-execution of the capital budget of at least
25 percent in recent years, the reduction in the budgetary allocation is unlikely to lead to a
significant decline in actual capital spending. The main spending cutback is the cancellation
of a one-off payment of KD 5.5 billion (about 13 percent of 2008 GDP) to the pension fund.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 13, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with Kuwait
On April 10, 2009 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Kuwait. 1
Background
The 2009 consultation discussions were held against the backdrop of the global financial crisis and
the ensuing economic slowdown. Kuwait’s economy continued to perform strongly in 2008, although
signs of weakness emerged in the second half of the year. The authorities’ key challenge in the near
term is to preserve financial stability and cushion the impact of the global slowdown.
Real GDP is estimated to have picked up to 6.4 percent in 2008, up from 2.5 percent in 2007,
reflecting both higher oil production and robust non-oil GDP growth. Inflation peaked at 11.6 percent
(on a year-on-year basis) in August and started to moderate toward the end of 2008 on weaker
domestic demand and lower import prices.
High average oil prices contributed to substantial current account and fiscal surpluses in 2008.
Despite rising imports, the estimated current account recorded a surplus of 45 percent of GDP and
the budget surplus for 2008/09 is estimated at 26 percent of GDP, notwithstanding a large transfer
to recapitalize the pension fund (10.5 percent of GDP).
Broad money and credit growth declined in 2008, owing to the Central Bank of Kuwait’s (CBK)
measures to contain credit growth in the first half of 2008 and tight liquidity conditions in the second
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
half of the year. After switching back from a dollar to a basket peg in May 2007, the authorities let
the Kuwaiti dinar (KD) appreciate against the US dollar in order to slow inflation. This, along with
high inflation, led to a 7 percent appreciation in the real effective exchange rate (REER) in 2008.
The global financial crisis has affected adversely Kuwait’s financial system. Liquidity conditions
tightened in the second half of 2008, reflecting capital outflows and rising concerns about
counterparty risk. Consequently, the KD interbank rate spiked in October 2008, prompting swift
intervention by the authorities through large liquidity injections to stabilize the market. Since the
deepening of the global crisis after the fall of Lehman Brothers, the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE)
index fell by 50 percent. In October 2008, the third largest bank lost $1.4 billion, mostly on derivative
transactions, leading the authorities to guarantee customer deposits at local banks and implement a
successful recapitalization plan. In December 2008, the largest investment company in Kuwait
defaulted on most of its $3 billion debt obligations and has been negotiating a debt restructuring.
The economic outlook for 2009 will be driven largely by the fallout from the global slowdown. Real
GDP is projected to contract by 1.2 percent in light of lower oil production and a decline in non-oil
growth, reflecting weak activity particularly in the financial and construction sectors. Lower import
prices, weaker domestic demand, and a moderation in rents should bring inflation down to 6
percent. The fiscal and current accounts surpluses are projected to decline significantly owing to
lower oil revenue.
The medium-term outlook will depend largely on developments in the global oil market and progress
in the implementation of structural reforms to promote private investment. The fiscal and current
account positions should improve gradually over the medium-term in line with the projected increase
in oil prices.
The major risks to the economic outlook are a rapid deterioration in the balance sheet of financial
institutions and a prolonged global recession that could maintain oil prices below $50. These risks
would affect adversely investor and consumer confidence, limit fiscal space, and worsen the growth
outlook.

Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the Kuwaiti authorities’ prudent macroeconomic policies, which have
contributed to robust economic growth, strong fiscal and external positions. Looking ahead,
Directors indicated that the key challenge faced by the authorities is to preserve financial
stability and support economic activity in the face of the global financial and economic crisis.
While the medium-term outlook remains positive, Directors foresaw important challenges ahead
for the Kuwaiti authorities. In the near term, the sharp decline in oil prices would affect adversely
the fiscal and external balances, large oil production cuts and weaker activity in the non-oil
sector are expected to slow real GDP growth, and the credit squeeze and asset price deflation
could pose significant risks to the financial system. In the medium term, a key challenge is to
use the oil wealth to diversify the economy and boost non-oil GDP growth through private
investment.

3
Directors welcomed the financial system’s strength and resilience, while observing that risks
have emerged because of the global financial crisis. They commended the Kuwaiti authorities’
proactive measures to safeguard financial stability and sustain economic growth, including
through the injection of liquidity into the financial system and the adoption of a financial stability
law. They stressed that financial sector policies should continue to encourage consolidation and
restructuring of financial institutions, upfront recognition of losses, and participation of private
investors in the recapitalization of financial institutions.
Directors called for strengthening oversight of risk management practices by ensuring adequate
policies and procedures for identifying, monitoring, and controlling systemic risk in the financial
system. They emphasized the importance of restructuring the investment companies sector,
and welcomed the authorities’ interest in undertaking a Financial Sector Assessment Program
update. Directors urged the authorities to speed up reform of money laundering and terrorism
financing legislation to make it conform to international standards.
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to fiscal prudence and medium-term fiscal
sustainability. A number of Directors encouraged a fiscal stimulus to complement the financial
stability package, given the expected slowdown in economic activity, Kuwait’s strong fiscal
position, and the positive effect of a stimulus on investor confidence and private investment. A
number of Directors, however, noted the authorities’ concerns regarding a fiscal stimulus,
including Kuwait’s limited absorptive capacity, uncertainty regarding future oil prices, and the
possible limited effectiveness of a stimulus due to significant leakages through remittances and
imports.
Directors saw a continued need for medium-term fiscal reform aimed at reducing dependence
on oil revenue and rationalizing fiscal spending. They encouraged accelerated introduction of a
value added tax in coordination with other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. They
supported the authorities’ intention to maintain capital spending while containing current
spending, including by curbing large subsidies and transfers, reforming the pension system, and
moving to merit-based public sector salaries and benefits.
Directors stressed the importance of expediting the structural reforms that are vital to boosting
private sector investment, including enactment of key laws the capital markets, companies,
competition, public-private partnership, and privatization laws; streamlining of business
registration and other administrative barriers to investment; and enhancement of access to land
by private businesses and individuals.
Directors concurred that the pegged exchange rate regime remains appropriate for Kuwait in
the run up to the GCC monetary union, and that the recent move to a basket peg may have
been helpful in containing inflation. They noted the staff’s finding that the Kuwaiti dinar is
broadly in line with economic fundamentals. In light of weakening inflationary pressures and the
downside risks to economic growth, Directors supported the recent easing of monetary policy.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to improve economic statistics, and encouraged
them to adopt a program toward subscription to Special Data Dissemination Standard. To

4
address some data weaknesses, Directors advised conducting a comprehensive review of the
role and resources of the General Statistical Office.
Directors commended the authorities for their generous substantial development foreign
assistance to low-income countries in and outside the region and their active support for the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, and urged the authorities to continue
providing debt relief to all eligible-HIPC countries.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
