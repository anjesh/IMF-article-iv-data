INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
THE BAHAMAS
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007
Article IV Consultation with The Bahamas
Approved by Markus Rodlauer and Scott Brown
November 9, 2007
Executive Summary
Background. Real GDP grew by 3½ percent in 2006, supported by buoyant construction on new resort and
second-home projects, contributing to a sharp reduction in the unemployment rate. Tourism arrivals declined
mainly due to the recovery of competitors from hurricane damage and new U.S. travel regulations. A sharp
increase in the current account deficit to over 25 percent of GDP, reflected imports related to hotel projects
financed mainly by foreign direct investment. Inflation remains low (2–2½ percent) reflecting the exchange
rate peg to the U.S. dollar. The fiscal accounts deteriorated in FY 2006/07, mainly because of one-off factors,
but both the deficit (2½ percent of GDP) and public debt (41 percent of GDP) are relatively low and are not a
source of significant vulnerability for the economy.
Outlook and Risks. Growth is projected to rebound next year based on the expectation that tourist activity
will recover as new and upgraded facilities come on stream. However, this recovery may be tempered if U.S.
economic activity turns out to be weaker than currently projected. Medium-term prospects are favorable and
consistent with continuing external stability, based on strong investment in tourism capacity, and the sound
macroeconomic policy framework. However, a very competitive regional tourism market, high oil prices, and
vulnerability to hurricanes may pose challenges.
Focus of Discussions: Policies to maintain macroeconomic stability and enhance overall efficiency.
•

Fiscal policy. The government’s goals of balancing the budget and reducing debt to 30–35 percent of
GDP by 2012 are well placed. The authorities agreed that to achieve the targets, it will be important to
restrain the growth of recurrent primary spending which has expanded at a rapid pace in recent years.

•

Monetary policy. Staff recommended to bolster the stock of international reserves by moderating the
growth of credit. While the current level of international reserves (80 percent of base money) is not an
immediate cause for concern, it is below the central bank’s own benchmark of 100 percent of base money,
and the planned gradual further easing of capital controls warrants an additional precautionary cushion.
The authorities are closely monitoring the situation and stand ready to take whatever measures necessary
safeguard the reserve position and the currency peg.

•

Reforms. Staff endorsed the authorities’ plan to move toward market-oriented instruments of monetary
policy (Fund TA has been provided). The further relaxation of exchange controls, managed carefully as
intended by the authorities, will contribute to capital market development and economic efficiency.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The Bahamas is a small, open island economy with a relatively high income
drawn mainly from tourism and offshore financial activities. Helped by prudent
macroeconomic management over the past 30 years, overall standards of living are among
the highest in the Western Hemisphere. Per capita GDP is about US$20,000, and indicators
of social development and macroeconomic performance compare favorably with the rest of
the Caribbean. Tourism and related activities account for roughly one-third of Bahamian
GDP, and financial activities, including from its offshore center, account for over 20 percent
of GDP. These sectors are expected to remain the main engines of growth in the future, and
government policy is oriented towards further improving the business climate in those areas.
The Bahamas maintains a more than 30-year old exchange rate parity with the U.S. dollar.

2.
The Bahamas has a stable Westminster-style two-party political system. In May
2007, the Free National Movement, led by Mr. Hubert Ingraham, returned to power by a
narrow electoral margin, after five years in the opposition. Continuity in economic policy is
assured as both political parties endorse a private sector-led economic development model
with some state involvement in infrastructure, and have demonstrated prudent financial
management.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
The economic expansion that started in 2004 continued in 2006, as strong
tourism-related construction and domestic demand offset a lackluster tourism sector. In
2006, real GDP grew by 3.4 percent, as construction on new resort and second-home projects
increased sharply. Domestic demand was fueled by expanding bank credit to the private
sector, which grew by over 14 percent a year in 2005 and 2006 (mainly in consumer loans
and mortgages). These activities offset a decline in tourism arrivals (following strong growth

4
in 2004 and 2005), due mainly to the recovery of competitors from hurricane damage. The
unemployment rate fell by one-fourth to 7.6 percent, and estimates of the output gap suggest
that the economy is operating close to capacity. Nevertheless, inflation remains subdued at
around 2 percent (Figure 1).
4.
Following steady improvements in recent years, the fiscal accounts deteriorated
in FY 2006/07 mainly due to
one-off factors. Preliminary

deterioration was associated

enterprises and extraordinary
2001

2006
expenditures for the renovation
of schools. Since FY 2002/03,
revenue increased by 4½ percentage points of GDP, to 21½ percent of GDP, mainly owing to
buoyant import growth (in particular related to fuel imports) and improved tax collection.
This has offset growth in primary recurrent spending, in particular on wages and current
transfers and subsidies. Capital outlays, including transfers to public enterprises, have risen
recently in the face of shortcomings in public infrastructure, but overall they remain
relatively low at 3.4 percent of GDP. Public debt increased to 41 percent of GDP at end2006, mainly as a result of US$160 million market financing by the telecommunications and
electricity companies for new investment (Figure 2).
5.
Reflecting strong credit growth, net international reserves have declined to
below the authorities’ informal benchmark. The lifting of a credit freeze in mid-2004 set
off a vigorous expansion of credit. Credit growth has slowed this year (to 10 percent y-o-y by
September) as the overhang in credit demand diminished and responded also to moral
suasion by the authorities. Nevertheless, NIR have declined to around 80 percent of base
money, below the central bank’s informal benchmark of about 100 percent (Figure 3).
6.
Imports related to investment projects have led to a sharp increase in the
external current account deficit. The current account deficit can be decomposed into an
underlying position plus a transitory import component related to periodic waves of foreign

direct investment (FDI) in tourism-related construction projects.1 Thus, although the actual
current account deficit increased from 8½ percent of GDP to 25½ percent between 2003 and
2006, the underlying current account deficit rose by much less, from 8½ percent of GDP in
2003 to around 10½ percent, reflecting higher oil prices. A similar situation occurred in
1997–98, when the current account deficit rose from 7.5 percent of GDP in 1996 to
23.2 percent of GDP in 1998 following a hotel construction boom. Over the next two years,
the deficit fell back to 8 percent of GDP, while tourist expenditure rose by 3 percent of GDP.

Notwithstanding the recent lackluster tourism activity, standard indicators do
not suggest a decline in competitiveness or threat to external stability. According to
various measures, the real effective exchange rate has depreciated significantly in recent
years.2 Merchandise exports (net of re-exports) have grown steadily, from 6¼ percent of
GDP in 2003 to close to 7 percent in 2006, while receipts from the offshore financial sector
have risen from 1.9 percent of GDP to 3 percent. In tourism, despite a loss in market share of
Caribbean stop-over arrivals, The Bahamas’ share of total Caribbean tourism expenditure has
increased, in part reflecting a deliberate strategy to target the higher end of the market. In
addition, buoyant FDI points to a high level of investor confidence and prospects of future
improvements in productivity, and The Bahamas ranks high in terms of investment climate
indicators, including the level of taxation, rule of law, and corruption (Figure 4).
1

The underlying current account balance is calculated assuming that imports of construction services, other
services (which are mainly related to construction) and merchandise (including fuel quantity) remain constant as
a share of GDP.
2

In addition, an estimate of the equilibrium real exchange rate suggests that the actual rate is not overvalued
(Appendix II).

8.
Financial soundness indicators point to a healthy and well-supervised system.
The Bahamian banking sector has experienced healthy growth rates since 2003, with total
assets growing from 109 percent to 125 percent of GDP in 2006. At the same time,
profitability and capital adequacy have improved, while the ratio of nonperforming loans to
total loans has steadily declined. Substantial efforts have been made to bring banking
supervision up to international standards, harmonize domestic and offshore regulations, and
comply with the Basel core principles for bank supervision. New bank and private trust
company regulations have been implemented, including to specify limits of bank lending
exposure, improve know-your-customer provisions, impose meaningful physical presence
requirements for all banks and trusts, and consolidate anti-money laundering legislation in
line with international best practices. Partly because of exchange control regulations, which
severely restrict domestic banks from investing abroad and create a firewall between the
domestic and offshore financial sectors, the domestic financial system has not been affected
by the recent turmoil in global financial markets.

11

III. OUTLOOK FOR 2007–08 AND THE MEDIUM TERM
9.
Economic growth in 2007 is expected to decelerate moderately and then to
rebound in 2008. This year growth is projected to fall to around 3 percent, owing mainly to
the deceleration in the expansion of credit, the completion of a major hotel construction
project, and continued weakness in tourism arrivals. Tourism has been affected by the
Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (the requirement that U.S. tourists must have a
passport to re-enter their country), a slowdown in U.S. economic activity, and the withdrawal
of a significant number of hotel rooms for renovation and remodeling. In 2008, growth is
projected to rise to around 4 percent, based mainly on a rebound in tourist activity as new
and upgraded facilities come on stream, even as global economic conditions become
somewhat less favorable. The FY 2007/08 fiscal deficit is projected at 1.8 percent of GDP,
consistent with the official budget estimate, and the current account deficit is projected to fall
to 16½ percent of GDP in 2008, reflecting further moderation in hotel construction.

The main downside risk is that of a sharper slowdown in the United States. The
mission’s baseline forecast already incorporates some spillover effects to The Bahamas from
a slowdown of the U.S. economy in line with the WEO projections: (a) tighter credit
conditions in the United States, especially for real estate companies and potential secondhome buyers; and (b) subdued U.S. economic activity and consumer confidence, which
would impact tourism. In the event of a sharper U.S. slowdown, the negative impact on the
Bahamian economy might be stronger than projected, not only from direct effects on tourist
expenditures and capital inflows, but also because the authorities might need to tighten
monetary policy to prevent a loss of reserves. The Bahamas is also vulnerable to hurricanes.

12
11.
Medium-term prospects for growth and external stability depend on healthy
tourism growth. The underlying current account deficit is projected to decline to around
8½ percent of GDP by 2012 as the rise in oil imports is offset by a recovery in tourism and
continued growth of exports and the financial sector. Tourism receipts are assumed to
increase from 32½ percent of GDP in 2006 to 33½ percent in the medium term (the 1997–
2006 average), consistent with projected economic growth in the United States and Canada,
and the maintenance of The Bahamas’ competitive position as a result of the upgrading and
expansion of the hotel stock now underway.

Though currently in large deficit, the current account position appears
sustainable, based on projected long-term equity-related capital flows in line with the
average of the last 10 years. In the past, these flows have been largely immune to the
periodic bouts of volatility in international capital markets and have been underpinned by
The Bahamas’ strong fundamentals, including its stable macroeconomic conditions and a
favorable investment climate. Nevertheless, the need for inflows of this magnitude does
expose The Bahamas to potential capital account vulnerabilities. External debt is negligible
(5.9 percent of GDP) and does not pose a threat to external stability under standardized
shocks. Public external debt is around 5 percent of GDP, and partly owing to exchange
controls, private external debt is also very low (0.6 percent of GDP).

13.
There is also a sizable upside risk to the long-term growth outlook. Some US$13–
20 billion (200–330 percent of GDP) of hotel and second-home projects have been proposed
for consideration by the government. The projects are at various stages of negotiation and
approval, and only a small number of them are included in the projections. Thus, hotel and
home construction could be substantially stronger than projected, raising the risk of
overheating.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
The authorities’ main economic objectives are to maintain macroeconomic
stability and a positive investment climate. They see this as the best way to encourage
private investment and ensure continued growth in employment and standards of living.
Against this background, discussions focused on the economic outlook, policies to maintain
macroeconomic stability, and structural reforms to enhance overall efficiency.
Economic outlook
15.
Medium-term prospects are favorable but the highly competitive regional
tourism market and high oil prices pose challenges. If lackluster tourism growth were to
continue and thus also discourage future FDI, this would not only impact the current account
deficit but capital account financing could also decline. The staff encouraged the authorities
to continue to explore ways to broaden the tourist base, which, more than for any other
Caribbean country, is narrowly concentrated on the U.S. market. Developing new tourism
products in line with preferences of European and emerging market tourists could help
achieve this objective. In addition, this could create opportunities for niche developments and

14
Bahamian entrepreneurs, which the government would like to promote. Hotel operators also
cited a need to improve education and vocational training to address a skills shortage in the
tourism sector.
16.
The authorities and private sector representatives were optimistic about the
sector’s future. They noted recent initiatives to expand the tourist base to Europe and Asia;
new agreements to increase airline flights between the United States and The Bahamas; and
the world-class hotel companies undertaking new investments in the country. They also cited
the potential for expansion into the largely undeveloped outer islands, and the demographic
shift of the North American population—the “graying” of the relatively affluent baby boom
generation that has boosted demand for high-end tourist travel and second-home purchases,
which is assumed to be less sensitive to cyclical or credit market conditions.
17.
The authorities shared the staff’s concerns about the country’s ability to absorb
the large amount of hotel projects being proposed by developers. The authorities have
established an inter-ministerial task force to carefully monitor potential bottlenecks in public
infrastructure and services that might arise from the hotel construction. At the same time,
they are carefully reviewing the hotel project proposals to ensure consistency with
environmental sustainability, labor force capacity, and the local culture. This is especially
relevant in the isolated and sparsely populated outer islands, where the authorities have
decided to abandon the previous government’s strategy of encouraging the establishment of
large-scale resorts (“anchor projects”) to serve as engines of growth and development.
Exchange rate policy
18.
The staff and authorities agreed that the fixed exchange rate regime and parity
with the U.S. dollar are appropriate. The small size of the economy and its strong
economic and commercial ties with the United States argue for maintaining the peg. It has
fostered a favorable investment climate by eliminating exchange rate risk and allowing for
long-term investment planning. Moreover, there is no evidence that maintaining parity with
the U.S. dollar has hurt competitiveness or negatively affected external stability. The
authorities reiterated their commitment to economic policies consistent with supporting the
exchange rate parity.
Fiscal policy
19.
The authorities’ fiscal policy is anchored on the medium-term objectives of
balancing the budget and reducing debt. The authorities reiterated their commitment—
outlined in the FY 2007/08 budget speech—to balance the budget and reduce central
government debt to 30–35 percent of GDP by the end of their term in 2012. The staff
endorsed these goals, noting that their achievement would further increase the room to
maneuver in the event of shocks, and support the central bank’s efforts to accumulate
international reserves and the planned further relaxation of exchange controls. The staff

15
added that, if economic activity turned out stronger than projected, it would be advisable to
accelerate the pace of fiscal consolidation, to reduce the risk of overheating.
20.
Controlling recurrent primary spending will be a priority. Such spending has
grown at a fast and unsustainable pace in the past three years. Restraint in this area would
create room for much needed infrastructure spending. The authorities noted that they had
taken measures to further enhance the credibility of the budgetary and fiscal planning
process. To limit supplementary appropriations and enhance transparency, they have
committed to hold a formal midyear review of budget implementation in Parliament and
grant only thoroughly justified additional expenditure. In addition, the medium-term fiscal
deficit and debt-reduction objectives will be assessed within the framework of rolling 3-year
projections.
21.
The authorities intend to strengthen the budget constraints on public entities.
Extraordinary transfers to state agencies (½ percent of GDP) contributed to the FY 2006/07
budget overrun. Two ailing public enterprises will be the focus of tighter budget control in
the context of renewed management performance and investment plans. The authorities
confirmed their intention to proceed with the privatization of the profitable state
telecommunications and electricity companies.
22.
On revenues, the authorities are focusing on improving the efficiency of tax
administration. Efforts to improve administration include computerization, more focused
controls at customs, a better follow-up on tax arrears, and some streamlining of import and
stamp duties. In addition, they are working to improve collection of real estate taxes and
update the tax base. The authorities have no near-term plans for major tax policy changes,
although they noted that they may eventually need to adopt a consumption tax or VAT to
reduce dependence on import tariffs, depending on negotiations of regional and international
trade agreements. The Bahamas has the highest average customs tariff rate among Fund
members and the authorities are aware of the potential efficiency gains from adopting a
VAT. However, with a high import content of consumption, the authorities see the
advantages of a VAT over import tariffs as relatively small and they are not convinced that
these would outweigh the costs and disruptions at this time from such a far-reaching move.
23.
Import duty exemptions and tax concessions are generous. Concessions granted to
encourage hotel investment include import duty exemptions on investment-related goods as
well as long-term exemptions from real estate taxes. Import duty exemptions accounted for
B$80 million (1.3 percent of GDP) in FY 2005/06. The large amount of hotel projects being
proposed by the private sector suggests that the existing level of concessions may be overly
generous. Moreover, the staff noted that concessions implicitly favor imports over
domestically provided goods and services. The authorities agreed, and are reviewing the
statutory import duty exemptions and tax concessions granted under the Hotel Investment
Act and other legislation. For the time being, in their negotiations with promoters, they will
try to limit the scope of the entitlements to pure hotel projects, excluding the second-home

16
and other real estate type developments that are not specifically covered under the
concessions law. The authorities are also reviewing previously signed agreements to ensure
that concessions offered to developers were in full compliance with other areas of Bahamian
law. Despite these initiatives, however, the authorities were of the view that the regional
competition for hotel investment would not permit a substantial reduction in the use of tax
concessions to attract investment.
Monetary policy
24.
Monetary policy remains geared toward supporting the exchange rate peg. The
authorities noted that credit growth had come down, and that the external position was solid,
even though they agreed with the staff’s assessment that the level of international reserves
could be higher. The authorities emphasized that they were monitoring the situation closely
and would not hesitate to use all the tools at their disposal, including credit restrictions, in
order to safeguard the reserve position and the peg. They also noted that they had contingent
lines of credit with the commercial banks, in the event that there was a short-term need to
augment reserves.
25.
Staff considered that some additional tightening of monetary conditions was
warranted. While the current level of international reserves was not an immediate cause for
concern, current economic trends warranted additional caution, and the staff argued that the
authorities should try to accumulate reserves now by moderating the growth of credit. The
present level was significantly below the central bank’s own benchmark of 100 percent of
base money, in the context of the exchange rate peg. A higher level of reserves would
provide a buffer against the present downside risks in the global economy, such as the credit
crunch, a weaker current account from smaller-than-projected tourism expansion, or a further
increase in oil prices. Over the medium term, a higher level of reserves would also be
appropriate to accompany the planned further easing of exchange controls (paragraph 27).
26.
The staff endorsed the authorities’ plan to move toward market-oriented
instruments of monetary policy. The authorities currently rely mainly on moral suasion,
credit ceilings, and transfer restrictions as their policy instruments. Greater reliance on
market-oriented monetary instruments will allow the authorities to “fine tune” their liquidity
management operations and could help improve economic efficiency and competitiveness,
by contributing to the development of domestic capital markets and improving the efficiency
of the allocation of credit. The authorities have already begun to explore options for “openmarket-type” operations to help manage overall bank liquidity (such as purchases of some of
the central bank’s stock of government securities by the National Insurance Board, which has
substantial bank deposits). The authorities were pleased with the MCM/CARTAC technical
assistance mission on the use of indirect monetary policy instruments that took place in
October and looked forward to receiving the mission’s final report (Box 1).

17

Box 1. The Introduction of Indirect Instruments of Monetary Policy
The central bank is exploring a possible move from direct controls to the use of indirect
instruments of monetary policy. The move would involve a change to the monetary
operations framework and a more explicit use of interest rate levers to influence credit
demand. The use of indirect levers should allow for more effective and efficient
implementation of monetary policy, and support financial market deepening. It should also
provide a framework which is more robust in responding to financial market development
and the pressures of globalization.
Currently, the authorities’ main monetary policy instruments are moral suasion and
credit restrictions, although they do possess some indirect instruments. In 2006, in order
to moderate the growth of credit, the authorities successfully resorted to moral suasion in the
form of various letters and consultations with commercial banks. A standing facility for
providing liquidity exists notionally in the form of a discount window. The discount rate
does have market impact, as it effectively determines the banking sector’s prime rate, and
most loans—including government bonds—are priced on the basis of the prime rate.
However, in practice, the discount rate has not been used actively (the rate has changed only
twice in the last ten years) and thus has not reflected changes in the monetary policy stance.
A number of changes to the central bank’s operational framework will be needed to
support the adoption of indirect instruments. These include: improving balance of
payments forecasts and elaborating a short-term liquidity forecast; adjusting the reserve
averaging system; and replacing the existing discount and rediscount facilities with a more
normal standing credit facility where the central bank has more control over the terms and
conditions of borrowing. It would also be important for the government’s overdraft
(“advances”) from the central bank to be securitized or repaid, and for the central bank to
gradually sell some of its holdings of government securities to the market to remove existing
excess liquidity.
With these measures in place, the authorities would be in a position to implement open
market operations to manage liquidity and guide the short-term market interest rate.
The central bank’s monetary policy committee would periodically set a monetary policy rate,
which would then replace the discount rate as a base for other market rates.
Financial sector policies
27.
The planned further easing of exchange controls is welcome and needs to be well
supported by strong macroeconomic and financial sector policies. Inward and outward
capital transactions by residents currently require authorization by the central bank, and
approved amounts are limited and carry high fees. Further relaxation of controls would foster
development of capital markets and enhance investment opportunities for Bahamians and

18
foreigners, while also facilitating Bahamas to keep up with spontaneous developments of
globalization and regional integration of the financial system. On the other hand, it would
also reduce monetary policy independence and potentially increase the vulnerability of the
fixed exchange rate regime. The staff supported the authorities’ gradual and controlled
approach, emphasizing that it should be accompanied by a higher benchmark level of
international reserves, indirect instruments of monetary control, solid fiscal policy, and a
strong financial regulatory and prudential framework.
28.
The authorities continue to place high priority on enhancing the supervisory and
regulatory framework for the domestic and offshore financial systems. They have
devoted substantial resources to upgrading personnel and practices in the supervision
department of the central bank, which has grown into the largest department in the bank.
This has allowed them to undertake on site inspections for all the banks at least once every
two years. At the same time, they have strengthened risk-based supervision, including the
development of watch lists for complex and potentially risky products, which has allowed
them to focus their efforts more efficiently. The authorities also noted the progress made in
the area of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).
They continue to provide extensive training and guidelines to commercial banks, which has
enabled them to move successfully from a prescriptive to a more efficient risk-based system.
29.
The authorities have taken steps to implement most of the recommendations of
the Fund’s 2004 offshore financial center assessment report. An important pending
measure is finalizing the guidelines on confidentiality for overseas regulators, in order to
permit the efficient exchange of information.
Trade and regional integration
30.
Trade integration and regional cooperation remain important objectives, within
the country’s priorities. The government has requested WTO membership; discussions are
at a very preliminary stage. The authorities are also hopeful that the U.S. Congress will
extend—and enhance—the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which is due to expire on
September 30, 2008. Given that merchandise exports are a relatively small component of The
Bahamas’ total trade, the degree of preferential access to export markets is important to only
a few sectors or firms. However, to the extent that such access is important to those sectors, it
remains a priority for the government. The authorities would naturally attach greater strategic
importance and a higher priority to international talks that might affect tourism or financial
services, given their much larger weight in the structure of the Bahamian economy. The
authorities noted that they remain committed to CARICOM and have an interest in strong
regional cooperation in specific areas, such as health, education, and security, but would not
participate in the Caribbean Single Market Economy, as there was little political support in
The Bahamas for liberalized regional immigration and currency union.

19
Statistical issues
31.
Progress has been made in strengthening the statistical base. A new and upgraded
series of national accounts has been published, and time lags for this year’s second edition
were shortened substantially. A number of comprehensive surveys are in preparation,
including an economic census of all enterprises, covering for the first time also the outer
islands. On the other hand, resource limitations in the Department of Statistics are hampering
the timely production of comprehensive economic statistics, and improved data in the area of
the national accounts, external trade, the consolidated public sector, debt, and the labor
market would facilitate economic monitoring and policy making.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Paced by a hotel and second-home construction boom, macroeconomic
performance over the past two years has been favorable. Real GDP has grown at a solid
pace, contributing to a sharp reduction in the unemployment rate. Tourism arrivals have
declined recently, mainly as a result of the recovery of competitors from hurricane damage
and new U.S. travel regulations, but a rebound is expected for next year. A sharp increase in
the current account deficit reflected imports related to hotel projects financed mainly by
foreign direct investment. Inflation remains low and under control. The fiscal accounts
deteriorated in FY 2006/07 mainly due to one-off factors, but both the deficit and public debt
are relatively low and are not a significant source of vulnerability for the economy.
33.
The near-term outlook remains positive, but risks have increased. Growth is
projected to rebound next year based on the expectation that a new round of hotel
construction will get underway and tourist activity will recover as new and upgraded
facilities come on stream. However, this recovery may be tempered if U.S. economic activity
turns out to be weaker than currently projected. The fiscal deficit is projected to resume its
declining path in FY 2007/08.
34.
Medium-term prospects are also favorable and consistent with continuing
external stability, although the external environment may pose challenges. The Bahamas
will have to contend with a highly competitive regional tourism market and the likelihood of
continued high oil prices. It is also vulnerable to natural disasters. Nevertheless, based on
strong investment in tourism capacity, and the supportive macroeconomic policy framework
in place, the external current account deficit is expected to decline steadily. In addition, the
outlook for foreign direct investment remains favorable, underpinned by strong business
climate indicators, including on macroeconomic stability, low taxation, rule of law, and
corruption.
35.
The fixed exchange rate regime and parity with the U.S. dollar are appropriate
given the small size of the economy and its economic integration with the United States.
The peg has contributed to a favorable investment climate and, notwithstanding the recent

20
stagnation in tourism activity, various indicators do not suggest a decline in competitiveness.
Although the fixed exchange rate limits policy flexibility in the event of adverse shocks,
there is a strong social consensus in favor of the peg and the policy framework needed to
support it.
36.
The government’s goals of balancing the budget and reducing debt to 30–
35 percent of GDP by 2012 are well placed. Achieving these objectives would reinforce
both internal and external stability while increasing the resiliency of the economy in the
event of shocks. The authorities should stand ready to accelerate the pace of fiscal
consolidation in the event that stronger than anticipated growth and foreign investment were
to increase the risk of overheating.
37.
To achieve the targets, it will be important to restrain the growth of recurrent
primary spending which has expanded at a rapid pace in recent years. The government’s
use of a multi-year budgetary framework and its intention to introduce a formal midyear
budget review are commendable, promoting transparency and greater accountability in fiscal
management.
38.
On revenues, plans to improve tax administration, streamline import duties, and
tighten requirements for granting tax concessions are in the right direction. The large
amount of hotel projects being proposed by the private sector is an indication that tax
concessions may be overly generous. Depending on the authorities’ plans to participate in
regional and international trade agreements, the authorities would need to reduce dependence
on international trade taxes and adopt a consumption tax or VAT.
39.
The central bank should accumulate additional reserves by moderating credit
growth. An increase in international reserves closer to historical levels in relation to
monetary aggregates would provide more policy flexibility in the event of adverse shocks.
Furthermore, the planned relaxation of exchange controls calls for maintaining higher levels
of reserves than in the past.
40.
Steps towards the eventual adoption of market-oriented monetary policy
instruments are appropriate. Use of such instruments would improve the ability to finetune monetary policy, increase the efficiency of credit allocation by relying on price signals
instead of more direct intervention, and foster creation of a secondary market for government
securities, which will be an important building block for developing the domestic capital
market.
41.
Managed carefully, further relaxation of exchange controls would contribute to
capital market development and economic efficiency. This process should be gradual and
well supported by a strong policy framework, including adequate international reserves, a
solid macroeconomic policy framework, and a strong financial regulatory and prudential
framework.

21
42.
The financial system remains sound and well-regulated. Significant strides have
been made in strengthening the supervisory and regulatory framework of the financial
system. This should continue to inspire confidence and support further growth in the
financial services sector. Particularly welcome are the improvements in the AML/CFT
regime, following the introduction of a risk-based approach to monitoring.
43.
Economic statistics have improved, although gaps remain. The Department of
Statistics should press ahead with its ambitious work program to update and extend the data
sets for the analysis of economic and social developments, beyond the two main islands.
Despite notable improvements, statistical deficiencies continue to hamper policy assessment,
particularly in the national accounts, the balance of payments, debt, and the consolidated
public sector.
44.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with The Bahamas take place on
the standard 24-month cycle.

Appendix I. Background and Summary of Appendices
Discussions. The 2007 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Nassau during
September 11–20, 2007. The mission met with Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham, Finance
Minister of State Zhivargo Laing, Governor Wendy Craigg, Financial Secretary Ruth Millar,
other senior officials, representatives of the private sector, and the opposition. The staff team
comprised Trevor Alleyne (Head), Werner Keller, Gil Mehrez, and Elöd Takáts (all WHD).
Mr. Ladd (OED) attended the final meeting.
Exchange arrangement. The Bahamas has accepted the obligations of the Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The exchange rate of the
Bahamian dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar at parity.
Fund relations. The Bahamas has no outstanding purchases or loans.
Technical assistance. In 2005, STA provided assistance in balance of payments and external
debt accounting, and government finance statistics. In 2007, STA assisted in the compilation
of the new national accounts series. Immediately following the 2007 Article IV consultation
mission, an MCM/CARTAC mission provided advice on the adoption of market-oriented
monetary instruments.
Statistical issues. Data provided to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes. Despite
significant recent progress in timeliness and quality, weaknesses remain, particularly in the
areas of national accounts, the balance of payments, debt, and the consolidated public sector.
A new and upgraded series of national accounts is being published, and next year, the series
will be rebased and calculated backwards. An ambitious program to conduct comprehensive
socio-economic and corporate surveys is being executed, covering for the first time all
islands.
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). As of August 23, 2007, the
active portfolio of the IDB stood at US$112 million, of which US$53 million were
outstanding. The 2003–07 country strategy focused on: (i) supporting private sector
development; (ii) promoting social development and equity enhancement; (iii) environmental
protection and natural resource sustainability; and (iv) improving public sector management.
The IDB will prepare a new country strategy for 2008–12.

Appendix II. The Bahamas—Exchange Rate Assessment1
This note uses the Fundamentals Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate (FEER) approach to
assess the real exchange rate in The Bahamas. Panel regression techniques were used to
estimate an equilibrium relationship between real exchange rates and a set of fundamentals.
The estimated relationship was then used to calculate the equilibrium real exchange rates.
The panel includes The Bahamas, the six ECCU countries, Jamaica, Belize, and the
Barbados.
Fundamentals
The FEER emphasizes the time-varying nature of the equilibrium real exchange rate as a
function of real factors (fundamentals) that have a role in the determination of equilibrium
levels (Edwards, 1999 and CGER, 2006).2 In the case of the tourism-dominated economies
we expect the real exchange rate to be a function of the following fundamentals:
•

Productivity differentials. According to the so-called Balassa-Samuelson effect, higher
productivity in tradables will result in a real appreciation of the exchange rate. Per capita
tourist arrivals as share of per capita tourist arrivals in Antigua and Barbuda—the country
with the second highest per capita arrivals in the region after The Bahamas—were used
as a proxy for productivity differentials.3

•

Terms of trade. Higher terms of trade may appreciate the real exchange rate through
wealth effects. Given the dominance of tourism in the region, we use a proxy for tourism
terms of trade—movements in the terms of trade of goods and services not explained by
movements in terms of trade of goods.

•

Government consumption. Higher government consumption is likely to appreciate the
real exchange rate to the extent that it falls mostly on non-tradables.

•

Net Foreign Assets. Macroeconomic models predict that countries with higher net foreign
assets can in principle sustain a stronger real exchange rate because the income flow they
receive on their assets.

Prepared by Emilio Pineda.
Recent applications of this methodology include Cerra and Saxena (2002), Mathiensen (2003), Abidh and
Tsangarides (2006), and CGER (2006).

Other countries—such as Barbados—were used as benchmark with similar results.

38
Estimation results
The estimated model found a significant long-run relationship between the real exchange rate
and most of the identified fundamentals, particularly tourism-driven productivity and terms
of trade. Table 1 presents the panel regressions results for the panel including ECCU
countries plus Jamaica, Barbados, The Bahamas and Belize. The estimation results proved
robust to different specifications and samples, and are in line with those found in the
literature.4
•

•

The estimated coefficient for
productivity differentials implies that
an increase of 10 percent in per
capita tourist arrivals relative to the
per capita tourist arrivals in Antigua
and Barbuda, is associated with an
appreciation of around 1 percent in
the equilibrium real exchange rate.
A ten percent increase in the tourism
terms of trade is associated with an
appreciation of the equilibrium real
exchange rate of 2 percent.

Equilibrium real exchange rates
Equilibrium Real Exchange Rates (ERER) were computed by evaluating the relationship
between the real exchange rate and the fundamentals.5 The figure below shows the evolution
of the actual and equilibrium values for the REER in The Bahamas between 1979–2006.

For additional robustness checks see Pineda and Cashin (2007), “Is the Eastern Caribbean Dollar
Overvalued?,” forthcoming Working Paper.

The fundamentals can exhibit a substantial degree of “noise” or fluctuations. To ameliorate the impact of these
fluctuations we applied a Hodrick-Prescott filter with a smoothing factor of 10.

C. Recent Country Strategy
The IDB’s strategy for 2003–07 has been to focus on: (i) supporting private sector
development; (ii) promoting social development and equity enhancement; (iii) environmental
protection and natural resource sustainability; and (iv) improving public sector management. A
key feature of the strategy has been to focus on relatively small projects with a high technical
assistance content. The IDB will prepare a new strategy for 2008–12.

There has been significant recent progress in the timeliness and quality of economic
data, although weaknesses remain. Statistical data are adequate for surveillance purposes.
The Department of Statistics (DOS) is publishing a new and upgraded series of national
accounts. This year’s second edition, covering 2006, became available at a much shortened
time lag, but not in time for the FY 2007/08 budget. Next year, the series will be rebased and
calculated backwards to 1989. The central bank produces annual, quarterly, and monthly
reports covering macroeconomic developments and summary monetary and fiscal data, and a
weekly brief of key monetary data is available to the staff. The operations of public
corporations are not compiled into a consolidation of the public sector accounts.
The DOS has an ambitious program to conduct comprehensive socio-economic surveys.
(i) A household expenditure survey with a poverty assessment module has been completed;
(ii) a survey on social conditions will provide MDG data (modified to fit the local
circumstances); (iii) an occupational survey, to be conducted in the fourth quarter 2007, will
update the labor force statistics; and (iv) an enterprise census in 2008 will provide a
comprehensive inventory of economic activity and will, for the first time, cover the outer
islands.
The Bahamas began participation in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS)
in 2003. Its metadata was posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on
February 14, 2003.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 08/04
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 17, 2008

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
The Bahamas
On November 26, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with The Bahamas.1
Background
Helped by prudent economic management over the past 30 years, The Bahamas enjoys the
third highest per capita GDP among Western Hemisphere countries and social development
indicators that compare favorably with other countries in the region. Tourism and related
activities account for roughly one-third of Bahamian GDP, and the financial sector, including a
dynamic offshore center, account for over 20 percent of GDP.
Macroeconomic performance has been solid. Led by construction on new resort and secondhome projects, the economy grew by close to 3½ percent in 2006; growth is expected to
moderate slightly to 3 percent this year. Inflation remains low at around 2½ percent. The current
account deficit increased sharply to 25½ percent in 2006, reflecting imports related to the resort
investments and higher oil imports. The rise in imports has been largely financed by foreign
direct investment but because of a decline in tourist arrivals, there has also been some draw
down in international reserves.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Macroeconomic policies have been tightened this year. The growth of credit has declined from
over 14 percent in 2006 to 10 percent in September in part because of moral suasion by the
authorities. In addition, the budget deficit target for FY 2007/08 (ending June 30) is 1¾ percent
of GDP compared with a preliminary outturn of about 2½ percent of GDP in FY 2006/07.
The authorities’ see the maintenance of macroeconomic stability and a positive investment
climate as the best way to encourage private investment and ensure continued growth in
employment and standards of living. Against this background, discussions focused on the
economic outlook, policies to maintain macroeconomic stability, and structural reforms to
enhance overall efficiency.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ solid track record of prudent macroeconomic
management, which has helped The Bahamas attain the highest standard of living in the
Caribbean. Despite a recent decline in tourist arrivals, macroeconomic performance continues
to be favorable, with strong growth, low inflation, and a relatively small fiscal deficit and public
debt. The sharp increase in the external current account deficit mainly reflects constructionrelated imports that are financed by foreign direct investment.
At the same time, Directors observed that the external environment poses several challenges
and risks going forward, including the relatively slow economic growth projected for the United
States next year, a highly competitive regional tourism market, high oil prices, and the country’s
vulnerability to natural disasters. In this context, they welcomed the authorities’ strong
commitment to maintaining macroeconomic stability, which is backed by the supportive
macroeconomic policy framework in place. Directors also noted that the business climate
remains very attractive, and that there is substantial ongoing and planned investment in the
tourism sector. In light of this, Directors generally considered that overall The Bahamas’
medium-term economic prospects remain favorable. However, Directors reiterated that
diversification of both the tourism product and the overall economy will be crucial for strong and
sustained economic growth.
Directors supported the government’s goals of balancing the budget and reducing debt to 30–35
percent of GDP by 2012. To ensure the achievement of these targets, Directors welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to control current spending, tighten budget constraints on public
entities, and improve tax administration; and they commended the authorities’ intention to
privatize the telecommunications and electricity companies. Directors welcomed the authorities’
plans to streamline import duty and tax concessions, and encouraged the authorities to consider
the progressive introduction of a value added tax or a domestic consumption tax to replace
trade taxes.
Directors were of the view that the fixed exchange rate has served The Bahamas well,
particularly by enhancing the investment climate and keeping inflation low. They welcomed the

3
indications that competitiveness is adequate, and noted the strong national consensus in favor
of safeguarding the peg.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to gradually remove exchange controls. They
emphasized that this process will need to be supported by an appropriate macroeconomic
policy framework, an adequate level of international reserves, and a strong financial regulatory
and prudential framework. In this regard, Directors welcomed the central bank’s actions to curb
credit growth, both to allow a build-up of international reserves and to reduce the economy’s
vulnerability to shocks. Directors encouraged the use of market-based monetary policy
instruments to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy, make credit allocation more
efficient, and help develop the domestic capital market. They supported continued technical
assistance from the IMF and the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Center to improve
the central bank’s operational framework.
Directors observed that The Bahamas’ financial system remains sound and well regulated. They
commended the authorities’ efforts to further strengthen the regulatory and supervisory
framework and bring it to international standards, including by modernizing the regime to
combat money laundering and terrorism financing and introducing a risk-based approach to
supervision.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2007 Article IV Consultation with The Bahamas is also available.
