IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with New Zealand
On February 5, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with New Zealand.
The economy’s strong growth after the global financial crisis has been supported by rising terms
of trade and reconstruction activity after the 2010–11 Canterbury earthquakes, as well as high net
immigration. Growth peaked at 3.5 percent year-on-year (y/y) in Q4 2014, bringing output
slightly above potential. However, the tailwinds have recently waned. In 2014, dairy prices
began to fall from historic highs, leading to a sharp drop in income growth after the positive
effect of declining oil prices had worn off, and investment activity related to the Canterbury
rebuild has reached a plateau. As a result, output growth is estimated to have slowed to
2.3 percent in 2015, despite resilient consumption. Meanwhile, unemployment has been edging
up reaching 6 percent in Q3 2015. Due largely to the decline in oil prices, inflation has dropped
to 0.3 percent (y/y) in Q3 2015. House price inflation in Auckland has remained high, driven
fundamentally by supply shortages.
The exchange rate depreciation has cushioned some of the impact of the decline in dairy prices.
The bilateral exchange rate against the U.S. dollar has depreciated as dairy prices fell and the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) eased monetary policy. The depreciation has mitigated
the impact of the international dairy price decline on farmers’ incomes, and supported exports of
travel and education services.
With growth below potential, measures of core inflation around the lower half of the target band,
and a still strong exchange rate, monetary policy has been eased since June and the Reserve
Bank stands ready to reduce rates further if warranted.
To manage risks arising from house price inflation in Auckland, macroprudential measures were
introduced in 2013, leading to a temporary slowdown in price hike. A package of additional

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

macroprudential regulations and tax measures was announced in May 2015, but having become
fully effective only in November. The banking sector has increased capital and liquidity buffers,
but reliance on offshore funding and a large share of mortgage lending remain sources of
vulnerability.
Fiscal policy is also supportive of the economy in the short term, while consolidation is projected
to resume in the medium-term. Automatic stabilizers have been allowed to work and public
investment is being increased. Net debt is projected to decline further to around 5 percent of
GDP in the medium term.2
With chronically low national saving, New Zealand’s economy is dependent on borrowing from
abroad. Its persistently negative savings-investment balance has led to the accumulation of a
large net negative international investment position (IIP) which reached65 percent of GDP in
2014.
The short-term outlook is challenging with both external and domestic risks, the latter arising
from rapid house price inflation in Auckland. However, New Zealand’s flexible economy is
resilient, and medium-term prospects remain positive. New Zealand’s main exports—agricultural
consumer products and tourism—should benefit from the ongoing shift to a more consumptionoriented growth model in China. Consumer demand in other Asian countries is also expected to
grow. Overall, output growth is projected to recover to its estimated potential rate of 2.5 percent.
With measures of core inflation around the lower end of the target range and expectations
consistent with the band’s midpoint, inflation is forecast to rise to within the RBNZ’s target
range of 1–3 percent in 2016.
Executive Board Assessment3
Executive Directors welcomed that New Zealand’s economy continues to perform well despite
the slowdown imposed by the fall in dairy prices, plateaued investment associated with the
Canterbury rebuild, and slower growth in trading partners. Directors agreed that New Zealand’s
sound and flexible policy frameworks, including the important buffer provided by the flexible
exchange rate, position the country well to weather the recent slowdown. Medium-term
prospects remain positive, and Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ alertness to the
downside risks and challenges arising from real estate market pressures, a persistently low
savings rate, and relatively low productivity.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors considered the current accommodative monetary stance to be appropriate and agreed
that, if needed, the authorities should stand ready for further easing given low inflationary
pressures and below potential output. With regard to fiscal policy, they agreed that the planned
easing this year and next, including through an acceleration of public investment in
infrastructure, combined with a resumption of gradual fiscal consolidation thereafter, is
appropriate. These measures should support the economy in the short term and bolster the public
sector balance sheet in the longer term.
Directors noted that the banking system is resilient and well-supervised. They commended the
proactive prudential and tax measures being taken to address the risks stemming from the
housing market. Noting that the underlying cause of the housing market boom in Auckland is a
supply/demand mismatch, they encouraged the authorities to be ready to use additional
prudential measures and consider steps to reduce the tax advantage of housing over other forms
of investments, while continuing to address supply-side bottlenecks.
Directors agreed that raising national and in particular private saving is critical to reducing
external vulnerabilities from the still heavy reliance on offshore funding. They noted that higher
saving may also reduce capital costs by lowering the risk premium and thereby support
productive investment and long-term growth. They encouraged the authorities to consider
comprehensive policy measures to boost long-term financial savings, including through reform
of retirement income policies, as this could also help deepen New Zealand’s capital markets and
broaden options for retirement planning.
Directors observed that, notwithstanding high living standards, New Zealand incomes lag those
of other advanced economies, due to relatively low capital intensity and productivity.
Acknowledging that the economy’s small size and distance from markets likely limit gains from
trade, they encouraged the authorities to build on the country’s business-friendly environment to
take steps to boost competition in key service sectors, leverage ICT more intensively, and
address key infrastructure bottlenecks. They welcomed the focus of the government’s Business
Growth Agenda on these issues.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 21, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Growth and outlook


Growth has moderated as tailwinds have waned: dairy prices have fallen sharply
from historic highs and investment activity related to the Canterbury rebuild has
reached a plateau. The short-term outlook is challenging with both external and
domestic risks, the latter arising from rapid house price inflation in Auckland.
However, New Zealand’s flexible economy is resilient, and medium-term prospects
remain positive.

Policy agenda


Monetary policy has been eased since June and the Reserve Bank stands ready to
reduce rates further if warranted. Given the below-potential growth, measures of
core inflation around the lower end of the target band, and a still strong exchange
rate, the monetary policy stance is appropriate.



Fiscal policy is also supportive of the economy in the short term, while consolidation
is projected to resume in the medium term. Automatic stabilizers have been allowed
to work and public investment is being increased. Given the current economy and
with the strength of the public sector balance sheet key to sustain investor
confidence, this fiscal path is broadly appropriate.



For monetary policy to be able to focus on the real economic cycle, the risks arising
from house price inflation in Auckland need to be managed through other tools,
including prudential and tax measures.



The banking sector has increased capital and liquidity buffers, but reliance on
offshore funding and a large share of mortgage lending remain sources of
vulnerability. Continuing to strengthen capital and moving toward more stable
sources of funding is important.



Raising national saving is key to reducing dependence on borrowing from abroad.
Comprehensive measures to encourage private long-term financial saving should be
considered, including through retirement income policies. Incentives to invest in real
estate assets should be reduced.



New Zealand’s living standard is very high but incomes lag those of peers. The
economy’s small size and distance from markets limit gains from trade, but measures
to boost competition in key sectors, strengthen skills and innovation, as well as
investment in infrastructure, should help improve productivity.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The economy’s strong growth after the global financial crisis (GFC) has been
supported by tailwinds: rising terms of trade (driven by high demand from China); and
reconstruction activity after the 2010-11 Canterbury earthquakes. More recently, population growth
driven by high net immigration also contributed, as the economy of Australia, New Zealand’s
common labor market partner, has slowed. Growth peaked at 3.5 percent y/y in Q4 2014, bringing
output slightly above potential. Due largely to the decline in oil prices, inflation has dropped to
0.1 percent (y/y) in Q4 2015.
2.
However, the tailwinds have recently waned. In 2014, dairy prices began to fall from
historic highs, leading to a sharp drop in income growth after the positive effect of declining oil
prices had worn off, and post-earthquake rebuilding activity in Canterbury has reached a plateau.




Prices for whole milk powder (WMP), one
of New Zealand’s key exports, declined
from an average of around US$4,900/MT
over 2013Q2-2014Q1 to US$1,700/MT in
August 2015, partly on account of high
inventories in China, decline in demand
from Russia, and increased global milk
supply after the European Union
abolished its production quotas.
Production cuts in New Zealand, which
provides about 60 percent of global
supply of WMP, have since supported a
partial recovery of the price to just over
US$2,300/MT in November 2015.
Post-earthquake reconstruction
investment in the Canterbury region
ramped up quickly, from NZ$1½ billion
in 2011 to NZ$4½ billion in 2014, but is
forecast to plateau at about that level
during 2015-17.

House price inflation in Auckland has remained high. House prices in Auckland (where
about one-third of the population lives) have continued their strong upward trend, rising by
22.5 percent (y/y) in December 2015, and the housing inventory available for sale remains low.
Moreover, prices in neighboring areas are beginning to accelerate as buyers are priced out of the
Auckland market. Supply shortages are a fundamental driver of house price inflation, exacerbated by
high net immigration. On the demand side, macroprudential measures introduced in 2013 have led
to a temporary slowdown in house price inflation. A package of additional macroprudential
regulations and tax measures aimed at containing risks emanating from the Auckland housing
market was announced in May 2015, but having become fully effective only in November, its
effectiveness to cool rapid house price growth is yet to be seen (Box 1).

Fiscal consolidation is broadly on track. With significant expenditure control and solid
revenue growth, an overall surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP was reached in 2014/15, well above the
budget target (which had envisaged a deficit). 1 Net debt declined slightly to 7½ percent of GDP.

Box 1. Measures to Contain Auckland House Price Risks
To contain risks arising from rapidly rising house prices to the financial sector, the RBNZ has used
macroprudential policy tools proactively.
First round (October 2013): The RBNZ placed a
temporary ‘speed limit’ on high loan-to-value
ratio (LVR) residential mortgage lending where
banks must restrict new mortgages at LVRs over
80 percent to no more than 10 percent of their
total residential mortgage lending. While house
price inflation in Auckland initially moderated in
response to the measures (and tighter monetary
policy), it accelerated again during 2015.
Second round (May 2015): The RBNZ
announced additional measures, which have
taken effect in November 2015:

Sources: QV.co.nz and staff estimates.

Residential property investors (though not owner-occupiers) in Auckland are required to have a deposit
of at least 30 percent of the purchase price.



The existing 10 percent speed limit for loans at LVRs of greater than 80 percent is retained in Auckland,
while it is increased outside of Auckland from 10 to 15 percent, to reflect the more subdued housing
market conditions there.



A new asset class for loans to residential property investors has been established, which could attract a
higher risk weighting than owner-occupier mortgages.

Tax measures announced in the 2015/16 budget presented in May also complemented the RBNZ’s
second round. They effectively apply income tax on profits from property sales for non-primary residences if
the house is bought and sold within two years. The government also announced a tightening of reporting
and taxation rules for foreign buyers.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
New Zealand’s flexible economy, underpinned by strong policy frameworks, is well-positioned to
weather the recent slowdown and manage risks, including to financial stability. Over the medium term,
raising saving remains critical to address long-standing issues associated with New Zealand’s large net
external liability position.

A. Outlook: Short-Term Challenges but Positive Medium-Term Prospects
8.
The short-term outlook is challenging. The decline in dairy prices is still feeding through
the economy, as investment and input decisions in the dairy sector continue to influence related
sectors through the rest of the milk production season (until May 2016). While New Zealand’s milk

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEW ZEALAND

production comprises less than 5 percent of GDP, its downstream and upstream footprint is
estimated to be much larger.2 On the investment side, the plateauing of reconstruction in
Canterbury and a relatively slow pick-up in infrastructure and housing construction in Auckland
imply that the contribution of investment demand to growth will be significantly reduced (Figure 1,
panel 3). More broadly, New Zealand’s main trading partners, China and Australia, have slowed,
putting downward pressure on demand for and prices of New Zealand’s exports.
9.
House price inflation has not given rise to a general credit boom. Credit to the private
sector has accelerated recently but remains moderate at 7.1 percent in the year to November, with
both housing loans and business credit growing at similar rates (Figure 2, panel 6). Going forward,
house price growth is projected to moderate, as the impact of tighter macroprudential and tax
measures sets in. This should lead to a slowdown in housing loans and an eventual decline of the
household debt-to-disposable income ratio (Box 2). At the same time, business credit is expected to
pick up further as investment accelerates in the medium term, supported by accommodative
monetary policy and a recovery in domestic-currency export prices.
10.
Fiscal policy is supportive of the economy in the short term, while consolidation is
projected to resume in the medium term. In 2015/16 and 2016/17, weaker revenue growth and
higher public investment are expected to return the budget to deficit (of about ½ percent of GDP
each year), providing significant stimulus to the economy. In the medium term, the authorities’ fiscal
plans envisage significant expenditure control through improvements in the efficiency of recurrent
as well as capital spending, while maintaining revenue broadly constant as a share of GDP. In
2017/18, the budget is projected to be broadly in balance, and from 2018/19 in surplus which
gradually increase to about 1 percent of GDP. Net debt is forecast to decline to about 5½ percent of
GDP by 2019/20.
11.
New Zealand’s economy is resilient and its financial sector sound. Business and
consumer confidence indicators have recently picked up again, and consumption remains solid and
net immigration strong.


The flexible exchange rate provides an important buffer. The depreciation of the NZ dollar is
cushioning some of the impact of dairy price declines, and supports exports of education and
tourism services, which constitute around one-fifth of total exports and continue to grow
rapidly, as well as manufacturing.



In the agricultural sector, farmers are well-experienced and can employ a range of measures
(e.g., delaying capital expenditure, using cheaper feed, reducing labor costs, culling cows) to
adapt to lower prices, and banks continue to support the sector, taking a medium-term
approach to borrower’s viability.

Box 2. Macro-Financial Outlook and Risks
The housing sector is central in assessing New Zealand’s outlook and risks, considering risks
stemming from high price inflation in Auckland, high concentration of mortgage loans in banks’
asset books, and high levels of household debt. Staff’s analysis, using a model of house prices based
on economic fundamentals, suggests that house prices and household debt are to moderate over the
medium term, containing financial sector risks in the baseline scenario.

as a whole is expected to slow down, New
Zealand’s main exports—agricultural consumer products and tourism—should benefit from the
ongoing shift to a more consumption-oriented growth model in China. Consumer demand in other
Asian countries is also expected to grow along with their income levels, and net exports to benefit
from the weaker exchange rate. Overall, while output growth is estimated to have slowed to
2¼ percent in 2015, slightly below potential, it is projected to recover to its estimated potential rate
of 2½ percent, based on total factor productivity (TFP) and capital input growth in line with long run
historical averages, and moderately declining growth of labor input consistent with the projected
slowing of working age population growth (with migration fluctuating in line with historical
experience). With inflation expectations consistent with the midpoint of the RBNZ’s target range of
1-3 percent, inflation is forecast to rise to within the band in 2016, as the impact of the decline in oil
prices drops out, the depreciation of the NZ dollar passes through, and fiscal stimulus is adding to
demand, and then gradually converge to the center of the band.

B. Risks: Tilted to the Downside
13.
While overall prospects are positive, risks are significant and tilted to the downside
(Annex II).


Dairy prices. A renewed decline in dairy prices could threaten some higher-cost dairy producers.
While New Zealand’s dairy sector as a whole has coped with significant price swings in the past,
debt in the sector is concentrated among a relatively small group of farms. At the end of the
2013–14 season, 10 percent of farms accounted for around one-third of the total sectoral debt
and these may constitute a pocket of vulnerability. The impact of this on financial stability,
however, would likely be limited.



China spillovers. A sharper-than-expected slowdown in China that significantly affects consumer
spending could reduce New Zealand’s exports and may lead to the exit of some farmers and
attendant repercussions on the financial sector. In addition, it would also likely adversely affect
Australia, New Zealand’s second-largest destination for exports.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

NEW ZEALAND



El Niño. The El Niño weather pattern is well entrenched. While irrigation is spreading, some
agricultural areas are reliant on rainfall. Should a drought occur there, agricultural output could
be significantly affected.



House prices. If the authorities’ measures fail to cool house price inflation in Auckland, the
housing market could be increasingly driven by self-reinforcing demand dynamics which could
eventually lead to a sudden sharp correction in house prices, with adverse effects on the
financial sector (residential mortgages represent about 50-60 percent of banks’ assets) and the
wider economy. High levels of household debt—with a large share of mortgages carrying
adjustable rates—also imply that a rise in interest rates could strain their ability to service debts,
squeeze disposable income and consumption, and trigger declines in house prices.



Financial market volatility. U.S. monetary policy normalization may lead to unexpected bouts of
higher global financial market volatility. This could lead to an abrupt depreciation, higher
financing costs and/or a period of very poor liquidity in international financial markets.

14.
There are also upside risks. A stronger-than-anticipated supply response to housing
demand could pave the way for a smoother deceleration of house price inflation while supporting
growth, and a recovery in dairy prices would boost incomes and investment. Continued high net
immigration could pose challenges for short-term economic management, but in the longer run
would boost growth.
15.
There is ample policy space to respond. Should downside risks materialize, the RBNZ has
scope to ease interest rates further. The low level of public debt would allow even more supportive
fiscal policy if warranted. The flexible exchange rate provides an important buffer, and the financial
system is less vulnerable than before the GFC. Broadly, financial system stress tests suggest it is able
to withstand—at least in the short term—adverse developments related to China spillovers, dairy
prices, and the housing market (Box 3), even though public support may be needed in an extreme
scenario.
16.
More broadly, with chronically low national saving, New Zealand’s economy is
dependent on borrowing from abroad. Its persistently negative saving-investment balance has
led to the accumulation of a large net negative international investment (IIP) position (65 percent of
GDP in 2014), and requires to a significant extent financing by bank borrowing from abroad. While
the net IIP position has improved from a negative 85 percent of GDP in 2009—supported by the
payouts from international reinsurers after the Canterbury earthquake as well as strong deposit
growth—this still renders the economy susceptible to swings in international financial markets (even
though foreign exchange exposures are mostly hedged or in domestic currency), and is estimated to
lead to higher capital costs.

Authorities’ Views
17.
The authorities broadly concurred with the staff’s assessment of the outlook and risks,
though they viewed risks as more balanced. They emphasized that at the current juncture the

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEW ZEALAND

degree of uncertainty, including with regard to dairy prices, immigration, and the impact of El Niño
was unusually high.


Dairy prices: the authorities noted that dairy markets had a history of volatility. They stressed,
however, that the dairy industry has gone through rounds of structural changes coping with the
volatility, and has become more competitive and resilient, with increasingly professional
management and new investment.



Immigration: they noted that the current situation, in which net emigration to Australia was at an
all-time low, was unusual, and that they expected it to pick up as growth in Australia rebounds.
However, should high net immigration continue, this would support growth in the longer run
even if it posed challenges—notably by increasing pressure in the housing market—in the short
run.



El Niño: the authorities indicated that the El Niño weather pattern was well established, but its
impact as yet uncertain. The spread of irrigation had reduced the risk associated with drought.
Box 3. Stress Testing the New Zealand Financial Sector

Over the past years, the RBNZ has conducted regular stress tests of the New Zealand banking system, focused
on housing price busts, interest rate spikes and a protracted decline in dairy prices. The Australian Prudential
Regulatory Authority collaborated on the subsidiaries of Australian banks, which play dominant roles in New
Zealand.
House price bust and interest rate spike. In the house price decline scenario, a sharp slowdown in
economic growth in China triggers a severe double-dip recession. Real GDP declines by around 4 percent,
and unemployment peaks at just over 13 percent. House prices decline by 40 percent nationally, with a more
marked fall in Auckland. The agricultural sector is also hit by a combination of a 40 percent fall in land prices
and a 33 percent fall in commodity prices. The RBNZ also considered a scenario where the interest rate is
sharply higher, resulting in increased unemployment and higher borrowing costs.
In these scenarios banks face higher funding costs and credit losses, with a significant adverse impact on
profitability and capital ratios. Losses on residential mortgages account for around one-third of total credit
losses. The aggregate Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio falls by around 3 percentage points though all
banks remain above the minimum CET1 capital requirement of 4.5 percent. Losses are greater than the
capital held for housing for the internal ratings based risk weight banks and almost all banks would use
capital conservation buffers and face constraints on dividend and bonus payouts. Even though CET1
requirements are not breached, it is unlikely that New Zealand would have a fully-functioning banking
system as banks with substantially reduced capital ratios would be severely constrained in their ability to
raise funding (both in availability and pricing), and hence in their ability to advance credit. In such a scenario,
the lower credit extended by banks would also have an adverse impact on real GDP growth and would likely
lead to higher fiscal deficits.
Low dairy prices. In the stress scenarios, milk prices are substantially below recent averages and farm gate
prices are assumed to fall by around 40 percent by 2018-19. This will result in higher loss rates, estimated
around 2-14 percent of all dairy lending. The banks would incur losses amounting to 2-18 percent of pre-tax
profits, highlighting the need for increased provisioning, but the impact would be manageable from a
financial stability perspective.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

NEW ZEALAND



House prices: they pointed to stress tests that suggested banks would be able to withstand a
severe shock to house prices, output, and dairy prices, but noted that in a severe scenario credit
supply could become constrained.



Financial market volatility: while acknowledging the risks, the authorities noted that New
Zealand’s banking system had weathered the GFC relatively well, and stressed that capital ratios
have improved and the use of wholesale funding was significantly reduced since then.

18.
The authorities broadly shared the staff’s assessment of longer-term vulnerabilities
and higher capital costs arising from low saving. While they pointed out that this is a longstanding feature of the economy and that net external liabilities had been reduced substantially
after the GFC, they shared the staff’s concerns and indicated that they would consider measures to
raise savings.

POLICIES
Monetary and fiscal policy settings are broadly appropriate. Automatic stabilizers have been allowed to
operate, and public investment is accelerated where possible. Prudential and tax measures should be
used to increase the maneuvering room for monetary policy. In the medium term, steps to raise
national savings, boost productive investment, and further strengthen the financial sector should be
considered.

A. Short-Term Macroeconomic and Risk Management
19.
A strong public sector balance sheet ultimately underpins confidence in New Zealand’s
economy. In this regard, while public debt is already low (Annex III), the authorities’ planned
medium-term fiscal consolidation path is broadly appropriate, envisaging an improvement of the
cyclically adjusted balance by about 1/3 percent of GDP annually from 2016/17 onward over the
next few years. However, in the short run, with the economy below potential and ample fiscal policy
space, the authorities’ planned fiscal stimulus through automatic stabilizers and increased public
investment is timely. In particular, investments to support a boost in housing supply in Auckland,
and infrastructure improvements to address bottlenecks would also help ease house price inflation,
and improve the productivity of the economy. This should be facilitated by the recently completed
national 30-year infrastructure investment plan, which provides a strategic framework for
infrastructure investment decisions.
20.
Monetary policy should focus on price stability while paying due regard to economic
growth. With the below-potential growth, measures of core inflation around the lower end of the
target band, and a still strong exchange rate, the RBNZ’s recent easing and its continued readiness
to ease further are appropriate. Using monetary policy to ‘lean against the wind’ could be
considered as part of a broader strategy to rein in financial stability risks only if financial stability
risks become broad based and prudential policy is insufficient to contain them. Even in this case, the
benefits would need to be weighed against the output costs and the risk of policy reversals, though
further prudential and tax measures to reduce incentives to invest in housing could ease these
trade-offs.
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEW ZEALAND

21.
For monetary policy to be able to focus on the real economic cycle, the risks arising
from further house price inflation in Auckland need to be managed through other policy
measures. The underlying issue is a supply/demand mismatch. Intensifying efforts already underway
to boost higher-density housing, and increase the supply of land and infrastructure in the city would
be welcome, including through better local/central government coordination and measures to
discourage land hoarding (which could include higher land taxes), but even then the supply
response will be slow. Therefore, in the interim, to buy time, other measures can usefully be
employed:


Prudential measures: Housing market risks are serious, and need to be proactively addressed.
While the impact of the newly introduced macroprudential and tax measures will need to be
evaluated, the authorities should prepare further steps in advance, should they be needed. This
could include targeted higher risk weights on housing loans, higher down payments, and a
formal debt serviceability test, as deployed in other advanced economies in the Asia-Pacific
region that have experienced rapid house price growth.



Tax measures: The newly introduced measures to deter speculative investment are welcome, and
further steps in this direction (e.g., by widening the scope within which a resale of real estate is
deemed for a business purpose and the proceeds taxable) could be envisaged. In addition, the
incentives for buying real estate increase when real estate investors can write off interest
payments against their other taxable income. This ‘negative gearing’ encourages investment that
would otherwise be loss making, and thereby acts as an amplifier of price movements in the real
estate market. Ring-fencing housing losses to within real estate earnings would therefore
weaken an important price driver.

22.
The financial system has markedly improved its capital and liquidity buffers since the
GFC, but challenges remain. The major banks have a large proportion of their assets in residential
mortgages and rely on broadly similar business models. Banks have continued to reduce their
reliance on short-term offshore funding markets, resulting in a rise in the core funding ratio from
78 percent in 2010 to 86 percent in 2015, mainly through increased deposit funding. With regard to
capitalization, all banks currently exceed Basel III capital requirements, with strong profitability.
Stress tests indicate that even under very adverse scenarios, banks’ CET1 capital remains above the
minimum requirement. Nonetheless, a reduction in collateral values and loss absorbing capital could
prompt banks to rebuild buffers, leading to reduced credit provision to the economy. To improve
the resilience of the sector and reduce vulnerabilities stemming from the reliance on offshore
funding, it is important to continue strengthening capital buffers and moving toward more stable
sources of funding. Staff welcomes the planned review of financial sector capital levels in 2016.
Moreover, the planned FSAP in 2016 will also assess financial sector resilience. Even after the recent
growth in size and depth, New Zealand’s capital markets remains small by international standards
and the banking system continues to dominate funding for firms. Further development of both
equity and bond markets, including retirement products, should remain a policy priority.
23.
Should any of the risks outlined above materialize, macroeconomic policy responses
would need to be adjusted. A sharp slowdown in the economy driven by key export markets could
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

NEW ZEALAND

warrant a monetary and, if severe enough, a coordinated fiscal policy response. A severe downturn
in the housing market may also call for supportive demand policies. Similarly, a period of extremely
low liquidity in financial markets or an excessive risk premium required by international investors
could call for both monetary and fiscal support.

Authorities’ Views
24.
The authorities emphasized their commitment to reducing net debt. While low
compared to other advanced economies, they felt that a small open economy like New Zealand
needed particularly strong buffers and that the government has an important role to play given the
economy’s net external liabilities. While keeping its fiscal strategy unchanged, the government has
updated some of its short-term intentions and long-term objectives to provide scope for the fiscal
position to fluctuate in response to changing economic circumstances. The intention is to reduce
net debt in national definition to around 20 percent of GDP by 2020, and to within a range of 0 to
20 percent of GDP over a longer time horizon. The authorities also emphasized their efforts to
enhance the efficiency of both capital and current spending, the latter through a ‘social investment’
approach which takes into account costs and benefits of social policy interventions over a 20-year
horizon. The authorities were ready to let automatic stabilizers—which largely work on the revenue
side—operate fully, and have announced an additional NZ$1 billion of capital spending given the
pipeline of high-quality investment priorities. This could help alleviate housing market and
infrastructure pressures in Auckland.
25.
The RBNZ reaffirmed its accommodative stance. While they expect interest rates to now
be on hold for some time, they stand ready to ease further should circumstances warrant. They
confirmed that monetary policy was focused on price stability, with due regard to output growth,
but at the same time, they pointed to the limits of monetary policy in fine-tuning the economy. With
regard to house price inflation, they indicated that they were strengthening their collection of data
to enhance analysis of mortgage lending, and suggested that they would need to assess the impact
of the most recent macroprudential and tax measures on the housing market and mortgage lending
before deciding on possible additional measures. While pointing to stress tests indicating that banks
can withstand a sizeable shock to house prices, the terms of trade, and economic activity, the
authorities agreed on the importance of maintaining strong capital and stable sources of funding
buffers.

B. Medium-Term Policies: Increasing Resilience and Raising Incomes
26.
Raising national saving is key to reducing external vulnerabilities and raising potential
growth. With government saving broadly adequate and higher than those of peers, policy measures
would need to concentrate on raising private savings. Higher savings would, through lower capital
costs, raise potential growth over time due to higher productive capital investment and increased
TFP, and would improve the IIP, rendering the economy less susceptible to external developments.
27.
Comprehensive measures to encourage long-term private financial saving should be
considered. Such measures would need to be embedded in the current tax system, which
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEW ZEALAND

epitomizes the principle of ‘broad-base low-rate’ taxation, but need not be confined to tax
measures. A key instrument could be modifications to the Kiwisaver scheme, which was introduced
in 2007. Options include broadening coverage, changing default settings to nudge participants
toward higher contributions, restricting access to funds before retirement (including for buying a
first home), raising employer contributions, raising the minimum level of employee contributions,
reduce taxation of contributions or returns, and promote a wider variety of financial investment
options. This could also help deepen New Zealand’s capital markets and broaden options for
retirement planning. In addition to changes to the Kiwisaver scheme, modifications to the universal
pension system could also be considered, including the introduction of a means test.
28.
Incentives to invest in real estate assets should be reduced. The tax-preferred treatment
of housing diverts savings into real estate assets, increasing costs for business investment. In this
regard, the measures outlined above to reduce the tax advantage of real estate investment
(reducing the scope for ‘negative gearing’ and widening the scope of applicability of income
taxation on profits from property sales for non-primary residences) would also help promote
financial savings.
29.
New Zealand’s living standard is
very high but incomes lag those of other
advanced economies. Its income per capita
remains at the low end of advanced OECD
economies. While New Zealand’s small size
and distance from markets likely play a role in
limiting gains from trade (Box 4), there is
some room to alter other structural factors to
increase investment in productive capital,
thereby increasing the currently low capital
intensity and TFP.

Despite the implementation of
successful structural reforms in the 1980s, productivity levels have remained low compared to
OECD peers. To raise productivity, the government’s Business Growth Agenda has identified a
number of policy priorities. Specifically, the Productivity Commission has highlighted the need to
raise productivity in the services sector (which comprises 70 percent of GDP). Measures include
boosting competition in key sectors such as finance, real estate, retail, and business and other
professional services; and leveraging ICT technology more intensively, including by enhancing skills.
With New Zealand ranked 2nd in the World Bank’s 2016 Doing Business report, there is limited scope
for simple measures to boost productivity, but the authorities’ focus on the services sector as well as
on ICT as a means to reduce the costs of distance is appropriate. Higher saving (see above) may also
boost long-term growth by lowering capital costs for businesses, thus supporting higher productive
investment. This would be reinforced if incentives for investing in real estate were to be reduced and
options for financial savings broadened.

Box 4. The Impact of Distance
New Zealand’s distance from markets has limited productivity, resulting in below-OECD average incomes,
even though its sound institutions and policies could have made it a top performer Enhanced efforts would be
needed to overcome this handicap.
From the 2000s, New Zealand has lagged
behind top OECD countries in output per
worker by 20–25 percent. This gap can be
explained by both substantial productivity
gaps and lower levels of capital. While the
latter may be partly influenced by the low
savings rate (and higher interest rates), the
productivity gap is striking, particularly when
taking into account New Zealand’s sound
institutional and policy settings: New
Zealand’s per capita should be 20 percent
above the OECD average based on structural
policy settings, not 20 percent below (NZPC,
April 2014).1/

Trade and Market Access

New Zealand’s distance from markets
appears to be a key factor. It could affect
productivity through limits on the potential to
exploit scale economies and agglomeration
effects, higher transport costs, and by
reducing trade intensity. These factors may
explain more than half of New Zealand’s
productivity gap compared to 20 selected
OECD countries and is estimated to cost
around 12 percent of GDP relative to other
developed countries (Boulhol and de Serres,
2010). 2/

Overcoming the disadvantages of distance may require enhanced efforts. Integration into global value
chains in industries and services with fast-paced innovation, particularly in high-value added (and less
location-dependent) aspects such as design and R&D would be required. Further easing telecom and air
transport regulation may help reduce the distance disadvantage, including for service exports, for which
New Zealand is relatively well positioned.

Authorities’ Views
32.
The authorities agreed that raising national saving was an important policy objective.
They indicated that they had explored this issue in depth, and would consider measures to boost
private saving—without jeopardizing their solid fiscal position—in the future. They also pointed to
measures already taken to reduce incentives for investing in real estate, and indicated that
consideration could be given to expanding these. At the same time, they were keen to protect the
integrity, simplicity and ‘broad base, low rates’ approach of the tax system, and were skeptical about
the effectiveness of fiscal incentives. They were also concerned about transitional issues and the
distributional impact of changes to the tax system, but agreed that such issues could at least
partially be addressed through a comprehensive approach to reform. Moreover, they pointed out
that key tax measures to significantly disincentivize investment in housing were politically difficult.
33.
They concurred that raising productivity was critical. With New Zealand among the most
business-friendly economies in the world, they saw little scope for ‘big bang’ reforms, but explained
that they were advancing a broad-based Business Growth Agenda to strengthen skills and
innovation, as well as investment and infrastructure, while using natural resources sustainably. They
also aimed to boost exports, as a means to foster competitiveness. The authorities also saw
improvements in the efficiency of both recurrent and capital public spending as a key tool to
contain fiscal costs while improving outcomes.

STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Outlook. As tailwinds wane, the short-term outlook is challenging. Dairy prices have fallen
from historic highs and the investment associated with the Canterbury rebuild is plateauing, while
trading partner growth has slowed. However, New Zealand’s resilient and flexible economy is well
positioned to weather the recent slowdown. The flexible exchange rate is an important buffer to
help the economy adjust. Underpinned by strong policy frameworks, medium-term prospects
remain positive.
35.
Risks. There are significant downside risks, including a renewed decline in dairy prices,
spillovers from a sharper-than-anticipated slowdown in China, the impact of El Niño on agriculture,
a sharp correction in house prices, and financial market volatility related to monetary policy
normalization in the U.S. However, the well capitalized banking system, under strong RBNZ
supervision, is assessed to be able to withstand severe stress scenarios, although it continues to face
long-standing structural issues related to reliance on offshore funding and a large share of
mortgage lending. Moreover, there is ample monetary and fiscal policy space to respond, should it
become necessary.
36.
Macroeconomic management. Given low inflationary pressures, output below potential,
and unemployment edging up, the RBNZ’ accommodative monetary stance, including its readiness
to ease further if warranted, is appropriate. With regard to fiscal policy, continued strengthening of
the public sector balance sheet with a firm commitment to the medium-term objective of reducing
debt further should help underpin confidence in New Zealand’s economy. The authorities’ fiscal
easing this year and next, including through an acceleration of public investment in infrastructure,
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

NEW ZEALAND

combined with a resumption of a gradual fiscal consolidation path thereafter, is broadly appropriate
to support the economy in the short term while bolstering the public sector balance sheet in the
longer term. If risks were to materialize, macroeconomic policies would need to be adjusted: a sharp
slowdown in the economy could warrant a monetary and, if severe enough, a coordinated fiscal
policy response.
37.
Financial stability. Risks stemming from the housing market are serious, and staff welcomes
the proactive macroprudential measures to address them. While the underlying cause of the
housing market boom in Auckland is a supply/demand mismatch, self-reinforcing price dynamics
may emerge and eventually lead to a sudden sharp correction in house prices, with adverse effects
on the financial sector. Intensifying efforts to boost housing and the supply of land and infrastructure in the city is therefore critical. But since such measures, even if accelerated, will take time,
other policy steps are needed for monetary policy to be able to focus on the real economic cycle.


Prudential: While some time will be needed to fully assess the impact of the recent
macroprudential and tax measures, additional steps should be prepared in advance, in case they
are needed.



Tax measures: The newly announced measures to strengthen the applicability of income taxation
on profits from property sales are welcome, but more comprehensive steps to reduce the tax
advantage of housing over other forms of investments should be considered, including by
reducing the scope for ‘negative gearing’ and increasing taxation of land.

38.
Saving and investment. Raising national saving is critical to reducing external
vulnerabilities. In particular, higher private and especially household saving (which are low compared
to peers) would improve the IIP. At the same time, higher saving may also reduce capital costs by
lowering the risk premium and thereby support productive investment and long-term growth.
Comprehensive policy measures to encourage private long-term financial saving should be actively
considered, including through reform of retirement income policies. Options include changing the
parameters of the Kiwisaver scheme—e.g., default settings, access to funds, contributions, and
taxation—to increase coverage and contributions while containing fiscal costs, and adjustment of
parameters of the public pension system. This could also help deepen New Zealand’s capital
markets and broaden options for retirement planning.
39.
Productivity. Notwithstanding high living standards, New Zealand incomes lag those of
other advanced economies, due to relatively low capital intensity and TFP. The economy’s small size
and distance from markets likely limit gains from trade, but leveraging ICT technology more
intensively, including by enhancing skills, could mitigate the impact of this handicap. Moreover,
measures to boost competition in key sectors such as finance, real estate, retail, and business and
other professional services should help raise productivity and incomes. In addition, public
investment to address key infrastructure bottlenecks should help improve productivity. These steps
should effectively supplement the macro-economic measures to reduce the longstanding savinginvestment imbalance described above.

New Zealand has historically had a large
negative IIP position and run persistent current
account deficits. This reflects a long standing
structural savings-investment imbalance, with
a relatively low savings rate compared to other
advanced economies. The current account has
been gradually widening since 2010, and hit
3¼ percent of GDP in 2014. The deficit is
projected to widen to 4.8 percent of GDP in
2015 as sharply lower commodity prices
weaken the goods balance. As a result, the net

More recently, by December 2015 commodity
prices, including dairy, had declined by
23 percent relative to the 2014 average, and
by 20 percent since the recent peak in March
2015. Concurrently, by August 2015 the tradeweighted real exchange rate had depreciated
by 13 percent compared to the 2014 average,
and by 10 percent since March 2015. Among
other short term factors influencing the
exchange rate, equity and bond funds net
inflows appear to have recovered year-to-date
in 2015, after falling sharply off the peak in
2012.

Aug 2005

Historically, New Zealand’s real exchange rate has tended to reflect movements in prices of its key
commodity exports. For instance, over the commodity price cycles between February 2009 and
January 2015, commodity prices rose nearly

foreign liabilities to GDP are expected to widen slightly from just under 65 percent in 2014 to nearly
66 percent in 2015.
Against this backdrop, the IMF’s model based approaches that attempt to relate the REER to macro
fundamentals and policy gaps from desired policy settings suggest that the gap between current
REER level and the level implied by fundamentals may have narrowed compared to assessments of
overvaluation in the range of 5-15 percent prior to the recent declines in commodity prices and
exchange rates, now more in the range of 0-10 percent, though there are uncertainties around these
estimates.


The REER index regression that directly relates
the REER index to medium term fundamentals
and policy gaps suggests that in September
2015, the exchange rate is still about 5 percent
above the value implied by fundamentals and
desired policy settings. 3 percent of the gap was
attributed to policy gaps, and 2 percent to
regression residuals. Compared to the 2014
assessment, this shows a narrowing of the REER
gap.

This approach suggests the REER was above
levels implied by fundamentals by between 0-10 percent1 given a projected current account
deficit wider than the estimated current account norm by around ¼ – 2¼ percent in 2015.2



Finally, stabilizing net external liabilities at the projected level of 65.8 percent of GDP in 2015
would require current account deficits to average around 3¼ percent of GDP over the medium
term. This suggests that the real exchange rate would have to depreciate further by about 7
percent.

Overall, the external position is assessed to be moderately weaker than the level consistent with
medium term fundamentals and desirable policy settings.

Based on an EBA estimate of the elasticity of the current account to the REER of -0.2 (consistent with a recent
Treasury estimate in Treasury Working Paper 14/12), and a mean estimate of -0.4 as suggested by RBNZ Analytical
Note AN 2012/08.

2

The EBA estimated current account norm (deficit) in September 2015 is 1¾ percent of GDP, which appears to be
low given that New Zealand has historically run current account deficits averaging 3¾ percent of GDP. A norm closer
to the historical average would imply a smaller current account gap relative to the projected 2015 deficit, and a less
overvalued exchange rate.

Orderly tapering would likely beneficial for the economy,
supporting a further depreciation of the exchange rate, even
though the impact may be limited given asymmetric monetary
policies. However, a bumpy exit from unconventional monetary
policies and bouts of market volatility would likely raise the cost
of New Zealand's offshore wholesale borrowing. Supportive
fiscal and monetary policies may be needed.

Reduced dairy output would affect growth, though likely

A broader slowdown in emerging markets, especially in the

China is the top destination for New Zealand's exports, leaving
growth prospects exposed to its economic outlook. While the
effect on demand for consumer goods in China is likely limited
as the economy continues to rebalance, a sharp slowdown in
China would affect New Zealand directly through the terms of
trade and indirectly through its impact on Australia, New
Zealand's second-largest trade partner. However, the flexible
exchange rate serves as a buffer against terms of trade shocks.

contribute to high house prices in New Zealand, a sudden price

triggering a downward spiral of lower confidence, deteriorating
balance sheets, and slowing activity. A further tightening of

EXTERNAL RISKS
Sharp asset price adjustment and decrompression of credit spreads
Investors reassess underlying risk and respond to
unanticipated changes in growth and financial
fundamentals in large economies, Fed policy rate
path, and increases in U.S. term premia, with poor
market liquidity amplifying volatility.

El Niño
El Niño-induced drought affects agricultural areas
dependent on rainfall.

Sharper-than-expected global growth slowdown

Upside: dairy price recovery
A recovery in dairy prices would boost incomes.

DOMESTIC RISKS
Sharp house price correction
Self-reinforcing demand dynamics in the housing
market could lead to a sudden price correction,
affecting the financial system and the economy.

Upside: strong housing supply response
Stronger administrative action leads to a decisive
pickup of building consents and contruction in
Auckland, leading to a gradual reduction of the
supply shortage.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative
likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability
between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the
time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. "Short term" and "medium term" are meant to indicate that the
risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Statement by Vicki Plater, Alternate Executive Director for New Zealand
February 5, 2016
The New Zealand economy is flexible and resilient and has continued to perform well in
the face of shocks. As growth slowed during 2015, macroeconomic policy has responded
to the changing outlook; as staff note, current policy settings are appropriate and provide
room to move further if downside risks eventuate. The authorities note that it is a period
of considerable uncertainty and they are alert to the array of risks that could eventuate,
including potential upside risk. Stress testing indicates that the financial sector generally
remains robust to potential risks, such as prolonged weak dairy prices or risks from the
housing market, with macroprudential policies fulfilling their role in helping insulate the
financial sector from risks to housing prices. Fundamentally, however, rapid house price
growth reflects a shortage of supply. The authorities are strongly focused on lifting
productivity and domestic savings. There are no simple policy levers to address these
issues, and rather continuing to progress incremental reforms across a range of areas
will be needed to help see a meaningful and sustainable lift in New Zealand’s income
levels over the medium-term.
I thank staff for a constructive mission and thorough Article IV report. My authorities value
the Article IV process and the international experience and cross-country perspectives that
the Fund can bring. The New Zealand authorities broadly concur with staff’s outlook and
analysis and generally agree with the recommendations put forward in the Article IV report.
Economic Outlook and Risks
While slowing in 2015, the economy remains resilient. New Zealand recorded its sixth
year of consistent annual growth in 2015, albeit softening from 2014’s above-potential
3.7 percent growth to slightly below potential (around 2.5 percent). Key factors are falling
commodity export prices - most notably, the 65 percent drop in dairy prices in USD terms
between February 2014 and August 2015 - and as the contribution to growth from the
reconstruction activity in Christchurch begins to wane1. The economy is responding,
supported by policy adjustments. The flexible exchange rate is acting as a buffer, having
depreciated over 25 percent against the USD since June 2014. Farmers have lowered dairy
production in response to the price signal. Strong growth in tourism has helped underpin
services. While economic activity was subdued in the first half of 2015, indicators have
turned more positive since August: international dairy prices have shown a modest if fragile
recovery and consumer and business confidence have both improved. Continuing record
levels of net migration demonstrate confidence in the economy. Employment growth has
moderated in line with economic activity and unemployment had trended up slightly to
1

The total cost of the 2010 and 2011 Canterbury earthquakes is estimated to be approximately 15 percent of
GDP.

2
6.0 percent, in part reflecting strong labour force growth increasing spare capacity. The
unemployment rate did drop back to 5.3 percent in December on the back of relatively strong
employment growth and lower participation. Wage and price pressures are muted and
inflation expectations are well-anchored.
Growth is expected to remain below potential at around 2-2.5 percent before picking up
later in 2016. Accommodative monetary policy is expected to stimulate the domestic
economy while exports – particularly of services – benefit from the depreciation of the New
Zealand dollar. While the NZ dollar depreciation has not fully offset the fall in international
dairy prices, it is a helpful fillip for exporters of a number of other commodities,
manufacturing products and services (particularly to the US market) and import-competing
firms. Global prices of agricultural-based commodities have fallen less than prices of energy
and industrial commodities, and some agriculture sectors – such as horticulture and
viticulture are performing well. Agriculture commodity prices are expected to recover
modestly over time.
We concur with Staff that there are a number of risks and uncertainties to the
economic outlook, although the New Zealand authorities see more potential for upside.
Upside risks include the potential for net migration to run stronger for longer (forecasts
assume that net migration will ease back from record levels as the relative performance of the
Australian economy lifts, but outturns have persistently surprised); and domestic
consumption could be stronger if households spend more freely on the back of recent house
price gains. Downside risks could emerge from the current strong El Niño, weaker global
growth and financial market volatility, while the near-term prospects for dairy prices remain
a key factor in the outlook. While slower growth in China and other parts of emerging Asia
would have an impact, including indirectly via Australia, New Zealand is well positioned to
benefit from China’s transition towards more consumption-oriented growth given New
Zealand’s export basket of predominantly consumer goods and services. That does not
discount the potential that global transitions could be bumpy.
Domestically, high house prices represent a risk although macroprudential measures,
and the clearer application of tax rules on property transactions, provide some space
for the fundamental supply shortages to be addressed. As the tax measures (including the
“bright line” test clarifying existing tax rules on taxation on gains from residential property
sold within two years of purchase) only came into effect from 1 October 2015, and the
changes to the RBNZ’s macroprudential policies (including requiring residential property
investors in Auckland to have a deposit of at least 30 percent) only took effect from 1
November 2015, it is too early to tell their impact. We are also conscious that
macroprudential policy has limitations – it can buy time but cannot address the underlying
challenge of a housing shortage in Auckland, which is further exacerbated by strong

3
migration.2 The authorities are not immediately looking to develop additional
macroprudential measures. A range of efforts are underway to help secure the housing
supply response needed, including streamlining the approvals process to bring more land to
market for housing developments, increasing the density of some Government social
housing, and additional capital spending (see below) to address infrastructure bottlenecks. At
the regional level a necessary element will be changes to zoning restrictions in Auckland City
to enable higher density housing, decisions on which (in the proposed Auckland Unitary
Plan) are due later in 2016. The Productivity Commission’s inquiries on Using Land for
Housing and Better Urban Planning are also relevant.
The authorities are alert to downside risks and potential volatility and have
considerable policy space if required. The exchange rate remains an important buffer.
Monetary Policy
Monetary policy is supporting economic activity and remains appropriate, with the
exchange rate depreciation also assisting the adjustment. In response to the weaker
inflation and growth outlook, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) lowered the policy
interest rate by 100 basis points during 2015 to 2.5 percent. Interest rate settings will
continue to be accommodative. At the end of January, the RBNZ stated that “some further
policy easing may be required over the coming year to ensure that future average inflation
settles near the middle of the (1 to 3 percent) target range”. Although headline CPI was 0.1
percent in 2015, estimates of core inflation have centered around 1.5 percent and inflation
expectations remain well-anchored – key given the RBNZ’s forward looking focus for
inflation. Nevertheless the RBNZ is monitoring conditions closely. The depreciation in the
New Zealand dollar (over 25 percent against the USD to date although more modest on a
trade weighted basis) is providing an important adjustment mechanism. The depreciation in
the exchange rate has not fully reflected the falls seen in export prices.
Fiscal Policy
The government’s fiscal stance is expected to be mildly expansionary in 2015/16. The
Government has announced that it will allocate an additional NZ$1 billion towards
infrastructure spending in the 2016 Budget than previously envisaged. Capital spending is
expected to increase in 2016 and 2017, and discretionary fiscal policy will be supportive of
economic activity in 2015/16. There is a solid pipeline of infrastructure projects (including to
facilitate housing supply), although this will in part involve some bringing forward of capital
expenditure already planned.
2

Annual net migration continues to run at record levels, reaching 64,900, in December (1.8 percent of the
working age population). While the relative strength of the New Zealand economy has been a key driver with
fewer New Zealanders departing to Australia and arrivals of Australians and returning New Zealanders, there
has also been a strong increase in student arrivals (particularly from India) and steady growth in arrivals on
work visas.

4
The authorities recognize that prudent fiscal management is a necessary part of their
economic management strategy. Having achieved its short-term target of a return to a
fiscal surplus in 2014/2015,3 the authorities refreshed the Government’s short-term fiscal
intentions in the 2016 Budget Policy Statement. The Government’s overall fiscal strategy
remains: to keep a tight rein on spending, focus on results from public services, starting to
pay down debt, and looking to return any excess revenue on top of this to taxpayers. The
revised short-term intentions provide scope for some short-term fluctuations in response to
changing economic circumstances around the overall medium-term path for the
Government’s finances, thus mitigating the potential for fiscal policy reactions to exacerbate
the cycle. Fiscal policy is expected to be broadly neutral on average over the next five years
and Core Crown (recurrent) expenditure is expected to further narrow as a percentage of
GDP, consistent with the Government’s focus on improving public sector productivity and
getting on top of the longer-term drivers of spending.
The authorities have also been placing an increasing focus on effective management of
the overall government balance sheet and intend to strengthen the balance sheet as a
buffer against future adverse shocks. Total net worth is expected to increase over the next
five years, and by 2019/20 be similar to the level before the global financial crisis and
Canterbury earthquakes. The authorities are seeking to strengthen incentives for government
departments to better manage their balance sheet and investment projects. To help drive
greater transparency and accountability on how well taxpayer-funded projects are
progressing, new initiatives include the recent publication of the first annual “Managing
Government Investment Projects” report and quarterly “Major Projects Performance Report”.
My authorities have appreciated the opportunity to share their experience with staff from
Fiscal Affairs Department as we collectively strive to improve balance sheet performance
measures and management.
Financial Sector
The financial system is sound and remains resilient to a range of shocks. The banking
system maintains capital and funding buffers in excess of minimum requirements and
profitability is strong. Stress tests indicate the financial system is well placed to withstand
severe stresses that could emerge from the dairy sector and the housing market. The RBNZ’s
analysis of farm-level data shows that under a severe stress scenario (including a sharp
decline in land values), losses for the banking system as a whole are manageable
(approximately 18 percent of total before-tax profits of the five largest dairy lenders over a
typical four year period). The RBNZ is currently completing stress tests with the largest dairy
lenders. Risks to the financial sector from the housing market are being mitigated through
macroprudential tools, which have reduced the proportion of low-deposit loans on the banks’

balance sheets (LVR >80 percent) to 13.4 percent as at December 2015, thus improving
resilience of the financial system to a housing market downturn.
Risks around the New Zealand banking system’s reliance on global markets for funding
have reduced. Strong and continuing deposit growth has meant that banks have had less
need to issue debt in wholesale markets, leaving bank's reliance on wholesale funding much
reduced from the time of the GFC. Wholesale funding has also shifted towards more longerterm instruments. These factors reduce the exposure to potential disruptions to offshore
funding markets and short-term liquidity.
Strengthening financial regulation and supervision remains a focus to preserve
financial stability and foster financial sector development and financial inclusion. The
Reserve Bank continues to make progress on a number of regulatory initiatives, including
carrying out a stocktake of banking regulations and consulting on the regulation of financial
market infrastructures. The New Zealand authorities look forward to a high-quality FSAP to
be undertaken later in 2016, and have already begun preparations for this.
Medium-term Structural Issues – Lifting Productivity and Savings
The authorities remain focused on lifting productivity and prosperity. As Staff usefully
highlight, this challenge is compounded by distance and New Zealand’s small size.
Given New Zealand’s strong relative performance in indicators of the business environment
and regulation, to lift New Zealand’s productivity requires incremental reforms across a
broad range of areas. The Government’s Business Growth Agenda (BGA) is working to build
a more productive and competitive economy with a focus on six key inputs for businesses:
skilled and safe workplaces; export markets; infrastructure; innovation; natural resources;
and investment. Boosting productivity and international connections is key to bring scale,
competition, investment and ideas. Amongst other things the Government is working to
encourage and enable business-led innovation (especially through R&D) and to increase the
impact of the Government’s own R&D investment in public research organizations; and
ensuring an education system that provides the skills that workers and businesses need, and
equipping all people to participate and succeed. A sustainable lift in living standards will also
require continued improvements in the management of New Zealand’s natural resources.
The Productivity Commission (established in 2011) also enhances the “system” to lift
productivity. Recent inquiries have included the services sector, more effective social
services, and regulatory institutions and practices, and the Commission is currently
examining new models of tertiary education. The Commission’s recommendations are
feeding into programs of work.
The authorities concur that higher domestic savings and deeper financial markets could
help lower the cost of capital and ultimately support higher productivity. New Zealand
has had a continuous current account deficit for over 40 years as worthwhile investment
opportunities have consistently exceeded the country’s own capacity to fund them. While
New Zealand's net international liability position is relatively high (61.9 percent of GDP) it is

6
well below its recent March 2009 peak of 84.0 percent and has been relatively stable. A long
history of work (including the 2010/11 Savings Working Group) has sought to understand
the factors that lie behind New Zealand’s relatively low private savings. There is no one
simple policy lever to address this, and some proposals are politically more challenging. We
welcome Staff’s suggestions and will continue to explore feasible policy options.
Conclusion
In summary, New Zealand’s economic management has served us well. But we are not
complacent to the risks and continue to seek ways to lift our economic performance. We
thank Staff for their report as one of the ways that enables us to continue to assess results and
make improvements, drawing also on other best practices.
