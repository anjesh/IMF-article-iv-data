KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—ARUBA
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation Discussions
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation Discussions with the
Kingdom of the Netherlands—Aruba
Approved by Erik de Vrijer and Aasim Husain
October 6, 2010

Context. Aruba is a small, open economy with a history of policies that successfully
safeguarded macroeconomic stability. Tourism—which accounts for the bulk of economic
activity—declined sharply with the global downturn, and Aruba’s oil refinery closed
temporarily in mid-2009. As a result, real GDP plummeted in 2009. A gradual recovery is now
underway.
Challenges: An underlying fiscal shortfall of close to 6½ percent of GDP has piled up as a
result of spending pressures that have built up over many years and tax cuts to combat the
recession. If unaddressed, this would put public debt on an unsustainable path. A social
dialogue between the government, employers, and trade unions has yielded an agreement on
measures that enhance the financial soundness of Aruba’s main pension and health care
schemes, but yield limited fiscal savings in the short-term.
Focus of Consultation: Discussions focused primarily on the fiscal challenge and on options
to address it within a medium-term framework. Staff recommended considering a simplified
value-added tax as part of a comprehensive tax reform. As regards monetary policy, the central
bank is moving from direct (credit ceiling) to more indirect (reserve requirement) instruments
to enhance policy effectiveness. Staff welcomed the shift, but noted that the challenges to both
monetary management and banking supervision would increase.
Authorities’ response: The authorities consented largely with staff’s advice on monetary
policy and financial stability issues. On fiscal policy, the government agreed on the need for
fiscal consolidation and noted that it intends to reduce the deficit to below 2 percent of GDP by
2014. However, the government emphasized cuts in the size of the civil service and
investments in infrastructure to stimulate growth, and preferred to consider revenue measures
only at a later stage.
Mission team: Messrs. Wiegand (head), Gottlieb, and Munteanu (all EUR). Staff met with
Governor Refunjol, Prime Minister Eman, Minister of Finance de Meza, Central Bank
President Semeleer, senior officials of the government and the central bank, members of
parliament, and representatives of labor unions, business associations, think tanks, banks, and
pension and health care funds. Ms. Barendregt (OED) participated in some of the discussions.

I. CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Aruba is a small, open economy with one of the highest living standards in the
Caribbean and a history of stability-oriented macroeconomic policies (Figure 1 and
Table 1). In the period preceding the global financial crisis (2003–07), real GDP growth
averaged 3 percent per year, boosted by tourism and foreign direct investment. The longstanding peg to the U.S. dollar helped create a positive investment climate. Annual credit
ceilings set by the central bank kept credit growth at sustainable levels. A prudent fiscal
policy—the central government deficit averaged 1.7 percent of GDP in the past 10 years—
contained public debt at 40–45 percent of GDP, earning Aruba investment grade ratings from
Standard & Poor’s and Fitch.
2.

Since 2008, adverse external shocks have left Aruba in a difficult spot.



Tourism declined in the wake of the global downturn, compounded by a sharp
decline of condominium construction for nonresidents. Between two-thirds and threequarters of the economy are estimated to depend on tourism.



Aruba’s oil refinery shut down operations in July 2009, reflecting slim margins on
refined petroleum products and a dispute over business turnover tax payments with
the Aruban government. More than 2,000 jobs, accounting for about 5 percent of the
workforce, were directly or indirectly linked to the refinery. In June of this year,
however, the refinery’s foreign owner unexpectedly announced to resume operations
from November, as demand for refined petroleum products has recovered and the tax
dispute with the authorities has been settled.



Overall, real GDP contracted by 7½ percent in 2009, making Aruba’s slump one of
the most severe in the Caribbean (Figure 2 and Table 2). Unemployment increased
sharply to 11.3 percent, amid rapid disinflation, sharp current account adjustment, and
weak lending activity (Box 1 and Figure 3).

3.
The government reacted to the slump by loosening fiscal policy, using primarily
permanent measures that have created a large underlying deficit (Figure 4, Tables 3–4).
Upon taking office in October 2009, the new government (Box 2) cut an unpopular business
turnover tax (BBO) in half from 2010, in line with its economic program announced prior to
the elections. The tax—introduced only in 2007, broadly in line with IMF recommendations
to gradually shift from direct to indirect taxation—accounted for almost 20 percent of tax
revenue in 2008, or close to 4 percent of GDP. The government also increased social
transfers to mitigate the impact of the recession and initiated a social dialogue with labor
unions and employers to address Aruba’s most pressing socio-economic challenges.
4.
Monetary policy’s effectiveness in the recession was hampered by a lack of
instruments to stimulate lending (Figures 5–6, Tables 5–6). Until last year, the central bank
conducted monetary policy mostly by means of a ceiling on credit growth to the private
sector, in the context of a fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar. In the downturn,

4
commercial banks cut lending volumes while preserving high interest margins, with no
effective instrument at the disposal of the central bank to ease lending conditions. In
response, the central bank abolished the credit ceiling at the beginning of this year and
moved to conducting monetary policy by means of an unremunerated reserves requirement.
Box 1. Recent Macroeconomic Developments
Real GDP contracted by 7½ percent in 2009. Part of the decline owed to the shutdown of
the refinery in July. However, GDP excluding refining also contracted by almost
5 percent, primarily reflecting a drop in tourism, reduced construction of condominiums,
and knock-on effects on private consumption. The unemployment rate increased to
11.3 percent from 6.9 percent in 2008.
Consumer prices fell by 2.1 percent (annual average) in 2009, owing largely to a sharp
decline in volatile energy and food prices. Core CPI inflation eased to 1.8 percent, down
from 3.3 percent in 2008, and has declined further in the early months of 2010, reflecting
weak domestic demand and the halving of the business turnover tax at the beginning of
the year.
The external current account balance adjusted from a deficit of 5½ percent of GDP in
2008 to a surplus of 6 percent of GDP in 2009 (Figure 7, Tables 7a–7b). The refinery
closure accounted for two-thirds of this shift, in part because the refinery imported
reduced amounts of crude oil in 2009, but exported refined products using inventory.
However, the non-oil current account also improved by almost 4 percentage points of
GDP, amid lower non-oil imports, reduced dividend payments by foreign-owned
companies, and a drop of remittances from nonresident workers to their home countries.
The shift was accompanied by a fall in FDI and portfolio inflows.
Credit to the private sector contracted by about 1 percent in 2009, due to tight lending
standards and weak demand for loans, especially from corporations. Corporate deposits
increased, giving rise to large excess funds that banks invested either in foreign assets or
deposited with the central bank.
The banking system remained profitable and preserved high capital and liquidity buffers,
in spite of the downturn (Table 8). System-wide capital adequacy stood at 18 percent at
end-June 2010, well above the prudential requirement of 14 percent. Nonperforming loans
were 9½ percent of gross loans—with problem loans concentrated in commercial real
estate and corporate lending—up from less than 7 percent at end-2008, but were almost
fully provisioned.

5

Box 2. Constitutional Framework and Recent Political Developments
Aruba, a former Dutch colony, obtained autonomy (“status aparte”) in 1986, thus becoming
one of three countries that form the Kingdom of the Netherlands, together with the Netherlands
and the Netherlands Antilles.1 Aruba enjoys self-governance in internal affairs. Foreign and
defense policy are conducted by the Kingdom.
Elections in September 2009 resulted in a majority for the Arubaanse Volks Partij (AVP),
which controls 12 out of 21 seats in the Staten (parliament). Eight seats are occupied by the
main opposition party Movimiento Electoral di Pueblo (MEP). The MEP controlled Aruba’s
government between 2001 and 2009. A cornerstone of Prime Minister Mike Eman’s political
program is improving relations with the Netherlands, which had deteriorated in previous years

5.
Aruba’s external competitiveness appears solid and reserves coverage is broadly
adequate, thus underpinning the peg with the U.S. dollar. The real effective exchange
rate measured in terms of core prices (i.e., excluding temporary fluctuations in food and
energy prices) has depreciated slightly in recent years, while Aruba’s market share in
Caribbean tourism has held up well (Box 3). At end-2009, official reserves covered about
5½ months of imports and 100 percent of short term debt by residual maturity. Aruba’s total
external debt is high at more than 90 percent of GDP, but risks appear contained as much is
in the form of FDI-related intra-company lending, while only small portions are short-term
and/or portfolio funding. The largest short-term debt category—deposits of non-residents
with Aruban banks, amounting to somewhat more than 10 percent of GDP—was stable
during the crisis (Tables 9–10).
II. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK
6.
A gradual recovery is under way, supported by a pick-up in tourism and the reopening of the refinery.


1

In 2010, GDP is projected to contract by 2 percent. The drop reflects mostly the
refinery closure during the first 10 months. GDP excluding refining is expected to
stagnate, as some recovery in tourism and a surge in public spending are balanced by
still weak private investment and consumption, notwithstanding some recent
improvement in business perceptions and first signs of a recovery in construction
activity (notably higher building permits). Inflation is projected to remain subdued.

The Netherlands Antilles will be dissolved on October 10 of this year. The two most populous islands,
Curacao and Sint Maarten, will obtain status aparte for themselves, while three smaller islands will be
integrated as municipalities into the Netherlands.

6

Box 3. External Competitiveness and Tourism Developments
Key drivers of Aruba’s real effective exchange (REER) are (i) the inflation differential with the
United States; and (ii) the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis the euro, given that 15–
20 percent of Aruba’s trade is with the euro area. In 2007 and 2008, the REER appreciated
sharply, as a result of increasing food and energy-related prices that have a weight of onequarter in the Aruban consumer price index.
Excluding food and energy-related prices, Aruba’s real exchange rate against the U.S. dollar
remained flat or even depreciated slightly. Temporary import price pressures did therefore not
spill over into Aruba’s general price level, suggesting that second-round cost increases in
reaction to higher food and energy prices remained contained.2
Another—and possibly more illuminating—approach to assessing competitiveness is to
analyze the market share of Aruba’s main export: tourism. Tourism exports fell (in real terms)
by 6.3 percent in 2009, but such declines have been common across the Caribbean in the wake
of the global recession. Data from the Caribbean Tourism Organization suggest that Aruba’s
market share actually increased in both 2008 and 2009, with respect to both stay-over and
cruise visitors. Aruba’s reputation as a “high-end” destination may have helped, as tourism
losses have been concentrated in lower-cost segments of the market. Over the longer-term,
Aruba’s market share has been roughly stable.

In 2011, overall GDP growth is projected to surge temporarily to 7 percent as the
refinery returns to full capacity. GDP excluding refining is projected to expand by
more than 3 percent, owing to the realization of investment projects in hotel

construction and infrastructure, stronger tourism exports, and a general recovery in
private consumption.


Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced around this baseline, and relate primarily
to the prospects for tourism and construction activity. With two-thirds of tourist
coming from the United States, a significant factor is the strength of the recovery in
the U.S. Uncertainties surrounding the government’s planned investment program
(¶14) also add to short- to medium-term risks.

7.
The authorities agreed with staff that over the longer-term Aruba’s growth
model from the pre-crisis years appears unsustainable. Long-term prospects for tourism
are dampened by the fact that U.S. consumption growth is expected to remain below precrisis levels, and by space constraints that limit the potential for a further quantitative
expansion of tourism. As a consequence, the government is pursuing a growth strategy
focused on upgrading existing tourism facilities, improving Aruba’s infrastructure, and
moving to more energy-efficient modes of production. IMF staff estimates Aruba’s long-term
potential annual real growth rate at about 1½ percent.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Restoring Sustainability of the Public Finances
Recent Fiscal Developments
8.
Notwithstanding Aruba’s good fiscal track record, underlying pressures have
built up over many years. The main pension and health care schemes accumulated sizeable
financial imbalances over time, reflecting in part the impact of population ageing (Box 4).
The defined-benefit pension fund for civil servants (APFA) accrued a large actuarial deficit,
and the general health care system (AZV) required increasing transfers from the central
government, exceeding 3 percent of GDP in 2009. Spending pressures also built up on goods
and services. One-off windfall receipts often camouflaged the underlying state of the public
finances, such as a payment of more than 4 percent of GDP in 2008 from the Dutch
government related to the sale of hotel shares.
9.
The fiscal loosening implemented this year further increased challenges, given
the measures’ permanent nature. The overall fiscal deficit for 2010 is projected at slightly
above 4 percent GDP, but it would have been much higher in the absence of the one-off tax
settlement with the oil refinery (yielding more than 4½ percent of GDP). Cyclically weak
revenue collection exacerbates the fiscal shortfall.

8

Box 4. Aruba’s Main Health Care and Pension Schemes
APFA (Algemeen Pensioenfonds Aruba), a defined-benefit pension scheme for civil
servants, was until recently structurally underfunded, reflecting generous benefits
(70 percent of the final wage), an early retirement age (55 years), and losses on its
investment portfolio during the financial crisis. Its financial position will improve
significantly as a result of entitlement reforms agreed in the context of the social dialogue,
including the computation of pension claims on the basis of average career wages instead
of final wages, an increase in the retirement age from 55 to 60 years, and the calculation
of APFA pensions net of AOV pension claims.
AOV (Algemeen Ouderdomspensioen Verzekering), the general pay-as-you-go pension
scheme, has been running a cash-flow deficit since 2009 but is still drawing down reserves
accumulated in previous years. The increase in premium income agreed in the context of
the social dialogue will postpone the need for government transfers from 2013 to 2014.
The statutory retirement age is 60 years.
Ever since the introduction in 2001 of AZV (Algemene Ziektekosten Verzekering), the
universal health care system, insurance premiums have been insufficient to cover
expenditures, resulting in transfers from the budget that exceeded 3 percent of GDP in
2009 (on a cash basis). The funding shortfall—that the government is obliged to cover by
law—is expected to fall to about 2 percent of GDP as a result of the premium increase
agreed in the context of the social dialogue.
Going forward, further reforms will be needed to secure the sustainability of AOV’s and
AZV’s finances. For AOV, an increase in the retirement age may be unavoidable. As
regards AZV, reform options include the introduction of co-payments, increasing
competition between health care providers by relaxing entry restrictions, and the
strengthening of expenditure controls.

10.
In a first round of the social dialogue, participants agreed in August on steps
that reduce longer-term risks to the public finances but yield limited fiscal savings in
the short-term. In particular, important measures were agreed that improve the financial
health of Aruba’s health care and pension schemes (Box 4). Participants also consented to
keep the business turnover tax rate at its 2010 level—instead of eliminating it in 2011 as the
government had planned originally—and to raise excise taxes by modest amounts. To limit
the burden from these measures for select income groups, the government introduced a tax
allowance for the working poor, and increased transfers for welfare recipients as well as
wages for civil servants. Overall, staff estimates that the measures agreed on in the social
dialogue reduce the underlying fiscal deficit by 2–2½ percent of GDP. This estimate
excludes some expansionary measures that are difficult to cost, however, such as reduced
import duties on green products.
The Fiscal Outlook and Aruba’s Fiscal Adjustment Need
11.
Overall, IMF staff projects a fiscal deficit of almost 7 percent of GDP for 2011,
and—in the absence of further consolidation measures—an underlying medium-term
shortfall of 6–6½ percent of GDP. The authorities agreed with staff that such a fiscal stance
was unsustainable. Public debt would increase to about 65 percent of GDP by 2015,
triggering a rapid increase in the government’s
6

interest burden. Moreover, financing constraints

could arise. At this juncture, excess liquidity in

needs. However, once private sector demand for

from 2012 when significant amortizations on the
government’s commercial external debt are falling due.3
12.
Well aware of these pressures, the government has committed to reducing the
deficit by about 1½ percentage points of GDP per year in 2012–14. This would imply a
deficit of somewhat above 3 percent of GDP in 2013 (the last budget to be passed in the
current legislative term) and of below 2 percent of GDP by 2014. With this path, public debt

10
is estimated to stabilize at a level of around 52 percent of GDP. The measures needed to
achieve this adjustment remain to be specified, however.
13.
Staff advocated a somewhat more ambitious adjustment path with a view to
creating fiscal space to react to external shocks. Specifically, staff recommended targeting
a deficit of below 1 percent of GDP by 2013, corresponding to a primary surplus of
2¼ percent of GDP. This would put public debt as a share of GDP on a gradually falling path
even under cautious assumptions about future growth. The target implies a fiscal effort of
about 5½ percent of GDP, starting in 2011, beyond the initiatives announced in the context of
the social dialogue. Given that Aruba’s public debt is not yet at excessive levels, and in view
of the still fragile recovery, IMF staff recommended stretching fiscal consolidation over a
period of two to three years. The authorities were reluctant to agree with staff’s more
ambitious adjustment path, reflecting in part more optimistic views about future growth.

Options for Fiscal Adjustment
14.
The authorities emphasized that a cornerstone of their fiscal adjustment strategy
was to create the conditions for higher and higher-quality growth. Pivotal was an
infrastructure investment program envisaged for 2011–13 that encompasses road
construction projects and the relocation of Aruba’s commercial port. Financing is envisaged
to come largely from government owned enterprises or from the private sector through
private-public partnerships (PPPs), with no financial burdens for the central government
budget. The government argued that the program would not only provide a temporary boost
to activity but also remove bottlenecks that currently impede long-term growth. Staff noted
that the returns of such programs were inherently uncertain, and cautioned against basing
longer-term fiscal projections on optimistic growth forecasts. Moreover, possible contingent
fiscal liabilities should be minimized and monitored carefully.

11
15.
The authorities preferred expenditure cuts to meet any remaining adjustment
needs. They argued that tax increases would reduce the population’s purchasing power and
have undesirable social consequences. Specifically, the authorities saw room to reduce
spending in the following areas:
14
14


Public sector wage bill. The government has
imposed a hiring freeze and plans to reduce
the public work force by natural attrition.
Further, the authorities are considering
privatization of some government activities,
such as trash collection. However, the public
sector wage bill is already modest in regional
comparison, which restricts the potential for
savings.

Spending on goods and services, which has
increased from less than 4 percent of GDP in 2008 to more than 5 percent.



Health care. Further premium increases could eliminate the need for a government
transfer to AZV (projected at about 2 percent of GDP for 2011).

16.
Staff noted that achieving the entire needed adjustment through expenditures
measures seemed exceedingly difficult. In staff’s estimate, expenditure cuts that can be
implemented within a reasonable time frame amount to at most 3 percent of GDP, well short
of both the authorities’ (4½ percent) and staff’s (5½ percent) estimated adjustment need.4 It
therefore appears unavoidable that some adjustment would have to come from revenues,
where international comparison suggests that Aruba has room for maneuver. On unchanged
policies, Aruba’s tax revenues are projected at about 18 percent of GDP going forward. This
compares to a regional average of about 25 percent of GDP across 15 other Caribbean
countries. Moreover, only about half of Aruba’s tax revenues result from indirect taxes,
compared to a regional average of almost two-thirds.
17.
Staff suggested considering a tax reform that balances fiscal constraints with
social priorities. The following principles could usefully guide reform efforts: (i) the tax
system should raise sufficient revenue; (ii) it should be growth-friendly, fair and transparent;
and (iii) it should trigger high taxpayer compliance with low administrative costs. A
comprehensive reform may also help achieve other objectives, such as lowering high income
tax rates (among the highest in the Caribbean), eliminating nuisance taxes such as Aruba’s

4

This assumes savings of close to 2 percent of GDP from AZV (reflecting the elimination of the government
transfer which would, however, trigger higher premium payments for government employees), and of about
½ percent of GDP from each the public sector wage bill and goods and services.

12
foreign exchange tax,5 and protecting real income levels of the poor, especially when
combined with targeted social spending initiatives.
18.
A key component of a reformed tax system could be a value-added tax (VAT) to
replace the BBO. A VAT would avoid the BBO’s distortionary cascading effects that are
partly responsible for the BBO’s unpopularity. Further, a VAT would be born to a significant
degree by nonresidents, thus restraining the impact on purchasing power of Arubans. To limit
administrative costs for both the government and the private sector, the VAT could exempt
small businesses. International experience suggests that a VAT introduction would require
careful preparation of at least 1½–2 years. IMF staff encouraged the authorities to seek
technical expertise oriented on international best practices, for example by joining the
Caribbean Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC), which has helped with the
implementation of similar reforms in other Caribbean countries and territories.
19.
The authorities agreed that a structural shift to more indirect taxation is
desirable. They noted that reforms in other Caribbean countries and territories had increased
the pressure on Aruba to reduce direct tax rates to remain competitive. In this context, the
authorities pointed to a tri-partite working group that will analyze reform options and report
to the participants in the social dialogue by April 2011. The authorities remarked that they
would study the working group’s recommendations with an open mind, but also noted an
initial preference for raising excise taxes—whose real value has eroded from more than
4 percent of GDP in the early 1990s to less 2½ percent of GDP—or possibly higher import
duties.
B. Enhancing the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy
20.
Aruba’s monetary policy is anchored by the long-standing peg with the U.S.
dollar and was, until end-2009, conducted with relatively blunt instruments. The key
policy instrument was a ceiling on banks’ annual increase in lending to the private sector,
complemented by a limit on banks’ net foreign asset position, a de-facto capital control
obliging commercial banks to transfer excess foreign assets to the central bank.
21.

The experience with the credit ceiling has been mixed.



On the one hand, confidence in the peg was high, as evidenced by a low degree of
dollarization in Aruba’s banking system (17 percent of deposits at end-2009).
Moreover, unsustainable credit booms were prevented and underlying inflation
remained contained, thus safeguarding external competitiveness.

5

The tax on foreign exchange transactions represents an exchange restriction under Article VIII, Section 2(a) of
the Fund's Articles of Agreement.

13


On the other hand, the credit ceiling discouraged competition, thus helping sustain
an oligopolistic banking system characterized by large interest rate spreads and
outsized fee revenues.



Moreover, during the downturn the central bank lacked an instrument to stimulate
lending. In 2009, banks’ average lending rates remained virtually unchanged at
11 percent while lending volumes contracted. Rather than vying for new business,
banks placed a third of their funds in low-yielding central bank deposits or foreign
assets.

22.
Recognizing these constraints, the central bank eliminated the credit ceiling at
end-2009 and replaced it with an unremunerated reserves requirement as key policy
instrument.6 Staff welcomed this overhaul, noting that it should help spurring competition
between banks to bid down interest rates and allow for a more efficient conduct of monetary
policy going forward. The transition to the new monetary arrangement and the associated
risks required careful management, however.
23.
Staff and the authorities agreed that in the
short-term monetary policy should remain
accommodative. At this juncture, required reserves are
set rightly well below commercial banks’ actual
deposits at the central bank, giving rise to substantial
excess liquidity in the banking system. These liquidity
buffers should remain in place as long as credit demand
is depressed. In addition, staff encouraged the central
bank to emphasize that it no longer restricts credit
growth—several commercial banks had misunderstood
central bank communiqués mentioning “targeted credit
growth” as if the credit ceiling was still in effect.

24.
Staff encouraged the central bank to explore additional ways of fostering
competition between banks, such as temporarily relaxing some regulations that
effectively block the entry of new competitors. The central bank agreed with staff that in
particular the requirements of a non-negative net foreign asset position and of conservative
loan-to-deposit ratios could have the unintended side-effect of impeding foreign banks from
setting up Aruban subsidiaries. The central bank noted that temporary waivers to these rules
could be considered, provided the subsidiaries were owned by reputable, international parent
banks that are subject to comprehensive, consolidated supervision by their home supervisors.

6

A reserves requirement existed also prior to the reform, but its effectiveness was hampered as mandatory
reserves counted towards the (stricter) prudential liquidity requirement. This provision has been removed.

14
25.
The central bank agreed with staff that tightening may become necessary once
demand for credit rebounds. If pressure on the central bank’s foreign reserves position
would emerge, the central bank had to be prepared to use the reserves requirement rapidly
and to the full extent needed. Possible concerns that a large increase in mandatory reserves
may be overly costly for banks could be addressed by modest remuneration, provided it was
within the financial means of the central bank. At the same time, staff and the central bank
agreed that a rapid introduction of certificates of deposits could be problematic, given the
absence of a liquid interbank market and the potential for negative repercussions on the
central bank’s financial position. Over the longer-term, however, the development of marketbased monetary instruments would remain an important objective.
C. Safeguarding Financial Stability
26.
Conservative regulatory requirements and high underlying profitability have
helped Aruba’s banking system getting through the recession without major strains (see
also Box 1). Prudential requirements for capital adequacy (14 percent of risk-weighed assets)
and liquidity (15 percent of assets excluding goodwill) are set at adequately elevated levels in
view of the banking system’ systemic importance (Box 5). Going forward, nonperforming
loans are expected to increase for another 6–12 months, but at a relatively modest pace.
Banks seem well prepared to manage this challenge, in view of ample capital cushions and
continued profitability. Large buffers of excess liquidity also place the banking system well
to satisfy demand for lending once economic activity picks up.
27.
Elsewhere in the financial system, good progress has been made in restoring
financial soundness to corporate defined-benefit pension funds in the context of recovery
plans. In the wake of the recession, the coverage ratios of some funds fell below 100 percent
as a result of losses on their investment portfolios.
28.
The authorities agreed with staff that the central bank’s new monetary policy
framework would likely increase the challenges to prudential regulation and
supervision. The absence of a credit ceiling could well result in more aggressive lending,
which, in turn, could trigger a deterioration in banks’ lending standards. Supervisors will
therefore need to monitor market developments closely as well as the strategies and actions
of individual institutions. The mission also noted that enhancing the forward-looking
character of the central bank’s stress tests could help in this endeavor.
29.
Staff and the authorities agreed that Aruba’s off-shore financial sector—while
small—carries a potential for reputational risk. The mission argued that off-shore banks
should be permitted to operate only to the extent that the central bank can monitor their
activities and enforce prudential rules. The central bank confirmed that it had recently
stepped up efforts to ensure a sufficient physical presence of all off-shore banks operating in
Aruba to permit effective supervision. Failure to comply would trigger regulatory steps by

15
the central bank that could include issuing a formal directive, imposing penalties, or,
ultimately, revoking the bank’s license.
Box 5. The Structure of Aruba’s Financial System
The Aruban financial sector is relatively large, with assets of 184 percent of GDP. Commercial
banks dominate the sector with more than half of total assets. The rest of the financial system is
divided among pension funds, insurance funds and bank-like institutions.
The four commercial banks are foreign owned and are largely funded by resident deposits,
which account for 78 percent of liabilities. More than half of assets are loans to the private
sector. Holdings of public debt are low (only 2.5 percent of GDP).
Aruba also has two off shore banks with assets amounting to 12 percent of GDP. They have
limited physical presence in Aruba and are only engaged in banking activities with
nonresidents.
After banks, pension funds form the next largest component of the financial sector, dominated
by the civil service pension fund (APFA), which has assets of 37 percent of GDP. APFA and
insurance companies hold together 17 percent of GDP in government securities.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Aruba’s economy is gradually recovering from a severe recession triggered by a
series of external shocks. Tourism declined in the wake of the global downturn, and Aruba’s
oil refinery temporarily closed in July 2009. A slow and gradual recovery is underway now,
but the growth rates from pre-crisis years will be difficult to achieve going forward,
reflecting lower expected U.S. consumption growth (Aruba’s main trading partner) and limits
to a further quantitative expansion of tourism.

16
31.
Serious fiscal challenges need to be addressed. Aruba’s health care and pension
schemes have long been structurally underfunded, giving rise to sizeable fiscal liabilities.
Recent tax cuts, notably the halving of Aruba’s business turnover tax, and spending increases
to combat the recession have further contributed to a large underlying fiscal deficit. If
unaddressed, this would put public debt on an unsustainable path. The reforms agreed in the
context of the social dialogue between the government, labor unions and employers enhance
the soundness of Aruba’s pension and health care schemes and reduce longer-term downside
risks to the fiscal outlook. However, their short-term budgetary impact is limited.
32.
Staff encourages the authorities to develop a medium-term fiscal adjustment
program to safeguard the sustainability of the public finances. The program should aim
to put public debt as a share of GDP on a declining path even under cautious assumptions
about future growth, with a view to limiting the government’s interest expenditures,
maintaining access to domestic and external financing at attractive rates, and leaving some
room for maneuver in case Aruba is again affected by external shocks as in 2001/02 and in
2009.
33.
Staff agrees with the authorities’ intention to achieve a large part of the needed
fiscal adjustment through expenditure cuts. However, recourse to some revenue measures
seems unavoidable in view of the size of the fiscal shortfall. In this context, staff
recommends considering a tax reform that balances fiscal constraints with social priorities. A
key component could be a value-added tax designed to fit Aruba’s specific needs. Should the
authorities decide to pursue such a reform, staff encourages the authorities to seek technical
assistance based on international best practices, for example by joining CARTAC.
34.
The central bank’s switch from a credit ceiling to an unremunerated reserves
requirement as key policy tool is welcome and should allow for a more efficient conduct
of monetary policy going forward. However, the transition to the new monetary
arrangement and the associated risks need to be managed carefully. As long as credit
conditions remain depressed, the central bank should continue to leave excess liquidity in the
market. Once demand for credit rebounds, however, the central bank needs to be prepared to
use the reserves requirement to the full extent needed, with a view to protecting the central
bank’s foreign reserves position and safeguarding the currency peg.
35.
Challenges to prudential regulation and supervision will likely increase with the
new monetary policy framework. The absence of a credit ceiling may result in more
aggressive lending, which, in turn, could trigger a deterioration in banks’ lending standards.
Supervisors will need to monitor market developments closely as well as the strategies and
actions of individual institutions.
36.
It is currently envisaged that the next Article IV consultation discussions with
Aruba will be held in 24 months time.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
10/ Assumes the government follows the deficit path announced in the 2010 budget submission.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks. Figures in
the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being presented. Tenyear historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2010, with real
depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus
domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ The "constant primary balance" scenario removes the oil refinery settlement (4.6% of GDP) from the 2010 primary
balance .

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

The Aruban florin has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at Af. 1.79 per US$1 since
January 1, 1986.
Aruba maintains an unapproved foreign exchange restriction arising from the foreign
exchange tax on payments by residents to nonresidents. This tax, which amounts to
1.3 percent of the transaction value, was introduced when Aruba was part of the Netherlands
Antilles to generate revenue for the government. On June 25, 2010 Aruba introduced a
Sanctions Decree for the combat of terrorism and terrorist financing, in compliance with UN
resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1373 (2001), and the Special Recommendation III of the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Restrictions on financial transactions with Iraq and
Kuwait were lifted in November 2008 based on UN resolution 1483 (2003).
VIII.

Article IV Consultation:

The Board concluded the last Article IV consultation discussions for Aruba on
February 22, 2008 on the basis of the staff report (IMF Country report 08/78) and the
statistical appendix (IMF Country report 08/79). Consultations are conducted on a bi-annual
cycle.
IX.

Financial Sector Supervision, FATF Evaluation, and OFC Assessment:

The evaluation of Aruba’s compliance with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 40+9
Recommendations on AML/CFT was conducted jointly by the FATF and the Caribbean
Financial Action Task Force during November 24–December 5, 2008. A mutual Evaluation
Report was published on the FATF website in October, 2009.
A Detailed Assessment of Compliance with the Basel Core Principals for Effective Banking
Supervision (Country report 08/316) and the Assessment of Financial Sector Supervision and
Regulation (Country report 08/317) were published in September 2008. An update OFC was
conducted in 2008.

Technical Assistance:

To assist the Central Bank of Aruba with the implementation of the Standardized Report
Forms (SRFs), a monetary and financial statistics mission visited Aruba in February 2009.

Appendix II. Kingdom of the Netherlands—Aruba: Statistical Issues
Aruba’s statistical base is broadly adequate for surveillance, but improvements in several
areas would support effective economic analysis and policymaking. In particular, the fiscal
accounts, national accounts, and labor market statistics need to be strengthened.
1.

Real sector

Real sector data are compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). The CBS has
published national accounts data for 1995 through 2006, and preliminary estimates for 2007–
09. On the expenditure side, data on changes in inventories are lacking. Moreover, the data
on imports and exports of goods and services do not match BOP statistics, reflecting different
methodological approaches and raw sources. Furthermore, the CBS’ use of the Consumer
Price Index (CPI) as deflator for real GDP can give rise to distortions. CPI data are compiled
and published on a monthly basis.
2.

Fiscal sector

Government finance statistics are prepared and published on a regular basis, but not reported
to STA. The presentation of the fiscal accounts could be improved in several respects. First, a
residual expenditure category “not included elsewhere” that can amount to 3 percent GDP
should be disaggregated. Second, below-the-line financing does not add up to the fiscal
deficit without further adjustments. Third, each financing category has a large component
“other” (in addition to disbursements and amortizations) whose nature is not clear. And
fourth, the authorities combine commercial bank financing and Central Bank financing into
one aggregate entitled “net recourse to the monetary system”. This aggregate should be
disaggregated given that central bank financing of the deficit has an impact on money supply.
3.

Monetary sector

The methodology used by the Central Bank of Aruba (CBA) for compiling monetary
statistics published in CBA’s Monthly Bulletin, Quarterly Bulletin, and Annual Statistical
Digest is broadly consistent with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual 2000
(MFSM). The CBA reports monetary data to STA on a timely basis. The authorities submit
the data in the format of Standardized Report Forms developed by STA. The shortcomings in
the monetary data reports were discussed with the CBA during the STA technical assistance
(TA) mission in February, 2009. The STA mission concluded that CBA staff is capable of
implementing the mission’s short-term recommendations, but recommended additional TA
after the development and implementation of the new Chart of Accounts (COAs) for banks in
Aruba, currently under implementation (implementation period 2009–11).

5
4.

External sector

The CBA reports quarterly balance-of-payments data and an annual IIP. A more detailed
breakdown of exports and imports would be useful, for example by economic category
(consumer goods, fuels, raw materials, and capital goods) and by commodity.
Monthly data on the official reserve position are published with a lag of one month. A
breakdown in holdings of gold and foreign currency is provided. As prescribed by the SDDS,
data on foreign liabilities of the monetary sector—including a breakdown by maturity and
instrument—and the central government are published on a quarterly basis, with a lag of
about one quarter.
A debt survey covering both the public and private sectors provides information on the
amount, currency denomination of foreign debt outstanding, as well as on disaggregation by
instrument and amortization payments coming due. Areas requiring improvement include:
(i) make changes in external debt data consistent with the debt creating flows in the balance
of payments, (ii) report maturity schedules on private sector external debt; and (iii) report
flow data on trade credits and intercompany loans.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
October 20, 2010
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the Staff
Report (SM/10/270) was circulated to the Executive Board on October 7, 2010. The
information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The resumption of operations at Aruba’s oil refinery has been postponed and is
now envisaged for January 2011 rather than November 2010. This delay triggers a
downward revision of staff's projected real GDP growth rate for 2010 to -3.2 percent (from
-2.2 percent) and an upward revision for 2011 to 8.1 percent (from 7.1 percent). The
projections for real GDP growth excluding refining remain unchanged at 0.2 percent (2010)
and 3.2 percent (2011) respectively.
3.
The central bank has taken important steps to emphasize its accommodative
policy stance and to clarify that it no longer targets credit growth. In early October, the
central bank cut its advance rate to 1 percent (from 3 percent). The step is largely symbolic,
given that banks have large liquidity buffers and hence do not use the advance borrowing
window at this juncture. However, the cut signals that the central bank considers current
monetary conditions too tight. The central bank has also sent letters to Aruba’s commercial
banks that explain the functioning of its new monetary policy framework based on an
unremunerated reserves requirement as the key policy tool.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation
Discussions with the Kingdom of the Netherlands—Aruba
On October 20, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation discussions with the Kingdom of the Netherlands—
Aruba.1
Background
Aruba is a small, open economy with one of the highest living standards in the
Caribbean and a history of policies that have successfully safeguarded macroeconomic
stability over the years. Since 2008, however, adverse external shocks have left Aruba
in a difficult spot. Tourism declined in the wake of the global downturn and Aruba’s oil
refinery closed temporarily in July 2009, reflecting slim margins on refined petroleum
products. Overall, real GDP contracted by 7½ percent in 2009, making Aruba’s slump
one of the most severe in the Caribbean. Unemployment increased sharply to
11.3 percent, amid rapid disinflation, sharp current account adjustment, and weak
lending activity. A gradual recovery is underway now.
The government reacted to the slump by loosening fiscal policy, using primarily
permanent measures that have created a large underlying deficit. Upon taking office at
end-October 2009, the new government cut an unpopular business turnover tax in half
starting in 2010, in line with its economic program announced prior to the elections. The
government also increased social transfers to mitigate the impact of the recession and
initiated a social dialogue with labor unions and employers to address Aruba’s most
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

pressing socio-economic challenges. The social dialogue participants agreed in August
2010 on important measures that improve the financial health of Aruba’s main pension
and health care schemes. These steps reduce longer-term risks to the public finances
but yield limited fiscal savings in the short-term. The government also announced a path
that would bring the fiscal deficit to below 2 percent by 2014, but the measures to
achieve this objective remain to be specified.
Monetary policy was, until last year, conducted mostly by means of a ceiling on credit
growth to the private sector, in the context of a fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar.
In the downturn, however, commercial banks cut lending volumes while preserving high
interest margins, with no instrument at the disposal of the central bank to ease lending
conditions. To enhance policy effectiveness, the central bank abolished the credit ceiling
at the beginning of this year and moved to conducting monetary policy by means of an
unremunerated reserves requirement.
Aruba’s external competitiveness appears solid and reserves coverage is broadly
adequate, thus underpinning the longstanding peg with the U.S. dollar. The real
effective exchange rate measured in terms of core prices has depreciated slightly in
recent years, while Aruba’s market share in Caribbean tourism has held up well. At end2009, official reserves covered about 100 percent of short term debt by residual maturity
and 5½ months of imports. Aruba’s total external debt is high at more than
90 percent of GDP, but risks appear contained as much is in the form of FDI-related
intra-company lending, while only small portions are short-term and/or portfolio funding.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Aruba had been hard hit by the global crisis. While a
gradual recovery is underway, diminished prospects for a further expansion of the
tourism industry dampen the outlook for growth in the period ahead.
Directors encouraged the authorities to develop a medium-term fiscal adjustment
program to ensure that public debt remains on a sustainable path and to provide space
to react to external shocks. They commended the reforms of the pension and health
care schemes agreed in the context of the social dialogue, but noted that the short-term
budgetary impact of these measures is limited. Directors welcomed the authorities’
intention to strengthen the fiscal position through expenditure cuts, and considered that
some revenue measures would also be needed. A tax reform would help balance fiscal
constraints and social priorities. A key component could be a value-added tax. Directors
encouraged the authorities to seek technical assistance based on international best
practices, for example by joining CARTAC.
Directors agreed that the peg to the U.S. dollar has served Aruba well. They welcomed
the switch from a credit ceiling to an unremunerated reserves requirement as the key
monetary policy tool, and noted that the transition to the new arrangement and the
attendant risks need to be managed carefully by the central bank. Directors also noted
that challenges to prudential supervision would likely increase, as the absence of a
credit ceiling could lead to a deterioration in banks’ lending standards. They called on
the authorities to eliminate the tax on foreign exchange transactions, which constitutes

3
an unapproved exchange restriction under Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement.
Directors noted that a prudent regulatory environment and strong capital positions have
helped Aruba’s banking system weather the downturn without major strains. They
encouraged the authorities to foster greater competition in the financial sector by
temporarily relaxing some barriers to entry for foreign banks, provided close cooperation
is established with home country supervisors.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for the Kingdom of the Netherlands—Aruba
October 20, 2010
Introduction
The new government came into power on 30 October 2009, in the midst of a severe economic
recession. In 2009 real GDP contracted by 7.7 percent, reflecting a drop in tourism caused by
the global financial and economic crisis, a blow to construction activities especially in the
tourism sector, and the temporary ceasing of refining activities by the Valero refinery.
Unemployment rose to about 11 percent. The year 2009 was preceded by a few years of modest
real GDP growth and increasing inflation, especially in food and housing. In this context, social
problems on the island had aggravated.
A first essential initiative by the new government was to improve relations with strategic
external partners as well as with domestic stakeholders. Great efforts were put into this, and
have yielded important results. The Valero refinery, accounting for about 5% of the workforce
and which had interrupted operations, is now preparing for its operations to restart probably
early next year. KLM and Carnival Cruise Lines, which had stopped their flights/calls to the
island now have resumed their activities in Aruba, bringing high-end tourists to spend time on
the island. Relations with the Netherlands have significantly improved, leading inter alia to an
agreement on front-loading investments by the partly Dutch government-financed Aruba
Development Fund, and Aruba has played a positive role in the constitutional reform of the
Kingdom.
The authorities initiated a Social Dialogue creating consensus-building between government,
employers and unions. A first agreement between the participants was signed end-August. The
agreed measures will contribute substantially to the medium-term fiscal sustainability of
Aruba’s welfare system. Furthermore, it was agreed that a tripartite committee for tax reforms
will be established and will report on its finding in April 2011. More work is foreseen in a
second Social Dialogue starting in November 2010, which will address the issues of education,
safety, security and the aging population. The aim is to implement necessary action as of
January 2012. Already the Social Dialogue has led to a much stronger engagement and
commitment of different stakeholders in society, which the government considers to be a
necessary condition for moving forward on the path towards durable and sustainable growth.
Public finances
The authorities agree with staff that the fiscal challenges are serious. In the 2010 budget, the
government presented a medium-term deficit path, envisaging a reduction of the deficit by
around 1.5 percentage points per year in 2012-2014. The Parliament, in which the government
party has a majority, has made clear that it attaches great importance to reducing the fiscal
deficit.

The first Social Dialogue led to an agreement in August of this year. It contained a balanced set
of measures, providing relief of immediate pressure on vulnerable groups in society, while
making important progress in addressing the structural underfunding of Aruba's welfare system,
in particular its main pension schemes. Arrangements were also made to address part of the
shortfall in revenues in the short term. The tariff of the business turnover tax (BBO) had already
been halved by the current government in an earlier stage as part of an economic stimulus plan to
improve the purchasing power of the population and expand the financial limits of businesses. It
was agreed in the context of this dialogue that the planned cancellation of the business turnover
tax will be delayed and dealt with in the context of broader tax reform. Furthermore, excise taxes
will be increased on demerit goods so as to achieve the 2009 price level, offsetting the loss in
revenue from the halving of the BBO in those particular categories.
Agreed reforms of the defined-benefit pension scheme for civil servants (APFA) will
significantly reduce the government's obligatory payments to the Fund. It was agreed to raise the
pension age from 55 to 60 years; benefits will no longer be based on final wage but on the basis
of average career wages; and importantly, claims on APFA pensions will be computed net of
AOV-pension claims (the general pension). Moreover, a recovery plan was agreed until 2019 to
restore the Fund’s solvency position.
The premium income for the AOV (the general pay-as-you-go pension scheme) will increase as
a result of the agreed arrangements in the Social Dialogue, postponing the need for government
transfers. Participants in the dialogue also decided to further look into demographic and labor
market developments in relation to the AOV pensionable age. An obligatory second pillar
pension for the private sector will be introduced as part of labor contracts, with contributions
split between employers and employees. In the longer term, this will improve financial
conditions for the elderly and reduce the pressure on the AOV.
Other arrangements agreed in the Social Dialogue include an increase in the premium for the
universal health care system AZV, by 2 percent, equally shared between employers and
employees, and a reduction in the number of civil servants by a hiring freeze (except for
teachers and public order staff).
Notwithstanding the reforms outlined above, the government is aware that the fiscal deficit will
need to be reduced in the short-to-medium term, as outlined in the 2012-2014 deficit reduction
path. It sees some room for cuts in government spending, in particular by reorganizing
government tasks, lowering the public wage bill and taking action to reduce government
transfers to the AZV (general health insurance). On the revenue side, it is noteworthy that the
new government changed the practice that hotel and oil industries paid very little taxes.
Importantly, the recent tax settlement with Valero not only involved a large one-off tax payment
but also includes a provision that as of 2012 Valero will pay a minimum of $10 million yearly in
corporate tax. Finally, the government expects that its broad investment program will have its
share of returns in revenues for the government.

Strategy for growth
The government aims to raise the economy’s potential growth by pursuing investments that
improve the island's infrastructure and enhance the quality of services and the overall
experience that Aruba offers to the population and tourists, so as to enhance the added value of
our economic activities. The authorities thus aim for higher-end rather than more tourists.
Investments for a total amount of Afl. 1.2 billion are foreseen, mostly privately or through
private-public partnerships. Part of this effort is a planned Afl. 200 million investment program
by the (pre-funded and thus off-budget) Aruba Development Fund, which will focus in the next
one to two years on job-creating projects improving neighborhoods, schools and roads.
Public-private partnerships in the pipeline include relocating the container-harbor out of the
city of Oranjestad to the industrial area of Barcadera in the South-Center of the island, and
improving the island’s road network.
Large private investments currently being made are the construction of a large luxury hotel and
the preparations by the Valero refinery to restart refining operations. These projects have
encountered delays, leading the Central Bank of Aruba (CBA) to revise its real GDP growth
forecasts for 2010 downward to -3.7 percent, while revising upward the figure for 2011 to 9
percent, as the bulk of these investments will be realized next year.
Energy policies are high on the political agenda of the new administration. It is also foreseen that
a LNG-plant will be built by the refinery in cooperation with public utilities so as to improve the
sustainability of the island’s energy-supply.
The authorities furthermore envisage lowering the cost of doing business. Aware of the
incentives and disincentives that tax structures may bring, the government aims to create a fiscal
regime that permits growth. The fiscal regime, as stated above, will be reviewed as part of the
ongoing efforts of the Social Dialogue.
Monetary policy and financial sector supervision
The main objective of the monetary policy of the (CBA) is to maintain relative price stability
through the preservation of a fixed exchange rate of the florin with the U.S. dollar. This peg to
the USD has been maintained ever since Aruba gained 'status aparte' within the Kingdom of the
Netherlands in 1986. To support the confidence in the currency peg, the CBA strives to maintain
a comfortable level of foreign exchange reserves.
Until 2009, the CBA's main monetary instrument was a ceiling on credit growth. As of January
2010, the CBA has moved to more indirect monetary instruments, i.e. an unremunerated reserve
requirement. In meetings with commercial banks, IMF staff found that this change in policy had

not been fully perceived by market participants as such. Since then and as a direct follow-up to
staff's recommendation, the CBA has adapted its communication to market participants,
including at a recent meeting with the Aruba Bankers Association and in its most recent
monetary policy press release, clarifying the change in policy.
The financial sector generally remains in solid conditions. Whereas empirical evidence shows
that some competition between banks exists, for instance through acquirement of business
account of competitors, authorities generally agree with staff that competition between banks is
modest, as is illustrated by the very high interest rate differentials, despite a lack of credit
demand. The CBA plans to explore how changes in prudential and consumer protection policy
could enhance competition in the banking sector, while maintaining the sector's solidity.
The CBA invests continuously in the quality of supervision. Following the IMF's
recommendations in the 2008 Article IV consultation, the CBA in 2009 has introduced stress
testing, using IMF models. Based on the lessons learned from the international financial crisis,
the CBA decided to increase the required liquidity and solvency rations. A second stress test was
conducted in September 2010. The CBA's supervision division is in the process of broadening its
scope of activities to include supervision of the securities and investment business sector and all
AML/CFT obligations of financial institutions and DNFBPs (Designated Nonfinancial
Businesses and Professions). In order to enhance integrity supervision, including for AML/CFT
purposes, a separate integrity unit within the supervision department was set up in the CBA.
