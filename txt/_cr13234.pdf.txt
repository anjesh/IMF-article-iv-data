STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 2, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: The economic growth is expected to remain weak in fiscal year (FY) 2012/13 but,
beyond FY 2012/13, to gradually converge back to the historical trend. Risks to the nearterm outlook are tilted to the downside, reflecting external risks and weak business
confidence.
Fiscal Policy: In view of Tonga’s high level of external debt and the expected increase in
debt repayments, fiscal consolidation should be sustained. A sound fiscal consolidation
strategy should not factor in debt relief unless it materializes. If debt relief efforts succeed,
the fiscal space that would result should be prudently used.
Monetary Policy: The authorities need to start considering an unwinding of the
accommodative monetary policy stance. The government’s proposal to further
commercialize the Tonga Development Bank (TDB) has merits but will need to be
accompanied by a thorough due diligence assessment.
Structural Policy: Tonga should continue to strengthen its macroeconomic institutions in
key areas, including revenue mobilization and tax policy, public finance and debt
management, and financial supervision. Boosting Tonga’s long-term growth prospects will
also require steps to strengthen investor confidence. Efforts should focus on policy
coordination and judicious deregulation.

THE MACROECONOMIC SITUATION
1.
After achieving about 3 percent of annual growth during FY 2008/9–10/11 (fiscal
year ends on June 30), real GDP growth slowed down to 0.8 percent in FY 2011/12. In the
previous three years, public investment projects, particularly those funded by China’s EXIM Bank,
had offset the negative spillovers from the global financial crisis. However, those projects are
now completed and exerting a drag on growth—along with weaknesses in remittances, other
investment spending, and tourist arrivals. Growth is thus expected to slow further to about
½ percent in FY 2012/13. Starting in FY 2013/14, a gradual recovery of remittances and
tourism—along with improved infrastructure—is expected to raise growth to about 1¾ percent.
2.
Headline inflation has fallen significantly. After peaking at 9.7 percent in May 2011
(above the official reference range of 6–8 percent), inflation decelerated to 0.5 percent in
April 2013, led mainly by imported food and oil prices. Going forward, inflation is expected to
recover to the historical trend (about 5.5 percent). However, in the near term, there is an upside
risk to inflation from the need to realign electricity prices with fuel costs.
3.
There are no imminent risks to the external balance. Despite the continued
contraction of remittances since 2008, increases in foreign grants and, more recently, a decline in
imports, led gross official foreign reserves to rise by about 45 percent since December 2010. In
the medium term, however, the overall balance of payment is expected to return to a deficit. This
will cause gross international reserves to fall but remain above 4 months of imports (the NRBT’s
target).
4.
Risks to the near-term outlook are tilted to the downside given continued
fragilities in the global economy as well as domestic vulnerabilities. Tonga is highly
dependent on growth prospects in Australia and New Zealand, its primary markets for exports,
tourism, and seasonal migrant employment. Accordingly, global developments that could
adversely impact these regional economies represent the main risks to Tonga. Currently, key risks
relate to lingering uncertainties over fiscal policy in the United States, possible re-intensification
of euro area stress, and a broad-based and deeper-than-expected slowdown of emerging market
economies. On the domestic side, slippages in critical reforms could undermine investor
confidence.

A. Authorities’ Views
5.
While being more cautious, the authorities broadly agreed with the staff on the
macroeconomic outlook. They noted that remittances, one of the key drivers of Tonga’s
underlying growth, will likely not soon recover to pre-crisis levels notwithstanding the global
economic recovery, considering lags in the recovery of jobs (particularly in California that hosts a
large share of the Tongan diasporas) and the need to rebuild household net worth in advanced
economies.

REBUILDING POLICY SPACE TO BETTER MANAGE
RISKS TO GROWTH
Tonga needs to rebuild policy buffers by strengthening its fiscal position given its high
external vulnerability. At the same time, consideration should be given to a timely
unwinding of the accommodative monetary policy stance.

A. Background
6.
Tonga’s fiscal position improved significantly in recent years. The overall budget
deficit decreased to 2.7 percent of GDP from 7.6 percent in the previous year. The
FY 2012/13 budget aims to eliminate the fiscal deficit in line with the expected ending of Chinafunded investment projects. Although the mid-year assessment of the FY 2012/13 budget points
to shortfalls in both revenue collections including grants, these are expected to be offset by
corresponding cuts in grant-related expenditures and savings from the wage freeze.
7.
Following an improvement in the World Bank’s CPIA rating of Tonga’s
macroeconomic policies and institutions from weak to medium, the country has been
upgraded from high to moderate risk of external debt distress.1 The government adopted a
No New Loan Policy in June 2011 committing to no new borrowing (including concessional ones)
in light of Tonga’s external debt vulnerability. The authorities are also seeking debt relief from
the China EXIM Bank, through either debt reduction or rescheduling.

Monetary policy continued to focus on thawing the credit freeze within the
constraints set by the NRBT’s stated objectives. These objectives include protecting
international reserves and stabilizing inflation. Despite a basket peg, limited capital mobility
allows the NRBT to maintain substantial control over the reserve money. Since late 2009, the
NRBT has continued to limit sterilization to help re-grow private credits. While recent data show

TONGA

some signs of stabilization in credit growth, there has been concern over the effectiveness of
monetary policy transmission mechanism for some time (see Box 1).

B. Staff Views
9.
The government should continue to focus on strengthening the fiscal position to
restore fiscal space. External indebtedness remains an important vulnerability, and continuing
moderate primary surpluses should be targeted over the medium term to strengthen Tonga’s
debt and debt service indicators (Table 5). Medium-term fiscal consolidation should be
supported by strong debt management and continued avoidance of nonconcessional
borrowing.2 Staff also supports Tonga’s intention to maintain usable cash balances equivalent
to 2 months’ cover of recurrent spending as a fiscal buffer, given its limited options for
borrowing and high level of vulnerability to shocks. With a rise in recurrent spending in
FY 2013/14 and limited savings to build the cash balance, the latter is projected to slip to about
six weeks’ cover of recurrent spending by year-end. However, with increased primary surpluses
from FY 2014/15, domestic savings would rise sufficiently to stabilize and rebuild cash balances
toward the 2-month coverage ratio.
10.
For FY 2013/14, the primary fiscal surplus should be maintained at around
1 percent of GDP, in line with the projected FY 2012/13 outcome. Some financing from the
World Bank and AsDB that was formerly grant-only is expected to shift to an equal grant-loan
mix starting in FY 2013/14, consistent with the upgrade of Tonga’s debt distress rating. With this
decline in grant financing, a phased increase in the primary fiscal surplus to the 2 percent of GDP
medium-term range by FY 2014/15 is reasonable.3 Grace periods on some external loans will also
expire in FY 2013/14, and while the government has requested debt service relief, the design of
the fiscal consolidation strategy should not count on this being available. This approach would
allow any exceptional financing to be used to expand priority spending while also further
strengthening the primary surplus to help build cash buffers.
11.
Over the medium-term, fiscal consolidation will require wage restraint and revenue
reforms. The gradual recovery of economic growth is expected to increase the revenue-to-GDP
ratio by 1 percent, supported by revenue reforms. At the same time, the government aims to
reduce the share of the wage bill to 45 percent of recurrent spending. This will create fiscal space
to enable priority spending to rise to about 1½ percent of GDP, while protecting capital
investment outlays of about 2½–3½ percent of GDP (Table 5).
12.
The authorities need to start considering an unwinding of the accommodative
monetary policy stance. The NRBT’s accommodative monetary policy during the last three years,

Management of currency risks posed by the external debt would also benefit from improvements in hedging.

3

If the reduction in WB and AsDB grant financing is delayed until 2014/15, the government is advised to target a
larger primary fiscal surplus in 2013/14, corresponding to the higher baseline for grant inflows.

while appropriate, has resulted in a large liquidity overhang in the banking system, reflecting
both weak demand for credit and bank deleveraging. In the absence of a timely unwinding, the
overhang may amplify the procyclicality of the credit cycle. In view of this, the NRBT should stand
ready to mop up excess reserves, including by raising reserve requirements as needed, once
signs become clear that the credit cycle is bottoming out.
13.
The authorities intend to add a full commercial banking function to the Tonga
Development Bank (TDB). To this end, the authorities would like to seek equity participation
from two retirement funds and potential foreign investors to address the credit squeeze. This
plan has merits, given Tonga’s under-developed financial sector which is prone to market failure.
However, expanding commercial banking at TDB could also potentially increase fiscal and
governance risks, which should be properly addressed with the completion of a due diligence
process being conducted by the IFC. The authorities can also consider a carefully crafted
safeguard mechanism to advance its plan to introduce a risk-sharing facility (i.e., a donorsponsored credit guarantee scheme). Interest rate controls should be resisted.
14.
Staff’s exchange rate assessment suggests that there is no evidence of
misalignment of the exchange rate from the medium-term fundamentals (see Box 2). The
current basket peg of the exchange rate has served the country well as a nominal anchor.

C. Authorities’ Views
15.
While concerned about the expected decline in revenue in FY 2012/13, the
authorities did not expect this to require resort to new external financing—which would be
contrary to the No New Loan Policy. They expected the wage and hiring freeze policy put in
place for the FY 2012/13 budget to be fully effective in restraining recurrent spending. Moreover
the authorities intended to offset lower-than-expected project grants through comprehensive
expenditure reassessment across line ministries.
16.
The authorities agreed on the need for conservative assumptions about possible
debt relief from China. They intend to include debt relief in the final budget only when any
agreement is reached. Thus, while the FY2013/14 budget was being prepared using two
scenarios—with and without debt relief—the authorities are currently focusing on the scenario
without relief. The authorities are also reviewing the financial implications of the 2019 South
Pacific Games, which they have committed to host.
17.
The authorities expect inflation to remain stable below 6 percent, and international
reserves to hold at more than 4 months of import in the next 6 to 12 months. Based on this,
the authorities intend to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance in the near term.
However, the authorities agreed with the mission on the need to stand ready to mop up liquidity
with the bottoming of the credit cycle. The authorities favored recommencing the issuance of
NRBT notes and adjusting liquidity ratios, should the need arise. The authorities also agreed with
the staff on the need for a proper due diligence assessment by the IFC of the plans for TDB.

18.
The authorities shared the view that the current basket system has served the
Tongan economy well. They noted that external shocks could be absorbed by the exchange
rate flexibility (i.e., ±5 percent of monthly adjustment limit) if needed.

STRENGTHENING THE MACRO POLICY FRAMEWORK
Tonga should continue to strengthen its overall macro policy framework. Focus should be
on both expediting financial sector reform and enhancing fiscal policy effectiveness.

A. Background
19.
Financial sector reform is an on-going process. Banks in Tonga have been fixing their
balance sheets since late 2008. Shrinking the loan books and increasing holdings of reserve
assets have prompted negative macro-financial linkages and reduced business confidence. In
response, the NRBT has aggressively infused liquidity into the system and stepped up risk-based
supervision. Progress in improving the regulatory and institutional infrastructure has also
continued, including inauguration of a credit bureau.
20.
Revenue reform has progressed gradually. Previously identified priorities include: (i)
rationalizing tax exemptions; (ii) developing a natural resource taxation regime; and (iii)
introducing a small business taxation system. The government has since established a Revenue
Committee including to follow up on them.
21.
Public Finance Management (PFM) reforms have moved ahead. The government is
currently preparing its own PFM roadmap, and has agreed with development partners on a Joint
Policy Action Matrix (in which PFM-related reforms comprise a main pillar) linked to donor
budget supports.

B. Staff Views
22.
A stronger macro policy framework is critically important in building buffers
against future shocks. Banks’ painful efforts to clean up their balance sheets are expected to
eventually lead to a more resilient banking system. Efforts should continue to expedite this
process, and build a more robust regulatory and supervisory framework. The recent drawdown of
fiscal space increases the importance of on-going PFM and revenue administration reforms.


Financial sector. The financial deleveraging cycle may have turned the corner, with recent
data providing positive signals and banks positioning themselves to harness emerging
opportunities. Staff strongly supports the authorities’ continued efforts to strengthen on-site
supervision capacities. Staff also sees the need to further strengthen the collateral framework
including by addressing legal impediments to collateralizing lease rights on allotted lands.
The Receivership Bill should be enacted this year as planned. Efforts to promote interbank

TONGA

and bond market development should be reinvigorated with gradual reduction of excess
reserves.


Revenue reform. Staff strongly supports the creation of a presumptive tax regime for SMEs
and the natural resource tax regime. Revenue reform efforts should include streamlining and
enhancing the transparency of tax exemptions. Given Tonga’s revenue challenges, and the
loopholes generated by it, the staff recommends a freeze on new tax incentives. The recent
inclusion of tax expenditure in the budget is welcome. Updating both the Revenue and
Customs Management Systems is an important priority, as is the rationalization of tax
penalties.



PFM. Major gains have been made in: (i) budget transparency; (ii) the establishment of a
Treasury Single Account system; and (iii) better prioritization of the budget. Priorities going
forward should include: (i) updating personnel/payroll systems; (ii) strengthening the
procurement process; and (iii) on-going corporate planning reform and further advances in
program budgeting. The formalization of the PFM reform roadmap should also be facilitated.

C. Authorities’ Views
23.
The authorities welcomed the observed changes in banks’ attitudes to lend, and
acknowledged the need for improving communication with banks—both to better
understand their needs and to more closely share policy intentions. The authorities also asked for
continued technical assistance on onsite supervision and review of relevant financial laws,
including the Reserve Bank Act and Financial Institutions Act, with a view to strengthening the
financial regulatory framework. The government indicated that ministries are developing
corporate plans which will be integrated into the budget. The medium-term budget is also being
developed.
24.
While taking note of staff’s recommendation, the authorities informed staff that
strategies about tax incentives are internally being debated. In fact, some line ministries are
advocating an expansion of these incentives to support investment. Cabinet approved a
proposed small business tax and a natural resource taxation framework in September 2012,
which was prepared with technical assistance from PFTAC.

REVERSING A WEAKENING OF TREND GROWTH
Tonga’s efforts to develop the private sector are ongoing, and further efforts are needed to
nurture the business environment to unshackle private investment.

A. Background
25.
Tonga, like other PICs, faces significant challenges in raising job and economic
growth. New international competition has eroded Tonga’s niche markets. At the same time, a
catching up of income (to source countries) through remittance channels may have reached its
limit. Given declining exports, a very high rate of emigration, and a low investment rate, there are
concerns about the economy’s transition to permanently slow growth.
26.
Tonga’s efforts to develop the private sector are ongoing. Tonga is facing difficult
structural challenges, including its small size and remoteness. Addressing them in a way that
improves growth prospects will require higher investment, in particular private ones. Improving
the business environment will clearly facilitate this process, as will strengthening investor
confidence. Vast marine resources, potential to grow niche tourism, and a well-educated and
English speaking population are opportunities that can be explored, in particular if combined
with well-targeted deepening of structural reforms.

B. Staff Views
27.
Reforms should focus on policy coordination and judicious deregulation. Recent
efforts to enhance intra-government coordination and dialogue with the private sector are
welcome. The current framework (e.g., National Growth Committee) should be further
strengthened, for example by establishing a high-level government position to coordinate and
oversee inter-ministry efforts to address impediments to private sector growth. A tailored
support mechanism could be put in place, focusing initially on strategically important foreign
investors.
28.
The business licensing reform has achieved an important milestone by abolishing
the requirement for annual renewal of the headline trade license. The reform initiatives could
now focus on easing ancillary licenses required by various regulatory agencies. Improving access
to information needed by new investors is also important, as well as enhanced communication
on key ongoing reforms, to help boost business confidence.
29.
Staff supports the authorities’ intention to develop tourism as the key growth
engine. An enabling business environment and foreign capital participation would be important
to achieve this objective, as well as to revive growth in fishery and agriculture. Consistent and
predictable conservation decisions (e.g., in fishery) are also important to promote investor
confidence. The authorities’ plan to prepare a mining law is welcome given the need to prepare
for a comprehensive framework for the emerging deep-sea extractive potential.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

TONGA

30.
Continued efforts are needed to restructure distressed public enterprises.
Identification of private partners for these companies would be buttressed by commitment to
business enabling reforms. On a related issue, the tariff on electricity should be realigned to fuel
costs, while targeted transfers could be used to protect the vulnerable. The financial positions of
the public enterprises should be integrated into the national debt management framework, with
a focus on fiscal contingent liabilities.

C. Authorities’ Views
31.
The authorities agreed with staff on the need to further deepen structural reform
to nurture business environment, including through strengthened policy coordination. The
authorities in particular noted the need to create a full-time position within the government to
oversee inter-line ministry coordination. The authorities noted that focus of the reform is shifting
to land issues and immigration visa issues. The authorities also took note of the need for a
tailored service for strategically important foreign investors.
32.
The government’s highest priority is on the promotion of tourism, including
through more aggressive destination marketing. Nonetheless, the authorities acknowledged
the difficulty in determining target niches within the tourism industry. The authorities are
working closely with the private sector to address agricultural market access issues, including
through joint marketing trips, and noted that support should now focus on overcoming nontariff barriers and on organizing suppliers. The authorities also noted that the recent
establishment of an agricultural marketing fund will help mitigate difficulty in access to finance.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
The Tongan economy is expected to remain weak in FY 2012/13, following the
completion of key public work projects. Beyond FY 2012/13, staff projects the economy to
recover gradually, but to a slightly lower growth rate than the historical trend before the global
financial crisis. Risks to the near-term outlook are tilted to the downside, reflecting external risks
and weak business confidence.
34.
The current macroeconomic policy mix, which combines fiscal consolidation and
monetary accommodation, is appropriate. The overall fiscal deficit fell from 7.6 percent
to 2.7 percent of GDP in FY 2011/12; and the FY 2012/13 budget aims to eliminate the remaining
deficit. Monetary conditions have remained accommodative for the past three years.
35.
In view of Tonga’s level of external debt—an important vulnerability despite the
DSA rating upgrade—and the expected increase in debt repayments, fiscal consolidation
should be sustained. The FY 2013/14 budget could aim to maintain a similar level of primary
balance surplus as in FY 2012/13, to preserve cash buffers with the expected repayments on the
external loans and limited borrowing options. A credible fiscal consolidation strategy should not

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TONGA

factor in debt relief until it becomes certain, and the space that could result from debt relief
should be prudently used.
36.
The authorities need to start considering an unwinding of the accommodative
monetary policy stance. In particular, the NRBT should stand ready to mop up excess liquidity
with the bottoming out of the credit cycle. At the same time, other efforts to overcome obstacles
to renewed credit growth should continue. In this context the government’s plan to further
commercialize TDB has merits, but a thorough due diligence assessment is essential.
37.
Staff strongly supports the creation of a presumptive tax regime for SMEs and the
natural resource tax regime. Revenue reform efforts should include streamlining and enhancing
the transparency of tax exemptions. Formalization of the PFM reform roadmap is important to
demonstrate the authorities’ commitment to reform and to inform technical assistance from
donors.
38.
Tonga’s structural challenges to growth call for reforms to strengthen investor
confidence. Reforms should focus on policy coordination and judicious deregulation. The
current framework for coordination could be further strengthened, for example by establishing a
high-level coordinator. A tailored support mechanism for foreign investors should also be put in
place. The business licensing reform has achieved an important milestone, and could now focus
on easing ancillary licenses.
39.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Tonga be held on the 12month consultation cycle in accordance with the decision on consultation cycles, Decision
No. 14747-(10/96) (9/28/2010).

political instability, which culminated in
a civil uprising, halted the credit expansion for about a year (2006Q1–07Q1). With the restoration of
political stability, credit growth resumed at a brisk pace from the second quarter of 2007. Monetary
easing aimed at post-civil uprising economic recovery, reconstruction investments, and a pocket of
separate large projects provided the impetus during this time.
The credit boom abruptly ended in the third quarter of 2008 against a backdrop of sharply
deteriorating debt servicing capacities and moderating asset prices in the wake of the global financial
crisis. The remittance and tourism channels were particularly prevalent in transmitting initial impacts.
The ensuing stress fully opened up a macro-financial feedback loop. During this process, Tongan banks
displayed deep-rooted weaknesses in risk management and governance, despite foreign control and
ownership.
Since then, Tongan banks have continued to fix their balance sheets. Despite aggressive liquidity
injection by the NRBT, banks have continued to shrink their loan books and have piled up excess
reserves (in order to reduce risk-weighted assets), prompting renewed attention on the need to
strengthen Tonga’s monetary policy transmission mechanism, which has traditionally been weak.
Fortunately, recent data indicate that the deleveraging may soon turn the corner, with the equity-toasset ratio now reaching 20 percent, credit contraction stabilizing, and loan loss provisioning peaking
off.
What can be done to raise the effectiveness of monetary policy?



The structural weaknesses stemming from financial underdevelopment will have to be addressed
through enabling structural reforms: Tonga is making steadfast progress on this front.



The recent further deterioration of the transmission mechanism has a cyclical nature, stemming
mainly from the credit boom-bust cycle; while it will correct itself with the turn of the cycle,
policies should be open to various options for expediting the deleveraging (e.g., possible further
mobilization of private capital)

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TONGA



Efforts to promote interbank and bond market development should be reinvigorated, as the
excess reserve overhang, a key conjunctural impediment to the efficient functioning of interbank
markets, is removed in time.



The authorities’ plan to broaden TDB’s business focus toward SMEs and public enterprises can
provide much needed impetus to financial deepening and raise competition. A partnership with
the private sector including IFIs will help limit fiscal and governance risks.



SME credit guarantee programs can also help in this regard, provided that appropriate TAs can
be provided, leading to private partnership (especially from IFIs).



Interest rate controls should be avoided, as they are ineffective, leads to inefficient credit
allocation, and do not address the fundamental problem of weak business confidence.

fundamentals. The macroeconomic balance
approach suggests that the Tongan currency
is below its long-run equilibrium level by
about 3 percent, while the purchasing power
parity approach indicates an overvaluation of
around 8 percent.

 Exports. Export growth is expected at around 8 percent in the medium term (compared to an
average rate of 6.5 percent in the past decade), as the economy continues to recover, and
programs to boost exports including in tourism yield results.



Costs of doing business. Tonga is matched only by Samoa and Fiji among Pacific island countries
in its relatively favorable rating under the World Bank’s Doing Business 2013 report. However,
overcoming Tonga’s locational disadvantage and small size will require an even stronger business
environment. Judicious deregulation (e.g., easing ancillary licenses) and enhanced policy
coordination to nurture a business-friendly environment will be important.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
Tonga has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4 and maintains an
exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international. Since February 11, 1991, the value of the pa’anga is determined based on a weighted
basket of currencies comprising the United States, Australian, and New Zealand dollars, with the
U.S. dollar as the intervention currency. In July 2000, the Japanese yen was added to the basket, and
the monthly maximum adjustment limit was raised to 5 percent from 2 percent that had prevailed
since March 1998, when the allowance for adjustment was introduced. Tonga has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4.
Last Article IV Consultation
Staff discussions were held during February−March 2012, and the Executive Board discussed the
staff report (IMF Country Report No. 12/166) on May 16, 2012.
Previous Fund Recommendations
The staff and the authorities have continued to share comprehensive views in the past about policy
priorities. During the 2012 consultation, Executive Directors emphasized the importance of
strengthening policy buffers and of fiscal consolidation to rebuild the government’s cash balances
and safeguard debt sustainability; continuing to strengthen bank balance sheets; improving the
business environment; and following through on the technical assitatnce (TA) from the Pacific
Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) on tax reform.


The authorities expect to achieve significant fiscal consolidation in FY2012/13 through reduced
spending. The wage and hiring freeze put in place for the FY2012/13 budget was likely to have
constrained recurrent spending, and the lower-than-expected project grants were offset by a
corresponding under-implementation of related spending. The government has also adhered to
its No New Loan policy.



The authorities continued to strengthen risk-based supervision, launched a credit bureau, and
expect to enact the Receivership bill this year.



The authorities have removed the annual renewal requirement for the headline business license.
However, progress in public enterprise reform was slow due to difficulties in identifying strategic
investors.



The authorities created a presumptive tax regime for SMEs and a natural resource tax regime.

Technical Assistance
The Legal Department (LEG) provided assistance on AML/CFT issues for the Pacific islands countries,
including Tonga, from 2002 through 2005.

TONGA: PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
CENTRE (PFTAC) COUNTRY STRATEGY 2013–141
Background
Tonga continues to face a difficult macroeconomic environment. The global economic crisis has
led to a sustained period of slow growth, undermining both fiscal and financial stability. Nonperforming loans in the banking system remain high, while fiscal policy options are tightly
constrained by the high level of public external debt.
PFTAC has provided technical assistance (TA) to Tonga in all sectors in recent years,
collaborating closely with other development partners. This has been particularly so in the
public financial management (PFM) area where PFTAC has been working with the Asian
Development Bank (AsDB) to assist the authorities design and implement a realistic reform
roadmap. Regular TA has also been provided in the compilation of National Accounts and Balance
of Payment statistics. Support has also been provided to the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT)
in off-site and on-site banking supervision.
Strategy 2013–14
PFTAC’s TA strategy is guided by the APD regional strategy note and is planned within the results
framework for current PFTAC funding cycle.2 This strategy was discussed with the authorities in
June 2011.
PFTAC TA aims to support the authorities sustain progress on fiscal consolidation and to
improve the macroeconomic environment. PFTAC will continue to work closely with the broader
development partner group to ensure coherence and will aim to support implementation of actions
in the development partners’ budget support reform matrix. Inputs are expected in all sectors,
primarily at the strategic level in the fiscal and statistics sectors with detailed training and capacity
building in bank supervision and macroeconomics.
In the public financial management area, the focus will primarily be, together with AsDB, on
refining the PFM roadmap developed on the basis of the 2010 Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessment (1.2). PFTAC will contribute specific technical areas to support the
AsDB projects that aim to develop an effective medium-term budget framework (1.5) and improve

budget execution. These are likely to be in more accurate macroeconomic analysis (5.1), more
rigorous cash/debt management (1.6), and planning improvements to the functioning of their FMIS.
In the medium term, PFTAC would look to assist the authorities implement a follow-up PEFA
assessment, probably in 2014 (1.1).
In the revenue area, the main focus remains on assisting the authorities to implement the
recommendations of the October 2011 PFTAC strategic revenue review. The review and PFTAC’s
regional benchmarking exercise showed that Tonga is one of the regional leaders in implementing
modern revenue administration practices. PFTAC inputs will be determined by ongoing discussions
with Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MOFNP) and Revenue Services and are likely to be
supported by a new resident long-term advisor (yet to be recruited). PFTAC’s specific inputs are
likely to concentrate on improving corporate planning and strategies (2.2), implementing the new
small/micro business tax regime (2.1), natural resource taxation (2.1), risk management and
compliance strategies (2.5), and taxpayer services (2.4).
In statistics, Tonga is relatively well advanced against the overall results framework; based on PFTAC
advice, it produces National Accounts on two independent measures (4.1) with production of a
range of income indicators (4.3). Balance of payments statistics are now being developed according
to BPM6 standards (4.8). However, the quality of statistics and source data need to be strengthened
which was assisted during 2011 and 2012 by an AusAID funded resident advisor. As a result, direct
PFTAC assistance was minimal during this period. PFTAC continued to coordinate with and be a
resource for the resident advisor and to provide focused technical inputs in particular areas. Reengagement with Tonga may begin in 2013. Balance of payments and Government Finance Statistics
support will be provided by IMF HQ.
In financial sector supervision, IMF/PFTAC has assisted the NRBT establish enhanced off-site
analysis (3.1 and 3.2) and has provided support to on-site bank supervision. Intensive support is
being provided in 2012/13 to build on-site supervision techniques through training in standard
procedures, reports and analytical techniques (3.5-3.7). PFTAC is also providing follow-up support to
ensure that NRBT can regularly prepare off-site analysis and monitoring reports (3.1–3.3) using base
prudential returns developed by AFSPC. In 2013 this is likely to encompass implementation of the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) Financial Sector Information System (FSIS) .
In the macroeconomic area, PFTAC will assist the NRBT in strengthening its capacity for
macroeconomic analysis in cooperation with the research advisor from the Reserve Bank of Australia
currently placed with NRBT (5.1). Staffs of NRBT and MOFNP participated in a regional financial
programming workshop held jointly by PFTAC and the Singapore Regional Training Institute in
late 2012, and a follow-up visit to NRBT by PFTAC’s macroeconomic advisor is planned for 2013
(5.2). PFTAC is also providing support for the AsDB PFM TA project (involving a resident long-term
adviser) to strengthen macroeconomic and fiscal forecasting (5.3).

TONGA: WORLD BANK–IMF COLLABORATION1
The IMF team led by Mr. Jookyung Ree (mission chief to Tonga) has a close working relationship
with the Bank team led by Mr. Vivek Suri (lead economist, East Asia and the Pacific region) and
Mr. Robert Jauncey (senior country officer). The teams have an ongoing dialog on a range of
macroeconomic and structural issues. The level of cooperation and coordination is good and
includes the following:






Article IV Consultation. The World Bank participated in the 2009–13 Article IV missions, as well
as joining several consultations and providing various analytical inputs to the 2013 Article IV
Report. This participation facilitated the discussions, especially in areas of mutual interest such as
fiscal policy and structural reform. In addition, Bank and Fund staffs prepared jointly the Debt
Sustainability Analysis appendix to the staff reports.
Economic Updates. IMF analysis continues to provide a vital framework to the ongoing budget
support program, with IMF assessments used as the basis for decisions regarding the
appropriateness of the overall macroeconomic policy framework.
Structural Fiscal Reforms. Bank and Fund staffs have worked successfully to provide technical
assistance (TA) in public expenditure management and continue to collaborate on the ongoing
analytical work on public expenditure, the medium-term macro-framework, and general
structural issues.

Based on the above cooperation, the Bank and the Fund share a common view about Tonga’s
macroeconomic and structural reform priorities, which mainly aim at mitigating the risks to Tonga’s
external and fiscal sustainability and at promoting long-term growth. These include:





Putting public debt firmly on a downward path. This will require progress on multiple fronts
over the medium term, including the effective implementation of current policy to avoid new
borrowing, stepping up revenue administration and expenditure control, prioritizing
expenditure, as well as structural reforms. The government’s fiscal efforts will need to be
supplemented by continued provision of grants from donors.
Making use of the flexibility afforded by the current exchange rate arrangement. This
remains critical for safeguarding external stability.
Promoting private drivers of growth. Given fundamental constraints of smallness and
isolation, growth prospects are likely to remain concentrated in areas where premiums can be
generated to cover higher costs of production. Natural resource industries, including tourism,
agriculture, fisheries and mining hold the greatest potential for private sector development. To
facilitate development in these areas there is a need to: (i) improve efficiency in the energy
sector to reduce costs; (ii) strengthen the institutional framework for lending—including the
enforcement of creditor rights to collateral—as a means to increase access to finance and lower

the cost of borrowing; (iii) improve vital tourism infrastructure, including through the
introduction of private participation in the management of the Dateline Hotel and
commercialization of Tonga Communication Corporation; and (iv) lower regulatory barriers to
foreign investment.
World Bank Group cooperation with Tonga is set out in a Country Assistance Strategy presented to
the Board in October 2010. Given the current depth of policy dialogue and Tonga’s difficult position,
the Bank is significantly scaling up both analytical and financial support for Tonga. Total IDA and
Trust Fund commitments to Tonga over the past three years amount to almost US$73 million,
compared to $30 million between 1985–when Tonga became a member–and FY10. All assistance
since FY09 has been provided on 100 percent grant terms.
A key focus of engagement has been around energy-sector and general budget support operations.
US$5 million was provided to energy-sector reforms in FY2011, with a series of two development
policy operations–focusing on reforms in public financial management, fiscal policy and structural
reforms–providing an additional US$10.8 million of World Bank financing over FY2012–FY2013
through a World Bank-led multi-donor process.
Other World Bank investments are focused around connectivity for sustainable economic
development, and include: (i) a broadband cable, cofinanced with AsDB (US$17.2 million);
(ii) transport sector reform, with PRIF and AusAID financing (US$14.7 million); and (iii) aviation sector
support (US$27.2 million).
The World Bank provided TA to the Ministry of Finance and National Planning during FY2013 to
strengthen budget execution, monitoring, reporting and transparency, and, with AusAID financing
support, is undertaking a review of current investment incentive arrangements to support
Government in identifying priority reforms to encourage increased foreign investment.
The Bank and Fund teams will continue their close cooperation going forward, particularly in
supporting the current program of budget support and to assist the Government in responding to
ongoing economic difficulties. Appendix I details the specific activities planned by the two country
teams over the July 2012–July 2015 period. It was also agreed that further details on collaboration,
as necessary, will be agreed at the technical level as work progresses.

TONGA: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK1
The goal of the Asian Development Bank’s (AsDB) Pacific Approach 2010–2014 of a sustained and
resilient and improved standard of living aligns with the vision of Tonga’s National Strategic
Planning Framework 2009/2010-2014/2015 (NSPF) to create a society in which all Tongans enjoy
higher living standards and a better quality of life. Similarly, as the Pacific Approach aims to achieve
its goal through inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth, the NSPF aspires to achieve its
vision through equitable and environmentally sustainable private sector-led economic growth.
AsDB’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2007-12 for Tonga shares the same focus as the Pacific
Approach and the NSPF.
AsDB’s support to Tonga will be through infrastructure development; renewable energy; effective,
prudent macroeconomic and fiscal management; and private sector development. The Pacific
Approach focuses on the need to mitigate environmental impact and strengthen climate change
resilience through development of renewable energy options; enhancing connectivity via
multimodal networks and new technologies; and supporting urban development. Two key drivers of
change to promote the focus of the Pacific Approach include improved private sector environment
and public sector management. The priority outcome objectives of the NSPF supported by AsDB are:
(i) to support the private sector through better engagement with government, appropriate
incentives, and streamlining rules and regulations; (ii) maintain and develop infrastructure to
improve the everyday lives of people; and (iii) integrate environmental sustainability and climate
change into all planning and executing of programs. AsDB’s strategy for Tonga is therefore
consistent with the Pacific Approach and the NSPF.
AsDB has approved 15 loans and 4 grants totaling $94.85 million from the Asian Development Fund
(ADF) to Tonga since it joined AsDB in 1972. Fifty six technical assistance (TA) projects with a value
of $10.6 million were also provided to improve capacity and strengthen institutional development in
various sectors. Past AsDB investments have focused on finance development and infrastructure
development in transport, power, agriculture, and fisheries.
Active projects include two grant-financed projects and three TA projects in the country portfolio.
The grant-financed program approved in 2009 helped Tonga mitigate the impact of the global
economic crisis, while establishing the basis for higher, more equitable and sustainable growth in
the medium term and creating an economy more resilient to future shocks. Another grant-financed
project supports enhancing living standards by improving urban infrastructure. Of the three ongoing
TA projects, one focuses on economic and strategic management as well as the development of a
public finance management roadmap and a medium-term budget framework. Two TA projects are
supporting the preparation of the proposed Tonga-Fiji submarine cable project and the second

phase of the integrated urban development project. Tonga also benefits from a number of regional
TA projects in private sector development, economic management, energy efficiency, and public
financial management. Assistance to climate change adaptation and mitigation activities will be
made available, in particular, the pilot program for climate resilience will support the mainstreaming
of climate change considerations into infrastructure development and through broader whole-ofgovernment institutional strengthening.

TONGA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
While economic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance, data deficiencies continue to
complicate the monitoring of economic conditions and policy formulation. The Statistics
Department (SD) and the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MOFNP) have received, on a
regular basis, technical assistance (TA) in national accounts, government finance, and balance of
payments (BOP) statistics from Fund’s Statistics department (STA) as well as the Pacific Financial
Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC); nevertheless, data provision to the Fund continues with long
delays.
The two main sources of statistical information are the Quarterly Bulletin of the National Reserve
Bank of Tonga (NRBT), and the annual and semi-annual budget reports from the MOFNP. The
country has been participating in the GDDS since May 30, 2006. The metadata are posted on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/gdds/gddscountrycategorylist/?strcode=TON).
Real Sector Statistics
In June 2012, the SD released a new series of national accounts, which changed the base year
to 2010/11 from 2000/01, with the assistance of a statistical advisor from New Zealand. The new
series also made improvements in the classification and valuation of inputs, in line with PFTAC
assistance in 2008 and 2009, including: utilization of 2009 Household Income and Expenditure
Survey (HIES); supplementation of customs data with quarantine office data in merchandize exports;
and inclusion of in-kind donor-funded capital projects and loan projects, which used not to be
captured. With the release in February 2013 of the preliminary GDP results for 2011/2012, the
historical series was further revised to reflect improved deflators. PFTAC is planning to resume its
statistical support with a mission in national accounts statistics in September 2013. The SD has also
been invited to participate in the PFTAC regional seminar on national accounts planned for
June 2013.
The Consumer Price Index is based on a basket of goods and services from the 2009 HIES. TA was
provided in 2008 on the development of an import price index, but trade data was not of sufficient
quality to produce indexes.
Labor market statistics are weak: employment statistics have not been compiled since 2003; and
average earnings statistics are not available. Publication of international arrival and departure
statistics recommenced in 2012. However, further work is required to develop migration statistics, in
particular information on emigration to the United States.
Government Finance Statistics
The FY2002/03 Central Government Budget Statement introduced a presentation of fiscal data
compiled according to the methodology of the 1986 Government Finance Statistics Manual.
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TONGA

However, improvements are still needed to ensure accurate and reliable fiscal data. Proper
classification of transactions is needed to permit reconciliation with monetary financing data. Lags in
updating the accounting system should be shortened. Published data are often subject to significant
revisions. Consolidated financial statistics for the broader public sector and general government are
not published due to lack of capacity. No data are reported for publication in the IFS or GFS
Yearbook. Tonga is participating in the three-year GFS-IMF project for the Asia-Pacific region funded
by the government of Japan, and has given a commitment to commence reporting for the
yearbooks. A mapping exercise from GFS 1986 to GFS 2001 has been carried out, but data has not
yet been presented publicly on the new GFS basis.
External Sector Statistics
The SD produces balance of payments statistics on a quarterly basis, which are published in its
website in BPM6 format. However, standard methodology, either of BPM5 or BPM6, is largely not
observed, and data are published with a significant lag. Official BOP statistics are compiled annually
by the SD with long lags. Monthly trade figures, derived from customs data, are available with a
three-month lag. Unofficially, the NRBT compiles monthly balance of payments statistics based on
the Overseas Exchange Transactions (OET) records of the banking system with a six-week lag,
although the OET has serious shortcomings in its reporting requirements—the lack of a coding
system consistent with needs to compile the balance of payments. There are significant differences
between the BOP estimates compiled by the SD and NRBT. Moreover, large errors and omissions
point to possible under-recording of imports. With regard to international investment positions (IIP),
no information is published due to lack of capacity and a data collection framework. External debt
transactions are largely underestimated in the balance of payments. However, attempts are being
made to improve reporting of external debt and capital transfers to be consistent with the national
accounts. Changes in reserves do not distinguish transactions from valuation changes.
With PFTAC assistance in March 2009, the SD developed revised draft BOP statistics and
methodology, and made recommendations for further improvements in compilation techniques and
source data. A follow-up mission took place in March 2010. As part of the Pacific Region module of
the JSA Project on External Sector Statistics (ESS) in the Asia and Pacific Region, a mission from the
IMF took place in November 2012 to provide TA in balance of payments and IIP. The MOFNP has
put in place a system that provides detailed information on official sector external disbursements
and debt service.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
NRBT reports data for the central bank, other depository corporations, and monetary aggregates
using the standardized report forms (SRFs). These data were published for the first time in the
March 2008 issue of IFS and IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics. The NRBT will have
to allocate resources to improve the quality of the monetary and financial statistics by obtaining
source data suitable for compilation of the SRFs in line with the recommendations of the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual. TA in monetary and financial statistics will be needed to improve the

JOINT IMF/WORLD BANK DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
July 2, 2013

ANALYSIS 2013
Approved By
(IMF) Luis Breuer
(IDA) Sudhir Shetty; Jeffrey
D. Lewis

Prepared By
The International Monetary Fund and
The International Development Association

Tonga’s rating has been changed from high to moderate risk of debt distress based on
the joint IMF-WB low-income country debt sustainability assessment (LIC DSA). This
change is mainly due to the improvement of the Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) rating from ‘Weak’ to ‘Medium’ by the World Bank last year. Although
the relevant indicators of external and public debt and debt service show a similar path
for debt dynamics as last year’s DSA, the upgrade of the CPIA rating for Tonga
significantly increases thresholds of these indicators, with only a single threshold (PV of
debt in percent of exports) now breached for no more than three years under the baseline
scenario. Because remittances have declined significantly in recent years, they are
excluded from debt burden thresholds and indicators under the baseline scenario, but
may mitigate liquidity risks. Notwithstanding the upgrade of the DSA rating, risks remain
signficant, and a cautious approach is recommended towards new nonconcessional loans.
With scheduled repayments on two loans (reconstruction and roads) from the China EXIM
Bank, Tonga’s debt service burden is expected to rise sharply from FY 2013/14 (July 1 to
June 30), substantially draining the government’s cash balance. The government’s
balance sheet is also exposed to a currency risk, with about 60 percent of the outstanding
external debt denominated in Chinese renminbi. A declining path of external public debt
is critically dependent on steadfast implementation of medium-term fiscal consolidation,
as outlined in the Tonga Strategic Development Framework (TSDF).

TONGA

BACKGROUND
1.
As a small open economy, Tonga is facing the dual challenge of large fluctuations on the
external side and a limited production base on the domestic side. On one hand, it heavily relies on
remittances, tourism, and foreign aid. On the other hand, the production and export bases are quite narrow
and based mainly on a few agricultural products and fishery.
2.
The economy is gradually recovering from the effects of the global slowdown and the
domestic credit crunch. After averaging about 3 percent during the previous three years, economic
growth slowed down to 0.8 percent in FY 2011/12. In the previous three years, public investment projects,
particularly those funded by China EXIM Bank, had offset spillovers from the global financial crisis. However,
those projects have been completed, and a normalization of construction activity has reduced the impetus
for growth—along with weaknesses in remittances, other investment spending, and tourist arrivals. In
FY 2012/13, the economy is expected to grow by 0.5 percent. Starting in FY 2013/14, however, a gradual
recovery of remittances and tourism—along with improved infrastructure—will help growth to gradually
increase to about 1¾ percent over the medium term.
3.
Tonga’s total public sector debt stock (including publicly guaranteed debt) has risen since
FY 2008/09 and is expected to reach about 45 percent of GDP by the end of FY 2012/13. External
debt accounts for the majority of the debt stock, amounting to about 40 percent of GDP, leaving Tonga
vulnerable to foreign exchange liquidity and currency risks. This rise in debt stock was primarily on account
of two loans (for reconstruction and roads) from China EXIM Bank1. These loans account for about
60 percent of the outstanding external debt and pose an excessive exposure to a single foreign currency,
while long-term loans by international financial institutions (IFIs) account for about 35 percent of external
debt. In the current fiscal year, disbursements by China EXIM Bank have been completed for both the
reconstruction and road loans. In total, about 80 percent of the reconstruction loan was used to finance
direct government capital expenditure while the remainder was used for on-lending to the private sector
for office, residential, and retail construction. The terms of the on-lending include an interest of 5 percent
on the outstanding Tongan pa’anga amount, and the government receives repayments from the private
borrowers after the completion of the project2. The entire road reconstruction loan was used to finance
direct government capital spending on road improvements, including on the outer islands.

1

These loan commitments were signed in November 2007 (for reconstruction), and in February 2010 (for roads), and

bear a 2 percent interest rate, 5-year grace period, and 20-year maturity. The arrangement with the Chinese
contractor performing the work associated with these loans required an initial disbursement of 30 percent to cover
the down payment, while outstanding disbursements were paid quarterly as work was completed and claims filed.
The authorities hope to negotiate with China for a debt relief or a debt rescheduling for another 5 to 10 year grace
period.
2

Since March 2012, the private borrower has started to repay the government.

4.
Tonga’s DSA builds on the baseline scenario assumptions presented in Box 1. Under the
baseline scenario, over the medium term, recovery of remittances and tourism, along with improved
infrastructure will help growth to gradually increase to about 1¾ percent, slightly lower than its long-term
average growth rate of about 2 percent. Public spending is assumed to grow slower than projected
revenues and grants over the medium term, limiting the longer-term need for additional external
borrowing. Remittances—the largest source of foreign exchange earnings (one-half of Tongans live abroad,
mostly in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States)—are assumed to recover in the medium to long
term, in line with economic recovery in remittance-originating countries, and remain an important source
of foreign exchange inflows. The recovery in remittances is, however, more sluggish than assumed in the
previous DSA. Remittances are projected to recover from 14 percent of GDP in FY 2011/12 to 17 percent of
GDP by FY 2017/18 and an average of 18 percent of GDP over the longer term. This level is roughly the
average during 1994–2000, but much lower than the 32 percent of GDP average observed during 2001–10.
Because of recent declines, debt burden indicators and thresholds are exclusive of remittances under the
baseline scenario.
5.
On the fiscal front, the government is expected to implement a medium-term fiscal reform
plan supported by tax reform and restraint on payroll expenditure while increasing priority
spending. Under these assumptions, the government will be able to rebuild cash balances and maintain a
declining debt path while covering rising debt service costs. Revenues are expected to get some boost
from proposed reforms to tax policy and administration, as well as the gradual economic recovery, and this
will hep offset the gradual decrease of cash grants. The government is expected to continue with its policy
to reduce the share of the wage bill to 45 percent of recurrent spending, bringing down current
expenditure by about 2 percent of GDP in the medium term. Given all of these, the medium-term overall
fiscal balance (excluding the China EXIM Bank loans) is projected to average a surplus of about 1–2 percent
of GDP.
6.
The Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating for Tonga was upgraded from
‘Weak’ to ‘Medium’ by the World Bank last year. Credit was given for major gains in macroeconomic
policy management, social protection systems, and business environment reforms. Consistent with the
stronger rating for Tonga’s macroeconomic policies and institutions, it’s indicative debt distress thresholds
were raised relative to 2012 levels, thereby improving the

scenarios (Figures 1a-b).

7.
Based on the updated DSA, Tonga has been
upgraded from high to moderate risk of external debt
distress3. Only one threshold (PV of debt in percent of
export) is still breached under the baseline scenario, and
this breach is not protracted, lasting for only three years.

While remittances are excluded from debt burden indicators and thresholds, remittances are expected to
help mitigate liquidity risk.4
8.
However, Tonga continues to face important debt vulnerabilities, and the current DSA
suggests a similar path for debt dynamics as the previous year’s DSA. The debt burden peaks early in
the projection period and gradually declines in the absence of new nonconcessional external borrowing. It
also assumes that going forward, the Tongan government will undertake planned revenue reforms which,
together with restraints on recurrent spending, will contribute to a buildup of adequate cash reserves. It
also assumes that the Tongan government will continue to refrain from taking new nonconcessional loans
until Tonga is upgraded to a low risk of debt distress classification. It does not factor in any debt relief or
rescheduling.

EXTERNAL DSA
Baseline
9.
Under the baseline, due to the upgrade in the CPIA rating, the external debt trajectory
currently breaches only one policy-dependent threshold, the PV of debt-to-export ratio. However,
this breach is not protracted, with the ratio falling below the threshold in FY 2015/16 and remaining at
lower levels over the medium term (Figure 1a)5. The PV of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external
debt is currently about 35 percent of GDP, which breaches the former indicative threshold (30 percent of
GDP) but is below the revised indicative threshold (40 percent of GDP). The PV of debt-to-revenue ratio,
meanwhile, would stay well below the threshold throughout the projection period.
10.
Debt service is expected to rise in the medium term on account of the expiration of the
grace period on the China EXIM Bank loans. But it will remain well below the threshold of both exports
and revenue (Figure 1a).
11.
Tonga’s remittances would help reduce liquidity risks. Remittances to Tonga have averaged
about twice export receipts over the past decade, and have provided a considerable source of foreign
exchange inflows. Because they have declined significantly in recent years, remittances are excluded from
debt burden thresholds and indicators under the baseline scenario. In an alternative scenario including
remittances, the PV of PPG external debt relative to exports and remittance is projected to stay below the

The Interim Guidance on the Use of Remittances in the DSA Framework for Low-income Countries, which considers

remittances as part of the base case for countries with large remittances, will be used from next year.

According to the DSA guidelines, countries should be considered at a high risk of debt distress if there is a

(lower) modified threshold of 120 percent67. When remittances are considered with export earnings,
external debt service remains well under 10 percent throughout the projection period (Figure 1b).

Sensitivity Analysis
12.
Risk of debt distress is sensitive to assumptions regarding the external environment. Stress
tests show that the debt position is vulnerable to a significant slowdown in exports and currency risks. An
export shock stress test causes the PV of debt-to-export ratio to approach 260 percent of exports and
remain above the indicative threshold in the medium terms. Likewise, an exchange rate depreciation shock
causes the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio to breach the indicative threshold until FY 2015/16. The alternative
scenario based on historical averages (red lines) provides a more sanguine picture than the baseline8,
mainly because inflation rates of the U.S dollar denominated GDP deflator was higher in the past.

The public sector DSA reinforces the
conclusions of the external DSA9. The high level of
public sector borrowing for road building and
reconstruction of the capital city over the past few
years pushed PV of debt to stand to 40 percent of
GDP in the current fiscal year. But it is expected to
decline steadily under the baseline scenario
(Figure 2). This highlights the importance of fiscal
prudence and commitment to limiting new
nonconcessional PPG borrowing10.

Source: Fund staff calculations.

Under recently-issued guidance (Interim Guidance on the Use of Remittances), remittances will be included in the

base case starting with the 2014 DSA. This is likely to reinforce the conclusion that Tonga is at moderate risk of debt
distress.
7

In a recent review, the IMF Executive Board approved modifications in some of the thresholds.

8

In this alternative scenario, the following four variables are set at their historical levels; (i) real GDP growth; (ii)

growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms); (iii) non-interest current account in percent of GDP; and (iv) non-debt
creating flows.
9

The public sector DSA covers all Government and Government-guaranteed debt. Public enterprises are not

included but all external borrowing by them is accounted for, as public enterprises do not have access to
international capital markets.
10 Domestic debt (including government guaranteed debt) reached $36.9 million in FY 2012 (about 4.6 percent of
GDP), comprising of GoT’s bonds issued, with the majority of holdings by Financial Institutions and Retirement Fund
Board. GoT’s bonds are mainly issued on a roll-over basis with the exception of any redemptions or new issues.

Sensitivity Analysis and Alternative Scenario
14.
Stress tests indicate that vulnerabilities remain throughout the projection period, especially
to a significant depreciation (Figure 2). The PV of public debt would increase up to 53 percent in
FY 2013/14 when a one-time 30 percent real depreciation takes places, but subsequently fall to 42 percent
of GDP over the medium term. It should settle at around 19 percent of GDP in FY 2032/33.
15.
Alternative scenarios highlight the importance of fiscal consolidation and growth enhancing
reforms. An alternative scenario that maintains the primary balance at the FY 2011/12 level results in a
slightly slower decline in debt and debt service indicators relative to the baseline. The other alternative
scenario, where the long-term real GDP growth and primary balance are fixed at the average of the past
decade (both of which are significantly worse than in the baseline), leads the relevant debt and debt service
indicators either to fail to improve (PV of debt to GDP ratio and PV of debt to revenue ratio) or to improve
only marginally (debt service to revenue ratio).
16.
A no-reform scenario also highlights the importance of following through with the
government’s fiscal reform strategy. In a scenario of no tax reforms coupled with a failure to cut wages
expenditures (including due to socio-economical challenges), the authorities will have to borrow
domestically to bridge the financing gap. This will cause substantial further stress on the public debt level,
increasing the PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio to about 50 percent over time.

STAFF ASSESSMENT
17.
Tonga has moved from high to moderate risk of debt distress. This change is driven by an
improvement in Tonga’s CPIA rating from ‘weak’ to ‘medium’ and associated changes in debt distress
thresholds. While not included in debt burden indicators and thresholds under the baseline scenario,
remittances will mitigate liquidity risks. Threshold breaches under alternative scenarios indicate continued
external vulnerabilities.
18.
The assessment of reduced risk of debt distress is heavily contingent on successful fiscal
consolidation. The fiscal authorities need to build enough cash balances (about 2 months of recurrent
expenditure) to ensure servicing of the increased external debt obligations from FY 2013/14 without
sacrificing essential public spending11. Alternative scenarios underline the importance of sustained fiscal
consolidation for effective debt management. Additionally, there is a currency mismatch on the
government’s balance sheet (about 60 percent of the external debt are denominated in Chinese renminbi)
which, if left unhedged, could pose additional risk to Tonga’s debt dynamics.
19.
Key medium-term vulnerabilities include major external shocks, currency mismatches, and
lower GDP growth. These vulnerabilities underscore the importance of sound macroeconomic policies to
improve Tonga’s growth potential on a sustainable basis (as highlighted in the staff report), diversification

of export products and markets, and continued efforts to build fiscal buffers. Sound public debt
management is also essential to guide future development financing in Tonga. Priority should be given to
projects that would generate higher growth and employment, especially in the context of the Tonga
Strategic Development Framework (TSDF), to help strengthen debt service capacity in the future.
Consideration should also be given to hedging exchange risks on foreign liabilities using financial
instruments, and developing a comprehensive debt management strategy with technical assistance.

The Authorities’ Views
20.
The authorities recognize the risks posed by the high debt burden and would like to bring
down the public debt below 40 percent of GDP. The authorities agreed that creating fiscal space will be
crucial in reducing the debt burden and protecting priority spending. In discussions with staff, the
authorities noted that they were seeking to reschedule some of Tonga’s debt obligations to China EXIM
Bank. They shared staff’s concerns about the currency risk posed by the current external debt structure, and
noted that they were seeking technical assistance to mitigate this risk.

Box 1. Key Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth is projected at 0.5 percent in FY 2012/13. In the previous three years, spillovers from the
global economic crisis were offset by public investments, in particular reconstruction and road projects
funded by China EXIM Bank in FY 2011/12. However, as construction activities normalize and the recovery
of remittances remains slow, economic growth is expected to be weak in FY 2012/13. Over the medium
term, recovery of remittances and tourism, along with improved infrastructure, will help growth gradually
increase to about 1¾ percent, slightly lower than its long term average growth rate of about 2 percent.



The government is assumed to achieve an overall fiscal surplus of about 1−2 percent of GDP over the
medium term, including to meet the expected debt repayment. Reforms in tax policy and administration
are expected to improve the tax-to-GDP ratio to 16.4 percent of GDP from 15.7 percent of GDP over the
medium term, while cash grants will decline to 4.6 percent of GDP in FY 2017/18 from 9.9 percent of GDP
in FY 2011/12. Current expenditures (excluding ones funded by project grants) are expected to slow down,
led by a reduction in the ratio of the wage bill to GDP by about 1 percentage points over the medium
term. Total capital expenditure is expected to increase from about 2 percent of GDP to 3.4 percent of GDP
over the medium term.



Over the longer term, the primary fiscal surplus is expected to be eliminated with the gradual reduction
in cash grants. Lower project grants primarily explain the reduction in expenditure, while the wage bill is
targeted to average 45 percent of domestically-funded expenditure. Total capital expenditure is assumed
to remain at about 4 percent of GDP.



Financing. Majority of the grants, together with projected disbursements from concessional loans, are
assumed to be spent on development projects and associated maintenance. Following the final
disbursement of the China EXIM Bank road loan, there will be no external nonconcessional borrowing until
Tonga is upgraded to low risk of debt distress. The external financing from the World Bank and Asian
Development is expected to be under the rule of 50:50 (grants vs loans). On the domestic front, no new
(net) domestic borrowing is assumed.



The current account deficit is projected to narrow from 6.6 percent of GDP in FY 2011/12 to 5.9 percent
of GDP in FY 2012/13, due mainly to a decline in imports. The current account deficit should average about
3 percent of GDP over the medium term and narrow slightly over the long term, as remittances and
tourism receipts improve.



Remittances are expected to recover during the current fiscal year, along with strengthening economic
prospects in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Remittances are expected to remain an
important source of foreign exchange in the medium term.



Tourism receipts are projected to average around 10 percent of GDP and increase to an average of
13 percent of GDP over the long term
Tonga: Key Macroeconomic Assumptions (in percent)
assuming that the tourism environment
2012 DSA
2013 DSA
continues to improve.



The export base is projected to remain
narrow and relatively undiversified. The
proper operation of the fumigation
facility should help exports by meeting
New Zealand’s bio-security requirements.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Tonga
On July 19, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Tonga1 on a lapse of time basis2.
Economic growth slowed to 0.8 percent in fiscal year 2011/12 (July-June), from an average of about
3 percent during the previous three years. Reflecting the completion of public investment projects,
Tonga’s growth is likely to remain low in 2012/13, at about ½ percent. Starting in 2013/14, recovery
of remittances and tourism—along with improved infrastructure—will lead economic growth to
recover to a slightly lower growth rate than the historical trend.
Headline inflation has fallen significantly. After peaking at 9.7 percent in May 2011 (above the
official reference range of 6–8 percent), inflation decelerated to 0.5 percent in April 2013, led mainly
by imported food and oil prices. Going forward, inflation is expected to recover to about 5.5 percent.
There are no imminent risks to the external balance. Despite the continued contraction of remittances
since 2008, increases in foreign grants and, more recently, a decline in imports led gross official
foreign reserves to rise to about 8½ months of imports as of March 2013.
The overall budget deficit decreased to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2011/12 from 7.6 percent in the
previous year. The 2012/13 budget aims to eliminate the fiscal deficit. While a mid-year assessment
of the 2012/13 budget suggests that revenue collections could be less than budgeted, this is projected
to be matched by spending restraint. Following an upgrade by the World Bank of its Country Policy
and Institutional Assessment rating for Tonga’s macroeconomic policies and institutions, the risk of
external debt distress for the country has been reclassified from high to moderate. Monetary policy
continues to be accommodative, and recent data show some signs of stabilization in credit growth.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

Under the IMF’s lapse of time procedures, the Executive Board completes Article IV consultations without convening
formal discussions.

Progress in improving the regulatory and institutional infrastructure has continued, including
inauguration of a credit bureau.
Executive Board Assessment
On July 19, 2013, the Executive Board of the IMF concluded the Article IV consultation with Tonga
and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting.
The Tongan economy is expected to remain weak in FY 2012/13, following the completion of key
public work projects. Beyond FY 2012/13, staff projects the economy to recover gradually, but to a
slightly lower growth rate than the historical trend before the global financial crisis. Risks to the nearterm outlook are tilted to the downside, reflecting external risks and weak business confidence.
The current macroeconomic policy mix, which combines fiscal consolidation and monetary
accommodation, is appropriate. The overall fiscal deficit fell from 7.6 percent to 2.7 percent of GDP
in FY 2011/12; and the FY 2012/13 budget aims to eliminate the remaining deficit. Monetary
conditions have remained accommodative for the past three years.
In view of Tonga’s level of external debt—an important vulnerability despite the Debt Sustainability
Assessment rating upgrade—and the expected increase in debt repayments, fiscal consolidation
should be sustained. The FY 2013/14 budget could aim to maintain a similar level of primary balance
surplus as in FY 2012/13, to preserve cash buffers with the expected repayments on the external loans
and limited borrowing options. A credible fiscal consolidation strategy should not factor in debt relief
until it becomes certain, and the space that could result from debt relief should be prudently used.
The authorities need to start considering an unwinding of the accommodative monetary policy stance.
In particular, the National Reserve Bank of Tonga should stand ready to mop up excess liquidity with
the bottoming out of the credit cycle. At the same time, other efforts to overcome obstacles to
renewed credit growth should continue. In this context the government’s plan to further
commercialize Tonga Development Bank has merits, but a thorough due diligence assessment is
essential.
Staff strongly supports the creation of a presumptive tax regime for small and medium-sized
companies and the natural resource tax regime. Revenue reform efforts should include streamlining
and enhancing the transparency of tax exemptions. Formalization of the Public Financial
Management (PFM) reform roadmap is important to demonstrate the authorities’ commitment to
reform and to inform technical assistance from donors.
Tonga’s structural challenges to growth call for reforms to strengthen investor confidence. Reforms
should focus on policy coordination and judicious deregulation. The current framework for
coordination could be further strengthened, for example by establishing a high-level coordinator. A
tailored support mechanism for foreign investors should also be put in place. The business licensing
reform has achieved an important milestone, and could now focus on easing ancillary licenses.
