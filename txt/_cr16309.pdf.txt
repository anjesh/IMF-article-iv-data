IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with the Philippines
On September 14, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with the Philippines.
The Philippine economy has continued to perform strongly. Real GDP regained strength from a
slowdown in mid-2015 to record a robust 5.9 percent growth rate in 2015 and 6.9 percent in the
first half of 2016. Both consumption and investment grew rapidly, while net exports were held
back by weak external demand. Job creation was also strong, with the unemployment rate
declining to 6.3 percent in 2015 and 6.0 percent in the first half of 2016. Inflation has remained
moderate, falling below the BSP’s target band (3±1 percent) in 2015 and the first seven months
of 2016 due to lower commodity prices. The external and fiscal position remained robust
in 2015, with a current account surplus of 2.9 percent of GDP, gross international reserves of
US$81 billion (or 11 months of imports of goods and services), a national government fiscal
deficit of 1.4 percent of GDP, and general government debt at 35 percent of GDP.
The outlook for the Philippine economy remains favorable despite external headwinds. Real
GDP growth is expected at 6.4 percent in 2016 and 6.7 percent in 2017 on continued robust
domestic demand and a modest recovery in exports. Unemployment is projected to decline to
5.9 percent in 2016 and 5.7 percent in 2017. Inflation is expected to return to within the BSP’s
target range later this year and in 2017 as commodity prices stabilize and strong economic
activity continues. The current account surplus is expected to decline in 2016−17 due to higher
commodity prices and infrastructure related imports. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to
remain in a declining trend. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. The Philippine
authorities are well equipped to respond as needed with suitable policies should any risks
materialize, particularly given the strong fundamentals and ample policy space.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their continued strong macroeconomic
management, with robust growth and low inflation. Directors noted, however, that the favorable
macroeconomic performance has not led to corresponding improvements in poverty reduction,
inequality, and unemployment. They considered that the new administration has an opportunity
to put the economy on a higher and more equitable growth path. Directors encouraged efforts to
increase investments in infrastructure and human capital, improve targeting of social spending,
enhance competitiveness and foreign direct investment, and making the financial system deeper
and more inclusive.
Directors supported the increase in the fiscal deficit target to 3 percent of GDP from 2017,
anchoring fiscal policy to a broadly stable public debt-to-GDP ratio. They noted that this would
allow a welcome boost to infrastructure and social spending, while ensuring fiscal sustainability.
Directors highlighted the need for additional revenue to finance further infrastructure and social
spending and welcomed the authorities’ plans to implement a comprehensive tax reform that
would be revenue positive, more equitable, and efficient. They urged the authorities to formulate
a medium-term public infrastructure plan with clear project prioritization and appropriate choices
between budget and PPP spending, with due consideration of contingent liabilities. Further
efforts to strengthen public financial management and budget execution were also encouraged.
Directors considered the current monetary policy stance as appropriate in view of the low
inflation and near zero output gap. However, they noted the need for continued vigilance,
particularly in light of the fiscal stimulus. Directors encouraged the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas
(BSP) to stand ready to take measures if there are signs of overheating or accelerating credit
growth. They commended the BSP for the smooth implementation of the new interest rate
corridor and deposit auctions, which will improve monetary policy transmission and help
develop domestic capital markets. Directors encouraged passage of the central bank charter that
would authorize the issuance of central bank bills and BSP recapitalization. They emphasized the
need for continued exchange rate flexibility.
Directors noted that the financial system remains sound. They supported the authorities’ use of
targeted prudential policies to strengthen resilience and limit systemic risks. Directors
encouraged broadening the central bank’s financial stability mandate.
Directors supported the authorities’ goal to accelerate poverty reduction and their priorities for
structural reforms. They called for well-targeted infrastructure and social spending, including for
education and health, especially in rural areas, as well as continued efforts to enhance
competition and open the economy to foreign investment. Directors also welcomed the focus on
financial deepening and inclusion as essential elements of the authorities’ inclusive growth
strategy. They emphasized the importance of strengthening the AML framework, including to
make tax evasion a predicate crime.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 26, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: The Philippine economy has performed well in recent years with rising potential
growth and strong macro fundamentals. Economic growth is supported by robust domestic
demand and is broadly in line with potential while the outlook for inflation is well within the
target band (3±1 percent). The external position is sound and fiscal policy is prudent, with a
low and declining debt-to-GDP ratio.
The strong economic performance, however, has not yet fully benefited a wide range of the
population. Poverty and inequality remain high. Poor infrastructure has constrained private
investment and job creation. Public investment has risen but continues to be low due to
weak implementation capacity, while progress has been made on fiscal transparency.
Investment in infrastructure and human capital, financed through increased government
revenues while allowing a small increase in the deficit, is needed alongside structural
reforms to reap the Philippines’ demographic dividend, promote inclusive growth and
reduce poverty.
Risks: Tilted to the downside. Upside risks include stronger domestic demand spurred by
low commodity prices and further improvements in budget execution. On the downside,
lower growth in China, tighter global financial conditions, and a surge in global financial
volatility could lead to capital outflows.
Main policy recommendations:


Fiscal policy should focus on the medium-term priorities of boosting investment in
infrastructure and human capital. While allowing a small increase in the deficit (to
3 percent of GDP), additional revenue should be secured and expenditure
management improved to safeguard fiscal sustainability and anchor fiscal policy by
stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio at its current low level.



The monetary policy stance, underpinned by an improved operational framework, is
appropriate for now and there is space to respond to shocks if needed.



The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) should continue to monitor the financial
system to ensure that emerging systemic risks are dealt with through suitable
macroprudential measures, including risks relating to credit growth in the real estate
sector and concentration.



Structural reforms priorities include opening up to foreign direct investment and
enhancing competition.

CONTEXT
1.
The Philippine economy has performed well during the past several years and the
strong macro fundamentals provide a solid foundation to meet the remaining challenges.
Sound macroeconomic policies have delivered solid economic growth and reduced unemployment,
low inflation, and financial stability as well as a strong fiscal position. However, underemployment
and poverty rates have remained stubbornly high. Inequality remains among the highest in the
region. Competition has been limited including by restrictions on foreign direct investment and by
regulatory behavior.

2.
Poor infrastructure has constrained
private investment and job creation, and
residual excess liquidity from capital inflows
following the Global Financial Crisis impede
monetary policy transmission. The 2015
Article IV consultation called for increasing
public infrastructure and social spending,
financed by raising government revenues, to
help reap the Philippines’ demographic
dividend and lay the foundation for sustainable
growth, along with structural reforms to
increase competitiveness. Public infrastructure
investment has accelerated recently but remains constrained by limited government revenue
collection and incomplete public financial management (PFM) reforms, along with slow spending
processes. BSP initiated an upgrade of their Interest Rate Corridor (IRC) system to improve monetary
policy transmission.
3.
Rodrigo Duterte, Mayor of the Philippines’ third largest city Davao, was inaugurated
as the new president in June, with a ten-point economic policy agenda calling for continuing
prudent economic policies and a more ambitious inclusive growth and structural reform
strategy. While primarily focusing on law and order, President Duterte tapped into a desire for

PHILIPPINES

change among a large part of the population to tackle the high levels of poverty and inequality that
persists especially in rural areas despite years of robust economic growth. The President’s ten-point
plan (Box 1) includes: accelerating infrastructure investment; raising competitiveness by relaxing
constitutional restrictions on foreign direct investment; ensuring security of land tenure;
strengthening the education system; implementing a comprehensive tax policy reform, modernizing
tax collection agencies; and improving social welfare programs. The mission discussed the ten-point
agenda with the new administration and provided a number of policy options to consider, as
elaborated below.
Box 1. Philippines: President Duterte’s Ten-Point Socioeconomic Agenda


Promoting law and order.



Continuing and maintaining current macroeconomic policies, including fiscal, monetary, and trade
policies;



Instituting progressive tax reform and more effective tax collection while indexing taxes to
inflation, in line with the plan to submit to congress a tax reform package by September;



Increasing competitiveness and the ease of doing business, drawing upon successful models used
to attract business to local cities such as Davao, as well as pursuing the relaxation of the
constitutional restrictions on foreign ownership, except with regard to land ownership, in order to
attract foreign direct investment;



Accelerating annual infrastructure spending to account for at least 5 percent of GDP, with publicprivate partnership projects playing a key role;



Promoting rural and value chain development towards increasing agricultural and rural enterprise
productivity and rural tourism;



Ensuring security of land tenure to encourage investment and address bottlenecks in land
management and titling agencies;



Investing in human capital development, including health and education systems, as well as
matching skills and training to meet the demands of businesses and the private sector;



Promoting science, technology, and the creative arts to enhance innovation and creative capacity
towards self-sustaining and inclusive development;



Improving social protection programs, including the government’s conditional cash transfer
program, in order to protect the poor against instability and economic shocks; and



Strengthening the implementation of the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Law to
enable, especially, poor couples to make informed choices on financial and family planning.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
Macroeconomic developments remain favorable and the financial system is sound and stable,
although there are risks. Economic growth continues to be strong as robust domestic demand offsets
continued weak external demand. Inflation has been below the target band, reflecting low food and oil
prices, but is expected to rise to the middle of the band in 2017. The fiscal and external positions are
strong. Risks remain tilted to the downside including from global financial volatility.

A. Recent Developments
4.
Growth and inflation. Real GDP regained strength from a slowdown in mid-2015 to record
a robust 5.9 percent growth rate in 2015 and 6.9 percent in the first half of 2016. Both consumption
and investment have grown rapidly, while net exports have been held back by weak external
demand. Real GDP growth is projected at 6.4 percent in 2016 and 6.7 percent in 2017 on continued
robust private domestic demand and higher public spending. Exports would recover only modestly,
although worker remittances and receipts from Business Process Outsourcing would help cushion
the impact of the weak external environment. The output gap is expected to remain near zero
in 2016–17. Amid strong economic activity, inflation fell below the target band (3±1 percent) in 2015
and the first seven months of 2016 due to lower food and fuel prices, but is expected to return to
within the target range later this year and in 2017 as commodity prices stabilize and strong
economic activity continues.

5.
Fiscal developments. The national
government budget deficit reached
1.4 percent of GDP in 2015 based on IMF
staff definition, below the 2 percent
medium-term target because of slow budget
execution early in the year. Budget execution
improved thereafter reflecting enhanced
public finance and procurement
management, making the 2 percent deficit
target attainable in 2016. This would imply a
fiscal stimulus of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2016.
Indeed, there are upside risks coming from
better than anticipated budget execution and a higher deficit this year. The new administration
plans to increase the deficit target to 3 percent of GDP starting in 2017, to raise infrastructure and
social spending, implying a fiscal stimulus of 1 percent of GDP in 2017.
6.
Macro-financial issues. Following the global financial crisis, the Philippines received
sizeable inflows, both from remittances and portfolio investment, resulting in a buildup of reserves
and persistent excess liquidity, and market interest rates have often been below the floor of the
BSP’s IRC. These factors have kept effective borrowing costs at historic lows and fueled credit
growth alongside real estate price inflation, albeit within a reasonable range. BSP’s macroprudential
policies in 2014 on real estate lending and tightening of lending standards more generally
moderated bank credit growth from 20 percent in 2014 to 13.6 percent in 2015. However, there has
been some rekindling as credit grew by 17.6 percent in June 2016 (y/y), with credit to construction
and real estate growing above 20 percent. This, and the rapid increase in corporate leverage,
warrant close monitoring by the BSP.1 2 Financial intermediation by nonbank financial institutions,
which are not regulated by the BSP, remains small but has grown rapidly in recent years. The
Philippines’ stock of bank credit, at 39 percent of GDP in 2015, remains lower than in other

1

Deviations of credit-to-GDP from a backward looking trend (Dell’Ariccia and others, 2012) and cycles in real credit
per capita compared to its trend (Mendoza and Terrones, 2008) show credit growth within the usual cutoffs, the
increase in bank credit to GDP is just below the 3 percentage point cutoff, and the credit gap (Drehmann and others,
2010) just exceeds the 10 percent of GDP cutoff (Box 2).

Financial market development in the Philippines is at levels that are broadly consistent with those seen elsewhere in
Emerging Asia, after adjusting for differences in per capita income (see Chapter 5 of Philippines—Selected Issues, IMF
Country Report No 15/247).

PHILIPPINES

Box 2. Philippines: Credit Developments
Credit growth has rekindled in 2016 after slowing in 2015. While most indicators suggest that credit growth remains below typical
cutoffs for credit booms, the mixed signals provided by available indicators and the composition of credit growth across sectors warrant
careful monitoring. The output gap remains near zero even when financial variables are considered in the estimation.
Credit growth has picked up in 2016. Credit growth moderated from 20 percent in 2014 to 13.6 percent in 2015 following the
BSP’s decision to tighten monetary policy and raise bank reserve requirements in 2014. However, credit growth has rekindled to
17.6 percent in June 2016, especially for services (18.1 percent) and industry (17.5 percent). Moreover, credit growth for construction
and real estate remained above 20 percent in June 2016, warranting close monitoring of credit developments for these sectors.

Credit growth remains below credit boom levels according to most but not all indicators. Staff updated last year’s estimates of
credit booms.1 The approach of Mendoza and Terrones (2008), which looks at deviations of real credit per capita from trend, shows
that credit growth remains in line with trend. The approach of Dell'Ariccia and others (2012), which looks at deviations of the creditto-GDP ratio from a backward looking trend, also find no evidence of credit booms, with the growth differential between credit and
GDP remaining below the 10 percent cutoff. However, the approach in Chapter 3 of the IMF’s Global Financial Stability Report of
September 2011, shows that the increase in the credit-to-GDP ratio remains just below the 3 percent threshold for early warning of
credit booms. Similarly, the approach of Drehmann and others (2010), which looks at deviations of the credit-to-GDP ratio from a
Hodrick-Prescott trend with a high smoothing parameter, finds that the credit-to-GDP ratio barely exceeds the 10 percent of GDP
cutoff in 2016.

Financial variables contain useful information about the business cycle position. Expansions coinciding with rapid credit and
asset price growth are stronger, while recessions coinciding with credit and asset price busts are longer and deeper. Staff updated
last year’s estimates of the output gap using the BIS approach that integrates financial variables (real credit and stock prices) into a
broader measure of the output gap. The results indicate that the output gap in the Philippines in 2016–17 is near zero, although
slightly positive, consistent with the recent pickup in credit growth.

emerging market economies, mainly reflecting still low access of households to formal financial
institutions, suggesting a need for further financial deepening and inclusion. Capital flows and the
exchange rate have not been significantly affected by recent bouts of global financial volatility
compared to neighboring countries.

7.
External sector. The current account surplus fell to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2015 despite the
large drop in fuel imports (by 1.3 percent of GDP), reflecting a deceleration in remittances, a decline
in exports, and a large increase in imports of capital and intermediate goods. The current account
surplus is projected to fall further in 201617 due to higher commodity prices and infrastructure
related imports. The peso depreciated vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in 2015 but by less than other
regional currencies, and it has been stable in 2016. International reserves have remained broadly
unchanged since 2012 at around US$80 billion (or 231 percent of the Fund’s reserve adequacy
metric) and external debt declined to 27 percent of GDP in 2015.

B. Outlook and Risks
8.
Outlook. Tables 1–8 present the staff baseline scenario with real GDP growth in the
6−7 percent range. Private credit growth is consistent with a normal pace of financial development
over the medium term, remaining below estimated credit boom thresholds. This scenario assumes
that the authorities implement fiscal and structural policies already committed (see Box 3), including
the proposed new fiscal framework with a central government budget deficit of 3 percent of GDP in
the medium term. The baseline does not include new tax policy measures being formulated, and
thus the revenue-to-GDP ratio is likely to remain broadly unchanged at around 15½ percent of GDP
alongside public investment at about 5 percent of GDP, which is still lower than most countries in
the region.

Box 3. Philippines: Assumptions Underlying the Baseline
and IMF Staff’s Recommended Scenarios
Baseline scenario. This scenario assumes that the authorities implement fiscal and structural policies
already committed. In particular:


National government budget deficit of 2 percent in 2016, rising to 3 percent in 2017‒21;



National government revenue projection assumes unchanged tax policies and tax administration;



National government expenditures reflect PFM improvements already underway, with capital and
equity expenditure rising from 3.3 percent of GDP in 2015 to 5.3 percent in 2021; and



Structural reforms reflect measures already underway during the previous administration, including
PFM and other governance reforms (e.g., the PPP and PFM laws), both in line with track records
during the last few years, and structural reforms for which legislation has been passed such as the
new competition law, opening up the financial sector to foreign investment, and the Right of Way
law for infrastructure projects.

IMF staff’s recommended scenario. This scenario includes staff’s recommended fiscal and structural
reforms aimed at achieving the authorities’ development objectives for growth and poverty reduction,
building on the government’s ten-point economic agenda. In particular:


National government budget deficit of 2 percent in 2016, rising to 3 percent in 2017‒21;



National government revenue projection assumes the IMF staff’s preferred revenue package,
yielding 3.0 percentage points of GDP gradually over the 2017‒19 period;



National government expenditures incorporate additional social spending of 1.5 percentage points
of GDP and additional infrastructure spending of 1.5 percentage points of GDP (both relative to the
baseline scenario), financed by the additional revenue collections; and



Additional structural reform measures, including easing foreign investor restrictions in the negative
list and in the constitution, land titling reform for use of land as collateral in agriculture, and labor
market reforms, which are on the President’s platform but have not yet been legislated.

9.
Risks. On balance, risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside. Upside risks include a
stronger lift to domestic demand from low commodity prices and additional improvements in
budget execution. On the downside, slow budget execution or revenue shortages could dampen
growth. Moreover, lower growth in China and the region, tighter global financial conditions, and a
surge in global financial volatility could lead to capital outflows and tightening of domestic financial
conditions with attendant impacts on investment and growth, though the Philippines is less
vulnerable to China and financial spillovers than the rest of the region. Risks to financial stability
stem from concentration relating to the conglomerate structure and rapid credit expansion in the
real estate sector, as elaborated below. Finally, natural disasters pose an ongoing risk. The
Philippines is well equipped to respond if any of these risks materialize, particularly given the
country’s strong fundamentals and ample policy space. For instance, in response to possible
volatility or a reversal in capital flows, there is scope to allow for exchange rate flexibility, limiting
intervention to smoothing excess volatility, and for easing monetary or fiscal policy if the real
economy slows down significantly.

10.
Scenario analysis. The baseline scenario, which only includes the fiscal and structural
policies already committed, falls short of achieving the authorities’ stated development objectives
for growth and poverty reduction. Table 8 and Box 3 provide a second scenario that incorporates
the staff’s recommended fiscal and structural reforms aimed at achieving the authorities’
development objectives, building on the new government’s ten-point plan. Substantially higher
public infrastructure spending will require raising additional revenues, supported by a more realistic
fiscal framework that maintains debt
sustainability. Monetary policy will need to
remain vigilant given the additional fiscal
stimulus and until the fiscal deficit stabilizes at a
higher level. Under the staff’s recommended
scenario, annual growth would be about
1 percentage point higher owing to higher
investment, including private investment
crowded in by higher public investment, and
bolder structural reforms that increase total
factor productivity (TFP) growth gradually over
the medium term.3 Well-targeted and higher
social spending would help reduce poverty towards the government’s target. Enhanced
infrastructure investment, including in areas that have benefited little from such investment in the
past, would help create jobs and make growth more inclusive. Structural reforms, such as liberalizing
foreign investment and land use, would help catalyze the effects of higher government spending.

C. External Sector Assessment
11.
The external sector balance has declined somewhat as noted above but remains
moderately stronger than warranted by fundamentals and desirable policies (Appendix 3). This
is primarily due to structural impediments to investment and precautionary savings to self-insure
against natural disaster risk, rather than a misaligned real exchange rate level. Accordingly, the
current account gap should close over the medium term as public infrastructure investment
increases in line with the authorities’ plans. Staff assess the peso to be broadly in line with
fundamentals and desired policies because the current account gap is due to the above-mentioned
structural factors. While the level of international reserves is above the Fund’s Reserve Adequacy
metric, this is broadly justified by the vulnerability to natural disasters and capital flow volatility. Staff
continues to support the BSP’s view that the exchange rate should act as a buffer to external shocks
and be allowed to move freely in line with market forces, with intervention limited to smoothing
excessive volatility in both directions.

As TFP is calculated as a residual, the short-run growth contribution from TFP in 2017 reflects higher capacity
utilization.

Authorities’ Views
12.
The authorities appreciated staff’s analysis of the medium-term outlook and
alternative scenarios. They are optimistic about the growth potential of the economy despite weak
global prospects. Consistent with their strategy to boost infrastructure spending, they project
growth at 6.0–7.0 percent in 2016, 6.5–7.5 percent in 2017, and 7–8 percent during 2018–22. The
authorities also considered that the current account surplus reflects structural bottlenecks rather
than exchange rate misalignment. The current account surplus should decline going forward in line
with the plans to boost infrastructure investment, while exchange rate flexibility would continue.

POLICIES FOR MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL
STABILITY
Stepping up infrastructure and human capital investment will need to be supported by strengthening
the macroeconomic policy framework, while containing financial stability risks. Substantially higher
public infrastructure spending will require the government to raise additional revenues, supported by a
more realistic fiscal framework that maintains debt sustainability. Monetary policy will need to remain
vigilant to risks of overheating given the additional fiscal stimulus and until the fiscal deficit stabilizes
at a higher level. The main macro-financial risks that will need to be managed are concentration risks
associated with the economy’s conglomerate structure and sectoral risks stemming from the pickup in
credit growth particularly in the real estate sector.

A. Fiscal Policy
13.
A two-pillar framework would suit the Philippines, with the public debt-to-GDP ratio
as an anchor, complemented by a central government overall deficit as an operational target
(Box 4). The debt ratio would set an upper limit to fiscal slippages and preserve fiscal sustainability,
while the deficit target would provide operational guidance for policy formulation as it has a close
link to debt dynamics. The operational target should be based on realistic growth and revenue
projections and implemented flexibly to avoid procyclical fiscal management.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES

Box 4. Philippines: New Fiscal Framework
The public debt-to-GDP ratio should serve as the fiscal anchor. This should be complemented with a flexible overall fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio
as the operational target.
Given the Philippines’ low and declining debt-to-GDP ratio, the new fiscal framework should aim to preserve fiscal sustainability,
while at the same time be flexible enough to allow for fiscal space to deal with uncertainties and risks. There are four main types of
fiscal rules: debt rules, budget balance rules, expenditure rules, and revenue rules. These rules have different properties with respect to debt
sustainability, economic stabilization, operational guidance for fiscal policy, and transparency. Many countries combine multiple fiscal rules
given the trade-offs among them.
Debt rules set an explicit limit for public debt in percent of GDP. This type of rule is the most effective in terms of ensuring convergence to
a debt target. However, it does not provide sufficient guidance for fiscal policy when debt is well below its ceiling.
Budget balance rules constrain the variable that primarily influences the debt ratio and is largely under the control of policymakers. They
can be specified based on the overall balance, or can explicitly account for economic shocks. The latter add flexibility, but estimating the
adjustment, typically through the output gap, makes it more difficult to communicate and monitor.
Expenditure rules usually set permanent limits on total, primary, or current spending in absolute terms, growth rates, or in percent of GDP.
As such, these rules are not linked directly to the debt sustainability objective since they do not constrain the revenue side. They can
provide, however, an operational tool to trigger the required fiscal consolidation consistent with sustainability when they are accompanied
by debt or budget balance rules. Another advantage of expenditure rules is that they are relatively easy to implement and monitoring
compliance is relatively straightforward.
Revenue rules set ceilings or floors on revenues and are aimed at boosting revenue collections and/or preventing an excessive tax burden.
These rules are also not directly linked to the control of public debt, as they do not constrain spending.
Staff recommends a two-pillar approach for the Philippines, with the consolidated general government debt-to-GDP ratio as an
anchor, complemented by a central government overall deficit as an operational target. A natural anchor to preserve fiscal
sustainability would be the debt ratio, which creates an upper limit to repeated (cumulative) fiscal slippages.1 However, the estimation of the
ratio ex ante is subject to a large degree of uncertainty, and its effective implementation requires an operating target, which would be under
the direct control of the government. For this operating target, a central government overall deficit is appropriate, as the authorities are
used to the concept and operation, and it also has a close link to debt
dynamics.
The fiscal anchor should target a broadly stable debt-to-GDP ratio at
the current level of 36 percent of GDP, while the deficit target should be
raised to 3 percent of GDP to allow for priority expenditures and retain
some margin. A rise in the deficit target from 2 percent of GDP to 3 percent
from 2017 would reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to under 31 percent by 2021,
thus providing a margin of 5 percent of GDP to respond to materialization of
fiscal risks and uncertainty around the baseline projections. For instance,
PPPs have continued to expand from ₱1.1 trillion in 2013 to ₱1.4 trillion in
June 2016, with a proportionate increase in associated contingent liabilities.
Natural disasters are also a threat and their economic cost can be large. For
example, typhoon Yolanda in 2013 caused damages by 4 percent of GDP.2
Moreover, a one-standard deviation shock to GDP growth for two years (with
growth falling to 4.5 percent in 2017 and 2018) would increase the debt-toGDP ratio by 3 percentage points by 2021.
The new administration has set a medium-term overall deficit target of 3 percent based on appropriate revenue projections. The
previous administration’s fiscal deficit targets were based on aspirational revenue targets. Moreover, expenditure was withheld in case of a
revenue shortfall to secure the 2 percent of GDP fiscal deficit target, which impeded efficient expenditure and risked procyclical fiscal
management. In July 2016, the Development Budget Coordinating Committee (DBCC) decided to set the deficit target at 3 percent of GDP
from 2017 onwards based on appropriate revenue projections. Although this initiative is likely to reduce the revenue shortfalls, these may
still happen due to cyclical fluctuations, in which case staff would favor a flexible deficit target that allows automatic stabilizers to work, to
avoid withholding expenditure and making fiscal policy procyclical.
Increasing flexibility in the deficit target warrants consideration. The overall deficit target has an inherent weakness because, if
implemented too rigidly, it could force procyclical fiscal management. A number of options are available to increase flexibility, depending
upon country circumstances. For example, an escape clause under well-defined circumstances (e.g., emergencies caused by natural disasters
and exceptionally adverse national economic conditions) and clear guidelines on how to get back on the stable debt path would prevent
procyclical fiscal management in severe downturns.

14.
The fiscal anchor should target a broadly stable consolidated general government
debt-to-GDP ratio at the current level (36 percent of GDP) over the medium term, while the
national government deficit target should be increased to 3 percent of GDP. Public debt
decreased from 44 percent of GDP in 2009 to 36 percent in 2015. While it does not need to decline
further, particularly given the large infrastructure and social needs, the credibility of fiscal
management earned in recent years needs to be preserved. A broadly stable debt-to-GDP ratio
balances these two considerations. The deficit target of 3 percent of GDP, higher than the 2 percent
under the previous administration, would allow the authorities to address the Philippines’ large
infrastructure and social gaps to promote inclusive growth. It would also reduce the debt-to-GDP
ratio to under 31 percent in 2021, thus providing a margin of 5 percent of GDP to respond to
materialization of fiscal risks and uncertainty around the baseline projections through flexible
implementation.
15.
The Philippines needs to reform its tax system and administration to collect more
revenue for additional infrastructure and social spending and to make it more equitable and
efficient. Tax collections are low compared to neighboring countries, reflecting low compliance and
extensive exemptions, yet the personal income
tax brackets have crept upwards due to
inflation. Staff supports the authorities’ push for
a comprehensive tax policy reform that is net
revenue positive with due attention paid to
equity. The comprehensive tax reform package
could include a reform of the personal income
tax (PIT) that simplifies the rate structure,
indexes tax brackets for inflation, and
eliminates exemptions such as that of the
minimum wage and that of the 13th month
salary (Box 5).4 Revenue losses from the PIT
reform could be more than offset by higher
excises on fuel (including diesel, which is currently not subject to an excise tax) as well as
rationalization of VAT exemptions (for senior citizens, disabled people, electricity transmission, social
housing, and cooperatives),5 and excises on sweetened beverages and higher motor vehicles taxes
or registration fees. The package could also include simplifying the corporate income tax (CIT) rate
structure and rationalizing tax incentives. A harmonization of financial sector taxes as part of the

4

The exemption for minimum wage earners effectively exempts a large share of the labor force. It also creates a
vertical inequity, as those with wages earning slightly higher than the minimum wage are taxed on their full income
(less the personal allowance), while those earning the minimum wage are untaxed. The 13th month salary exemption
is also highly regressive.
5

Removal of exemptions for senior citizens, disabled people, and social housing could be accompanied by
well-targeted transfers to help cushion the social impact. Other measures in the comprehensive tax reform package
would help make the burden more equitable such as the PIT reform.

Box 5. Philippines: Comprehensive Tax Reform Package
The IMF with the World Bank proposes a comprehensive tax reform package that is net revenue positive, equitable, and efficient.
A comprehensive tax reform is needed that is net revenue positive with due attention paid to equity and efficiency. There are several
important problems in the tax system, principally including: (i) the extreme erosion of the corporate income tax base through the granting of
myriad investment incentives—largely in the form of long tax holidays, followed by in many cases a permanent tax rate of 5 percent in lieu of all
other regular taxes; (ii) the strict banking secrecy law, which prohibits the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) from obtaining any data regarding
taxpayer’s income or wealth from Philippine banks; and (iii) the erosion over the last 20 years of the tax bracket levels for the personal income tax
and the ad hoc adjustment of the PIT through nonsystematic exemptions and measures. The latter two problems have especially important
implications for equity.
The IMF with the World Bank provided a comprehensive tax reform proposal (see table). This proposal takes as anchors: the need to reduce
investment incentives—while recognizing that this is not possible in full or immediately—in order to improve economic efficiency and to permit,
eventually, a reduction of the headline CIT rate;1 the need to ease the strict bank secrecy law which prevents enforcement of modern tax
compliance with regard to income taxes—and which will ultimately reduce the attractiveness of the country for legitimate international investors;
the goal of rationalizing the treatment of different forms of income from capital; the need to improve the logic and equity of the PIT structure; and
the need to increase the level of taxation of fuel, both to raise revenue and to mitigate substantial negative externalities including health and
congestion effects. All of these factors bear on the competitiveness and attractiveness of the Philippines as a location for investment.

__________________________
1/ In particular, reduction of the CIT rate from 30 percent to 25 percent should only be considered if fiscal incentive rationalization has already
started. The Philippines already has the lowest outturn for corporate taxes in ASEAN while having the highest rate because of the numerous tax
incentives from BOI, PEZA, and other regional incentive schemes (e.g., Subic, Clark and other free trade zones). Moreover, the Philippines also has
the lowest FDI-to-GDP ratio even after having the most generous tax incentive structure.

ASEAN financial integration roadmap would reduce transaction costs and promote financial
intermediation. Staff supports the Department of Finance’s efforts to amend the bank secrecy law to
allow the tax authorities access to individual bank account information and make tax evasion a
predicate crime for money laundering in order to improve the efficiency and equity of revenue
collection. More broadly, strengthening tax administration should be a priority, although substantial
revenue gains would be expected only in the longer term.
16.
The authorities should formulate a medium-term public infrastructure plan with clear
prioritization of projects and appropriate choices between budgetary and PPP spending, with
due consideration of contingent liabilities (CLs). Staff support the authorities’ target to increase
public infrastructure spending to at least 5 percent of GDP over the medium term, which would still
be below the average level in the rest of the region,6 and would favor higher infrastructure spending
if done efficiently and if additional revenues are available to finance it. These investments would be
more effective for poverty reduction if focused on areas such as telecoms, logistics, ports, healthcare
and schools, particularly in rural areas and smaller cities. They should aim to encourage creation of
high quality jobs, boost human capital of the growing young population, alleviate supply
bottlenecks, and provide a basis for more geographically balanced development. Staff noted that
the IMF, jointly with the ADB, stands ready to help the authorities increase efficiency and review
investment guidelines including PPPs through a Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA).
Staff welcomed the Right of Way Act that will help speed up the implementation of public
infrastructure, and support the proposed PPP Act that will strengthen the planning and
implementation framework for PPPs. Regarding CLs, the temporary PPP policy guidelines that fully
guarantee the debt of PPP projects should be reconsidered.
Authorities’ Views
17.
The authorities appreciated the debt sustainability analysis that supported the
medium-term fiscal targets and were in broad agreement with the proposed fiscal anchor.
They plan to target a 3 percent of GDP fiscal deficit starting in 2017 while making revenue
projections more realistic. The authorities are confident that capacity including at the level of line
ministries has improved sufficiently to achieve the spending level necessary to achieve the target. A
Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA) focused on practical recommendations would
be useful.
18.
The government plans to prioritize infrastructure investment on inter-island
connectivity, logistics, farm-to-market roads and tourism sites, and address congestion in
Metro Manila and other urban areas, as well as social spending. To expedite decongestion and
critical infrastructure projects, the administration has requested emergency powers from congress
for a limited period of time. This would authorize the President to adopt alternative methods of
procurement for the construction repair, rehabilitation, improvement or maintenance of
transportation projects aimed at the reduction of traffic congestion in Metro Manila and other urban

areas. These include limited source bidding or selective bidding, direct contracting or single source
procurement, repeat order, shopping, and negotiated procurement.
19.
The government plans to submit a tax reform plan to congress by mid-September. It
would be net revenue positive and include a higher income tax threshold and lowering of the PIT tax
rates coupled with expansion of the VAT base by limiting VAT exemptions, hikes in fuel excise taxes,
and introduction of excise tax on sweetened beverages. They agreed that any reduction in CIT rates
should be accompanied by rationalization of tax incentives.

B. Monetary Policy
20.
The flexible inflation targeting regime has served the Philippines well. BSP enhanced its
capacity for liquidity and inflation forecasting recently, strengthening the framework. Headline
inflation has generally fallen within the target band in recent years and greater exchange rate
flexibility has helped cushion the impact of external shocks. However, most of the liquidity injected
by the buildup of international reserves in the period of unconventional monetary policies in the
advanced economies was passively sterilized by the BSP’s Special Deposit Account (SDA) Facility.
This was partly because the BSP charter limited the BSP’s ability to issue its own debt securities for
monetary operations, leading to excess liquidity and lower money market interest rates that
continue to impede monetary policy transmission. Staff supports the reform to the IRC that would
improve the transmission of monetary policy, and recommended resubmitting amendments to the
BSP charter that would allow for issuance of BSP securities, recapitalization of the BSP, and money
market development plans.
21.
Excess liquidity in the banking system has declined slightly since mid-2013 but is still
substantial. It is currently being absorbed by the Overnight Deposit Facility (previously the SDA
Facility), Overnight RRP Facility, Term Deposit Facility (TDF), and through the banks’ required
reserves. In early June, the BSP introduced a new IRC, without changing the de facto monetary
policy stance (Box 6). By expanding the liquidity absorption using the new TDF auctions, the IRC
aims at aligning market interest rates with the policy rate and improving the transmission
mechanism in line with Fund TA advice.
22.
The current monetary policy stance
is appropriate. Inflation is projected at the
bottom of the BSP’s target range this year,
and to rise to the center of the band next
year, as the one-off effects of lower
commodity prices dissipate and domestic
demand remains strong. While Fund staff
estimates show that the effective policy
interest rate is broadly in line with Taylor rule
implied levels, there is excess liquidity and
the transition to the new IRC is ongoing. The
baseline scenario incorporates the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

PHILIPPINES

Box 6. Philippines: Monetary Transmission and the Interest Rate Corridor
The BSP’s IRC with liquidity operations is designed to strengthen the effectiveness of monetary policy while maintaining the current
monetary policy stance. Thus far, implementation of the new IRC has proceeded smoothly.
Structural excess liquidity has caused market interest
rates to trade below the BSP’s policy rate. The rate on the
overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) operations is the key
policy rate to signal the BSP’s monetary policy stance.
However, most of the liquidity injected by the buildup of
reserves in the period of unconventional monetary policies
in the advanced economies was passively sterilized by the
BSP’s Special Deposit Account (SDA) Facility. This reflected
the limited amount of treasury securities held by the BSP for
the RRP operations and inability to issue its own debt
securities. Since the BSP lowered the SDA rate without
changing the RRP rate in 2013, market interest rates have
followed the SDA rate and remained significantly below the
policy rate, with the SDA rate becoming a more relevant
benchmark rate.
BSP adopted a new IRC with liquidity operations to
strengthen the effectiveness of monetary policy. On June 3, 2016, the BSP formally shifted its monetary operations to an IRC
system that aims to influence short-term market interest rates to move closely with the BSP’s policy rate. The IRC is structured as a
mid-corridor system, with the Overnight Lending Facility (OLF) and the Overnight Deposit Facility (ODF) (renamed from the SDA
facility) forming the upper and lower bounds of the corridor, while the overnight RRP rate is set at the middle of the corridor. BSP
also introduced the Term Deposit Auction Facility (TDF) as the main tool for absorbing liquidity and as a variable rate auction
supporting price discovery in the money market. The initial TDF auctions have been small and were oversubscribed by a large
margin and market rates have remained at the floor of the IRC. BSP is expected to increase its deposit auction volumes to promote
gradual convergence of TDF and market interest rates toward the policy (RRP) rate.
The level and structure of the IRC was calibrated to the desired neutral monetary policy stance. BSP clearly communicated
that the IRC reforms were primarily operational in nature and have not materially affected prevailing monetary policy settings
upon implementation despite a drop in the policy rate (RRP). In particular, the interest rate at the floor of the corridor, where the
bulk of BSP’s liquidity absorption with the market currently takes place, has been kept steady since the launch of the IRC system.
This is consistent with staff estimates of the effective policy rate (measured by the weighted average of SDA and RRP rates) and
SDA rate implied by the traditional and augmented Taylor rule reaction functions, suggesting that the IRC policy rate settings are
broadly appropriate in current conditions. Once most of the liquidity is absorbed through open market operations and market
rates are well anchored within the corridor, the BSP plans to reduce the relatively high required reserve ratio on banks gradually to
minimize the risks of financial disintermediation.

implementation of the new IRC, with market rates gradually converging to the policy rate with the
scaling up of deposit auctions. Significantly faster-than-projected credit growth with inflationary
pressures, or a stronger-than-expected impact of the fiscal expansion on inflation would warrant a
monetary policy tightening relative to the baseline. On the other hand, the Philippines has space to
loosen monetary policy should downside risks or a shortage of liquidity materialize, including by
reducing the banks’ required reserve ratio, which is among the highest in the region.
Authorities’ Views
23.
Monetary policies of some advanced economies have led to surges in capital inflows,
which continue to pose a challenge for monetary policy formulation and implementation. In
their view, the favorable inflation performance suggests that the BSP has sufficiently sterilized the
resulting excess liquidity through its deposit facilities. It has continued to rely on its broad toolkit for
monetary policy such as the use of reserve requirements to manage liquidity and the conduct of
foreign exchange operations to smooth volatility. It has also introduced new sterilization tools and
instruments to actively manage liquidity under the IRC system. The new IRC is an operational
adjustment designed to improve monetary policy transmission, and the experience thus far has been
favorable. The BSP was in broad agreement with staff’s policy recommendations concerning
monetary policy going forward.

C. Macro-Financial Linkages and Systemic Financial Stability Risks
24.
The main macro-financial risks are
Philippines: Macro-Financial Linkages
concentration risks associated with the
conglomerate structure of the economy and
rapid credit growth to real estate. Building
upon last year’s Article IV consultation, the staff
assessed macro-financial linkages. It prepared
updated estimates of credit cycles (Box 2),
analyzed bank-corporate linkages more deeply
and updated the corporate stress tests (Box 7),
and advised the authorities to fill data gaps
identified using the Fund’s Balance Sheet
Approach (Box 8). Several initiatives are
underway to fill these data gaps, including the
Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) efforts to enhance corporate sector balance sheet
data, as well as other efforts covering shadow banking activities by real estate developers.

Box 7. Philippine Nonfinancial Corporates: Limited Aggregate Risks
Mask Pockets of Vulnerability
Nonfinancial corporate debt in the Philippines is now comparable to peers although foreign exchange exposure is limited. Overall
debt at risk is still low but there are pockets of vulnerability. Concentration risks warrant continued monitoring.
Aggregate debt of Philippine nonfinancial corporates (NFCs) is
expanding rapidly and is now comparable to that of its peers,
although foreign exchange (FX) exposure is limited. Debt of
the universe of Philippine NFCs increased from around 28 percent
of GDP in 2009 to just under 42 percent in 2015, driven chiefly by
the issuance of corporate bonds and domestic bank loans in local
currency. Consequently, although NFC debt is now at a level
comparable to that of many peers, aggregate FX exposures have
remained low at under 28 percent of total debt, or about
12 percent of GDP in 2015.
Firm-level stress tests show that overall debt-at-risk is still low,
but there are pockets of vulnerability. Staff updated last year’s
stress test exercise1 for 4,083 firms covered by the Orbis database
and found debt-at-risk (debt of firms with an interest coverage
ratio below 1.5) is relatively modest at 32 percent of total debt
under the most severe scenario—a level similar to that of other
emerging market economies (EMEs) in 2013. However, risks remain
concentrated in particular sectors such as real estate and other
services.
Concentration risks arising from the conglomerate structure
and rapid expansion of real estate developers warrant
continued monitoring. Using data for 20 large Philippine
corporates (9 banks, 7 real estate developers, and 4 holding
companies), staff assessed whether pockets of vulnerability can
pose wider systemic risks following Segoviano and Goodhart
(2009).2 Staff found that systemic risk has declined since the GFC,
although it has ticked up of late, but at the same time, real estate
developers are becoming more systemically important. Given the
rapid expansion of their activities, including shadow banking, and
links through the conglomerate structure, real estate developers
continue to warrant close monitoring.

Box 8. Philippines: Addressing the Remaining Data Gaps Continues to be a Priority
There are significant data gaps on balance sheet exposures of other financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations, and households.
Several initiatives are underway by BSP, SEC, and other agencies to fill these gaps but it will be some time before the data gaps are filled.
Staff used the Fund’s Balance Sheet Approach (BSA) to identify data gaps. The BSA is an analytical representation of the balance
sheet of institutional sectors including their cross-holdings. It is typically used to assess the exposure of individual sectors to shocks as
well as to study how shocks get transmitted across sectors.

The main gaps pertain to “Other Resident Sectors” and the breakdown of Government assets. The Philippines does not yet
systematically collect information on several resident sectors, for example it is still in the process of compiling the Other Financial
Corporations Survey (OFCS). Moreover, the breakdown of external positions of the nonbank and nongovernment sectors is also not
available in the International Investment Position (IIP) and balance of payments (BOP) statistics. Finally, Philippine Government Financial
Statistics (GFS) only contain information on liabilities, and does not disaggregate “Other Resident Sectors.”
The Philippine authorities have several ongoing initiatives to fill these data gaps. Most importantly, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) is responsible for two main parallel processes to collect financial statement data more efficiently and in greater detail:
implementing the extensible business reporting language (XBRL) and the comprehensive form of financial statements (CFFS). Data
collected by SEC through these initiatives will feed into several important surveys, such as OFCS, BOP, IIP, flow of funds (FOF), sectoral
balance sheet (SBS), debt securities statistics, corporate leverage, and a financial social accounting matrix (FSAM). In addition, BSP is
working with the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) to collect standardized information about certain aspects (e.g., trade
receivables) of the balance sheet of real estate developers.
Ultimately, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) will consolidate the data into a sectoral balance sheet (SBS), although likely not
before 2018.

The OFCS is an analytical survey that provides a comprehensive
Bangko Sentral Pilipinas (BSP)
measure of the claims (or assets) and liabilities of the other financial
corporations (OFCs) in the Philippines. The compilation of OFCS is in
adherence to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) Plus
which the Philippines target to complete by 2019.

The BSP is already collecting information on OFCs under its
supervision.

The maiden results of the RREPI were released by the BSP last 6
June 2016. This covers the period Q2:2015 to Q1:2016 with
Q1:2014 as base period. The RREPI will be generated by the BSP
on a quarterly basis.

Sectoral balance sheet (SBS)

While the compilation of the financial sector balance sheet will
be generated by the BSP, the consolidation of the whole SBS will
be spearheaded by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). As
discussed during the inter-agency meeting on SDDS Plus
matters last 2 May 2016, the PSA intends to start the preparatory
stages on the SBS by 2017 (at least with those sectors where data
are readily available).

The SBS, which is one of the IMF's SDDS Plus data categories, reports Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)
the disaggregation of financial assets and liabilities by economic
sectors, including the non-financial, financial, general government,
household and rest of the world sectors.

Systemic risks appear contained but merit continued monitoring. While most indicators
suggest that credit growth remains below typical cutoffs for credit booms, the mixed signals
provided by available indicators and the composition of credit growth across sectors warrant careful
monitoring to continue assessing the need for macroprudential measures, including countercyclical
capital buffers (Text table), supported by strong microprudential supervision. Firm-level stress tests
show that overall debt-at-risk is still low in nonfinancial corporates but there are pockets of
vulnerability, where leverage has increased and is concentrated. Nonfinancial corporate debt in the
Philippines is now comparable to peers although foreign exchange exposure is limited. A part of real
estate financing, while likely still small, is provided by real estate developers to household borrowers
who cannot yet borrow from banks but data gaps hinder further assessment. Concentration risks
arising from the conglomerate structure and rapid expansion of real estate developers warrant
continued monitoring. When credit growth becomes excessive for some sectors, the BSP would
consider targeted macroprudential policy responses. Such measures could include higher risk

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES

weights on real estate loans and lending to real estate developers. Additionally, concentration risks
associated with conglomerate structures and rising corporate leverage make it important to allow
the additional Single Borrower Limit (SBL) for PPP to lapse in December 2016 as planned. Finally, the
banks’ ability to absorb mark-to-market losses from higher market interest rates and corporate
vulnerabilities relating to exchange rate shocks should be further assessed with enhanced balance
sheet data.

26.
The authorities’ initiatives to strengthen systemic risk monitoring are welcome. BSP
recently decided to strengthen its financial stability function to mainstream macro-financial
surveillance and a prudential framework, drawing on recent Fund TA. These efforts should continue
to be complemented by expanding the regulatory perimeter, particularly to include real estate
developers and the nexus of conglomerates and banks. In this regard, staff supports explicitly
assigning a financial stability mandate to the BSP through amendments to its charter. Staff also
welcomes the regulatory agencies’ concerted efforts to maintain financial stability through the
Financial Stability Coordination Council (FSCC).
Authorities’ Views
27.
Macroprudential policies will continue to be applied. Unconventional monetary policies
in the advanced economies have placed banking supervision in emerging market economies in a
more complicated situation. BSP regularly conducts real estate stress tests and requires remedial
actions, including curtailing lending or raising capital. Although there are not immediate signs of
vulnerabilities in the household sector relating to real estate holdings, additional targeted measures
would be considered when needed. The measures already implemented, such as the real estate
stress tests, have moderated bank credit growth, and the BSP considers it premature to undertake
additional macroprudential measures particularly targeting the real estate sector at the current

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

PHILIPPINES

juncture. However, the BSP is enhancing monitoring of risks and will move proactively to limit them
in a targeted manner like it did with setting sector-specific capital charges for nondeliverable
forwards in response to systemic risks from foreign exchange exposures.
28.
In order to manage concentration risks, BSP intends to allow the additional SBL limit
for PPPs, adopted six years ago in the context of an underdeveloped capital market, to lapse
at the time of its sunset at end-2016. The SBL exemption was a calculated move put in place
without compromising the overall prudential regulation framework. Additional prudential measures
were put in place to help ensure financial stability, including the implementation of strengthened
capital requirements and risk management. To facilitate financing for infrastructure investments
even under lowered SBL limits, the BSP recently rationalized limits on PPP project loans to related
parties, by excluding properly ring-fenced project finances.

STRUCTURAL POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF INCLUSIVE
GROWTH
29.
The authorities are targeting a faster reduction in poverty than in recent years, which
will require well targeted social and infrastructure expenditure, especially in rural areas where
poverty incidence is highest. The Philippines’ high poverty rate fell only by 0.3 percentage points
per year, from 28.8 percent in 2006 to
26.3 percent in 2015 (national definition). The
new authorities target a reduction in the
poverty rate of 1.25 to 1.5 percentage points
per year during their term, with a cumulative
decline of 7.5 percent to 9 percent in six years.
Staff assessed the likelihood of achieving
these ambitious targets in the staff
recommended scenario.7 The results show
that poverty would fall only by 0.6 percentage
points per year, less than half the
government’s target, through the increase in
the level of expenditure per se. Therefore, in order to achieve this target, it is imperative that the
scale up in social and infrastructure is well targeted to the most vulnerable, particularly in rural areas,
and accompanied by strong structural policies. In this respect, staff welcomes the plans to improve

7

Staff estimated the effect of public expenditure on poverty reduction by a two-step approach, drawing on existing
studies: the first step identifies the effect of public expenditure on inequality, while the second step identifies the
effect of inequality and growth on poverty. This analysis was based on “Building Inclusive Growth in the Philippines,”
in Philippines—Selected Issues, Chapter 3, IMF Country Report No. 12/50; and “The Impact of Tax and Expenditure
Policies on income Distribution: Evidence from a Large Panel of Countries,” Hacienda Publica Espanola 200.

the conditional cash transfer program, raise investment in education and health, promote rural and
value chain development, and ensure land tenure in agriculture.
30.
Staff supports the new administration’s priorities for structural reforms. The most
macro-critical reforms include raising infrastructure investment and enhancing competition, by
amending the PPP law and opening up to foreign investment with a focus on lifting the
constitutional provision that prohibits more than a 40 percent foreign stake in utilities.8 Enhanced
competition in the crucial transport, telecommunications, and logistics sectors should be achieved
through steadfast implementation of the competition law, and also drawing up a national
competition policy and avoiding regulations that unduly discourage new entrants. The recent
passage of the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act (CMTA) and Cabotage Act is a welcome first
step. Foreign investment could be liberalized by easing the constitutional restrictions and/or the
negative list of the foreign investment act. Emerging macro-critical issues include: addressing low
agricultural productivity by facilitating the transferability of land titles and for use as collateral to
access credit; and addressing labor market imperfections and the skills mismatch to benefit from the
demographic dividend, thereby helping to reduce poverty and youth unemployment.
31.
Capital market development is crucial for growth and infrastructure investment, and
for the mitigation of concentration risks in the banking system. Currently the government
securities market is segmented and liquidity is low even at benchmark maturities due to an excessive
number of issuances, pricing convention, and the absence of a formal primary dealer (PD) system or
well-functioning market maker mechanism. Developing the capital market, including through
building a reliable benchmark yield curve, is important for mobilizing saving for productive
investment and growth, a key policy priority. Efforts should be also made to develop instruments
that would raise additional financing for PPP infrastructure projects (Box 9). Banks are near their
single borrower limits for lending to conglomerates including infrastructure PPPs. Capital market
development is all the more important in view of staff’s recommendation that the BSP allow the PPP
exemption from the 25 percent SBL to lapse. There is scope for financing brown field infrastructure
projects by issuing nonrecourse infrastructure bonds and asset backed securities that are
collateralized on the project’s future cash flows. This would allow banks to offload the brown field
assets and invest in green field infrastructure projects, while staying within the reduced single
borrower limits. Addressing the impediments to securitization and supporting regionally accepted
ratings would be important in this endeavor. The development of an institutional investor base
would also be important in this regard, including the implementation of the Personal Equity &
Retirement Account (PERA) Law. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) would also contribute to this
end.

While amending the constitution might face challenges, the Senate and House of Representatives have already
agreed to form a Constitutional Assembly to this end.

Box 9. Philippines: Infrastructure Financing and Capital Market Development
Market-based financing can mitigate constraints in infrastructure financing. The Philippine capital market is
developing but challenges remain, including the need for a deep and liquid government bond market to provide a
reliable yield curve.
Opening up new avenues of financing is important for infrastructure investment in the Philippines.
Infrastructure financing in the Philippines has relied on loan syndication by banks. While some infrastructure
projects have been financed through corporate bond issuances by holding companies with infrastructure exposure,
project bonds have rarely been issued. However, continued reliance on bank loans for large infrastructure projects
will face constraints associated with high concentration and asset-liability mismatch risks.
Market-based financing can be useful for brownfield infrastructure investments.1 During the planning and
construction phases of infrastructure projects, banks usually provide the largest share of financing, reflecting their
expertise in monitoring the projects and the relative ease of debt restructuring in cases of unforeseen events. Bond
financing can be rather costly due to high default risk. Once the infrastructure project becomes operational and
starts generating stable cash flows, bond financing becomes a natural and economically appropriate choice to
refinance or securitize initial bank loans at a low cost. Such bonds will offload a pool of illiquid assets from banks
and create space for new greenfield investments by banks. In addition, these bonds can be attractive for
institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, who need a diversified portfolio of
long-term assets to match the long-term duration of liabilities.
Countries have taken different approaches to infrastructure financing.2 Infrastructure financing is often led by
the public sector because investment profiles of infrastructure investments are not conducive to purely private
investments. For example, in China, loans by state-owned banks with guarantees from local governments have been
a major source. In Brazil, long-term private sector corporate finance has been dominated by a publicly-owned
development bank at a subsidized rate. As a result, local debt market development has lagged, although the
financial sector in Brazil is otherwise sophisticated. Some countries have been successful in developing local bond
markets to support long-term infrastructure projects. In particular, pension reforms in Canada and Chile have
helped to provide a stable long-term investor base and assisted local capital market development. Malaysia has also
successfully developed its capital market for infrastructure financing through reforms in the regulatory framework
and market infrastructure developments.
In the Philippines, challenges to developing the local bond market as a source of financing for infrastructure
investment remain. Deep and liquid government bond markets—anchored by a well-functioning money market—
would be needed to provide a reliable yield curve, which would support the pricing of other fixed-income
instruments. Addressing irregular liquidity across the yield curve by concentrating issuance and trading activity at
benchmark maturities is a key priority in this regard. Other important building blocks include a prudent regulatory
and supervisory framework for capital markets, key market infrastructure, and high-quality credit information
services. Taxes may also affect the financial viability of investment vehicles.

32.
Promoting financial inclusion is another priority. Access to formal financial services is low
especially in rural areas. In addition, the cost of remittances has increased due to closure of
correspondent banking relationships in the
context of de-risking of banks globally. In this
regard, additional new technologies for
international money transfers can be usefully
studied and encouraged, while monitoring their
introduction to mitigate risk. Development of
the insurance market would help promote
inclusive growth and poverty reduction. Staff
also welcomes a creation of a multiagency
committee chaired by the BSP to provide
strategic direction and oversight the
implementation of the 2015 national financial
inclusion strategy.
33.
The recent theft of US$81 million from Bangladesh’s official international reserves
laundered through casinos in the Philippines highlights the need to tighten anti-money
laundering legislation and procedures. Staff’s view is that the AML law needs to be strengthened,
along with amendment of the bank secrecy law, and is ready to provide further technical support to
help formulate these amendments if desired. The amendments should include the coverage of
casinos under the AML law and making tax evasion a predicate crime. The BSP and Department of
Finance are already working with Congress on amendments to the AML laws. The BSP also relaxed
foreign exchange regulations in August 2016 including documentary requirements for banks to
migrate transactions in the informal market to the banking system.
Authorities’ Views
34.
Making growth more inclusive is a key priority for the new administration. The
authorities noted that poverty reduction was slow in the past, but they plan to speed it up. They
welcome staff’s analysis on poverty reduction and agreed that meeting the ambitious targets would
require well targeted social and infrastructure spending, particularly in the provinces. The authorities
also recognize the need to develop and deepen capital markets and promote financial inclusion. The
Bureau of the Treasury, together with the BSP and SEC, plan to introduce a new repo instrument and
PD system. In addition, the authorities are finalizing work on other initiatives, including the
introduction of an overnight index swap facility and a pricing benchmark framework. To promote
financial deepening and inclusion, the BSP approved entry of a number of foreign banks to foster
competition in the banking sector and provide better access and options to the underserved areas.
The authorities have also resubmitted draft amendments to the AML law and the bank secrecy law
to Congress. As part of its supervisory enforcement action, the BSP recently imposed a record
₱1.0 billion (US$21 million) fine against the domestic bank involved in the Bangladesh cyber heist.

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
The Philippine economy has continued to show strong economic growth coupled with
low inflation. Sound macroeconomic policies and prudent financial sector supervision have
contributed to solid macroeconomic fundamentals. Strong economic growth in the first half of 2016
reflects the strength of domestic demand. Inflation is expected to move within the target range.
Credit growth has picked up, but most indicators suggest that credit growth remains below typical
cutoffs for credit booms. There is a continuing need to monitor macro-financial risks in light of
recent rapid credit growth.
36.
The favorable macroeconomic performance in recent years has not led to
corresponding improvements in social indicators. Income inequality and poverty persist and the
unemployment rate has come down only slowly. Staff supports the authorities’ efforts to implement
reforms that would strengthen social indicators.
37.
The new administration has an opportunity to put the economy on a higher and more
equitable growth path while reaping the dividends from its young and growing population.
Building on the Philippines’ sound macroeconomic policies, this will involve increasing infrastructure
spending, facilitating PPPs and opening the economy to foreign investment, as well as improving
the investment climate. Staff supports the government’s plans to improve human capital and social
services for the poor. It also supports the efforts to promote development in a more geographically
balanced manner.
38.
Staff supports the government’s plan to raise infrastructure and social spending and
increase its medium-term fiscal deficit target to 3 percent of GDP, anchored to a stable
debt-to-GDP ratio. The increase in public spending in the 2016 budget is appropriate given the
large infrastructure and social needs, while output is expected to remain close to potential. The new
fiscal deficit target would keep the debt-to-GDP ratio stable and allows a cushion for unforeseen
contingencies such as disaster risk and contingent liabilities arising from PPPs.
39.
A comprehensive tax reform is needed to make the system more equitable and
efficient, and to raise additional revenue to finance large infrastructure and social needs.
While the authorities’ intention to pass a comprehensive tax reform package is welcome, they are
further urged to eliminate the 13th month salary exemption from the PIT and raise taxes and fees on
motor vehicles. It will also be very important to rationalize tax incentives at the same time as CIT
rates are lowered to avoid a revenue loss and to increase efficiency. To strengthen tax collection, the
tax authorities should be given access to individual bank account information and tax evasion
should be made a predicate crime.

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES

40.
The authorities should formulate a medium-term public infrastructure plan with clear
prioritization of projects and appropriate choices between budgetary and PPP spending, with due
consideration of contingent liabilities. Staff support the authorities’ target to increase public
infrastructure spending to at least 5 percent of GDP over the medium term. It will be important that
such spending is done efficiently in key strategic areas and that additional revenues are available to
finance it.
41.
Monetary policy settings are currently appropriate. Nonetheless, the BSP should stand
ready to tighten if there are signs of overheating or credit growth accelerating with inflationary
pressures. The adoption of the new interest rate corridor is commendable and efforts to absorb
additional liquidity through stepping up the size of deposit auctions should continue. This would
allow the BSP to lower the currently high banks’ required reserve ratio over time. Passage of a new
BSP charter that authorizes the issuance of central bank bills and increases BSP’s capital would help
support monetary policy effectiveness. With official international reserves more than adequate, the
policy of allowing the exchange rate to move freely in line with market forces, while smoothing
excessive volatility in both directions, should continue.
42.
Macroprudential policies should be used to guard against systemic risks to financial
stability, including those relating to conglomerate structures and real estate. Staff supports the
authorities’ use of targeted prudential policies to tame financial excesses, including credit surges,
and strengthen resilience. More stringent prudential regulations may be needed if systemic risks
become apparent. Broadening the BSP’s financial stability mandate remains a priority, and staff
supports the authorities’ proposed amendments to the BSP charter. Staff also supports the
authorities’ efforts to allow better access to information on conglomerates’ finances.
43.
Financial deepening and inclusion are also essential elements of the authorities’
inclusive growth strategy. While the composition of credit growth including in the real estate
sector should be closely monitored on an ongoing basis to avoid risks from credit booms, expanded
bank lending to productive sectors will facilitate inclusive growth. Staff believes that further
development of alternative forms of financing and hedging, such as new technologies to increase
the access to financial services by a larger share of the population, and development of corporate
bond and equity markets, is needed to support infrastructure investment.
44.
Staff supports the authorities’ objective to accelerate poverty reduction. Achieving this
goal will require that the scale up in social and infrastructure is well targeted to the most vulnerable,
particularly in rural areas, and accompanied by strong structural policies. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ initiatives in the 10-point policy agenda to increase social spending and promote rural
development and agriculture.
45.
Staff also supports the authorities’ efforts to step up structural reforms. Raising
infrastructure investment and competition, opening the economy to foreign investment, addressing
low agricultural productivity, and removing labor market imperfections and the skills mismatch to
benefit from the demographic dividend, would have large growth dividends and would help lower
poverty and youth unemployment.

The recent incident of funds being illegally shifted from Bangladesh underscores the

1/ The assumptions underlying the baseline and staff's recommended scenario are presented in Box 2. Staff's recommended scenario includes a tax reform
that raises 3 percent of GDP in extra revenue over time, in increments of 1 percentage point per year starting in 2017. The extra revenue is used to finance
additional social and capital expenditure by equal amounts. The larger fiscal multipliers of investment and social expenditure than that of taxes lead to an
increase in real GDP growth of 0.5 percent relative to the baseline scenario in 2017-19, with growth increasing by another 0.1 percent in 2018 and
0.2 percent in 2019 due to crowding in of private investment and enhanced public investment efficiency. Over the medium term, growth rises to 8 percent in
2020-21 due to higher public and private investment, gains in productivity associated to the liberalization of FDI and reform of land titles, and faster
employment growth due to labor market reforms. Inflation raises somewhat reflecting the demand stimulus partly offset by a tightening of monetary policy
and higher potential growth, and the current account surplus declines because of higher investment and lower saving.
2/ The estimated impact of the reforms included in the staff's recommended scenario are based on Komatsuzaki 2016 (Improving Public Infrastructure in
the Philippines, IMF WP/16/39) and Dabla-Norris and others 2015 (Structural Reforms and Productivity Growth in Emerging Market and Developing
Economies, IMF WP/16/15).

serve as a shock absorber. Let the
exchange rate adjust to the new
equilibrium if China’s growth
slowdown is persistent.
Implement structural reforms and
consider accelerating public
infrastructure spending to spur new
sources of growth.
Enforce existing macroprudential
policies and implement additional
real estate specific measures.
Ensure adequate bank capital to
absorb credit losses.
Coordinated and strengthened
surveillance on nonbank activities,
including expansion of the BSP’s
mandate to include nonbanks.
Monetary policy should focus on
maintaining price stability.
Macroprudential policy should be
deployed to limit the buildup of
systemic vulnerabilities, including in
specific sectors.
Strengthen the public expenditure
framework in support of
infrastructure and social spending.
Improve the scope for PPPs to
develop infrastructure.
Broaden the tax base and improve
tax administration to raise
additional revenue.
Further expand well targeted
transfers and universal health care.
Accelerate infrastructure
improvements, especially in the
areas which make it more resilient
to natural disasters.
Explore private and public sector
options for insurance.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative
likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of
the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the
risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Appendix II. Philippines—Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt in the Philippines is sustainable. Staff’s baseline scenario projects that the general
government debt-to-GDP ratio will fall from 36 percent of GDP in 2015 to below 31 percent in 2021
despite the rise in the fiscal deficit target to 3 percent in 2017. The growth-interest rate differential is
the main factor behind the projected fall in public debt, contributing 6.6 percentage points, as real
GDP growth increases to 7 percent toward the end of the projection period. Moreover, the primary
surpluses also contribute to the reduction in public debt by 2.5 percentage points. The gross
financing needs remain comfortable at 4−5 percent of GDP throughout the projection period. The
debt composition is also projected to remain stable with a relatively low share of short-term debt
and foreign currency-denominated debt, in line with the authorities’ debt management policy.
Alternative scenarios indicate that staff’s baseline is conservative. The Philippines achieved a large
scale public debt reduction in the past decade, supported by primary surpluses, high output growth,
and exchange rate appreciation. The historical scenario, in which real GDP growth, real interest rates,
and primary balances are equal to their 2006‒2015 averages, leads to faster reduction in debt and
gross financing needs than in staff’s baseline. The scenario with a constant primary surplus at the
projected 2016 level of 1.9 percent of GDP also leads to lower debt-to-GDP ratios and gross
financing needs than in staff’s baseline scenario.
Total external debt in the Philippines is also sustainable. External debt fell sharply in the 2000s, from
a peak of 76.4 percent of GDP in 2001 to 26.5 percent in 2015, due to sustained current account
surpluses, strong output growth, and currency appreciation. Under staff’s baseline scenario, these
trends are projected to continue, with external debt expected to fall to 15.7 percent of GDP in 2021.
Alternative scenarios suggest that staff’s baseline is conservative. The historical scenario, in which
real GDP growth, real interest rates, and the non-interest current account balance are equal to
their 2006‒2015 averages, leads to a faster reduction in external debt than in staff’s baseline.
Moreover, debt dynamics appear resilient to various shocks: one-half standard deviation shocks to
interest rates, growth, and the current account lead to only modest increases in external debt ratios
over the medium term. However, exchange rate volatility remains a vulnerability as a one-time real
depreciation of 30 percent in 2016 would raise the external debt-to-GDP ratio by about
10 percentage points.

Appendix III. Philippines—External Sector Assessment
The Philippines’ external sector remains moderately stronger than warranted by fundamentals and
desirable policies despite the recent decline in the current account surplus. The current account
approach of the Fund’s External Balance Assessment (EBA) model, adjusted by Philippines-specific
factors, shows a current account balance slightly above the level implied by fundamentals and
desired policies. On the other hand, staff assess the peso to be broadly in line with fundamentals
and desired policies, although subject to a high degree of uncertainty. This apparent dichotomy is
because the Philippines’ current account surplus is determined by structural factors such as
inadequate infrastructure, a weak business environment, and risks of natural disasters, which
constrain private investment and lead to higher precautionary savings. Accordingly, the current
account gap should decline once infrastructure is upgraded in line with the authorities’ plans.


Current account. The EBA model places the gap between the actual and the current account
balance that is consistent with fundamentals and desired policies—the so called CAB norm—at
4.9 percent of GDP in 2015 (3 percentage points lower than in 2014). Deviations of policies from
their desired levels explain 1.3 percent, with 0.4 percent due to a strong domestic fiscal stance
and 0.9 percent to fiscal policy gaps in other countries. The other 3.6 percent of GDP is left
unexplained by the EBA model. Philippines-specific factors such as natural disaster risks or
worker remittances could explain between 23 percent, suggesting a current account balance
modestly above its norm.12



Real effective exchange rate (REER). The REER is assessed to be broadly in line with the level
implied by fundamentals and desired policies. The EBA REER approaches (index and level) point
to an overvaluation of the peso. On the other hand, applying an estimated elasticity to the
assessed current account gap range point to an undervaluation of about 8 percent. Two key
factors that are probably not well captured by such elasticity calculations are remittances and
the need for a substantial ramp-up of capital goods imports to sustain a desirable increase in
investment that started in 2015. Taking all of this conflicting evidence into account, staff find it
appropriate to reflect the high degree of uncertainty and assess the REER broadly in line with
fundamentals and desired policies.

As noted in the 2014 Philippines—Staff Report, IMF Country Report 14/245, exposure to natural disasters is an
uninsurable risk for the private sector. For the Philippines, this factor adds 1.52 percent of GDP to the CAB norm.
Worker remittances are another important factor that drive a wedge between GDP and GNI, the latter being a better
measure of income and the basis for saving-investment decisions. Using GNI instead of GDP as a measure of income
in the EBA model adds another 0.51 percent of GDP to the CAB norm.
1

Last year’s sizeable EBA current account gap has declined due to both a smaller cyclically adjusted current account
balance and a slightly larger CAB norm. At the same time, the Philippines’ specific adjustments have been reestimated and their impact is smaller than previously estimated. Therefore, the current account gap, although slightly
below last year’s, does not change the staff’s bottom line assessment.



Addressing imbalances: The Philippines’ current account surplus reflects its low level of
investment compared with other EMEs. Raising investment and thus boosting potential growth,
by improving the business environment and infrastructure, would help reduce external
imbalances going forward, without necessarily adjusting the exchange rate.



International reserves. The Philippines continues to have ample reserves, which stood at
229 percent of the Fund’s reserve adequacy metric in 2015. While the level of reserves is above
the RA metric, it is broadly justified by the vulnerability to natural disasters and capital flow
volatility. Staff agrees with the BSP that the exchange rate should continue to be allowed to
move freely in line with market forces with intervention limited to smoothing excessive volatility
in both directions.



Size and importance of capital flows. During the post global financial crisis years, the Philippines
received sizeable foreign exchange inflows, both from remittances and portfolio investment,
resulting in a build-up of reserves. Going forward, steady portfolio outflows are expected to
continue, and gross reserves are projected to increase modestly over the medium term. The
opening up of the economy may see a rise in foreign direct investment but be accompanied by
higher imports of capital goods, particularly in the staff’s recommended scenario.

practices and restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions except for exchange restrictions maintained for security reasons and notified to the
Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision 144-(52/51).
Article IV Consultation
Philippines is on the standard 12˗month cycle. The 2015 Article IV consultation was held on
August 26, 2015 (IMF Country Report No. 15/246).
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Report on Standards and Codes (ROSC)
Participation:
MCM: A FSAP was conducted during the fourth quarter of 2001; FSAP missions visited Manila in
October and November–December 2001. The final version of the report was discussed with the
authorities in June 2002. The associated FSSA was discussed by the Executive Board together with
the Article IV staff report in September 2002. The FSAP report was published in March 2004. The
FSAP update mission took place in November 2009, and the report was published in April 2010.
FAD: Discussions on fiscal transparency were held in Manila in September 2001. The ROSC report
was discussed by the Executive Board in September 2002 together with the Article IV staff report,
and published in October 2002. The update to the ROSC report was published in June 2004. In
addition, a pilot Fiscal Transparency Evaluation mission took place in February 2014 and the report
was published in June 2015 (IMF Country Report No. 15/156).
STA: A ROSC Data Module mission was conducted in September 2003, and the report was published
in August 2004.
Technical Assistance
The Philippines is an intensive user of IMF technical assistance (TA), particularly in fiscal and financial
areas. Improvements have been made in all areas, but the translation of recommendations into law
has lagged.
FAD has concluded a five-year TA project financed by the Millennium Challenge Corporation to
improve the basic functions of tax administration by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) (2011−16),
in line with recommendations made by FAD TA missions in 2005, 2008, and 2009. The project
provides for a resident tax administration advisor and an extensive program of short-term expert
visits. In the extended project (2013–16) the main priorities were intended to “institutionalize” the
new procedures implemented in the arrears management and VAT audit pilots, enhance the
compliance improvement strategy (CIS), integrate redesigned business process with eTIS, and
introduce further institutional, governance and management strengthening to help ensure
sustainability of the reforms. Particular progress has been made in VAT audit, arrears management
and compliance improvement strategy. In addition, TADAT assessment took place in December 2015
to provide a picture of the current state of operations within the BIR against international good
practice in tax administration. A tax policy TA in April 2016 made a comprehensive proposal of tax
reform in the ASEAN environment. FAD’s past TA missions on tax policy provided advice that

PHILIPPINES

constituted the basis for the reform of excises on tobacco and alcoholic beverages implemented in
early 2013 and publication of tax expenditures to improve transparency and accountability of tax
incentives supported by the Tax Investment and Management Act (TIMTA). TA on public financial
management (PFM) seeks to establish effective and efficient budget and treasury management. In
addition to the Fiscal Transparency Evaluation, TA on medium-term budget framework, government
cash management, formulation and drafting of the PFM bill, and contingent liabilities management
took place in 2014−2016. In line with past PFM advice, the government introduced a Treasury Single
Account and is reviewing its cash management and planning. It now produces a midyear report on
the macroeconomic and fiscal outlook and midyear budget execution. In addition, the revenue and
expenditure from off budget accounts are now presented in budget documents. Moreover, the PFM
bill has been submitted to the Congress.
On the legal area, LEG provided TA to the Philippines on Central Banking Legislation in 2012, and
provided advice on the amendment to the Philippines’ Central Banking Law in November 2013. In
April 2013, LEG also provided TA on Implementation of Targeted Financial Sanctions Obligations
under UN Security Council Resolutions Relation to Terrorism Financing.
MCM provided a series of TA in 2010−15 on developing and implementing a risk-focused
supervisory approach in keeping with the Basel Core Principles and other key international
supervisory practices and on timely identification and resolution of problem institutions. Among the
long list achievements are: improved quality and timeliness of supervisory actions and related
supervisory reports; issuance of new regulations covering securities investments and stress testing;
and selected areas of Basel III implementation including liquidity coverage ratio and leverage ratios.
MCM TA efforts were also devoted to the implementation of the supervisory core training initiative.
The in-house training initiative is now self-sustaining, with 21 courses rolled out, and the quality of
the supervisory reports has shown considerable improvement. Finally, two missions in 2015 and 2016
assessed the institutional needs for strengthening the framework for financial stability analysis and
provided a road map for a comprehensive financial stability framework, focusing on the institutional
setup, monitoring and tools, and crisis management.
In addition, three MCM TA missions on liquidity management and forecasting and on the
implementation of an interest rate corridor took place 2013−2015 to strengthen monetary policy
operational framework. The BSP has made progress on developing its liquidity forecast capacity, and
the new interest rate corridor system was introduced in June 2016.
Other areas of MCM TA included advice on financial market development. A workshop on the
deepening of government securities market was held in 2014, and TA on exchange consolidation and
securities regulation was delivered in 2015.
A series of STA TA missions on Government Finance Statistics took place in 2012 and 2013 to assist
the authorities in compiling and disseminating government finance statistics in accordance with
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. Additionally, during 2012 STA provided TA to the
Philippines in the areas of Balance of Payments Statistics, Data Dissemination Standards, National
Accounts, and producer and consumer price indices. In late 2014, a TA mission worked with the
Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) on source data and compilation procedures of quarterly
accounts, and the implementation of the new System of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA).

authorities have submitted test SRF-data for several types of OFCs, which have been reviewed by
STA. It is expected that the SRF will be introduced by end-2016.

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
(As of June 30, 2016)
Background
The Bank and the Fund country teams for the Philippines exchanged views to coordinate the teams’
work during 2016‒17 through the resident representative’s office and headquarters missions. The
teams agreed on the Philippines’ main macroeconomic challenges to navigate the uncertain global
environment to maintain macroeconomic stability, create policy space to meet future potential
shocks, and build the foundations for faster and more inclusive growth. Based on this shared
assessment, the teams identified three structural reform areas as macro-critical, in view of their
central role in achieving sustained inclusive growth: (1) raising investment, including public sector
capital spending; (2) strengthening public finance and social safety nets; and (3) financial sector
development. Table 1 details the specific activities planned by the two country teams during
June 2016˗June 2017, along with their expected deliverables, and the division of labor.
The Key Areas with Joint Programs
Strengthening Public Finance
The continued focus on mobilizing fiscal revenue to help fund spending in support of sustained and
inclusive growth, while strengthening the resilience to shocks. The Fund and the Bank have a long
standing program of support for strengthening public finance and involves close coordination in tax
policy reform including fiscal incentives rationalization and monitoring of the sin tax
implementation; management of fiscal risks and reporting; debt management strategy; assisting the
Department of Budget and Management in improving public financial management and support for
the Bureau of Treasury’s lead role in implementation of a Single Treasury Account (TSA) and cash
management.
Financial Sector
A joint Bank/Fund Financial System Stability Assessment took place in 2009, following up on the
initial joint FSAP in 2002. Following the FSAP recommendations, the Fund has focused on technical
assistance in bank supervision and resolution. The Bank has taken the lead in the nonbank financial
sector and crisis simulations. Joint areas of interest are banking sector soundness and resolution,
financial inclusion and capital market development.
Broad agreement among the two teams emerged on the key issues and challenges, and on the
division of tasks to tackle these. It was agreed that further details on collaboration, as necessary,
would be agreed at the technical level as work progresses. The teams have the following requests
for information and collaboration from their counterparts:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES



The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in World Bank’s discussions with the
government on financing of infrastructure, PPPs, and implementation of the development policy
loan. Review and sharing of analytical work, in particular the Philippine Development Report
(PDR) series, would be welcome, in addition to follow up from the 2010 FSAP, and on work
related to the reform of social safety nets, public expenditure reviews, and public financial
management.



The Bank team requests to be kept informed of the Fund’s assessments of macroeconomic
policies and prospects and to coordinate closely the technical assistance work, especially in
areas such as budget reform, tax policy and administration, financial sector development and
soundness as well as in public expenditure analysis and management, where extensive Bank
work is ongoing.

ADB’s private sector operations in the Philippines began in 1986. As of June 30, 2016, cumulative
approvals in 30 projects amounted to $1,109 million. ADB’s private sector operations in the
Philippines include financing for power plants, roads, and air transport, and investments in banks
and private equity funds. In December 2014, ADB approved a $75 million (₱3.375 billion) loan for
the expansion and renovation of the Mactan Cebu Airport terminal (the first large-scale PPP project
awarded under the Aquino government's PPP program). Another two loans were approved in 2015
for $20 million to support the 150-Megawatt Burgos Wind Farm Project, and for $221.807 million to
support the Tiwi and Makban Geothermal Power Green Bonds project.

The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2011−2016 was endorsed by the ADB Board of Directors on
October 26, 2011. The CPS is aligned with the government’s Philippine Development
Plan 2011−2016 and ADB’s Strategy 2020. The key objective of ADB support will be to help
Philippines achieve, high, inclusive, and sustainable growth. The intended outcomes of the CPS are:
(i) improved investment climate and private sector development; (ii) more efficient, effective, and
equitable social service delivery; (iii) reduced environmental degradation and vulnerability to climate
change disasters; and (iv) strengthened governance and reduced corruption. A CPS Final Review was
completed in June 2016 and sent for validation to Independent Evaluation Department. The results will
inform the next CPS 2017−2022. The Country Operations Business Plan (COBP) 2016–2018, the fifth
under the CPS 2011–2016, was approved in December 2015. The next COBP 2017-2019 is expected for
ADB Management approval by September 2016.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of August 2, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National accounts: As part of a World Bank-funded project, Improving the Quality and Usefulness of the Philippine
System of National Accounts, the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) rebased the national accounts
from 1985 to 2000. Continuing improvements include ongoing efforts to fully implement the System of National
Accounts, 2008. Despite the authorities’ efforts to improve quality, weaknesses remain in the national accounts.
These include the coverage of the GDP and the statistical discrepancies in the GDP estimates between the
expenditure and production sides. The authorities are working on improving (i) the accuracy of the GDP volume
measures; (ii) the coverage of the public corporations sector; (iii) the accuracy of the quarterly GDP data; and
(iv) the adoption of benchmark techniques to reconcile quarterly and annual national accounts estimates. The
NSCB is currently participating in the IMF Statistics Department’s Project on the Implementation of the System of
National Accounts and the International Comparison Program, funded by the Government of Japan. This three-year
technical assistance project provides assistance to improve the quality of the national accounts and price statistics.
National accounts are expected to be revised in the near future based on the recently released 2012 Census of
Philippine Business and Industry (CPBI).
Price statistics: In July 2011, the National Statistics Office introduced a rebased consumer price index (CPI). The
updated CPI is compiled using weights based on the 2006 Family Income and Expenditure Survey. Data from
the 2008 Commodity and Outlet Survey were used to augment the provincial market baskets. One important
methodological change implemented in the updated CPI is the adoption of the internationally recommended
Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP) for the classification of all items. As noted in the
above section, assistance will be provided to improve the quality of price statistics in Philippines.
External sector statistics: The BSP has completed the final-stage implementation of BOP compilation to BPM6
framework in March 2014. The compilation of IIP data based on BPM6 framework was completed in
September 2014. Steps have been taken to improve the quality of balance of payment statistics. In 2005, the
Central Bank of Philippines (BSP) created a Department of Economic Statistics, with one of its units to concentrate
on compiling, analyzing, and publishing the balance of payments and the international investment position. Since
deregulation in the early 1990s, international transactions have increasingly flowed through nontraditional
channels that are not adequately covered by the statistical reporting system. The authorities have introduced new
data sources, including the Cross Border Transactions Survey and administrative-based reporting systems to
address coverage issues, but challenges remain. The Foreign Currency Deposit Units (FCDUs), which account for
about 70−75 percent of foreign exchange settlements, are exempt from reporting requirements because of strict
banking secrecy rules.
Monetary and financial statistics: Compilation of monetary and financial statistics (MFS) largely conforms to the
Fund’s methodology. A joint effort between the Insurance Commission, SEC, GOCs, BSP to gather data and publish
the Other Financial Corporation’s Survey is ongoing.
Government finance statistics: Provision of fiscal data is broadly adequate for surveillance. Major areas for
improvement include detailed data for levels of the public sector beyond the national government as well as
transition of fiscal data reporting to the GFSM 2001 format. Fiscal Transparency ROSCs were conducted in 2002
and 2004.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Philippines subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards
(SDDS) in August 1996.

Statement by Mr. Marzunisham Omar, Executive Director and Mr. Thomas Benjamin
Marcelo, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
September 14, 2016
1.
The Philippine authorities appreciate the constructive policy dialogue and useful insights
shared by staff during the 2016 Article IV Consultation. The discussions focused on the policy
priorities of the new administration, particularly on macroeconomic policies and structural
reforms to sustain the strong growth and enhance its inclusiveness. The authorities welcome
staff’s assessment that sound macroeconomic policies have delivered solid economic growth and
the challenge now is to make more people benefit from this growth through a durable reduction
in poverty. The authorities broadly concur with staff assessment and key recommendations and
would like to provide the following updates on recent economic developments and policies.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
2.
The Philippine economy sustained its resilience and continued to grow strongly amid a
still challenging global economic environment after posting real GDP growth of 7.0 percent in
the second quarter of 2016, one of the fastest growth in the Asian region. The favorable growth
performance was supported by continued robust private demand, strong investment, and
increased government spending, particularly for infrastructure development. However, the
agriculture sector contracted due to the lingering effects of El Niño. External demand remained
weak, as exports of goods and services continued to slow down, despite the double digit growth
of services exports.
3.
The inflation environment over the past years has remained relatively benign in the
context of low global commodity prices and favorable domestic food supply conditions.
Meanwhile, the sound and stable banking system and robust external sector dynamics continue to
provide solid support to the Philippine economy.
4.
The authorities view the following as key risks to the outlook: (a) divergence in monetary
policies in the advanced economies, which may raise near term financial market volatility;
(b) lower oil prices, which may lead oil exporters to cut back on spending and capital
expenditures with the impact on remittances; and (c) weather-related disruptions. The authorities
welcome staff’s view that the Philippines is well-equipped to deal with these challenges, should
these materialize, given the country’s strong fundamentals and ample policy space.
5.
The authorities target a GDP growth of 6.0–7.0 percent in 2016. The smooth political
transition and assurance of macroeconomic policy consistency and continuity by the new
administration will likely keep business and consumer confidence strong to meet the full-year
target. Over the medium term, the authorities are aiming for a steady acceleration of growth
towards 7.0 to 8.0 percent to enable a durable reduction in poverty. The new administration will
maintain sound macroeconomic policies, accelerate infrastructure spending, invest heavily in
human capital development, and promote regional and rural development.

2
Macroeconomic Policies and Structural Reforms
Fiscal Policy
6.
The authorities agree with staff’s recommendation that fiscal policy should focus on
accelerating infrastructure investment and higher and well-targeted social spending to promote
more inclusive growth. The authorities have increased the annual fiscal deficit target from
2.0 percent of GDP in 2016 to 3.0 percent of GDP for 2017 until 2022 to allow for higher
spending on infrastructure, agriculture and rural development, and social services with due
regard to preserving debt sustainability. The proposed national budget for 2017 amounts to
PhP3.35 trillion, 11.6 percent higher than the budget for 2015 and corresponds to 21 percent of
GDP (2016: 19.5 percent of GDP). The country’s total infrastructure spending for 2017 will
increase to 5.4 percent of GDP (2016: 5.1 percent of GDP). The proposed budget allocation for
infrastructure spending has been increased by 13.8 percent to fund transport infrastructure
construction and rehabilitation of school buildings, and establishment of flood control systems.
The proposed budget allocation for social spending has been significantly increased
by 20.1 percent to support education and skills development programs, health care, socialized
housing and resettlement, as well as the conditional cash transfer program.
7.
As part of the new administration’s reform agenda, the Department of Finance will be
proposing to Congress a package of reform measures that includes lowering personal and
corporate income taxes and simplifying tax processes. The revenue erosion from the lowering of
income tax rates would be offset by reform initiatives that include broadening the tax base and
collection, reviewing fiscal incentives, adjusting the fuel excise tax rates, imposing taxes on
unhealthy food items, and eliminating some VAT exemptions. With these reform measures, the
authorities aim to increase total revenue effort to about 17 percent of GDP in 2018 (2015:
15.9 percent of GDP) and about 18 percent of GDP by 2022.
8.
The revenue measures will also help in further reducing the national government’s
outstanding debt to 40.9 percent of GDP in 2017 (2016: 42.7 percent of GDP) and place the
debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward trajectory in the medium term. The authorities will continue to
strengthen the resilience of the country’s debt profile by maintaining a bias for domestic
borrowings while optimizing available concessional loans from development partners.
9.
The authorities’ overall strategy for infrastructure development is to increase
infrastructure spending to 6.0 to 7.0 percent of GDP during the period 2017–2022 to attain
higher growth potential in the medium term. In support of this, the authorities have initiated
reforms in investment programming and budgeting. A three-year rolling infrastructure program
in the national budget starting 2017 was reinstituted, assuring fund allocation for well-developed
and readily-implementable projects for three years. The process of investment programming is
being streamlined through online submission and updating of priority programs and projects. The
authorities are also working to speed up the appraisal and approval process for major capital
projects while still ensuring the quality of infrastructure projects. The authorities are supporting
amendments to the procurement law to simplify and streamline the process, delineating delivery
responsibilities between national and local projects, and improving the absorptive capacity of
government agencies through better planning and project execution.

3
10.
In addition to public infrastructure investments, the revitalized public-private partnership
(PPP) program will accelerate the roll out of infrastructure projects. While there is a solid
pipeline of PPP projects that has keen investor support, the authorities are open to unsolicited
proposals from the private sector.
11.
Significant progress continues to be made on fiscal structural reforms, with the passage of
laws on tax incentives management and transparency and customs modernization. To fast track
infrastructure investment and PPPs, a law was amended to facilitate the acquisition of right-ofway site for national government infrastructure projects. The authorities are also supporting the
passage of laws on government streamlining, budget reform (earlier supported by IMF technical
assistance), and amendments to the law on build- operate-transfer schemes.
Monetary Policy
12.
Monetary policy will remain focused on achieving the inflation target of 2.0–4.0 percent
for 2017–2018. The authorities welcome staff’s view that the current monetary policy stance
remain appropriate. The authorities continue to see a manageable inflation outlook over the
policy horizon. Latest forecasts continue to indicate that average inflation is likely to settle
slightly below the 3.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage point target range in 2016 and rise toward the
mid-point of the target range in 2017 and 2018. Inflation expectations also remain well-anchored
within the inflation target band over 2017–2018 while the risks to future inflation appear to be
broadly balanced.
13.
The benign inflation environment also provided flexibility for the Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas (BSP) to shift to an interest rate corridor system and implement key reforms in its
monetary operations in June 2016 to further improve the transmission of monetary policy. The
changes to the system for monetary operations involved: (a) modification of the RRP facility into
an overnight facility; (b) introduction of the auction-based term deposit facility;
(c) and conversion of standing facilities (repurchase and special deposit account windows) to
overnight liquidity facilities. The BSP’s main policy rate will continue to be the overnight RRP
rate. Over time, the implementation of the interest rate corridor will allow for possible reduction
in reserve requirements in line with international norms.
14.
The authorities continue to maintain a market-based exchange rate policy, with scope for
occasional presence to maintain orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market. In addition,
the BSP has continued to further liberalize the foreign exchange regulatory framework, as part of
continuing efforts to keep regulations appropriate for the changing needs of the Philippine
economy and following the thrust towards greater openness in view of the country’s increasing
integration with global markets.
Financial Sector Policy
15.
The Philippine financial system remained stable and resilient despite bouts of external
volatility. The banking system is sound, underpinned by a continued increase in assets, lending,
and deposits, and with capital adequacy ratios comfortably above the BSP’s prescribed levels
and international norms. The authorities continued to undertake supervisory and regulatory
reforms to further ensure the continued soundness and stability of the financial system. On

4
enhancing financial stability, the recent policy measures and initiatives include: (a) amendment
of the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation charter to enhance the liquidation and resolution
framework for banks; (b) issuance of guidelines on operational risk management; (c) adoption of
Basel III liquidity coverage ratio requirements; and (d) launching of new residential real estate
price indices to assess the Philippines’ real estate and credit market conditions. The authorities
are prioritizing amendments to the BSP charter, Deposit Secrecy Law and Anti-Money
Laundering Act, as well as supporting the passage of the Payments Systems Act and an expanded
Islamic banking law.
16.
To further develop the banking industry, the authorities approved the phased lifting of
restrictions on the establishment of new banks. To support financial deepening, the authorities
issued new guidelines on the creation of the personal management trust for estate planning
and/or asset management of trust entities. To develop the capital markets, reforms focused on
providing flexibility in raising foreign capital and encouraging more foreign investors to invest
in the country. To support the financing of priority investments, the authorities approved
amendments to rationalize lending rules to regulated parties. An agricultural value chain
financing framework was also issued to address the associated credit risks with the agriculture
and fisheries sector.
17.
To further advance the financial inclusion agenda, a National Financial Inclusion Steering
Committee was institutionalized by executive order to be the governing body providing strategic
direction, guidance and oversight in the implementation of the National Strategy for Financial
Inclusion. The Credit Surety Fund (CSF) Cooperative Act was passed and institutionalized the
CSF program initiated by the BSP in 2008 to help micro, small and medium enterprises gain
access to formal sources of credit. A law was also passed recognizing and regulating nongovernment organizations engaged in microfinance.
Structural Reforms
18.
The authorities recognize the challenge to make the strong economic growth more
sustainable and inclusive. Over the medium term, the authorities are setting a growth target of
7.0 to 8.0 percent and a reduction in poverty incidence from 26.3 percent in the first semester
of 2015 to 17 percent by 2022. This will be supported by a comprehensive and accelerated
structural reform agenda.
19.
The structural reform priorities include strengthening institutions, reducing the cost of
doing business, easing restriction on foreign investments, and strengthening agro-industrial
linkages. Government processes are being reviewed to further cut red tape. A dozen government
agencies have already been placed under a single leadership to streamline and enhance the antipoverty programs of the government. An executive order was issued on freedom of information
to promote greater transparency in the Executive Branch. A one-stop shop service for overseas
Filipino workers was recently launched to ensure that government frontline services are made
more accessible to Filipinos who are currently working or planning to work overseas. The
authorities have likewise requested Congress to grant the President emergency powers to solve
traffic and congestion problems in Metro Manila and other parts of the country.

5
20.
The authorities are also committed to push for constitutional amendments to lift
restrictive economic provisions to encourage greater foreign investments as well as to adopt a
federal form of government to promote decentralization and regional development.
21.
The authorities also continued to demonstrate strong commitment and ability to deliver
on its structural reform agenda with the passage of several key legislations in 2015 and 2016, in
order to boost productivity and competitiveness, such as the competition law and amendments to
the cabotage law. On promoting employment generation and protection, new laws were
introduced on job search assistance, overseas worker welfare administration, and labor dispute
settlement. On supporting trade, laws were introduced on Halal products, anti-smuggling of
agricultural products, and funding support for agriculture competitiveness. On education, laws
were introduced on entrepreneurship and financial education among young Filipinos and college
scholarships, grants-in-aid, and low-cost educational loans to poor students. On improving
governance and strengthening of institutions, several laws established branches of the Regional
Trial Court to speed up the resolution of cases. A law established the Department of Information
and Communications Technology (DICT), which will focus on ICT matters including internet
speed and online or electronic-related crimes. On disaster risk reduction and climate change
adaptation, a law provides for funding support to modernize the national weather agency.
22.
The authorities are also supporting the passage in 2016 and 2017 of the following
legislative measures: (a) law on freedom of information to mandate the disclosure of public
documents; (b) law on pension reform for uniformed personnel; (c) amendments to the bank
secrecy law to strengthen efforts to curb tax evasion; and (d) amendments to the law on antimoney laundering to include casino operators in the coverage of the law and also make tax
evasion a predicate crime.
23.
The authorities, after broad consultations, have also developed AmBisyon Natin 2040,
the long-term vision of the Philippines and will make this an anchor for development planning
across administrations, thereby ensuring sustainability of development initiatives. The authorities
have also initiated the groundwork for formulating the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022
taking into account the new administration’s socio-economic development agenda and long-term
vision.
Final Remarks
24.
The Philippines remains committed to continue implementing sound macroeconomic
policies and wide-ranging structural reforms to support the strong and sustained growth of the
economy and enable a durable reduction in unemployment and poverty. The authorities
appreciate the Fund’s support through training as well as technical assistance, particularly in
fiscal and monetary policies, public financial management, financial stability, and
macroeconomic and financial statistics. In this regard, the authorities continue to count on the
Fund’s support through policy advice and capacity building, tailored to the Philippines’ specific
needs and conditions.
