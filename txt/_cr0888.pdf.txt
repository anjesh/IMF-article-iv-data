Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with Belize
Approved by Ranjit Teja and G. Russell Kincaid
February 7, 2008

•

Outlook. Belize’s near-term macroeconomic prospects have improved, but significant
risks remain. Real GDP growth has been boosted by new oil discoveries, and inflation
remains low. The debt restructuring of 2007 has eased liquidity pressures on the budget
and external reserves.

•

Focus of consultation. The discussions centered on the prospects for continued financial
stability, focusing on policies to reduce Belize’s high fiscal and external vulnerability
over the medium term. The Belize dollar, pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1976, appears
to be in line with fundamentals and external stability is not under threat at present.
However, this year’s fiscal slippage and the envisaged introduction of a new petroleum
revenue management mechanism call for policy adjustments.

•

Key recommendations: (i) Fiscal adjustment should aim at halving debt/GDP ratios to
about 40 percent by 2019 when amortization of the restructured debt will begin falling
due; (ii) budgetary measures are needed to raise the FY 2008/09 primary surplus to
3½ percent of GDP; and (iii) reform of liquidity management should be undertaken.
These policies are broadly in line with the advice in the last Article IV consultation,
which was concluded in October 2006.

•

Data. Belize adheres to GDDS and data are generally adequate for surveillance.
However, the timeliness of key indicators is an issue and other weaknesses remain. For
example, public debt data are not complete, and net international investment position
statistics are not compiled due to financial and human resource capacity constraints,
making it difficult to apply key concepts behind the 2007 Surveillance Decision.

•

Discussions. During December 4–13, the team (P. Gajdeczka (Head), E. Boz and
M. Kandil (all WHD), and A. Palmason (PDR)) met with Prime Minister Musa, Finance
Secretary Waight, Central Bank of Belize (CBB) Governor Campbell, other officials,
and representatives of the private sector, labor unions and the political opposition.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Macroeconomic pressures and policy response since 2005. As a result of highly
expansionary macroeconomic policies during 1999–2004, in part in response to the damage
from two major hurricanes, external current accounts widened sharply, public debt soared,
and international reserves declined substantially. From 2005 on, the authorities took steps to
correct serious macroeconomic imbalances in the context of a “home-grown” adjustment
strategy. As a result, the primary balance improved from a small deficit in FY 2004/05 to a
surplus of 3 percent of GDP in FY 2005/06. However, the adjustment efforts were not
sufficient to bring the economy back onto a sustainable path, and, therefore, Belize engaged
with its external private creditors in 2006 to achieve a cooperative debt restructuring.
2.
Debt restructuring. A final agreement with creditors, completed in February 2007,
has opened the path to restoring fiscal and external sustainability. The nearly full
participation contributed to a 21 percent debt reduction in NPV terms and provided
significant liquidity relief for the government. Nevertheless, Belize’s debt burden remains
high (90 percent of GDP), external reserves are low, and sustained adjustment is needed.
3.
Role of the Fund. Although the Fund has not been a participant in the restructuring
process, the staff were in close contact with both the authorities and their creditors during
that period. The 2006 Article IV consultation provided an important input into the
formulation of an adjustment scenario that the authorities were preparing with their
financial advisors. In response to a request by the authorities, the Managing Director
provided on December 20, 2006 an assessment letter to the international financial
community.
4.
Elections. Elections are scheduled for February 7. The outgoing government,
headed by Prime Minister Musa for two five-year terms, has had an absolute majority in
Parliament. Important reforms have been initiated, but policy implementation also has been
complicated by political controversy over such issues as a government guarantee in the
health sector and contracts in the oil industry.

Box 1. Belize: Oil Management Fund
Petroleum was discovered in Belize in late 2005. Based on current discoveries, oil
production is expected to peak in 2007 at one million barrels (4 percent of GDP) and then
contract by about ten percent every year. Government oil revenue consists of a 10 percent tax
on gross sales, a 40 percent income tax, and royalties of 5 percent.
Last September, the Parliament approved the establishment of the Petroleum Revenue
Management Fund. Starting in FY 2008/09, gross government revenues from oil will be
invested in the fund and a fraction will be transferred to the budget based on “permanent
sustainable income.” The latter will be calculated as a real return on the sum of accumulated
oil savings and the present value of the projected stream of oil revenues until depletion,
capped at five percent. The fund cannot be used to finance current budgets nor pay external
debt. However, in exceptional circumstances, e.g., devastation caused by environmental
disasters, civil turmoil and acts of war, an amount in excess of the sustainable income may be
transferred to the budget.
The figure below illustrates the path of oil savings assuming a nominal interest rate equal to
an average of 6-month Libor in the last three years. Oil savings reach 8 percent of GDP in
2019. Assuming a higher interest on accumulated savings, e.g., a historical average rate of
return of the U.S. stock market (S&P 500) of 10½ percent, the stock of oil savings would
reach 10 percent of GDP in 2019.

profitability indicators do not point to
any major risks. One bank appears to be vulnerable due to reported losses and may need to
inject more capital in case of further deterioration.
10.
The near-term outlook remains broadly stable, despite some deterioration in
fiscal and external balances. For 2008, real GDP growth is projected to pick up,
notwithstanding the impact of stagnating oil output, and inflation is projected to ease. Under
unchanged fiscal policies, the primary surplus of the central government would decline,
mostly due to transfers to a new oil revenue management fund. The external current account
deficit is projected to remain unchanged, and with anticipated capital flows, international
reserves are expected to remain broadly stable.
III. POLICIES TO ENHANCE SUSTAINABILITY

11.
Macroeconomic policies should aim at bolstering fiscal and external
sustainability. The substantial debt relief granted by private creditors in early 2007 has
opened the way for a reduction in Belize’s vulnerabilities. Fiscal consolidation targeting
lower debt ratios, combined with higher reserves accumulation, is essential for regaining
market access and sustaining external stability over the medium term. The discussions
centered on external stability issues anchored by the 2007 Surveillance Decision, next year’s
budget and medium-term debt strategy, and structural reforms in the fiscal and monetary
areas.

A. External Stability Issues
12.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment that Belize’s exchange rate is
broadly in equilibrium and its external accounts not a source of instability at present.
The staff’s findings are based largely on the assessment of the exchange rate, as the absence
of IIP data limited the scope of the analysis of external stability as envisaged under the 2007
Surveillance Decision. The discussions focused on the following points:
•

The real effective exchange has been depreciating since 2000, in line with the
underlying fundamentals (Box 2). Model-based and indicators-based assessments
suggest that Belize’s real effective exchange rate is not far from its equilibrium level.

•

The underlying current account deficit (5¼ percent of GDP) does not appear to
be a threat to external stability at present. The projected deficits are substantially
lower than historical average (12 percent of GDP), and the banana and sugar
concessions under the Economic Partnership Agreement with the European Union are
expected to benefit Belize, which remains competitive in those sectors. Based on past
experience, the current global downturn is expected to have relatively limited impact
on tourism in Belize, which is largely a high-end niche market.

•

Available information on the structure of Belize’s capital and financial accounts
suggest a limited risk of external instability in the near term. Private capital inflows
are mostly foreign direct investment and the debt agreement provides a liquidity relief
over the next 11 years. The authorities noted that restrictions on capital outflows, which
they intend to maintain for now, shield against capital account volatility. They
recognized, however, that absent fiscal consolidation, central government borrowing
requirements may be difficult to cover beyond the next 3–4 years.

8

Box 2. Belize: Equilibrium Exchange Rate Assessment
Model-based approach suggests that the actual exchange rate is broadly in line with the
equilibrium rate. To determine the equilibrium real exchange rate, a Fundamentals Equilibrium Real
Exchange Rate (FEER) model was used. For tourism dependent economies, the fundamentals are
assumed to include productivity differentials, terms of trade for tourism, government consumption,
and net foreign assets. Two different samples are considered: Caribbean countries (The Bahamas,
Barbados, Belize, six ECCU countries, and Jamaica) and ECCU plus 16 tourism dependent countries
across the world.1

1/ 2007 figures are based on data for the first half of the year.

The staff's estimates suggest that the underlying current account deficit in 2007, if sustained,
would gradually reduce the external debt/GDP ratio. The underlying current account deficit in
2007 (5¼ percent of GDP) is larger than the one projected (4 percent of GDP) due to adjustments
mostly for temporarily low interest payments (-1½ percent of GDP), high oil exports (-2¼ percent of
GDP), and the impact of the hurricane Dean (+2½ percent of GDP). Also, according to the debt
sustainability analysis, debt/GDP ratios would stabilize after 2012 with a non-interest current account
deficit of 4¼ percent of GDP, compared with a 2½ percent of GDP surplus in the 2007 underlying
current account.
Indicators-based approach confirms this assessment. Four different real effective exchange rate
(REER) indices are considered: CPI-based, commodity competitor-based, tourism competitor-based,
and tourism customer-based. All of the indicators display a gradual depreciation trend in the last few
years due to a depreciating U.S. dollar. In 2006, the Belize’s real exchange rate appreciated somewhat
according to all indices except the commodity competitor-based index. Data based on the first half of
the year suggests continuation of the gradual depreciation in 2007.
The results need to be interpreted with caution. Small samples are used to determine long-run
equilibrium values, and the availability and quality of historical data are limited. The model-based
approaches are based on panel data which have the advantage of increasing efficiency, while
discounting Belize-specific factors to some extent.

Assessments” (IMF, 2006) to a group of tourism dependent countries by focusing on productivity differential and terms of

•

Data weaknesses, however, circumscribe the scope of the staff’s assessment of
stability. In particular, due to capacity constraints Belize does not compile IIP data,
which is required by the Fund’s Articles of Agreement—so far as the member has the
capacity to provide that information—and is important to the 2007 Surveillance
Decision framework, and the BIS reporting banks show US$1.7 billion claims on (and
US$6.4 billion liabilities to) the non-bank sector in Belize. The authorities stressed that
BIS reported claims are a multiple of Belize’s GDP and have no relation to operations
of banks registered in Belize. Regarding data quality, they noted that Belize participates
in GDDS and provides other key data required for surveillance, while agreeing that
timeliness of key indicators could be improved. However, severe financial and human
resource constraints prevent them from addressing other remaining weaknesses at this
point.

but with extensive capital account
restrictions. However, a review of standard indicators in the context of medium-term
scenarios suggests that Belize’s reserves should be increased. At three months of imports,
they would also meet other criteria such as public sector’s short-term debt and broad money
coverage. The authorities agreed that the proposed targets would provide a reasonable
external liquidity buffer and a source of income for the central bank.
B. Resuming Fiscal Consolidation
14.
Restoring fiscal discipline in the near term is essential. The authorities noted that
this year’s above-budget spending constitutes a temporary departure from Belize’s debt
strategy. For FY 2008/09, the staff recommended a primary surplus of 3½ percent of GDP,
consistent with a phased adjustment path over the medium term. This target can be achieved
by raising taxes or through expenditure restraint equivalent to 2 percent of GDP. For
example, the GST rate could be increased by 2 percentage points to 12 percent; even at this
new level, Belize’s rate would still be second lowest in the region. Alternatively, nominal
current expenditure could be reduced relative to this year’s level, and in subsequent years
increase at the inflation rate.
15.
The mission recommended a fiscal adjustment path that would halve the
debt/GDP ratio by 2019. By then, amortization of the restructured debt will begin falling
due raising gross financing requirements substantially, and without fiscal consolidation debt
dynamic remains unsustainable (Appendix II). The associated primary surplus in the central
government budget would need to increase to 4¾ percent of GDP by 2011, gradually
declining thereafter (Tables 5, 6, and 7). This strategy also assumes no recourse to

10
commercial external financing in the medium term. The objective is to bring debt ratios and
debt-service payments to levels consistent with market access on favorable terms and limited
rollover risk. Most emerging market countries with investment grade have external debt/GDP
ratio of 40 percent or less.
16.
The authorities recognized the importance of sustained fiscal consolidation. They
broadly agreed that Belize’s high public debt burden and vulnerable budget position
constitute a source of long-term risk to external stability and growth.
•

The fiscal position needs to be tightened, starting in FY 2008/09. The authorities
recognized that the introduction of the Petroleum Revenue Management Fund would
reduce government revenue by about 2 percent of GDP, and that on unchanged
policies, the primary balance in FY 2008/09 would be only 1½ percent of GDP. They
noted that there is scope for further improving tax administration, which they prefer
over tax increases. Higher GST rates could be a measure of last resort, and, even then,
part of a broader tax package that would reduce other taxes. However, specific
measures would be included in the final budget only after the elections.

•

The authorities welcomed the staff’s analysis of the medium-term debt strategy.
They agreed with the broad objective of reducing public debt ratios to levels consistent
with stronger bond ratings and market access on favorable terms. They recognized that
their fiscal policy over the medium term needs to be set accordingly, and that financing
constraints called for a front-loaded adjustment path. In this context, they agreed that a
debt management unit and a multiyear budget planning within a medium-term
framework would substantially help guide their policies.
C. Structural Reforms to Support Fiscal Management
17.
There was agreement that fiscal reforms need to advance more rapidly to
support the adjustment effort. The discussions focused on the following areas:

•

Oil fund. The authorities agreed to consider steps to introduce more flexibility into the
annual transfers to the budget, including through a legislative amendment if necessary
(see Box 1). They also committed to ensuring transparency and regular audits of
government revenue from petroleum production, and noted that equal terms and
stability of oil contracts will be maintained.

•

Revenue administration. The ongoing reforms seek to enhance the performance of
tax departments via streamlined organization, computerization and strengthened
management capacity. The authorities noted that enhanced computerization has
increased efficiency in tax collection, and, to strengthen it further, efforts are underway
to unify tax administration and increase coordination across various departments. They
will seek assistance from CARTAC to establish an audit module for the GST.

11
•

Public financial management. The authorities agreed that government guarantees to
public and private sector entities—which now correspond to 4¼ percent of GDP—
need to be transparent and subject to risk analysis to ensure their consistency with the
public sector’s debt strategy. They pointed out, however, that constraints on resources
and qualified staff limited progress in this area. They will draw on technical assistance
from Commonwealth Secretariat to strengthen the debt-servicing unit at the CBB.

•

Governance and accountability. The authorities recognized that the non-contributory
pension fund for public servants constitutes a growing liability for the budget, and that
if unresolved would pose a risk to their debt strategy. They would consider during the
next fiscal year, in consultation with social partners, a combination of new employee
contributions, increased retirement age, and restrained growth of benefits to establish
financial viability of the scheme. Regarding the audits of government financial
statements, they recognized that the Finance and Reform Act of 2005 needs to be
better enforced and that this would require both a greater independence of the relevant
institutions and broad support from the parliament.
D. Toward A More Flexible Liquidity Management Framework
18.
Domestic liquidity management should be reformed to enhance its effectiveness.
Reserve requirements are not well suited to managing seasonal changes in liquidity, and in
the longer run would be inadequate to support the needed international reserve buildup
(Figure 3). Also, such measures as a transfer of funds to the CBB last September by the SSB
cannot be relied on systematically, and the SSB has resumed accumulation of deposits in
commercial banks which offer more attractive returns.
19.
The mission recommended early introduction of market-based instruments of
liquidity management. This would involve removing ceilings on outstanding domestic
government securities and on interest rates, converting the CBB overdraft into marketable
domestic government securities, and converting all government securities to market-based
interest rates. Subsequently, liquidity requirements for commercial banks could be lowered.
According to staff simulations, the net fiscal cost of such a strategy would be small (Box 3).
The mission noted that such a reform would also help address some important distortions
prevalent in the financial system such as high spreads between deposit and lending rates and
near absence of an interbank market.
20.
The authorities welcomed the Fund’s support for improving liquidity
management. The CBB is concerned about the impact of rising liquidity in the banking
system on credit growth and a possible buildup of inflationary pressures. It was recognized
that at present the CBB may need to use the only tool at its disposal (reserve requirements) to
control domestic liquidity. The CBB noted, however, that it was eager to advance rapidly

12

Box 3. Belize: Key Features of the Monetary System
Belize’s dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, but capital controls leave some room for
independent monetary policy. However, the Central Bank of Belize (CBB) lacks effective marketbased instruments. Existing instruments for liquidity management include:
• Reserve requirements, currently set at 10 percent;
• Liquid asset requirements, set at 23 percent, including reserve requirements;
• Voluntary transfer of public institutions’ deposits from commercial banks to the CBB.
Two regulatory ceilings contribute to the rigidity of the monetary system:
• 100 million BZ dollar ceiling on outstanding T-bills, which led to the growing use of the
overdraft facility by the government.
• 3.25 percent ceiling on T-bill rates, rendering them unattractive to commercial banks as
evidenced by small portion of T-bills being held outside the Central Bank.
Belize’s banking system is characterized by high spreads between lending and deposit rates.
Historically, this spread has been high and stable at around 850 basis points. High unremunerated
reserve requirements and lending to government at below-market rates to meet liquid asset
requirements have constituted an implicit tax on the financial sector. Up to one fifth of the spread can
be explained by these requirements. Lack of competition and high operating costs are other factors
that might have contributed to wide spreads.
Belize’s monetary system has similar features to those of The Bahamas and Barbados. First,
capital controls leave some room for independent monetary policy in presence of pegged exchange
rates. Second, central banks currently rely on non-market instruments, such as credit ceilings, transfer
restrictions, and reserve requirements and interest rate controls. Finally, spreads between lending and
deposit rates have been relatively high, at around 900 basis points in The Bahamas and 580 basis
points in Barbados as of end-2006.
The fiscal cost of switching to market based instruments would be low. Switching to marketbased instruments is necessary to improve the effectiveness of monetary management. This will
involve removing the above-mentioned regulatory caps and switching from administrative to marketbased interest rates. Currently, about 70 percent of domestic government debt is held by the central
bank and interest paid on this debt contributes to its profits which are subsequently transferred to the
budget. As the central bank sells government securities in the market, its profits would fall while
interest payments by the government to commercial banks would increase. However, with a planned
buildup of foreign exchange reserves central bank’s profits will rise, largely offsetting other losses.
Based on staff calculations, under the active scenario, the net fiscal cost of such a reform would be
0.06 percent of GDP in 2008, while the net cost of reserve accumulation would peak at 0.20 percent
in 2017.

with the reform of monetary management mechanism. The authorities decided to develop an
action plan shortly, and welcomed continued technical assistance from the Fund in this area.
21.
The authorities continue enhancing the supervisory and regulatory framework
and are confident that Belize’s financial system is stable. The Credit Union Act has been
recently amended, and, in line with the 2003 Offshore Financial Center Assessment
recommendations, the amendments of the Banks and Financial Institutions Act and the
International Banking Act are being finalized and are expected to be submitted to parliament
in early 2008. The impact of Hurricane Dean on the banking sector has been small and
insurance companies experienced only small losses.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
22.
Belize’s near-term macroeconomic prospects have improved over the past year,
but significant risks remain. Economic growth was boosted by new oil discoveries and
strong exports, underpinned by favorable external conditions, and tighter macroeconomic
policies helped keep inflation under control. Looking ahead, the main risks to growth and
financial stability arise from fiscal challenges and a deterioration in the global outlook.
23.
Despite data limitations that constrain the analysis, the Belize dollar would
appear broadly in line with fundamentals, and the external accounts are not a threat to
external stability at present. The exchange rate peg has provided an important anchor for
macroeconomic policies and for expectations. The stability of the exchange regime, however,
depends crucially on full implementation of the medium-term fiscal strategy and substantial
reduction of the public debt burden.
24.
Progress in consolidating the public sector’s financial position needs to continue.
Over the past three years, central government budget deficits have been substantially
reduced, the winding down of the Development Finance Corporation has advanced as
envisaged, and net international reserves have recently stabilized at about one and a half
months of imports. However, this year budget performance has weakened, despite the
revenue boost from the General Sales Tax introduced in 2006 and from new oil production,
as well as the relief provided by the debt exchange concluded in early 2007.
25.
A front-loaded fiscal adjustment is necessary to demonstrate Belize’s
commitment to lowering the debt ratios and regaining market access. Consistent with
this goal, a primary surplus of 3½ percent of GDP should be targeted for the 2008/09 fiscal
year. This can be achieved either by tax measures or by restraining current expenditure. In
subsequent years, primary surpluses need to be further increased, for example, by limiting
growth on current expenditure to the rate of inflation. The authorities are encouraged to
reconsider the framework for managing oil revenues, to make it more flexible and better
integrated with their medium-term fiscal strategy.

14
26.
Over the medium term, fiscal strategy should aim at lowering debt ratios
substantially to reduce vulnerability to shocks. A reduced debt burden would also increase
the space for more public investment and for countercyclical fiscal policies in the face of
external shocks. Furthermore, lower debt ratios would ease access to market financing on
favorable terms, especially when maturities on the recently restructured debt begin falling
due and gross financing requirements will increase substantially. Fiscal policies aimed at
restoring sustainability are more likely to help mobilize new lending from bilateral and
multilateral sources.
27.
Rapid progress in fiscal structural reforms would support the adjustment effort.
Revenue collection should be strengthened by reorganizing it into a unified agency, and
enhanced computer systems applied to assessment, collection, and audit of taxes
administered by the departments. Regarding expenditure, a multi-year budget planning
process should be established and a debt management office set up to help guide the
authorities’ fiscal strategy. Also, rapid progress is needed in putting on a sound financial
footing the pension fund for public servants. Institutions empowered by the 2005 Finance
and Reform Act should complete audits of government financial statements going back to the
1990s as soon as possible. Finally, transparency of government revenue from petroleum
production needs to be strengthened and audits carried out regularly, and transparency of
contracts in the oil and other economic sectors maintained.
28.
The authorities’ liquidity management framework should be reformed to
enhance policy implementation. The staff welcomes the recent steps to control liquidity,
while noting the limitations of cash and liquid reserve requirements as instruments of
monetary control. The authorities are encouraged to develop an action plan for early
introduction of market-based instruments by drawing on technical assistance provided by the
Fund and on regional experience in this area. Regarding financial stability, continued
vigilance is warranted in monitoring the strength of individual institutions and ensuring that
their capital base remains adequate.
29.
Further improvements are needed in the coverage and timelines of data
provided to the Fund. Priorities include completing the coverage of public sector debt data
and compilation of net international investment statistics.
30.
The next Article IV consultation is expected to be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Table 5. Belize: Summary of Macroeconomic Scenarios
________________________________________________________________________________
For the analysis of the medium-term prospects under different policy assumptions, staff prepared two
macroeconomic scenarios through 2020. A baseline scenario assumes broad continuation of present
policies, while an active policy scenario is based on a front-loaded fiscal adjustment and a larger
primary surplus in the central government budget.
There are a number of assumptions common in both scenarios. In particular, the assumptions about
the production and fiscal revenue from oil and about consumer price inflation and GDP deflator past
2008 are common.
Baseline Scenario
The main assumption is regarding the unchanged policy stance from the projected outcome for the
present fiscal year. Because of the associated external and fiscal uncertainties and the need to borrow
on expensive commercial terms, it is assumed that there will be a declining level of multilateral lending
and bilateral grants, and that investment levels would be such that economic growth would remain
low.
•

Real GDP growth—to remain around 2½ percent.

•

Fiscal policy—primary surplus in the central government budget to remain unchanged from this
year at 1.5 percent of GDP. It is calculated as this year’s non-oil primary surplus plus sustainable
oil revenue from the petroleum management fund (slightly less than one half percent of GDP per
year).

•

Reserve accumulation—given the high level of external borrowing, reserves are projected to
remain at about 1½ months of imports.

Active Scenario
This scenario essentially emulates the projection included in the 2006 Article IV staff report. It
assumes a front-loaded fiscal adjustment which tapers off over time as debt ratios decline. The main
difference is in the assumed level of oil revenues, which are now limited to about one-half percent of
GDP, compared to nearly 2 percent of GDP in 2007–09 assumed last year. Policy adjustment is
assumed to foster confidence and larger financing from international financial institutions and bilateral
donors, allowing for higher investment and growth.
•

Real GDP growth—to gradually increase to 3¾ percent. Real growth would be lower in 2008
relative to passive scenario reflecting the impact of GST increase on domestic consumption (and
rising inflation). Subsequently, growth picks up with higher investment.

•

Fiscal policy—primary surplus in the central government budget to increase from 3½ percent of
GDP in FY 2008/09 to peak at 4¾ percent of GDP by 2011. The adjustment is based on initial tax
measures and sustained current expenditure restraint.

•

Reserve accumulation—tighter policies and larger capital inflows would enable a more
ambitious reserve build-up, to above 3 months of imports by 2016.

APPENDIX I. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF APPENDICES
Discussions. The 2007 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Belize during
December 4–13, 2007. The mission met with Prime Minister Musa, Finance Secretary
Waight, Central Bank of Belize (CBB) Governor Campbell, other government officials and
representatives of the private sector, labor unions and the political opposition. The staff team
comprised P. Gajdeczka (Head), E. Boz and M. Kandil (WHD) and A. Palmason (PDR).
Ms. Y. Alvarez (OED) joined the team for the final discussions.
Exchange Arrangement. Belize has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4 and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for
current transactions. The Belize dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at BZ$2=US$1
since 1976.
Fund Relations. Belize has no outstanding purchases or loans. The last financial
arrangement was a Stand-by Arrangement for the period 12/03/84 to 05/31/86 totaling
SDR$7.13 million, fully drawn.
Technical Assistance.
•
A MCM mission visited Belize during December 4–15, 2006 to design monetary
policy instruments.
•
A FAD mission visited Belize during February 6–20, 2007 to review domestic tax
and custom systems; and provide advice on revenue administration.
•
A multi-sector mission visited Belize during February 21–March 7, 2007 to assess the
quality of macroeconomic statistics. A follow-up mission visited Belize during
August 15–26 to provide technical assistance on national account statistics.
Relations with the World Bank Group. A five-year Country Assistance Strategy was
completed for Belize in August 2000 (Report No. 20708-BEL), which identified only modest
project assistance. Currently, the World Bank has no active projects in Belize.
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The 2004–08 Country
Strategy, approved in September 2004, aims at assisting Belize in its transition towards
private sector-led growth. In December 2006, IDB approved US$25 million in Policy-Based
Loan (PBL), which has been fully disbursed. Currently, IDB is preparing a range of sector
studies that will inform a policy dialogue paper and a new country strategy for 2008–12.
Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). In December 2006, CDB
approved US$25 million in Policy-Based Loan, of which the first tranche was disbursed in
August 2007. The PBL is part of a broader assistance strategy for Belize that aims at
addressing fiscal and external imbalances and undertakes critical investment in social and
economic infrastructure.

APPENDIX II. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Results of an updated Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) are in line with those of
the 2006 Article IV consultation report. Minor differences arise from revisions to
historical data and lower than previously assumed interest rates as a result of the debt
exchange.
A. Key Assumptions
Two modifications were made to the standard DSA template on account of Belize
specific factors:
•

•

Interest rate fed into the calculation of the debt stabilizing primary surplus: With the
step-up structure of the exchanged debt, the last increase in the interest rate is
scheduled to take place in 2013 (a jump from 6 to 8.5 percent). To capture this jump
going forward, 2013 interest rate figures were used instead of 2012 in the standard
template.
Unchanged policy scenario: Due to the reduction in primary surplus resulting from
oil savings starting in FY 2008/09, the primary surplus under unchanged policies was
assumed to be the 2008 level instead of 2007.

Both scenarios assume:
•

•

•
•

Public sector debt includes the central government, publicly guaranteed external debt,
and other public sector external debt, and contingent liabilities including Belize
Electricity, Development Finance Corporation, Port of Belize, and Universal Health
Services.
Future central government liabilities to a pension plan for public officers are not
included. According to the most recent actuarial evaluation (2004), the present value
of obligations from pensions already being paid and future obligation for the
currently active staff was about 20 percent of GDP.
External debt is on a gross basis, while domestic debt is on a net basis.
Multilateral and bilateral borrowing takes place at LIBOR plus 100 basis points
spread.

Baseline scenario assumes:
•
•

Multilateral and domestic debt stocks are constant.
Financing requirements are covered by external commercial creditors at market
interest rates (the average of the last three years of the six-month libor plus 400 basis
points of country spread).

31

Active scenario assumes:
•
•

Enough multilateral financing will be available to meet financing requirements.
Debt to the multilaterals will trend upwards until 2018, and thereafter part of the
financing needs will be met commercially.
B. Assessment

Under the baseline scenario, debt is unsustainable in the long-run. Although this scenario
suggests a downward trend in the period covered by DSA, debt ratios get back on an
increasing trend starting from 2013, reaching 89.5 percent in 2019. (See Table 7a.) The
initial decline in debt ratios is due to lower interest payments on the exchanged debt and
when this interest rate climbs to 8.5 percent in 2013, the debt trajectory becomes
unsustainable. The accumulated savings in the oil fund reach 7 percent of GDP by 2012. This
implies lower debt ratios in net terms (77 percent in 2012), although, does not change the
overall debt trajectory.
Bounds tests reveal that the debt trajectory can change dramatically in response to
standard shocks. For example, debt ratios are particularly sensitive to the depreciation
shock given that 81 percentage points of the total public debt is denominated in foreign
currency in 2007. In response to this shock, the total debt ratio would increase to 127 percent
on impact and follow a similar trajectory to that of baseline. Government liabilities to the
pension fund can be thought of as a contingent stream of payments that would reduce
primary balances which would increase the debt ratios and could potentially put the debt
trajectory in an unsustainable path.
Under the active scenario, total debt ratios decline gradually to 66 percent by 2012 and
to 40 percent by 2019. The fiscal adjustment and the availability of multilateral financing at
favorable terms are the driving factors. Bound tests reveal reduced vulnerability to shocks
compared to the passive scenario.
Compared to the 2006 Article IV consultation report, both scenarios display somewhat
lower debt ratios. The current baseline scenario predicts lower debt ratios and lower debtstabilizing primary balance compared to those of last year’s, largely due to reduced interest
payments after the debt exchange. However, similar to last year’s assessment, high
vulnerability to standard shocks remains. In the active scenario, which envisages a fiscal
adjustment comparable to last year’s, vulnerability to shocks is reduced, reflecting lower than
previously assumed interest rates as a result of the debt exchange.

1/ Public sector debt includes central government, publicly guaranteed external debt, anectodal external public debt and other public sector external debt. External debt is on a gross basis, while domestic debt is
on a net basis.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency denominated
debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.

Since 1976, the Belize dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at
the rate of BZ$2 per U.S. dollar. Belize does not maintain exchange restrictions or multiple
currency practices. The central bank has not engaged in selective sales or rationing of foreign
exchange to the private sector since 2004, and there does not appear to be an unsatisfied
foreign exchange demand for commercial banks.

III. Economic and Sector Work
The 2004–08 IDB-Country Strategy with Belize, approved in September 2004, aims at
assisting the country in its transition towards private sector-led growth. Accordingly, the
Bank’s strategy focuses on one major objective: “support private sector-led growth.” The
IDB is currently preparing a range of sector studies that will inform a policy dialogue paper
and a new country strategy for 2008–2012.

7
The Belize authorities have been making significant effort to address the difficult fiscal and
debt consequences that have resulted from the expansionary policies of recent years. In
May 2006, the Government of Belize (GOBZ) requested a Policy Based Loan (PBL) of
twenty-five million United States dollars (USD25 mn) from the Caribbean Development
Bank (CDB) together with technical assistance (TA) support by way of additional loan and
grants to assist in ensuring the success and sustainability of fundamental fiscal and structural
reform measures which are being implemented. This request was approved by the CDB in
December 2006 and the first disbursement was made in August 2007. The PBL is part of a
broader assistance strategy by CDB for Belize. The strategy recognizes that the continuation
of the fiscal and external imbalances will affect Belize’s ability to undertake critical
investments in social and economic infrastructure. The PBL is intended to help GOBZ close
the fiscal and external financing gaps over the short to medium term, while it continues to
implement corrective measures, including the restructuring of its debt, the reform of its tax
regime and the strengthening of its fiscal management capacity. In December 2006, the CDB
also approved a loan of USD$12.6mn to Belize for the upgrade the Placencia road which was
appraised to have significant social and economic benefits. Technical assistance (TA) was
also approved by the CDB to Belize to help ensure the success of its adjustment efforts. Such
assistance includes a TA loan for the modernization of the Customs and Excise Department,
and TA grants of USD101,200 each, for the modernization of financial regulations, and to
assist Belize to establish an appropriate institutional framework for macro-economic
management.

Appendix V. Belize––Statistical Issues
While data provision for surveillance purposes is still adequate overall, staff’s analysis was
affected by shortcomings in certain areas. The July 2007 report by the multisector statistics
mission drew attention to shortcomings in national accounts, prices, balance of payments,
external debt, government finance, and labor statistics. In particular, the lack of data on the
International Investment Position (IIP) limited the scope of the staff’s assessment of stability.
The Central Bank of Belize publishes, in irregular intervals, a quarterly bulletin covering
developments in the real, fiscal, monetary, and external sectors, as well as an annual report
and a statistical digest. The country has participated in the GDDS since September 27, 2006.
Real sector
A new national accounts system has been phased-in. Under the new system, national
accounts at constant and current prices also are produced quarterly, instead of just annually.
The base year for the compilation of national accounts has moved from 1984 to 2000, with
consequent improvement of estimates at constant and current prices. Priorities for the period
ahead include establishing a national accounts user advisory committee, updating the
SNAPC-Belize application to take account of changes in the structure of the economy,
modifying the concept of government industrial activity in conformity with the guidelines in
the 1993 SNA, rebasing the national accounts to 2006 (including electricity imports in the
merchandise trade statistics), conducting a survey of activity in the Commercial Free Zone,
disaggregating the imports of the Export Processing Zone, undertaking an inventory of data
sources for national accounts, updating the Register of Establishments, annotating all GDP
tables to distinguish the various revision stages, and collecting data on informal sector
activity.
The CPI market basket is based on a household expenditure survey that was conducted
between June 1990 and March 1991 and needs to be updated. The CPI is calculated only four
times a year (February, May, August, and November), with a lag of about three months,
Labor market statistics are scarce and available at irregular intervals. Priorities include
allocating additional staff to compile the CPI, establishing a CPI advisory committee to
advise on the nature and purpose of the index, revising the procedures for collecting prices
for perishable goods, undertaking the new Household Income and Expenditure Survey,
improving the timeliness of the index, compiling a monthly CPI in accordance with
international best practice, publishing the CPI weights, streamlining the price collection
instruments, developing and disseminating a schedule for releasing the CPI, improving
metadata, and developing procedures for taking account of quality change.
Fiscal accounts
Classification of expenditure into current and capital does not conform to international
standards. The resumption of reporting annual data for the Government Finance Statistics

9
Yearbook and sub-annual data for the International Financial statistics is highly
recommended. The most recently reported annual data were for 1997.
Priorities include preparing a comprehensive list of institutions that comprise the central
government, general government, and the public sector; evaluating each statutory body to
determine its proper sectorization; compiling GFS for the social security fund; including the
social security fund and the extra budgetary units in the coverage of public sector debt data;
and treating all government transactions in accordance with the guidelines of the
GFSM 1986. Also, it would be important to audit the annual financial statements for the
budgetary central government are audited in a timely manner; disseminate the statistics for
central government aggregates and debt in accordance with the GDDS recommendations;
and publish the available monthly data on budgetary central government revenue,
expenditure and financing. Additionally, other needed improvements include reporting the
monthly detailed data on revenues, expenditure, and financing for publication in the IFS and
the GFSY; introducing a website link to the posted GDDS data; identifying the prior access
to fiscal statistics in the GDDS; developing a migration path to adopt the GFSM 2001
methodology; identifying the institutional coverage of GFS tables; compiling GFS for extra
budgetary units, consolidated central government, consolidated general government and
consolidated public sector; compiling and disseminating GFS tables; including a five to ten
year time-series for annual GFS data in publications; and including contact details in
publications.
Monetary accounts
Monetary data are reported to STA and WHD on a timely fashion. The authorities
implemented the Standardized Report Forms and data have been reported in this format since
January 2006. However, the coverage of monetary data is incomplete as it includes only the
accounts of the central bank and commercial banks; other depository corporations, including
credit unions are not included. Contrary to methodological recommendations, interest
accruals are included in other assets or other liabilities, rather than classified along with the
underlying instruments. In addition, unclassified assets and liabilities are large.
Priorities for the period ahead include revising the data to include the accounts of
commercial banks and the six largest credit unions; classifying international offshore banks
as part of other financial corporations sub sector; sectorizing the Social Security Board as
part of the general government; establishing an integrated monetary base; and establishing
data sharing procedure between the CBB and the Supervisor of Insurance.
Balance of payments
The compilation of balance of payments is based on the fifth edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual (BPM5). The transition to BPM5 was completed in 2004. In addition, the
authorities are refining the process for collecting relevant data that will enable regular

10
presentation of quarterly balance of payments statistics. As for the coverage, timeliness and
reporting of data for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) and in the
Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY), quarterly data on balance of payments
statistics have been reported, albeit with a considerable lag. International Investment Position
(IIP) Statistics are not compiled. A multisector statistics mission (February 21–
March 7, 2007) made recommendations to improve and expand the compilation and
dissemination of external sector statistics. There is a need for additional staff and relevant
training (e.g., courses on BOP, international investment position, and external debt).
External debt
There are discrepancies between the data reported by the central bank and those reported by
the ministry of finance, particularly with respect to gross external disbursements of the
central government. In addition, the data reported by the central bank and the ministry of
finance on the external debt of the public enterprises are incomplete and inconsistent with the
information provided by the public enterprises. The authorities are seeking to reduce the
discrepancies and inconsistencies by fostering greater cooperation among the agencies
involved. An effort to develop a database for private sector debt is under way.
Development Finance Corporation
The accounts of the DFC, which is a major instrument of the government’s economic policy,
are not well integrated into monetary or fiscal accounts. Priorities include recording the
financial support provided by the government to DFC in recent years; recording the loans to
DFC locked by mortgage securities as debt; compiling a consolidated sectoral balance sheet
for insurance companies and the Belize mutual fund; and renewing efforts to collect balance
sheet data from the DFC.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Belize
On February 22, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Belize.1
Background
Following an upturn in 2006, economic growth weakened in 2007, reflecting the impact of
Hurricane Dean on agricultural output and tourism, closures in garment and aquaculture
industries, and a leveling off in oil production. However, inflation remained low at 3 percent, and
international reserves increased further, to US$108 million by end-2007.
The debt restructuring agreement in February 2007 provided significant liquidity relief for the
government and has opened the path toward restoring fiscal and external stability. The nearly
full participation contributed to a 21 percent debt reduction in net present value terms and
provided significant liquidity relief for the government. Nevertheless, Belize’s debt burden
remains large, external reserves are relatively low, and the fiscal position is vulnerable.
The overall budget deficit for the 2007/08 fiscal year is projected at 2 percent of GDP,
significantly above the original target. Although revenues have been boosted by the successful
implementation of the General Sales Tax, expenditures are also expected to exceed the
originally approved budget, and the primary surplus is projected to fall short of the approved
budgetary target by 1 percent of GDP. Starting in FY 2008/09 (April to March) oil revenue will be
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

transferred to the petroleum management fund. Under the new rules, transfers to the budget will
be limited to only real returns on the present value of oil savings, resulting in a loss of current
revenue of about 2 percent of GDP next year.
Regarding structural reforms, progress has been made in consolidating the operations of the
Development Finance Corporation, in computerizing the revenue departments, and
strengthening government revenue departments. However, several important structural issues
are yet to be addressed, such as establishing a sound funding scheme for the National Health
Insurance and the pension fund for public servants.
Belize’s near-term macroeconomic outlook is broadly favorable, despite some deterioration in
fiscal and external balances. For 2008, real GDP growth is projected to pick up and inflation is
projected to ease. Under unchanged fiscal policies, and following the implementation of the new
oil revenue management fund, the primary surplus of the central government would decline to
1.5 percent of GDP. The external current account deficit is projected to be about 4 percent of
GDP, although with anticipated capital flows, international reserves are expected to remain
broadly unchanged.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the improvement in Belize’s near-term macroeconomic
prospects, with economic growth being boosted by oil discoveries and inflation expected to
remain low. Progress has also been made on structural reforms, and the debt restructuring
agreement, completed in February 2007, has opened the path to restoring fiscal and external
sustainability. Directors nevertheless noted that significant challenges remain. In particular,
continued consolidation of public sector finances and fiscal reforms will be needed to address
risks to Belize’s growth and financial stability, including those associated with a deterioration in
the global outlook.
Directors agreed that Belize’s exchange rate peg provides an important anchor for
macroeconomic policies and expectations. They noted the assessment that the exchange rate
appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals, while recognizing that data limitations constrain
exchange rate analysis. Directors stressed that, going forward, the stability of the exchange
regime will be buttressed by the implementation of a medium-term fiscal strategy that
substantially reduces the public debt burden. A further buildup in international reserves would
also enhance external stability.
Directors welcomed the new Belize authorities’ commitment to fiscal discipline, and encouraged
a front-loaded adjustment that would reverse the recent weakening of budget performance and
send a clear signal on their intention to lower the public debt ratio. They observed that a fiscal
adjustment aimed at sustaining increased primary surpluses over the medium-term would
reduce fiscal and external vulnerabilities, and provide space for increased public investment and
countercyclical economic policies in the face of external shocks. Lower debt ratios would also

3
improve access to market financing on favorable terms. Directors welcomed the authorities’
intention to review the framework for managing oil revenues, with the objective of increasing its
flexibility and better integrating it with the medium-term fiscal strategy.
Directors viewed that fiscal structural reforms would contribute importantly to strengthening
revenue collection and enhancing the quality of spending. Reorganization of revenue collection
into a unified agency and computerization of tax administration would improve revenue
collection, while the establishment of a multi-year budget planning process and a debt
management office would support more efficient fiscal planning. Directors underscored the
importance of putting the pension fund for public servants on a solid footing to assure sound
finances. Timely audits of government financial statements and the maintenance of transparent
accounting for government revenue from petroleum production, and of contracts in the oil and
other economic sectors will also contribute importantly to this effort.
Directors considered that the introduction of market-based monetary policy instruments would
improve the efficiency of domestic liquidity management. They noted that the effectiveness of
the cash and liquid reserve requirements currently used as instruments of monetary control is
limited. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to advance with monetary reform and
looked forward to the development of an action plan, drawing on Fund technical assistance and
on regional experience. Directors advised continued vigilance in monitoring the strength of
financial institutions.
Directors encouraged further improvements in the coverage and timeliness of data provided to
the Fund for surveillance.
