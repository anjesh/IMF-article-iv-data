Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with Mongolia
Approved by Daniel Citrin and Carlos Muñiz
September 1, 2005

This report is based on discussions held in Ulaanbaatar during June 14–24, 2005. The
team comprised Messrs. Carter (Head), Kronenberg, D’Hoore, Lee (all APD), and
Messrs. Cakir (FAD) and Kikuchi (PDR). Mr. Lee (Advisor, OED) also took part in
discussions. The team, which was assisted by Ms. Rehm, Resident Representative,
collaborated with overlapping MFD technical assistance and World Bank missions. Attached
also is a joint World Bank-IMF staff Debt Sustainability Analysis. The authorities’ Progress
Report on their Economic Growth Support and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EGSPRS) will
be issued separately, along with the associated Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN).
The team met Prime Minister Elbegdorj, Deputy Prime Minister Ulaan, Minister of
Finance Altanhuyag, Minister of Energy Ochir-Huu, Bank of Mongolia Governor
Chuluunbat, other senior officials; and with business, donor agencies, and financial sector
representatives.
The last Article IV Consultation was concluded on October 2002. Directors considered
that, despite achievements in its transition to a market-based system, Mongolia faced
daunting challenges in its efforts to promote robust growth, reduce poverty, and achieve
fiscal and debt sustainability. They noted that these challenges had been exacerbated by a
weather-related slowdown in output growth during 2000-01. In this context, Directors urged
the authorities to resist pressures on spending that would threaten to undermine the prospects
for sustainable, pro-poor growth.
Mongolia maintains a floating exchange rate regime and an exchange system free of
restrictions on current international transactions.
Data provided to the Fund are adequate for surveillance purposes. There remains room
for improvement in the quality and timeliness of balance of payments data, whereas
significant revisions to annual fiscal data that do not give rise to retroactive monthly
imputations complicate economic analysis of fiscal developments.

Executive Summary
Mongolia has experienced two years of unusually rapid economic expansion, benefiting
from good weather and high world mineral prices. Growth prospects should continue to be
robust in the medium term, settling around at least 5 percent from 2005 onward. Although
this growth has likely contributed to some reduction in the high level of income poverty,
measured at 36 percent in 2002, the challenge remains to make significant progress to
achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In the longer term, Mongolia’s public debt,
although large in nominal terms, is seen as highly concessional and sustainable with prudent
macroeconomic policies but vulnerable to large terms of trade shocks.
Despite generally adequate macroeconomic policies, inflationary pressures accelerated
from mid-2004 as fuel and food prices shot up. Prices continued to increase sharply in
2005 as the Bank of Mongolia failed to tighten the monetary stance. To avoid inflationary
expectations increasing, the Bank of Mongolia needs to address promptly high credit growth.
Fiscal performance was good in 2004, with excellent prospects for 2005. Large revenue
receipts reflected overall economic growth as well as higher-than-expected prices for copper
and volume for gold. Strong revenue performance so far in 2005 suggests that the deficit
could remain at its 2004 level, more than one percent of GDP below the budget target. For
future years, it is important that fiscal policy focus on tax reforms that make the system
simpler and more efficient, while making further improvements in public expenditure
allocation and financial management.
Further action to improve the health of the financial system and the strength of the
central bank is essential, building on the progress made in recent years. There is concern
that the high credit growth may mask the underlying fragility of some banks’ positions and
the problems of regulatory forbearance. The authorities are encouraged to resolve the capital
weakness of the BOM and improve the decision-making structure, with enhanced oversight.
Restructuring of public enterprises should remain an important priority. This can be
achieved through both improving the governance of enterprises intended to remain in the
public sector as well as resuming the privatization program. In particular, the authorities are
encouraged to continue their plans to revamp operations in the vital energy sector.
The recent PRGF arrangement lapsed in July 2005, without the completion of the third
and subsequent reviews. Aided by the strong economic performance, most of the quantitative
targets set in 2003 were met and some progress made on the structural agenda. However,
governance concerns emerged that the authorities recognize will need to be addressed so that
strong support can be given by Mongolia’s development partners to assist in the
government’s growth and poverty reduction strategy.
Mongolia’s commitment to an open trading system needs to be maintained to benefit
from strong regional growth.

I.

BACKGROUND, DEVELOPMENTS, AND OUTLOOK
A. Background

1.
Discussions on the 2005 Article IV Consultation took place against the backdrop
of two years of unusually rapid economic expansion, spurred by the confluence of
favorable domestic and external factors, mainly good weather and unusually high world
prices for copper and gold. Real GDP growth exceeded 10½ percent in 2004, and should
continue to be robust, easing to 5 percent in 2005. Despite generally adequate
macroeconomic policies, including a firm fiscal stance, inflationary pressures have not been
aggressively addressed since they started to accelerate in mid-2004.
2.
The political situation remains in flux. Consensus building within the grand
coalition that emerged from the June 2004 parliamentary elections has proven difficult. It has
been further tested in a parliamentary by-election that was precipitated by the election to the
presidency, a largely ceremonial post, of former Speaker and Prime Minister Enkhbayar, of
the Mongolian People’s Revolutionary Party (MPRP). There is much public speculation
about possible government changes and a rearrangement of the coalition itself. In this
uncertain political context, the pace of economic reforms has slowed considerably, although
fiscal management has so far remained firmly under control.
3.
Mongolia remains a poor country facing significant challenges. Poverty incidence
remains high, measured at 36 percent in a 2002–03 household survey (Annex I). While the
high growth in the last two years has likely contributed to a reduction in poverty, sustaining
those gains may be difficult as the external environment weakens in the medium term. Harsh
weather remains a threat to the livestock sector, upon which much of the population still
depends. Looking further, the challenges of poverty reduction are daunting. With a territory
of 1.6 million km² landlocked between Russia and China, a harsh climate, underdeveloped
infrastructure, and low population density, it will be difficult to leverage favorable mining
prospects to tackle poverty through broad-based growth and job creation.
4.
The current PRGF arrangement, originally approved in September 2001, lapsed
in July 2005, without the completion of the third and subsequent reviews. Aided by the
strong economic performance in the past 2 years, most of the quantitative targets set at the
time of the combined First and Second Review, September 2003, were met and progress
made on the structural agenda (Tables 7 and 8). However, serious governance concerns
emerged, especially those stemming from issues related to central bank procedures and the
lack of information on transactions related to the end-2003 settlement of the pre-1991 debt to
Russia (Box 1). The accompanying Ex Post Assessment examines Mongolia’s achievement
under this and previous programs, and draws lessons for future Fund involvement.1

Mongolia: Ex-Post Assessment of Longer-Term Program Engagement.

-6Box 1. The Settlement of Pre-1991 Transferable Ruble Debts to Russia
The overhang of Mongolia’s pre-1991 transferable ruble (TR) debt to Russia had been a longstanding issue between the
two countries. Fund staff had encouraged the authorities to resolve the issue in a manner compatible with Mongolia’s fiscal and
debt sustainability objectives. Given the uncertainty on timing and possible terms for such a resolution, the TR debt was excluded
from the staff’s external debt estimates and projections in the context of Fund-supported programs. However, the staff’s debt
sustainability analysis for the 2002 Article IV consultation contained some scenarios, which showed that Mongolia would need to
secure highly favorable terms on the settlement of this debt to ensure that its overall debt burden would not rise to unsustainable
levels (Country Report 02/252, Annex III).

cancellation of the entirety of the TR debt
(principal and outstanding interest), yielding the equivalent of a 97.8 percent discount on the notional stock of debt.

The debt settlement with Russia compares favorably in NPV terms with similar deals. While cross-country comparisons are
fraught with difficulties, the discount applied to Mongolia’s TR debt was significantly higher than the rate effectively applied in
the case of Vietnam, and was broadly in line with debt relief that was originally to be received by Nicaragua.
The transactions temporarily weakened Mongolia’s macroeconomic position. The government had recourse to short-term
borrowing from private domestic and external sources, increasing short term financial vulnerability. The government issued dollardenominated one-year treasury bills (T-bills) to a foreign mining company, Ivanhoe Mines, (US$50 million) and local currency
short-term bills to a domestic private bank ($25 million, 6 to 10 month maturities). An additional $13 million was collected
through an advanced settlement of taxes due from Erdenet, a large 51/49 percent government/Russian joint venture copper mining
company, and $25 million represented a draw-down from the government’s own deposits at the central bank. The rest involved the
use of official reserves, financed by a loan from the central bank. With a sharp improvement in the external position, mainly on
account of booming copper and gold prices, the impact of this borrowing was absorbed relatively easily. Official reserves rose
from $178 million at end-2003 to $205 million at end-2004, despite the repayment of $50 million to Ivanhoe Mines.
The financing resulted in losses for the BOM. The government contracted from the BOM a 10-year, interest-free, $100 million
loan and a $37 million, interest-free, short-term loan. This large recourse to BOM financing was highlighted in the 2003 and 2004
BOM external audit reports as violating the Central Bank Law and weakening the BOM’s income position. Later Parliament
approved the payment of one percent annual interest on the 10-year loan.
The nontransparent aspects of the settlement, coupled with a lack of adequate information on the ultimate disposition of
funds paid by Mongolia, have heightened concerns about governance. The Czech intermediary signed separate, confidential
side-agreements with the Mongolian and Russian governments. Moreover, the negotiations also encompassed debts incurred by
Mongolia to finance its equity stake in two major Mongolian-Russian joint ventures. The debt balance of one of these companies
was to be written off soon after the signing of a new intergovernmental agreement between Mongolia and Russia, but no
information is known of the signing. Finally, the Mongolian authorities have so far been unable to provide full information on the
final structure of the debt deal and related agreements, including with respect to the form and terms of the final payment. Thus, the
actual disposition of Mongolia’s public funds remains in doubt. Facing increasing awareness of the issue, a parliamentary
committee was established in early 2005 to investigate the settlement. The committee comprised 15 leading figures of all the main
political parties. The report concluded: (i) $250 million was paid as required by Russians through Czech intermediary as a
negotiated settlement (ii) the use of such an intermediary was common in other settlements of transferable ruble debt and no fee
was paid by Mongolia to that intermediary, (iii) all debt now confirmed extinguished (iv) there is no evidence of malfeasance and
(v) further information is not available. Thus, the commission’s report officially endorses a consensus that the deal is no longer an
issue.

-7-

5.
The World Bank, Asian Development Bank (AsDB) and bilateral donors,
particularly Japan, are active. Gross official aid flows, grants and concessional loans, were
equivalent to about 14 percent of GDP in 2004, and should continue to grow. The World
Bank’s programs focus on civil service reform, public financial management and
governance, the legal framework for the mining sector, and the energy and financial sectors.
The AsDB is currently developing a new strategy for Mongolia, expected to be completed by
late 2005, that would support economic growth, the poor’s access to public services, and
improved governance. Mongolia is eligible for assistance under the U.S. Millennium
Challenge Account and the authorities have been working to identify qualifying projects.
B. Recent Developments
6.
Overall economic performance was stronger than expected and broad based
in 2004 and early 2005. Contributions to high growth included a rebound in the livestock
sector from harsh winter shocks of 2000–01 (the “dzuds”) and strong mining exploration and
exports, boosted by a favorable environment of unusually high copper and gold prices
(Box 2). There was also strong foreign direct investment in mineral exploration, growth in
services, particularly tourism and transit trade between neighboring Russia and China.
7.
After several years of moderation, however, inflation has accelerated from mid2004. Triggered by supply-side shocks, namely the pass-through of higher world oil prices,
changes in sanitary regulations which pushed up the price of meat, and price adjustments in
utilities, headline inflation rose into double digits in late 2004 while the authorities’ measure
of core inflation increased to 8–9 percent (Figure 1).2 Monetary policy since the latter
months of 2004 has accommodated the direct and second round effects of the supply shocks;
accordingly, headline inflation reached 15¾ percent through July 2005, although the core
inflation rate has increased only slightly.
8.
Fiscal performance was good in 2004, with excellent prospects for 2005. Strong
revenue receipts reflected overall economic growth as well as higher-than-expected prices
for copper and volume for gold.3 Control over domestically financed expenditure was
broadly appropriate, along the lines of the previous government’s 2000–04 Action Plan,
although the 2004 budget included large increases in civil service pay and in pensions. The
lowest overall deficit since the beginning of transition, about 2 percent of GDP, allowed a
notable decrease in indebtedness. For 2005, the budget targeted a widening in the overall
deficit to about 3½ percent of GDP, reflecting a new assistance program for poor families
with children, much scaled back from original proposals but still at a cost of about 1 percent
of GDP. Strong revenue performance so far in 2005, with receipts 22 percent above the first
seven months of 2004, suggests that, if spending discipline is maintained, the deficit could
2

The core inflation index excludes meat, milk, and vegetables. The latter categories’ weight
in the CPI basket, however, is close to 22½ percent. According to research by the BOM, the
core index, while being much more stable, seems to underestimate inflation trends a little.

3

Minerals-related revenues amounted to about 10 percent of the total in 2004. Their sharply
higher than trend prices contributed about 2 percent of GDP to revenue in that year.

-8-

Box 2: The Impact of Copper on the Economy
Copper has long been one of Mongolia’s economic pillars. In 2004, copper exports contributed 21.5 percent
to Mongolia’s GDP. During the same year, the copper sector accounted for 8.9 percent of government total
revenues. This number is expected to increase to 10.5 percent in 2005, due to significant dividends collected
from Erdenet, Mongolia’s major mining corporation.
However, the share of copper in Mongolia’s total
exports is in decline. The share has decreased from
54.1 percent in 1994 to 36.2 percent in 2004. Other
export items, prominently gold and garments, have
taken over copper’s share and driven up the total
exports.1 Gold’s share has jumped from 3.1 percent to
27.9 percent between 1994 and 2004. Garments’ share
doubled, from 10.9 percent to 20.2 percent during the
same period.

Mongolia’s domestic economy is still very much
affected by any fluctuations in the world copper
price. The correlation between the change of the world
copper price and Mongolia’s GDP was 0.59 between
1994 and 2004. During the same period, the share of
copper exports in GDP fluctuated in the range of
12.5 and 21.5 percent, partly due to copper price
movement.

Copper price movements also affect Mongolia’s
government revenues and exports. Empirical data
have shown a strong co-movement between the change
of the copper price and government total revenues. The
correlation between them was 0.46 between 1994 and
2004. Even though copper’s share in total exports has
been reduced, copper price fluctuations still account for
most of the fluctuation of Mongolia’s total exports. The
correlation between the change of the copper price and
the total exports was 0.66, and that between the change
of the copper price and the change of the total exports
was 0.79 over the same period.

This suggests that copper price risk management should be considered by the government as a way to
smooth its revenues and reduce short-term vulnerabilities. Currently, Mongolia’s overall balance and
current account are being lifted by the rising wave of the world copper price. However, stress tests show that
Mongolia’s public external debt sustainability would be highly vulnerable to the shocks from any significant
fall in world prices in the coming months or years.

remain at its 2004 level, more than one percent of GDP below the budget target. Personal and
corporate income tax, social security contributions, import-related taxes, and dividends led
the revenue boost.
9.
While the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) failed to move decisively against the
inflationary pressures, it was faced with the inherent difficulty in setting appropriate
monetary policies at the end of a rapid remonetization process. In line with the trend since
the banking crisis in 1998/99, monetary growth eased in 2004, to about the rate of nominal
GDP growth, slowing down from rates above 40 percent in earlier years.4 However, the pace
of liquidity expansion picked up again in early 2005, as the BOM did not sustain increases in
the yields and placements of central bank bills briefly initiated in late 2004, reflecting the
Bank’s concerns about losses. Private credit growth, which had grown at a torrid pace—more
than 200 percent in the two years 2002-03—was still high in early 2005, reaching nearly
33 percent year-on-year at end-June 2005. Despite high lending spreads (more than
10 percentage points), credit demand remains strong, shifting in recent years from the trading
sector to real estate, construction and mining.
10.
Concerns for the vulnerability of the banking sector have been heightened by
high credit growth and remaining weaknesses in supervision and enforcement of
prudential rules. The incidence of nonperforming loans (NPLs) increased from 8.3 percent
at end-2003 to more than 10 percent at mid-2005, while other indicators of banking sector
soundness are mixed (Table 10). In the current environment of high credit growth, the quality
of bank portfolio could be worse than these data suggest, especially with the hard-to-measure
systematic rollover of problem loans. Moreover, credit risk management of banks remains
fragile. In this regard, the disclosure, in early 2005, of hitherto unreported off-balance sheet
exposure in three banks that issued letters of credit (L/Cs) in transactions with a Korean
company, only confirmed worrying weaknesses in bank corporate governance, compounded
by the lack of strict enforcement of applicable prudential standards.
11.
The balance of payments has been strong, with favorable terms of trade, new
gold operations, and robust capital flows in the mining sector. The current account
(including transfers) is estimated to have been in a surplus equivalent to about one percent of
GDP in 2004. High commodity export prices, strong tourism, and private transfers, helped
offset the increased cost of oil imports (more than a fourth of total imports).5 The removal
however, in early 2005, of US and EU import quotas on textiles and garments has already

The end-year rate of change in M2 underestimates monetary growth. The annual growth
rate in average 6-monthly nominal balances, for example, exceeded 40 percent for most
of 2004, and was still 34 percent at end-year.

The terms of trade, projected to deteriorate for 2005 as a whole due to higher oil prices,

affected Mongolia’s small garment sector to a greater extent than so far seen in other Asian
countries (Box 3). However, the net external impact has been modest, as most inputs are
imported. With steady flows of donor assistance and foreign direct investment, the BOM was
able to reconstitute its official reserves, temporarily depleted by the large payments related to
the Russian debt settlement at end-2003.
12.
The authorities maintain a flexible exchange rate policy, with interventions
officially limited to smoothing high-frequency fluctuations in the foreign exchange market
and the maintenance of an adequate cushion of reserves to facilitate adjustment to large
shocks. Throughout the 2000–04 period, the togrog depreciated gradually against the dollar,
particularly in 2004 when there was uncertainty about the settlement of Mongolia’s large
transferable ruble debt to Russia. In 2005, however, the dollar exchange rate has been
relatively stable, implying an appreciation of about 4 percent in real effective terms. The staff
considers that recent exchange rate movements have appropriately reflected economic
fundamentals, which include sharply higher mineral export prices, strong remittances, and
the rebuilding of international reserves.
C. Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks
13.
Medium-term prospects are broadly favorable, provided the authorities manage
to slow inflation back to single digit and sustain supportive fiscal policies (Table 6).
Growth is expected to settle around at least 5 percent, with a return to trend growth for the
livestock sector. The gradual coming on stream of a series of mid-size mining projects is
projected to sustain a growing pace of extraction. Telecommunications, transport and tourism
should also continue to exhibit strong growth, while construction and financial services are
likely to slow down and the garment sector should continue to decline. With appropriate
policy action, mainly on the monetary side, inflation could slow down, to about 10 percent
year-on-year at end 2005, returning to a 5 percent trend in 2006.
14.
The balance of payments is expected to weaken moderately, in line with a
modest decline in the terms of trade. Export growth is likely to turn negative in 2006 as
world prices of copper are projected to decline by a third from their record levels, and
garment exports decline further.6 However, import growth should slow down, as oil prices
are projected to stabilize. The current account balance (including official transfers) is
projected to move back into a deficit in the range of 4–5 percent of GDP over the mediumterm. The financial account should be positive over 2005–10, on account of sustained
disbursements of concessional loans and FDI, allowing the BOM to maintain official
reserves above 10 weeks of imports of goods and non-factor services.

6

Under the latest WEO assumptions, copper prices are projected to fall a combined
30 percent in 2006 and 2007, and slowly decline thereafter.

Box 3. Garment Exports of Mongolia
Non-cashmere garment products have recently become major export items of Mongolia, with
a share in the total export and GDP of 11.1 percent and 6.4 percent respectively in 2004. Out of
about 100 companies in non-cashmere garment sector, almost all of them were foreign investors;
mainly from China (37 percent)
and South Korea (19 percent).

operations. In the first four
months of 2005, the Mongolian garment exports to the US declined both in value (20 percent) and
in volume (40 percent) compared to the same period last year as Chinese investors suspended
productions in Mongolia either temporally or permanently. Categories affected by the quota
removal –mainly cotton shirts, blouses, and trousers—make up 70 percent of the output. Of
about 20,000 full-time workers (mostly ladies), thousands are reported to have lost their jobs by
April due to the closure of factories.
Government actions have not successfully arrested the declining garment exports. The
government has tried to mitigate the impacts of quota elimination by: i) halving the level of social
security contributions by employers for affected firms, from the current 19 percent of the wage bill,
and ii) exempting the import tax on raw materials for garment products. The government also
intends to take as-yet unspecified measures to promote diversification in the sector, and plan to
establish a textile industrial park in Ulaanbaatar (ostensibly to help producers improve productivity
and reduce costs).
The announcement by the US government to invoke textile safeguards on three categories of
clothing imports from China is expected to have positive impacts on the Mongolian exports if
Chinese investors consider that exports from Mongolia should be kept to escape the safeguard or as
an insurance for another safeguard that is under consideration. These categories accounted for about
50 percent of Mongolian garment exports to the U.S. in 2004. However, given that the products
falling into these categories are also major export products of other countries in a similar situation,
such as Cambodia, Mongolia still needs to improve its competitiveness to be preferred to these
countries.

15.
There remain significant risks to the outlook, but there are also bright prospects.
As well as the risk of an even-greater-than-assumed decline in copper and gold prices, the
main recent export drivers, Mongolia remains vulnerable to crippling weather shocks to its
agriculture sector. Misguided policy choices on the taxation of the mining sector could scare
away FDI, as they once did in the late 1990s, before being corrected in 2000. The banking
sector, while stronger than in the 1990s, remains vulnerable. On the other hand, the mediumterm scenario does not reflect the possible coming on stream of the Oyu Tolgoï copper and
gold mining project, in view of uncertainties on its scope and timing. With large copper and
gold reserves (a low estimate is US$6 billion), that project’s development, by 2007 or 2008,
would have a large, positive impact on activity, government revenues and exports.
16.
Mongolia’s external debt remains high but sustainable. Even after the settlement
of pre-1991 Russian debt, which was equivalent to more than 10 times GDP, the outstanding
stock of external debt was equivalent to 91 percent of GDP as of end-2004, and 55 percent in
Net Present Value terms (NPV). This ratio is well above the 40 percent threshold applied to
countries at equivalent levels of policy performance in the joint IMF-World Bank debt
sustainability guidelines, placing Mongolia at a relatively high risk of debt distress over the
medium-term (Box 4 and attached Debt Sustainability Analysis).7 The authorities would
welcome more grants but they already receive a substantial amount. Under a baseline
scenario of sustained growth and fiscal deficits in the 3 percent range, financed solely with
concessional loans, Mongolia’s external debt ratios would decline substantially in the longterm. However, stress tests suggest the debt could become unsustainable if there were
especially negative terms of trade shocks. Moreover, the DSA baseline does not allow for
any large-scale nonconcessional loans.
17.
Any relaxation of the government’s borrowing policy––either in signing large loan
agreements or in allowing less favorable borrowing terms––could have severe
consequences on its external debt sustainability. In this regard, there are several proposals
for loans, including from the governments of China ($300 million) and Turkey ($50 million),
as well as a possible $100 million international bond to be arranged by a foreign commercial
bank. These and other possible borrowing would support, inter alia, public infrastructure for
housing construction and trade. The loans would be nonconcessional and most of the
liabilities would be with the government, at least on a contingent basis.
II.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS

18.
The discussions covered three main areas: (i) immediate and medium-term
prospects for the economy, the risks to the outlook, and the authorities’ main macroeconomic

7

However, reflecting Mongolia strong revenue and export performance, the ratios of NPV of
external debt to exports, at 68 percent, and NPV of debt to revenues, at 160 percent, are well
below critical thresholds under the debt sustainability guidelines.

- 17 Box 4: Mongolia’s Public Debt
Mongolia has a high stock of public debt even
after the settlement of pre-1991 transferable
ruble (TR) debt to Russia. At end-2004,
Mongolia’s stock of total public debt amounted to
91 percent of GDP—almost all external loans from
multilateral and bilateral donors. A short-term
treasury bill issued to nonresident in 2003 to partly
finance the TR debt settlement was fully repaid
before the end of 2004. The remaining domestic
debt is mostly short-term borrowing from
commercial banks to bridge time lags between
revenues and expenditures. Mongolian authorities
have never availed themselves of the Paris Club
rescheduling.
Most of the Mongolia’s public external debt is
concessional. Three creditors (the World Bank,
the Asian Development Bank, and JBIC) account
for 80 percent of total public external debt.
Calculations of Mongolia’s stock of public
external debt at end-2004 indicate: (i) the nominal
stock amounts to $1.4 billion or 91 percent of
GDP (112 percent of goods and services), (ii) the
stock of NPV value amounts to $0.8 billion or
55 percent of GDP (68 percent of goods and
services). Average concessionality of public
external debt compares favorably with other
transition economies.

Due to the high concessionality, together with
large export share of GDP (80 percent in 2004),
debt service has been manageable. The external
debt service ratio, which temporally jumped up to
34 percent of goods and services in 2003 due to a
cash payment of $250 million in connection with
the pre-1991 debt settlement, would fall to its
previous low level of about 4 percent in 2005. A
high government revenue ratio to GDP (39 percent
in 2004) also means fiscal debt service indicators
are under control.

However, given that Mongolia’s external position is highly vulnerable to terms of trade shocks, a
cautious approach to contracting public borrowing is required. On external side, as copper and gold
exports account for more than 60 percent of Mongolian export of goods, the price declines of these
commodities would promptly worsen debt service indicators. On fiscal side, revenues also depend,
although to lesser extent, on copper and gold production. Therefore, it is crucial for Mongolia to maintain
a sustainable debt dynamics over the medium and long-term through limiting its borrowing on
concessional terms (see further be discussed in the debt sustainable analysis).

Analysis, and (iii) the authorities’ Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper Progress Report.
19.
The authorities broadly shared the staff’s assessment for the medium-term
outlook, while taking a more sanguine view of the risks related to inflation. They
acknowledged that the high growth rates achieved in 2004 would not be repeated. However,
they considered that reforms that improve the environment for the private sector and
investment in much needed public infrastructure could provide further impetus to growth,
even above the staff’s current projections of 5 percent per year. They agreed that
macroeconomic stability was a key condition for sustained growth in the future, but saw no
critical, unmanageable, risks in the recent upsurge in inflation.
A. Fiscal Policy
20.
Fiscal policy for the remainder of 2005 will aim at saving the revenue windfall
from higher minerals sector taxes and dividends. The authorities said that they were not
contemplating amendments to the 2005 budget, and they would contain expenditure strictly
within budgeted levels. As a result, the actual budget deficit is expected to be contained to
about 2 percent GDP––the same as in 2004 and about 1½ percentage points lower than
originally budgeted. At a time when inflationary pressures persist and the economy has no
need for additional stimulus, the staff considered that the decision to save the revenue
windfall was appropriate. To ensure that the targets could be met, the staff cautioned the
authorities on the need for maintaining strong control over spending and addressing
remaining weaknesses in budget management systems.
21.
The authorities’ Medium-Term Budget Framework (MTBF) for 2006–08 was
submitted to Parliament in May 2005. It envisages an increase in the overall deficit to
4 percent of GDP in 2006, compared with the original 2005 budget target of 3½ percent.
Developments since the framework was issued, including the continued buoyancy of
revenues and proposed tax reforms that will be discussed by Parliament late this year,
suggest that the MTBF will need to be revised to serve as a useful guide for policy. The team
urged the authorities to ground the medium-term framework and their tax reform proposals
within the context of the overall fiscal allocation priorities. Taking into account the projected
deterioration in the terms of trade, an overall fiscal deficit of no more than 3-3¼ percent of
GDP would be appropriate from 2006 onward. This would be consistent with a steady
decline in the stock of net credit to government and the ratio of public debt to GDP, while
allowing room for concessionally financed capital spendings that will be critical for sustained
growth.
22.
The staff encouraged the authorities to implement spending reforms in line with
the recommendations of a recent FAD technical assistance mission (Annex VII). Civil
service and pension reform, combining employment and compensation reviews, was the
main area where efficiency gains and savings could be generated. Key actions included
enhancing the pension system’s sustainability by raising the retirement age, phasing in a
notional defined contribution system, eliminating overlapping family benefits, consolidating
public tertiary education institutions, and eliminating public health services of a purely
private nature. The wage bill could be contained by a partial hiring freeze to reduce excess
support staff, and limiting increases in real wages of support staff.

- 19 -

23.
The authorities expressed willingness to improve their fiscal allocation priorities
but progress is likely to be slow. The Minister of Finance explained that containing the
wage bill would focus on eliminating unnecessary positions—at present there was not even a
proper count of staffing—while a working group was reviewing hiring and wage levels. The
government would also consider proposals from the Ministry of Social Assistance to restore
the long-run viability of the pension system and improve the targeting of social benefits
programs. While accepting that recent changes broadening the scope of the child money
scheme were costly, the authorities were considering a plan to target the payments through
applying additional criteria. As regards other spending initiatives, the mission expressed
concern about proposals to build 40,000 housing units, financed by very large
nonconcessional foreign loans that would require public guarantees or servicing.
24.
On the tax side, the government’s chief medium-term focus is on easing the
burden of taxation on the private sector and promoting investment-led growth. Many
proposals have been floated that, taken together, could cause substantial revenue losses,
reduce the efficiency of tax system, increase income inequality among taxpayers, and worsen
the business environment. With a view to simplification, consideration had been given to flat
rate proposals that would lower the top rates of both corporate (CIT) and personal (PIT)
income taxes while gradually reducing the rate of VAT. At the same time, there are strong
pressures to capture more of the benefits of the mining boom through taxes and charges.
25.
The mission argued that a comprehensive, broadly revenue neutral tax reform
package, along the main lines recommended by FAD’s recent tax policy mission would
contribute to these goals. The mission recommended: removing exemptions; unifying the
CIT at 25 percent, in two phases; removing restrictions on legitimate business expenses, and
providing for loss carry forward; introducing a cost effective system of tax incentives based
on investment tax credits; reducing the cascading under the VAT; increasing the threshold of
PIT; introducing taxes on domestic beer and telecommunication services, and increasing the
excises on cars to offset revenue losses from these measures. On mining taxation, the team
noted that raising royalties to levels well above industry standards as some had suggested
would jeopardize the investment climate in this critical sector and urged caution—a World
Bank team was providing technical assistance in this area.
26.
After several revisions, the government’s latest plans sought to avoid the pitfalls
of some of the earlier proposals although parliament may make further changes when they
debate the package during the autumn session. The staff supported the authorities’ intention
to increase the PIT threshold, allow legitimate expenses in computing taxable income under
the CIT, and replace cost ineffective tax holidays with tax credits. The authorities were
encouraged to (i) unify the CIT rate nearer the top rate; (ii) amend provisions for loss carry
forward; (iii) improve the VAT refund system; and (iv) eliminate remaining non-standard
VAT exemptions.
27.
The government continues to implement its plans for further improvements in
public financial management. With support from the World Bank, the government has
implemented a fully integrated Government Financial Management Information System that

- 20 -

in time will allow much improved fiscal reporting and control over funds. The staff
welcomed these developments, as this and other measures should contribute to improving
transparency along the lines recommended in the recently published ROSC update on fiscal
transparency.8 However, the team expressed concern that, while the introduction of the
Treasury Single Account (TSA) in 2003 allowed better tracking and transparency in the
management of government funds, there has been a sharp increase in balances held outside
the TSA, in commercial banks, since mid-2004 when the BOM ceased paying interest on
these balances. Thus, the staff argued that budgetary discipline is threatened by the increased
autonomy of entities collecting revenues to supplement their appropriations, and urged the
authorities to reverse these trends. The authorities noted that the question of interest earned
on such deposits would have to be resolved before agencies could be compelled to bring their
accounts under the TSA. Plans are also being discussed with the World Bank to improve
procurement procedures.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
28.
The team took the view that the authorities’ medium-term inflation objectives
were at risk if they did not withdraw the ongoing monetary stimulus. The Monetary
Policy Guidelines’ (MPG) main monetary target for 2005—restraining the growth of reserve
money to 15 percent—remained appropriate. In the short run, given the supply-side
contributions to price shocks, it was unlikely that inflation can be brought down below
10 percent, well above the MPG target 5 percent. The main concern, looking forward, was
that by continuing to accommodate the second-round effects of various real shocks, the lack
of monetary policy action would only allow the inflation process to intensify further. The
staff recommended that BOM tighten the monetary stance through indirect instruments to
meet the MPG target.
29.
Operationally, the onus of monetary tightening rests predominantly on the
BOM’s issues of Central Bank Bills (CBBs). To mop up the excess liquidity, the BOM
needs to increase the stock of CBBs from Tg. 69 billion at end-2004 to about Tg. 95 billion
by end-2005, which would also raise yields. The yields on CBBs declined sharply in
early 2005—the discount rate on two-week CBBs was 3-4 percent at end April, down from
nearly 16 percent in December 2004. Commercial bank interest rates would likely remain
close to their current relatively high levels—23 percent for lending rates, and an average of
13 percent of deposit rates—as earlier these rates did not drop in line with the CBB rates.
30.
Other tools for achieving a tighter stance are available, if needed. The team
supported a transfer of treasury funds now in commercial banks back to the government’s
BOM account to help tighten liquidity. The team argued that other possible measures, such
as increases in reserve requirement, should only be considered once the BOM has exhausted
its policy room with its main current instrument, the issuance by open tender of CBBs. This

- 21 -

said, the team noted that the BOM might re-examine the effectiveness of its instruments and
operational procedures, possibly with assistance from the Fund’s MFD experts.
31.
Although arguing that the current bout of inflation was fundamentally a supply
phenomenon, the BOM recognized the need to tighten the monetary stance through
issuing additional CBBs. However, the BOM is concerned about losses, and called on the
government to offset the cost of the monetary operations by paying interest on the remaining
$90 million balance of the loan that financed the Russian debt settlement. The team
supported this position, also calling on the BOM to pay suitable interest on all government
deposits held with them—reducing the incentive for budget agencies to keep their holdings
in commercial banks.
32.
The authorities stressed their commitment to the flexible exchange rate policy,
with interventions limited to smoothing high-frequency fluctuations in the foreign
exchange market and the acquisition of reserves. Given the low level of short-term debt,
the team noted that international reserve levels were broadly adequate (2½–3 months of
imports). Looking forward, it was clear that new shocks were in store, both favorable (new
mining prospects) and unfavorable (additional increases in oil prices). If favorable shocks
predominated, allowing the togrog to appreciate would help contain overheating pressures,
while if negative shocks did, nominal depreciation would facilitate the adjustment process. In
either case, the amplitude of medium-term movements to be expected in the bilateral and
effective exchange rates might well be higher than that observed over the last two years.
C. Financial Sector Policies
BOM Governance
33.
The BOM reported incurring significant losses in 2005 and the interest cost of
CBBs has made the BOM hesitant to issue them in adequate volume. In addition, in the
team’s view, dealing with its financial problems is bound to distract the BOM’s senior
management from what should be its core focus, monetary policy and banking supervision.
The staff argued for a comprehensive approach to dealing with losses. The full extent of the
losses should be assessed, the legal framework reviewed to establish the obligations of the
Ministry of Finance and BOM in the event that the net worth of the Bank falls below bestpractice norms, and a plan submitted to Parliament to strengthen BOM finances and
governance in the medium term.
34.
Ministers and the BOM concurred with the mission on the need to strengthen
the BOM’s financial position and governance. They also acknowledged that no concrete
steps had been taken so far to address the likely breaches of the Central Bank Law (CBL)
identified in the audit reports of the BOM’s accounts for 2003 and 2004. These include
government borrowing in excess of statutory limits, unauthorized lending to the private
sector, premature transfers of profits to the Budget, and poor international reserve
management practices. The authorities agreed with the Supervisory Board’s suggestion that
its role should be strengthened, with its reports more widely disseminated to Parliament.

- 22 -

35.
The BOM recognized that its own-account trading and intermediary gold
operations were unconventional for a central bank, but stated that until the private
sector took over this role, the BOM would continue. In line with earlier Safeguards
Assessment recommendations, the mission stressed that such gold operations, including
futures and derivatives, represent highly risky investment for its reserves, thus weakening the
governance of the BOM. Nevertheless, the BOM felt that the trading operations provided a
critical service to Mongolian gold producers while their officials were experienced and
highly competent in conducting futures and derivative operations backed by monetary gold.
Commercial banks, Nonbank Financial Institutions (NBFIs) and Savings Cooperatives
36.
The team, together with an overlapping technical assistance mission from MFD,
argued that the vulnerability of the banking sector continues to be cause for concern.
NPLs (including overdue loans) have increased during the past 12 months, with a ratio of
NPLs to total loans rising to more than 11 percent. Furthermore, the prospect of one or more
banks getting into serious difficulty in the relatively near future cannot be ruled out.
Indicators of bank profitability have also deteriorated in recent times. The conjunction of
even limited bank default and macroeconomic shocks would thus create an environment ripe
for a confidence crisis to damage the banking system.
37.
The BOM recognized that some banks could get into serious difficulty but
believed that there was no systemic risk. The Bank has improved supervision in many
areas, particularly strengthening of requirements for identification and provisioning of NPLs,
and its requirements, fully enforced, for a higher capital base. Clearly, however, a deepening
of bank problems called for continued strengthening of banking supervision, avoidance of
regulatory forbearance, and an improvement of corporate governance of banks. The MFD
team also recommended that the BOM prepare detailed contingency plans to deal with a
systemic banking crisis, including consultations with other interested parties as necessary;
that it take more targeted actions against problem banks, including intensifying on-site
examination; and encourage, or even require, problem banks to engage in management
advisory contracts, preferably with experienced banks.
38.
The BOM acknowledged that its supervision could have been more effective, and
that breaches of banking laws were incurred, in the case of three banks involved in the
issuance of a large amount in L/Cs. These events, in the staff’s views, exemplify the
continued need to improve bank governance and management quality, and supervision
effectiveness. There are issues about the validity of these L/Cs. Nevertheless, the potential
for bank failure, if legal judgments are held against any of these three banks, remains
significant, as the L/C amounts in dispute are very large relative to these banks’ capital or
assets. The BOM agreed that it should stand ready to take strong action toward the banks
themselves in the event of default arising from a negative judgment, but it was noncommittal on the staff’s view that it should also take action against the management of these
banks. Following the MFD team’s recommendation, the BOM intends to carry out an indepth check for similar transactions for the whole banking system, and review its own
procedures to prevent a recurrence of this problem.

- 23 -

39.
The mission also discussed ways for the Ministry of Finance and BOM to extend
current collaborative efforts in the strengthening of the regulatory and supervision of
credit and savings cooperatives (CSCs). CSCs continue to be largely unregulated, yet
advertise for deposits despite existing prohibitions, with risks of spillovers to the banking
system, even though their aggregate size remains small. Proposals for a regulatory
framework (including powers of supervision and prudential standards) will be submitted to
Parliament in the fall of 2005. The authorities acknowledged that the key would be to
provide adequate resources to establish the agency vested with supervisory powers over
CSCs. Consideration is being given to a supervision agency to cover the whole non-bank
financial sector.
D. External Policies—Debt and Trade
External Debt Management and Debt Sustainability Analysis
40.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s macroeconomic assumptions and main
findings of the debt sustainability analysis (DSA).9 They concurred with the DSA’s
conclusions that a strict continuation of the government’s current external borrowing policy–
–relying only on concessional external borrowing or grants––was called for, and
acknowledged the need to resist pressures to enter into agreements that involve
nontransparent negotiation and procurement procedures. The team also underscored the
critical need for improved debt management, and welcomed the tracking by Ministry of
Finance debt management staff of the same debt indicators as used by the DSA, as well as
plans to inform the Parliament on debt management and its importance.
41.
The mission urged the authorities to finalize the negotiations on clearing existing
overdue debts to bilateral creditors and continue to avoid any new arrears. Although
negotiations have taken place with the Russian authorities to resolve the accumulating
arrears of post-1991 Russian debt (US$10 million as of end-2004), a formal agreement has
yet to be reached; moreover long-standing restructuring and rescheduling negotiations with
Italy (US$13 million) have yet to reach conclusion.10
Trade Policy
42.
A recent Trade Policy Review (TPR) by the World Trade Organization (WTO)
confirmed that Mongolia maintains a generally open trade regime, with a low uniform
level of import tariff, limited non-tariff barriers, and only a few, small export taxes. At the
9

The draft DSA was prepared jointly with the World Bank, in accordance with the
procedures for low-income country DSA, approved by the two Executive Boards.
10

A debt to Finland (US$9 million) also remains unresolved. The authorities do not regard
this as in arrears because they are still ready to provide meat as payment, as earlier agreed.

- 24 -

same time, the trade regime is under political pressure, and the TPR cautioned the authorities
against protectionist pressures that are emerging especially in the food, drink and cashmere
processing sectors. The authorities noted that the liberalization process had not been painless
to some sectors. In addition to proposals for selective duty increases that were floated during
tax reform debates, there are also proposals for new export tariffs, especially on mineral
products and raw cashmere. The mission argued that even while these proposals were not
inconsistent with WTO commitments, they should be resisted. New minerals export taxes
would clearly hurt prospects for mining sector investment, FDI and growth, while the
proposed tax on raw cashmere exports could lead to the loss of income to the herders or
increased smuggling.
43.
Changes in the international trade regime have had only a modest impact on
Mongolia, although the recent lifting of quota under the ATC has hurt the small
garment sector. The authorities did not think Mongolia had been affected by the increasing
numbers of bilateral or regional free trade agreements, as its major trading partners are large,
neighboring countries. However, the government has approached the United States and the
European Union to obtain a favorable bilateral treatment, especially in the face of the (still
evolving) removal of quotas on garment imports into those markets. Mongolia could seek to
obtain from its trading partners greater access, in such markets as meat, where sanitary
regulation has sometimes been an impeding factor.
E. Poverty Reduction Strategy
44.
After some delay, the authorities have completed a progress report of the
Economic Growth Support Poverty Reduction Strategy formulated in 2003.11 This
progress report reaffirms the approach of the earlier document published by the previous
administration, focusing on ways to enhance broad-based growth while embracing the
pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals. Progress on achieving those goals has been
limited (Annex I). Jointly with the World Bank staff and other donors, the team discussed
with the authors areas in which assistance could be given to help enhance the priority setting
and costing of the various initiatives outlined in the EGSPRS. The discussion was in the
context of one broad framework that could replace the various action plans and guidelines
currently available, as well as improving poverty monitoring.
F. Ex Post Assessment of Program Engagement, 1991–2005
45.
The EPA team concluded that overall program design for macroeconomic
policies for the SBA and three structural programs supported by the Fund had
generally been appropriate. The level of intended financing provided by the Fund was
adequate, given the large amounts of other donor support. Even though the arrangements
11

The progress report and accompanying Joint Staff Advisory Note are being separately
circulated to the Executive Board for information.

- 25 -

were frequently delayed and incomplete, the level of official grants and lending from the
international development banks and bilateral donors was generally as projected and
constant. However, because of the steady flow of concessional financing, external debt had
been allowed to rise to levels threatening sustainability.
46.
The programs differed in their emphasis, in line with evolving stages of
transition and the need to address emerging challenges but were unable to be
completed. There remained a large part of the structural agenda unfinished, with the
financial sector still weak, public enterprises in need of further restructuring or privatization,
and the poverty reduction goals yet unrealized. Part of the failure to complete the
arrangements could be linked to country ownership of the process not being fully sustained,
undermined by frequent elections and government changes.
47.
The EPA team saw a strong case for a continued close policy dialogue between
the Fund and the Mongolian authorities, backed if possible by a low access financial
arrangement. Macroeconomic stability remained fragile, tax and expenditure reforms
needed to be further enhanced, and the financial sector strengthened—all areas of Fund
expertise. The current strength of the economy and external prospects indicated that there
was some time to build up both a track record of adherence to prudent macroeconomic
policies and cautious structural reform and to build a consensus among the various political
parties and civil society for major reforms of key institutions and governance.
48.
The authorities agreed with the broad conclusions of the EPA report and
endorsed the concept of having broad multiparty backing for any future Fundsupported program. Looking at the period since 1991, they felt the policies had achieved
the main objectives despite difficult conditions. Addressing the issue of sustained ownership,
the authorities thought that there were two key factors. First, the politicized society that
meant continuity was difficult as politicians sought to attract votes. Second, government
control over implementation had been poor. Thus, they sought focused programs that
concentrated on timely actions. On the build up of external debt, it was noted that there had
been a lack of linkage between foreign-financed projects and the longer term fiscal
implications. In that regard, the Deputy Prime Minister favored foreign direct investment as a
vehicle for future development wherever possible. In terms of the possible scope of any
future Fund arrangement, the authorities agreed that poverty reduction and job creation was
important, with strengthening of the financial sector and fiscal operations as key
conditions—including a fully agreed and integrated medium term budget framework.
G. Other Issues
49.
Public enterprise reform and privatization appear to have stalled but the
government was looking to make progress. The authorities did not view the recent
slowdown as indicating a shift in political support for continued transition to a market
economy, and were confident that the momentum could be regained soon. The next 3-year
privatization program includes key enterprises in sectors designated as strategic, such as
cashmere processing, banking, and energy. In the energy sector, there was recognition at all

- 26 -

levels of government of the need to secure more energy supply with the involvement of the
state and private sector. Guidelines for privatizing power plants, distribution and
transmission networks had been submitted to Parliament. However, there was public
opposition to efforts to adjust tariffs needed to enhance the financial viability of the
enterprises.
50.
The authorities agreed that a forceful move on as broad a front as possible to
improve public sector governance would be beneficial. As earlier discussed, improvement
of BOM governance would be a priority and the settlement of the Russian debt revealed a
need to ensure accountability of government operations. In addition, the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative, the envisaged new anti-corruption law (instituting income disclosure
requirements on senior officials), adoption and implementation of Anti-Money Laundering
and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML-CFT) law, and legal and judicial reforms
could all contribute to achieve gains.12 The staff also pointed out that the business
community would welcome transparency of the operations of the tax and customs
administration.
51.
Although Mongolia produces a wide range of statistics, the authorities
recognized there remain a number of weaknesses in key economic data. Some progress
has been made in developing a national accounts framework, but the authorities welcomed
assistance to improve the quality of GDP estimates and to develop a producer price index.
The authorities noted the quality of fiscal data could be further improved with the
introduction of the chart of accounts. Despite the improvement in the coverage of the BOP,
further upgrading was needed, particularly on data on remittances of migrant workers abroad
and foreign direct investment, and further technical assistance would be useful.
III.

STAFF APPRAISAL

52.
Medium-term prospects are broadly favorable, provided the authorities manage
to slow inflation back to a single digit and sustain supportive fiscal policies. Growth is
expected to settle around the 5 percent range, with a return to trend growth for the livestock
sector. The gradual coming on stream of a series of mid-size mining projects is projected to
sustain a stable pace of extraction. With appropriate policy action, mainly on the monetary
side, inflation should slow down, to about 10 percent year-on-year at end 2005, returning to a
5 percent trend in 2006.
53.
The balance of risks to growth appears broadly even. Susceptible to a more
pronounced decline in copper prices than currently anticipated, Mongolia also remains
vulnerable to large weather shocks. Additional risks to the outlook lie on the policy front,
especially on fiscal policies. As in the past, pressures for measures that could derail the fiscal
12

international standards is enacted.

- 27 -

stance remain intense. On the other hand, there is potential for a very large increase in
mineral extraction that could transform the economy significantly.
54.
With the external environment expected to remain strong in 2005, the staff
supports the authorities’ aim to keep the overall deficit to 2 percent of GDP,
1½ percentage points less than in the budget. At a time when inflationary pressures are
high, when the strong economy has no need for additional stimulus, and when current
account prospects are weakening, this policy stance is appropriate, making a positive
contribution to macroeconomic stability. The lower deficit target will require that the
authorities avoid expenditure slippage from the approved budget, and save additional
revenues arising from temporarily favorable macroeconomic factors.
55.
For 2006 and beyond, the direction of the fiscal stance should be broadly
neutral, provided inflationary pressures have subsided. Some small widening of the
overall fiscal deficit to about 3–3¼ percent of GDP from 2006 would be appropriate as the
terms of trade gains unwind. Taking advantage of the revenue windfall, this deficit would be
considerably lower than that envisaged at the time of the PRGF review. Net domestic
borrowing would continue to be significantly negative, and public debt would decline in
GDP terms, even while financing infrastructure improvements critical for growth.
56.
The staff urges the authorities to resist seeking short-term advantage through
tax giveaways, focusing rather on eliminating the distortions in the current income taxes and
VAT. Similarly, they should avoid inappropriate spending increases—such as large pay rises
in the absence of staffing reforms, and general increases in social transfer programs—or
engaging in large infrastructure projects with limited rates of return. The staff welcomes the
intention to reform the civil service and pension system, but notes that such changes will
need perseverance if past failures are not to be repeated.
57.
In the longer term, Mongolia’s public debt is seen as sustainable but vulnerable
to extreme terms of trade shocks. With aid from bilaterals, the AsDB and the World Bank
at favorable terms, the resulting debt dynamics are consistent with sustainability. In the
staff’s view, although the debt to GDP ratio is above the sustainability threshold for lowincome countries in the same category of policy performance ratings and would remain
above for some time to come, the strong export and revenue base is important. Thus, the
NPV of debt to exports and to revenues remain significantly below sustainability thresholds,
although an extreme permanent drop in mineral prices could undermine the position.
58.
In this context, the staff advises against loan agreements that entail
nonconcessional terms and/or implicit or explicit government guarantees.
Nonconcessional external borrowing by the public sector on such a large scale as suggested
would threaten external sustainability, while raising governance concerns. Any loans should
also adhere strictly to the regulations relating to government borrowing and guarantees.
59.
Plans for further improvements in public financial management should be
implemented vigorously, to ensure a tight control over public finance and to improve

- 28 -

transparency. The government’s Government Financial Management Information System is
an ambitious undertaking that in time will allow much improved fiscal reporting and control
over funds. All budget resources should be consolidated in the treasury single account. This
and other measures should contribute to improving transparency.
60.
A tighter monetary stance is essential to tame inflationary pressures. In this
respect, the staff looks forward to a resumption of central bank bill issues in the remaining
months of 2005 that can provide the basis for achieving the central bank’s target growth for
reserve money and help prevent the current supply-driven price increases from being
embedded in persistent double-digit inflation.
61.
For a commodity exporter like Mongolia, a flexible exchange rate regime
remains appropriate, and the government should resist demand for trade-based
measures to support sectors hit by shocks. A flexible exchange rate, with interventions
limited to smoothing high-frequency fluctuations in the foreign exchange market, provides a
guard against erosion of competitiveness. In the expected environment of continued
temporary high mineral prices, the authorities are urged to save some of the windfall gains
through some further reserve build up. The authorities are to be commended for their position
so far to resist undermining the open trading system.
62.
Further progress to improve the health of the financial system and the strength
of the central bank is essential, building on the progress made in recent years. There is
concern that high credit growth may mask the underlying fragility of some banks’ positions,
and the problems of regulatory forbearance. In the face of indications that some banks are
weakening, the BOM needs to take forceful corrective actions, to tighten supervision and
strictly enforce prudential norms, including those requiring painful adjustments for
individual financial institutions. Signs of problems in the non-bank financial sector should be
tackled vigorously. While savings cooperatives remain small, some may be running into
difficulties and the consolidated non-bank financial watchdog agency proposed by the
authorities would be welcome. The staff encourages the authorities to finalize drafting laws
for Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism.
63.
To address issues of governance at the BOM, the staff urges the authorities to
resolve the capital weakness of the BOM and improve the decision-making structure.
An enhanced supervisory board with direct access to parliament could assist in providing
oversight. It would also be advisable that the BOM move away from intermediation
operations in gold, in particular with respect to derivative transactions. If it is necessary for
such functions to remain within the public domain, they should be carved out into an agency
that is legally and operationally separate from the central bank.
64.
Restructuring of public enterprises remains a priority. This can be done through
both improving the governance of enterprises intended to remain in the public sector as well
as resuming the privatization program. In particular, the energy sector would benefit from
efforts to revamp its operations and ensure additional electricity supply in the longer term.

- 29 -

65.
The staff urges the authorities to use the current strong external environment to
provide the fiscal space to consolidate debt sustainability, while resuming a strong
structural program to ensure progress in tackling outstanding poverty and growth
issues. Combined with early action to address the governance weaknesses in the BOM as
well as normalizing links with the government, such steps could provide the basis for a
resumption of Fund program support. It would also be important that the highest standard of
transparency and accounting be applied to any large-scale loan operation or settlement such
that the population can take full confidence in the process.
66.
The authorities are also encouraged to improve the quality and coverage of fiscal
statistics and address the priority issues for the national accounts and balance of payments.
The government-wide chart of accounts will help resolve the technical issues for the fiscal
data. The authorities are urged also to focus on improved poverty indicators to assist their
work on the MDGs.
67.
It is recommended that Mongolia be on a 12-month consultation cycle. The
authorities have indicated that they, in principle, would consent to the publication of the staff
report.

ANNEX I

MONGOLIA––POVERTY PROFILE
According to the 2005 World Development Indicators, the per capita PPP Gross National
Income (GNI) in Mongolia was around US$1,820 in 2003 and the country was ranked 165th
among 208 nations. Given an average per-capita PPP GNI of US$1,926 in all low-income
countries, Mongolia has one of the lowest living standards in the world.
The Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS) and Household Income and
Expenditure Survey (HIES) for 2002/2003, conducted in collaboration with the World Bank
and the UNDP, are the most reliable sources of quantitative data on poverty available. Based
on these sources, Mongolia’s poverty profile can be summarized as follows.
•

With the poverty line at around 25,000 Tugrik per person per month, the head
count ratio was 36 percent—around 900,000 persons among 2½ million of total
population did not have the necessary means to purchase the value of a minimum
food and non-food package. In addition, the depth of poverty was substantial: on
average the consumption of the poor is 11 percent below the poverty line.

•

Taking into account broader concepts of poverty such as capabilities or social
inclusion in addition to income/consumption, it was estimated that 55 percent of
Ulaanbaatar population were living in a poverty situation. 33 percent of
population were under poverty in terms of income/consumption, 25 percent in terms
of capabilities, and 24 percent in terms of social inclusion.13

•

The head count ratio indicates that overall poverty has not improved in
comparison with that existing in the 1990s, with improved urban conditions
offset by a worsening in rural areas.14 The number of people living below the
poverty line in the 1990s was around 35–36 percent throughout the previous LSMS
conducted in 1995 and 1998. By region, however, the trends were very different; the
number of poor people in urban areas was significantly lowered from 39 percent
in 1998 to 30 percent in 2003 whereas the ratio in rural areas rose from 33 percent
in 1998 to 43 percent in 2003. The improvement of the poverty situation in urban area
seemingly resulted from relatively better economic performances in both industry and
services, starting from 2001. On the contrary, the deterioration of poverty in rural
area was a consequence of several dzuds and droughts that resulted in a dramatic loss
of the livestock population in 2000-2002.

13
14

Among these, 21 percent of the poor population overlapped two or three types of poverty.

However, there exist problems of direct comparability between some indicators in the
previous LSMS, as the methodology utilized was not entirely consistent.

ANNEX I

•

Similarly there has not been any significant improvement in income inequality
since 1998. In 2002-2003, the Gini coefficient, an index for the consumption gap,
was 0.33, down only marginally from 0.35 in 1998. Nationally, the richest 20 percent
of population has 5½ times more consumption than the poorest 20 percent. As
expected, poverty inequality was greater in urban areas than in the countryside.

•

Labor market status and educational achievement are important determinants
of poverty. Employment in the livestock or agriculture sectors was prone to poverty,
whereas those employed in the service sectors were less likely to be poor. Employees
with public sector and state companies enjoyed better living standards. The poor had
lower educational accomplishment than the non-poor: more than half of the poor
reached only the 8th grade of secondary school compared to one-third in the non-poor
category. Enrollment rates of children in poor and non-poor households were similar
at the primary level, while at the secondary level, non-poor children had significantly
higher enrollment rates.

•

Poverty is also correlated with the size of household. Whereas only 10 percent of
households with up to three members were poor, the poverty incidence for
households with more than five members was about 50 percent and for households
with 8 and more members, 70 percent lived under the poverty line.

•

The type of housing reflected living standards. In urban areas, those living in
apartments were less likely to be poor, while those living in gers were most likely to
be poor. In rural areas, those who live in houses were poorer than those living in gers.

However, most social indicators, in particular, those for health and education, have
improved since late 1990s. Health indicators, such as infant mortality, immunization rate,
and life expectancy, has been improved. In particular, secondary school enrollment rates rose
to a quite high level, compared to that in other low income countries. The Human
Development Index for Mongolia improved from 0.628 in 1998 to 0.668 in 2003, but the
country remains ranked 117th among 177 countries.

Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) was subject to
a full safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement that was approved by the
Executive Board on September 28, 2001. An on-site safeguards assessment of the BOM was
completed on September 10, 2003. Staff recommended that the BOM implement measures to
strengthen its external audit mechanism and financial reporting framework. The BOM has so
far implemented several of the recommendations. Staff continues to monitor the BOM’s
efforts to: (i) commit to the full adoption of International Accounting Standards (IAS) and to
disclose its guarantees and pledges in its financial statements; and (ii) disclose the fair value
of derivatives in its net international reserve position and financial statements. At the
conclusion of the December 2002 PRGF discussions, the BOM agreed to implement special
semi-annual audits of NIR to provide further assurance on the NIR position and to identify
any related pledges or guarantees.

ANNEX III

Exchange Arrangement:

On May 27, 1993, Mongolia moved from a fixed exchange rate against the U.S. dollar to a
floating exchange rate system. However, the BOM has, at times, made active use of its
intervention practices to maintain a stable nominal exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar
over extended periods of time. The official exchange rate is now set daily on the basis of
transactions in the interbank market. At end-June 2005, the official midpoint rate was
Tog 1,190 per U.S. dollar. The official exchange rate is applied to the public sector’s
transactions in imports and services, including debt-service payments, and to trade and
service transactions conducted under bilateral payments arrangements. Mongolia accepted
the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on February 1, 1996, and maintains an
exchange system that is free from restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
IX.

Article IV Consultation:

The 2002 Article IV consultation (Country Report No. 02/252) was concluded by the
Executive Board on October 25, 2002. Mongolia will be on the 12–month cycle.

ANNEX IV

Mongolia: IMF-World Bank Relations
(As of August 31, 2005)
Partnership In Mongolia’s Development Strategy
Mongolia became a member of the World Bank, IDA and IFC in February 1991. The World
Bank now has a wide-ranging policy dialogue covering structural reforms to promote
economic growth and poverty reduction, including public administration/civil service reform,
financial sector reform, private sector development, education, health, social reforms, urban
and rural development, infrastructure, and judicial reforms.
Mongolia’s vision for development and poverty reduction is laid out in the Government’s
Economic Growth Support and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EGSPRS) which, along with a
Joint Staff Assessment (JSA), was discussed by the respective Boards of Executive Directors
of the Bank and the Fund in September 2003. The EGSPRS builds on the strategy articulated
in the earlier interim report (I-PRSP) that was presented to the IDA and IMF Boards in
September 2001. The strategy, which provides an adequate framework for implementing the
government’s development agenda, is based on the following five main pillars: (i) ensuring
macroeconomic stability and enhancing public sector effectiveness; (ii) establishing a sound
institutional and regulatory environment to complete Mongolia’s transition to a market
economy and enabling the private sector to become an engine of growth; (iii) enhancing
balanced and environmentally sustainable development; (iv) fostering sustainable human
development and equitable distribution of the benefits from growth through improved service
delivery in education, health, and social welfare; and (v) promoting good governance and
gender equality. The Bank and the Fund have jointly assisted the Government in the
formulation and preparation of the EGSPRS. They continue to advise the Government in the
implementation of this strategy and monitor progress through EGSPRS progress reports. The
first Progress Report was discussed by Government Cabinet on May 4, 2005 and sent
thereafter to Parliament for hearing. The World Bank and the IMF have just prepared a Joint
Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) to advise the Government on how to further improve the
implementation of the EGSPRS. Meanwhile, the Bank is assisting the Government improve
the integration of its planning, budgeting, and monitoring systems.
World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy And Lending
Country Assistance Strategy. The current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was approved
by World Bank Board on April 29, 2004. The Bank’s CAS is broadly aligned with the
EGSPRS and supports a subset of priorities that reflect development areas where the World
Bank has a comparative advantage. The Bank plays a significant financial role in Mongolia,
with Bank funds accounting for 25 percent of Government investment. The Bank also plays a
strategic role in Mongolia’s development through its analytical and advisory services. The
structure of Bank’s lending program is well aligned with the EGSPRS. According to the
IDA-14 grant eligibility criterion calculations, Mongolia has qualified to receive grant-only
assistance in the Bank’s fiscal year 2006. About 49 percent of the portfolio is in
infrastructure projects (Energy, Transport, and Services Improvement), 29 percent of the

- 47 -

ANNEX IV

projects are in financial and private sector development, 11 percent of the portfolio is
focusing on providing sustainable livelihoods to the poor, while the remaining 11 percent of
the projects assisting with public sector reform. The Bank’s CAS embodies a “results based
approach” that relates outcomes to the country’s longer term EGSPRS goals, including the
MDGs.
Aid coordination. Bank lending to Mongolia represents about 11 percent of the country’s
overall Official Development Assistance (ODA) flows, implying the need to be selective and
to complement other donor efforts. The Government is working with external partners to
implement a harmonization plan presented at the 2003 Consultative Group meeting held in
Tokyo. To this end, four government-donor working groups have been established to
improve sectoral and cross-sectoral coordination. The five major development partners of
Mongolia are the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Germany, Japan, the United States, and
the World Bank accounting for approximately 87 percent of gross ODA in 2001-02. External
partners are moving toward aligning their support for capacity building and addressing some
of the bottlenecks identified in the EGSPRS. The new ADB country strategy paper (CSP) for
2005-2006, which was finalized in 2004, is also aligned with EGSPRS priorities. At the
Consultative Group meeting in 2003 both the ADB and the World Bank re-confirmed the
need to strengthen upstream donor coordination through their respective CSP and CAS
processes. The USAID 2004-2008 Strategic Plan for Mongolia, which was approved in 2003,
is also broadly in line with EGSPRS objectives on private sector development and
governance. The 2002-2006 United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF)
further complements the development activities that are being undertaken in Mongolia by the
Government, civil society and other international donors.
IMF-World Bank Collaboration In Specific Areas
The Bank and Fund teams are closely coordinating their policy advice to the Mongolian
authorities. There is collaboration in terms of common objectives, joint missions (such as
participation in the IMF’s Article IV Consultations and the Expenditure Policy Reform
missions, among others) and in determining structural reform measures to help implement
the Government’s EGSPRS.
Public Sector and Fiscal framework. The Bank is working with the Government to
strengthen the public finance management framework and civil service administration
through the provision of analytical advice, technical assistance, and investment projects. The
proposed first Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) will focus on public expenditure
management and civil service reforms. Meanwhile, the Fund is providing advice on fiscal
policy, monetary policy, and to strengthen Central Bank governance. Treasury reform advice
is a shared responsibility with the Bank, with the latter undertaking this in the context of the
Economic Capacity Technical Assistance Credit (ECTAC) project, a recently completed
Fiscal Technical Assistance (TA) project and several related trust fund-supported activities.
Public expenditure management. The Bank is assisting the Government to improve budget
planning, execution, reporting and accountability and improve public administration. This

- 48 -

ANNEX IV

includes technical assistance (Fiscal Technical Assistance Project – Fiscal TA and Economic
Capacity Technical Assistance Credit –ECTAC) to support institutional reforms and policy
development; training and capacity building; and a major upgrading of core information
systems for public financial management. These interventions are based on recommendations
of the Bank’s Public Expenditure and Financial Management Review for Mongolia (2003).
In addition, the Bank has been implementing an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) Grant
to provide technical assistance to the Ulaan Baatar Municipality (UBM) for strengthening the
processes for formulation and execution of its public expenditure policies.
Civil service reform. Through the ECTAC and an IDF grant the Bank is providing advice
and capacity-building support to: (i) assist with implementation of the Civil Service Reform
Strategy, passed by Parliament in 2004; (ii) strengthen medium term human resource policy
and expenditure formulation in context of the medium term budget framework (MTBF) in
light of the EGSPRS; and (iii) human resource expenditure execution by improving payroll
management through greater control of personnel expenditures.
In the financial sector, the Bank has increased its involvement since late 1999 through a
financial sector review and the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC) program. The
objectives of the FSAC were to support the government’s medium-term strategy for financial
sector reform and development, focusing on strengthening of prudential regulation and
supervision, bank restructuring and privatization, resumption of Government payments
services in the rural areas, and timely servicing of Government debt. The FSAC was closed
in September 2004 with all the tranches disbursed. The Bank is also working with the
Government and selected commercial banks to strengthen the banking system’s capacity in
credit risk management, automated payments system and Savings Bank resolution under the
Financial Capacity Development Project (FCDP). The mid-term review is under way with a
view to updating the Bank's assistance program to address the new challenges, and renewing
the government's long-term strategy for financial sector reform and development. In addition,
development of the legal and regulatory framework for financial holding companies and
NBFIs is an important policy requirement under the PRSCs.
In the area of Private Sector Development, the Bank Group started its assistance program
for private sector development through operations which supported state-owned enterprise
reforms and legal and regulatory changes in the early and mid-1990s. Since late 1990s, the
Bank has focused on alleviating the access to finance problem through the above mentioned
PSDC project. Following the closing of this project, the Bank has prepared a follow up
operation (PSDC II) which was approved by the Board in June 2005. This project will
continue to support SME growth through longer-term financing of eligible capital investment
projects. In addition, the Bank has been promoting private sector participation in service
delivery through lending and non-lending operations that aim at enhancing the regulatory
framework and business environment. In mid-2004, the Bank initiated an integrated study
that combines an assessment of the investment climate (through surveys of firms and
household-based enterprises) with competitiveness studies of supply chains in priority
sectors and a diagnostic trade integration study. The aims of this integrated study are (i) to
help both the Government and the Bank better understand the main constraints to private

- 49 -

ANNEX IV

sector development in Mongolia and (ii) to identify a set of concrete steps—policy reforms
and/or programmatic interventions—that the government of Mongolia might take to promote
market-oriented private-sector activity and greater integration with the global economy. The
study, which is to be completed in end-2005, complements the earlier cashmere report (2003)
and the mining sector (2004) reports. The findings from these studies are expected to feed
into the development of a PSD strategy and the Bank’s assistance program in these areas.
New lending operations encouraging private sector participation in infrastructure sector are
also being considered over the next three- to four-year period.
Meanwhile, IFC became a minority owner of two Mongolian banks in 2004. The IFC
involvement is expected to help enhance corporate governance and introduce international
best banking practices in the banks. In addition, IFC provided funding support to a
microfinance bank to support its operations and liquidity, and is currently providing technical
assistance for developing leasing industry. IFC has also provided funding support to
encourage micro-finance through the banking sector in Mongolia.
Social Sector and Poverty. The Bank has provided assistance to the Government to redesign
and implement its household income and expenditure surveys. It has also assisted the
Government conduct the subsequent poverty analysis and to obtain an updated poverty
profile for Mongolia, albeit as of 2002 due to data availability and access considerations. The
Bank is currently undertaking a Poverty Assessment. In this regard, a series of policy notes
were discussed with the Government and other stakeholders in June 2005. The full report is
under preparation. Also, the Bank is working with the Government to improve financial and
budget management in the social sectors. In terms of sectoral policies in health, the Bank has
been working with the Government on hospital rationalization, and will work on broader
health financing/system issues in the coming years. The Bank has assisted in analyzing the
sustainability of the pension scheme, and a study is being initiated to assess the efficiency of
the targeted social assistance schemes in Mongolia using household survey data. Together
with the updated poverty assessment, the study will form the analytical basis for the redesign
of the cash transfer programs. In this regard, a workshop was organized at the request of the
Government on social transfer programs in October 2004.
The Bank is working with the Fund and ADB to ensure policy consistency and coordination,
particularly regarding the budgetary impact of social policies and the need to protect social
expenditures and pro-poor investments in Mongolia. The Bank is also working towards
preparing a Rural School Support project in order to support rural schools in bagh and soums
(the lowest level administrative units in Government) in remote areas, to train its teachers,
and supply these schools with reading materials and school supplies. The Bank is conducting
a Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS) that aims to identify gaps in the planned and
approved budget for the education sector. This study is expected be disseminated later this
year. Under the PHRD-I Grant for the preparation of the PRSC-I, an analysis of Mongolia’s
existing pension system; an audit of the SSIGO (State Social Insurance General Office) and
SIF (Social Insurance Fund); an operational assessment of the State Training and Education
Fund (in charge of issuing student loans and grants) have been undertaken. Currently, the

- 50 -

ANNEX IV

Bank is working with the government to create a database for tracking implementation
progress of the recently initiated Child Money program.
Rural and Urban Development. In the rural sector, the Bank is assisting the Government in
the development of rural strategies and promotes secure and sustainable livelihoods through
activities in pastoral risk management, microfinance services, basic infrastructure investment
(through community-driven approaches), and the piloting of a new index-based livestock
insurance product. To this end, an Index-based livestock insurance project (IBLIP) was
approved by the World Bank Board in May 2005. In the area of urban development, the
Bank is assisting the Government formulate its city development strategy. The Bank is also
supporting the improvement of basic services delivery, particularly the provision of water
supply and Ger area upgrading.15 Finally, the Bank also helping the Government assess the
urban poverty situation in Mongolia. Meanwhile, the Bank and the Fund are collaborating
and coordinating their assistance in the domain of municipal finance and intergovernmental
fiscal relations.
Infrastructure. With a view of helping to shape sectoral strategies in Mongolia, the Bank is
preparing an Infrastructure Strategy Report that will examine the Government’s prioritization
of infrastructure investments and their fiscal impact. The Bank and Fund have a common
interest in monitoring inter-enterprise arrears, conducting social impact assessments of
energy prices, enhancing transparency in investment decisions and related financing
arrangements (e.g. in road sector financing), along with the efficient management and costeffective use of public funds.
Corruption, Justice and Legal Environment. There is an increasing recognition among
many policymakers and key stakeholders that the problem of corruption has reached levels
that warrant focused attention in Mongolia. The implementation of the Public Sector
Management and Finance Law (PSMFL) and the drafting of an Anti-Corruption Law are
positive steps towards tackling this problem, but much will depend on the quality of the laws,
associated implementing rules and regulations many of which are still being drafted or yet to
be approved. Media publicity is significant and could act as a deterrent against corruption.
However, key systemic constraints remain. Decision making is still perceived to be nontransparent, and patronage and lack of accountability remain major problems. In an endeavor
to assist the Government strengthen the rule of law in Mongolia, the Fund focuses on the
Central Bank and Anti-Money Laundering laws, while the Bank assists in enhancing public
confidence in the legal system with a focus on judicial reforms. Nevertheless, challenges
remain in enhancing access to justice, especially for the poor; disseminating new laws to the
public; and enforcing existing laws.
MIGA: Mongolia signed the MIGA convention in 1991 and ratified it the following year.
MIGA will be able to assist the country in attracting foreign investment through its
marketing and guarantee activities.

Mongolia became a member of the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in February 1991.
AsDB operations in Mongolia have been guided by its Country Operational Strategy (COS).
The first COS covering 1994–99 was prepared in 1994. It was aimed at facilitating
Mongolia’s transition to a market economy by (i) creating an environment in which a
competitive efficient market economy can flourish; (ii) developing the human resources and
skills necessary for a market economy; and (iii) developing the infrastructure needed for a
market economy.
In line with the Poverty Reduction Strategy approved by the AsDB Board in 1999, AsDB
entered into a Poverty Partnership Agreement (PPA) with the Government of Mongolia
in 2000. Within the framework of the PPA and built on the lessons learned during the
period 1994–99, AsDB formulated in May 2000 its new COS for 2000–05, placing poverty
reduction at the highest level of importance to be achieved through pro-poor interventions
that foster private sector-led economic growth and good governance, through selected
interventions in AsDB six core sectors, namely, finance, public sector, social sector,
agriculture, urban development and road.
AsDB is currently developing the new strategy for Mongolia, now called Country Strategy
and Program (CSP), expected to be completed in September 2005. This new CSP, covering
the period 2006-2008, is based on extensive consultations with stakeholders, on an analysis
of development constraints and poverty conditions, and on the Government’s strategic
priorities as set out in the EGSPRS. AsDB’s strategy over 2006–2008 will rest on two pillars:
(i) promoting broad-based economic growth⎯in particular economically diverse, stable, and
geographically distributed growth; and (ii) supporting inclusive social development⎯with a
concentration on improving the access of the poor to stable incomes and public services.
This CSP also takes an important step towards adopting a results-based program.
Effectiveness and efficiency of development initiatives are a major consideration in the
selection of strategic interventions. This CSP identifies development results that AsDB will
help achieve and establishes clearly defined outcomes that are expected during the
implementation of the CSP. This results-based approach is set within the larger context of
assisting the Government in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of its own
governance mechanisms.
AsDB also has a window—the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) for private
sector operation without government guarantee. After the successful participation of AsDB
in providing assistance to the Government in the privatization of selected banks, PSOD is
exploring the feasibility of setting up a shareholders loan fund in Mongolia.

ANNEX V

By December 2004, the AsDB had approved 34 loans from the Asian Development Fund
(ADF) totaling $605.8 million. In addition, by that date, the AsDB had approved
118 technical assistance (TA) grants amounting to $57.22 million. In 2005 two loans are
expected to be approved, the Financial Sector Reform Program to address remaining
weaknesses in the banking and in the non banking financial sectors, and the Education Sector
Development Project which mainly focuses on the development of a new education master
plan. In addition $2 million are planned for technical assistance in urban and housing,
governance, transport, and capacity building for education and the financial sector.
To ensure more effective use of development resources to achieve the development goals,
AsDB follows the policy on performance-based allocation of its concessional ADF
resources. According to this policy AsDB allocates the ADF resources to its eligible member
countries including Mongolia, based on a country performance assessment. The country
assessment focuses on major indicators concerning sustainable economic growth, socially
inclusive development, governance and public sector management, and portfolio
performance. Mongolia has performed satisfactorily measured against these benchmarks.
The AsDB has regularly participated in Mongolia Consultative Group meetings and
coordinated its operations with the IMF, the World Bank and other donors. At the Tenth
Assistance Group Meeting held Tokyo in November 2003, the AsDB delivered the joint
donors’ statement. Through this and other forums, the AsDB will continue to be actively
involved in policy dialogue with the government, particularly with regard to continuing of
reforms in: (i) achieving greater efficiency in the delivery of social services; (ii) the
promotion of good governance in formulating effective policies and establishing efficient
institutions; (iii) public sector management and finance which will lay a foundation for
effective macroeconomic management; and (iv) the financial sector, to provide affordable
financing services badly needed for increased private sector investment and production
efficiency. The AsDB will also continue to assist the Government in strengthening its
capacity in aid coordination, and planning and management of public investments. AsDB’s
effectiveness in delivering its program of assistance to Mongolia has been strengthened with
the official opening and full operation of a Resident Mission in August 2001.
Since March 2002, Mongolia participates as a full member of the AsDB supported
sub-regional cooperation for the Central Asian Republics and People’s Republic of China
(PRC). This sub-regional cooperation provides Mongolia with a new dimension to participate
in regional cooperation on a wider geographic basis. Started with a moderate program
in 2000, AsDB has assisted Mongolia and PRC to establish a very effective institutional
framework to promote and coordinate between the two countries. Cooperation in
transportation, trade and investment and environmental management has been identified as a
common priority.

Mongolia: Statistical Issues
1.

Progress to Date

The Mongolian authorities have established a framework for monitoring macroeconomic
developments and have made substantial improvements in all statistical areas with extensive
technical assistance, including from the Fund. Core data are provided on a timely basis.
Mongolia is participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), and its
metadata were posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) in August
2000. A ROSC mission that visited Mongolia in May 2000 assessed data dissemination
practices in Mongolia in relation to the IMF’s GDDS. The data module of the ROSC for
Mongolia was published on the IMF website in May 2001.1
A STA mission to assist in further improving national accounts visited Mongolia in February
2000. In conjunction with this mission, the authorities revised the annual GDP estimates for
1995–99 to incorporate new source data and rebase the accounts to 1995 prices. An advisor
assisted the NSO during August 2001- September 2003, in improving primary data collection
and compilation systems for national accounts and price statistics.
Based on the recommendations of the 2000 STA mission on consumer price statistics, the
methodology utilized to compile the CPI was substantially revised in January 2001. The
main revisions were : (i) the CPI basket was updated based on the results of the 1999
Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES); (ii) the CPI weights were updated using
the results of the 1999 HIES and the 2000 HIES, with the latter update done in March 2002;
and (iii) the CPI was rebased from December 1995 to December 2000.
The authorities adopted systematic procedures for compiling annual fiscal reports for the
general government and each of its subsectors. GFS data are also compiled on a monthly
basis for all subsectors, except the extrabudgetary central government. All extrabudgetary
agencies and funds should be examined to determine whether they should be included in the
budgetary central government sector or the public corporations sector. The authorities also
completed an inventory of all government bank accounts and instituted stricter standards for
registering bank accounts for government agencies to allow full reconciliation between
government accounts data and banking data. However, adequate reconciliation of monetary
and fiscal data and implementation of other technical assistance recommendations are
pending.
In November 2004, STA assisted the authorities in compiling the government accounts for
2003 according to the guidelines of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. The
As the ROSC was not prepared on the basis of the Data Quality Assessment Framework, no
ratings were given. Consequently, the TCIRS does not include memo items on data quality.

mission also provided extensive on-the-job training in GFSM 2001 methodology. Data were
prepared and reported in the new format for publication in the 2004 GFS Yearbook. Although
the chart of accounts generally follows the GFSM 2001, the mission recommended further
improvements to the classification of assets and liabilities. A planned introduction of a
computerized government financial management information system could improve data
collection and processing, although severe staff constraints may limit the MOF’s ability to
implement all the recommendations of the mission and further technical assistance may be
required.
The 2001 monetary and financial statistics mission found that the Bank of Mongolia (BOM)
implemented most of the recommendations of the 1997 STA mission, including the valuation
of monetary gold and the recording of Fund accounts in the BOM balance sheet.
In May 2001, a long-term resident advisor completed a 26-month assignment to help develop
the balance of payments statistics compilation system, which included the implementation of
an enterprise survey. The results from the survey were reflected in the 1999 balance of
payments data and used to generate partial international investment position estimates for the
nonbank sector. A new report form on international transactions that pass through domestic
banks was developed. With the BOM’s new regulation requiring banks to report international
transactions effective from January 1, 2002, the accuracy and timeliness of BOP statistics are
expected to be substantially enhanced.
The 2004 technical assistance mission, however, noted that the Bank of Mongolia failed to
sustain the implementation of the work of the long-term advisor, as very little use is made of
data from the enterprise survey due to its low response rate. In addition, although partial
information exists to compile an international investment position, such data are not
compiled.
2.

Outstanding Issues

•

While some progress has been made in developing a national accounts framework,
the quality of GDP estimates, particularly with respect to the current deflation
methods for constant price estimates, could be improved further. A proper
methodological treatment of animal losses due to harsh winters has been finalized.
Efforts are also needed to improve coverage of the informal sector and small-scale
activity, especially in the services sector. Raw data could be refined with a view to
producing reliable quarterly estimates of GDP. Furthermore, the construction of
expenditure-based national accounts in constant price terms would serve as a useful
check for the production side estimates.

•

The NSO has produced a national CPI, but progress in implementing the
recommendations of the STA mission to develop a producer price index has been
limited mainly due to resource and capacity constraints.

- 56 -

ANNEX VI

•

There are a number of deficiencies in the data on wages and earnings. The
development of labor market statistics through the establishment of quarterly sample
surveys would help mitigate these shortcomings. The government conducted a survey
of the civil service in May 2002, which would help to produce a detailed database on
civil service employment and wages.

•

The May 2001 STA mission identified a number of issues, including the coverage of
monetary statistics, classification of a number of foreign on-lent loans, and recording
of repurchase agreements on the treasury bills. The BOM is following up on the
recommendations of the mission. A TA mission is scheduled for October 2005 to
review the progress to date and to assist the BOM in the implementation of the
MFSM methodology.

•

The quality of fiscal data––provided for budgetary purposes and publication in the
GFS Yearbook––could be further improved. Improvements are underway in light of
the FAD/STA mission of March 2001 and subsequent GFS missions in 2003 and
2004. Key shortcomings affecting annual and subannual data have been lack of
coverage of the government accounts, weaknesses in source accounting data,
undocumented compilation and consolidation procedures, and lack of reconciliation
between government accounts data and banking data at an aggregate level. The
implementation of an integrated government-wide chart of accounts should help
resolve the underlying technical problems while ongoing treasury reforms should
significantly improve accounting and reporting practices.

•

Despite the improvement in the coverage of the BOP, further improvement is needed,
particularly on data on remittances of migrant workers abroad and foreign direct
investment.

Publications

The NSO publishes monthly and annual Statistical Bulletins in English and Mongolian.
These bulletins include data on population, employment, national accounts, prices, household
income and expenditure, central and local government revenue and expenditure, and external
trade. The BOM publishes a monthly Statistical Bulletin (within 15 days of the end of the
month, which includes summary statistics for the central bank, consolidated balance sheet of
commercial banks, and interest and exchange rate data) and Annual Reports since 1993.

Options for Tax and Expenditure Policy Reforms
Options for Tax Policy Reforms
With tax revenues at about 30 percent of GDP, Mongolia compares favorably with countries of
comparable levels of development. The revenue productivity of taxes, especially VAT, is
significantly higher than in many developing countries, despite tax rates broadly in line with those in
the region and even, in some cases, lower than in many other developing countries. However, high
spending requires high and distortionary taxation and borrowing, which reduces the resources
available to the private sector and increases incentives for informality. To enhance the private sector’s
economic environment, the authorities intend to improve their tax system by undertaking further
reforms of their tax policies and clarifying and simplifying their tax laws. In addition, the authorities
have been considering specific proposals to unify the CIT, PIT and VAT rates, and increase royalty
rates to extract more revenue from the mining sector. A FAD Technical assistance mission visited
Ulaanbaatar in October 2004, reviewed Mongolia’s tax system and made recommendations to
improve efficiency, revenue productivity, and equity of the tax system. The Article IV mission’s
recommendations were based on the findings of FAD mission.
Identified weaknesses in the current tax system:
•
•
•
•

corporate income tax (CIT) limits deductions such as for advertising, has no provisions for
loss carry-forward, and its dual rate system is distortionary;
the system of tax incentives, relying on tax holidays and concessional PIT rates, discriminates
between and within sectors, and between domestic and foreign investors;
there is a significant amount of cascading under the VAT due to a poorly working refund
system and important exemptions;
the threshold for the personal income tax (PIT) is substantially lower than in many other
developing countries, raising equity and administrative issues.

In order to remove these weaknesses under a comprehensive, revenue neutral tax reform
program, the Article IV mission recommended:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

removing exemptions;
unifying the CIT at 25 percent, in two phases;
removing restrictions on legitimate business expenses, and providing for loss carry forward;
introducing a cost effective system of tax incentives based on investment tax credits;
reducing the cascading under the VAT by providing, among other things, input tax credits for
pre-production expenses and pre-registration stock of goods;
increasing the threshold of PIT by 75 percent;
introducing taxes on domestic beer and telecommunication services, and restructuring and
increasing the rate of excises on cars in order to offset revenue losses from these measures.

On the possible proposal for a flat tax system, the mission acknowledged that single rates can
encourage compliance and reduce complexity, but also noted that it is generally unlikely that tax
rate cuts would pay for themselves unless authorities undertake significant reforms to improve tax
administration and to improve the efficiency, equity, and revenue productivity of their tax system.
As to increasing the tax burden on mining sector, the mission raised its concerns that increasing
the taxes unduly on the mining sector would send a negative signal, scaring away new investment
in a sector that is key to growth of the Mongolian economy. The authorities were advised to heed the
recommendations that will be provided by the World Bank on mining sector taxation.

- 59 -

ANNEX VII

In July 2005, the authorities submitted to parliament a draft tax reform proposal to be
discussed during the Fall session of the parliament. The proposal incorporates part of the mission’s
recommendations such as the removal of the limits on legitimate business expenses, introduction of
investment tax credits, removal of the tax incentives in the form of tax holidays and reduced tax rates,
and increasing the threshold of PIT by 75 percent. However, the authorities have not yet incorporated
some other key recommendations such as unifying the CIT at 25 percent and introducing changes to
reduce the cascading under the VAT. The authorities are also considering several proposals that also
have some elements about which the Article IV mission had raised concerns. These were increasing
custom tariffs for imported goods on milk and milk products, soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, leather
products. Not included in the package but also being discussed were reducing the social insurance
employer contribution rates and increasing the royalties and mining license fees.
Options for Expenditure Reforms
At over 40 percent of GDP, public spending in Mongolia is high in comparison with other
transition countries, comparing, for example, with an average spending level of 19 percent of GDP
in 2000-03 in seven low-income countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Moreover,
despite significantly higher social spending than in these countries, social outcomes indicators, such
as education achievement and health outcomes, are comparable. A January FAD Expenditure Policy
mission assessed options for government expenditure savings and efficiency enhancement.
Identified weaknesses in the expenditure policy of the authorities:
•
•
•
•

despite highly favorable demographics, the pension system is unsustainable, due to low
retirement ages, a limited contribution base, and a high minimum benefits;
social assistance for vulnerable groups is a patchwork of overlapping and poorly targeted
benefits;
government spending on education and health is relatively high and inefficient;
administrative expenditures are high, reflecting duplication, and overstaffing.

In light of the recommendations of the TA mission, to increase spending efficiency and identify
areas for savings the Article IV mission recommended:
•

enhancing the pension system’s sustainability by raising the retirement age, lengthening the
wage reference period for pension calculations, phasing in the notional defined contribution
system, indexing the minimum pension to CPI instead of the minimum wage, and integrating
the collection of social contributions with the administration of taxes;

•

rationalizing social assistance by eliminating overlapping family benefits, developing an
information management system for monitoring of the system of benefits, designing and
introducing a specific social safety net for vulnerable herders to provide cost-effective
protection during occasional severe winters;

•

increasing the efficiency in health and education by increasing the weekly norm for teaching
hours, consolidating public tertiary education institutions, eliminating public health services
of a purely private nature, limiting fully free public health insurance only to the poor;

•

reducing administrative expenditures, including the wage bill, by eliminating retirement and
tuition grants for civil servants, imposing a partial hiring freeze to reduce excess support
staff, and containing increases in wages of support staff to inflation.

APPENDIX

MONGOLIA—JOINT FUND-BANK DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Introduction
1.
This appendix presents the joint debt sustainability analysis (DSA) of the IMF and
the World Bank staff based on the common standard framework for low-income countries,
which has been approved by the respective Executive Boards.1 The assessment is based on a
forward-looking analysis of debt and debt-service dynamics, taking into account debt burden
thresholds that depend on the quality of a country’s policies.
2.
The DSA comprises: (i) a baseline scenario, and (ii) set of alternative scenarios
and bound tests. Whereas the baseline scenario is set up on the most plausible medium- and
long-term assumptions on key macro economic parameters and economic policies, the
alternative scenarios and bound tests are intended to explore the robustness of baseline
projections to alternative assumptions and shocks to macroeconomic policies and indicators.
Bound tests include the customary analysis of macroeconomic variables at one standard
deviation from their historical averages, as well as Mongolia-specific shocks, such as copper
and gold price fluctuations. The importance of a borrowing strategy that seeks to contain the
risk of debt distress is also covered.
3.
Reflecting data availability, the DSA covers only public and publicly-guaranteed
debt and excludes private sector debt and contingent liabilities. There are several
proposals being discussed with foreign partners that would represent large borrowing
commitments (more than 20 percent of GDP). These have been excluded from the analysis
given that terms and conditions as well as government involvements in repayment
obligations are not clear at the time of this analysis. It is also assumed that all the domestic
public debt will be fully repaid by 2008; therefore, all the public debts are external
after 2009.
4.
While there are important differences across the various debt and debt-service
indicators, the overall results suggest Mongolia is at relatively high risk of debt distress.
The main findings include: (i) only one indicator—NPV of debt to GDP ratio—is above its
threshold under the baseline scenario, (ii) other indicators are well below their threshold over
the entire projected period, but (iii) terms of trade shock would exacerbate these indicators
above the thresholds.
5.
Discussions for the DSA were conducted jointly by the Fund mission team, the
authorities, and the World Bank mission team in the context of the 2005 Article IV
consultation discussions. The Fund and Bank teams were in agreement about the
1

Countries—Further Considerations(www.imf.org).

- 61 -

APPENDIX

implications of the scenarios. While noting the difficulties of long-term forecasting, the
authorities also agreed broadly on the baseline macroeconomic assumptions and with the
main findings.
B. Baseline Medium- and Long-Term Scenario
Basic Assumptions and Thresholds
6.
The baseline scenario is built on continuation of prudent macroeconomic
management. The key assumptions include: (i) an average real GDP growth rate at 5 percent
(except for 6 percent in 2006), (ii) an increase in export growth in current dollar terms from
about 3½ percent in the medium term to 6½ percent in the long term, and (iii) a more gradual
increase in import growth in current dollar terms from about 4¾ percent in the medium term
to 6 percent in the long term. The output growth around 5 percent is based on the continued
development in mining sector, with no large-scale discovery of new mining fields assumed.
In addition to the mining sector, the main drivers of Mongolia’s economic growth are the
agriculture (livestock) and services sectors (especially trade, transport and wholesale
activities). The export projections reflect the WEO assumption of copper price adjustment to
their long-term trend. The improved trade and investment policies, which create the
environment for business and attract foreign direct investment, are also key factors to support
a favorable output and export growth. With fiscal policy aimed at saving the current highexport price windfall, it is also assumed that all the domestic public debt will be fully repaid
by 2008.
7.
On the external financing side, it is assumed that new borrowing continues to be
modest and contracted on concessional terms. New borrowing is projected to remain at
around US$115 million annually over the medium term, and then to increase by about
2 ½ percent annually over the longer term, reflecting a prudent external debt management
strategy. An average concessionality level of new external borrowing is assumed at around
47 percent, which is equivalent to the current level. Grants are assumed to increase by
2 percent annually over time with slightly higher rates in 2006 and 2007 to reflect IDA grant
financing that would be allocated during 2005-06.
8.
Mongolia is rated as a medium performer with regard to its policies and
institutions as of end-June 2005 under the joint IMF-WB DSA framework for LICs.2 As
a medium performer, the thresholds applied to Mongolia are: (i) 150 percent for Net Present
Value (NPV) of debt-to-exports, (ii) 40 percent for NPV of debt-to-GDP, and (iii)
250 percent for NPV of debt-to-fiscal revenue. The relevant debt service thresholds are

2

In the LIC DSA framework, the quality of country’s policies and institutions is measured
by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index, and
classified into three categories: strong, medium and poor.

- 62 -

APPENDIX

(i) 20 percent of exports and (ii) 30 percent of revenues. Therefore, the debt sustainability is
analyzed in relation to these thresholds in this appendix.
External DSA (Table 2a)
9.
Under the staff’s baseline scenario, the NPV of the debt-to-GDP ratio
(55 percent at end-2004), which is the only indicator initially above its threshold,
declines to below the threshold in the long term. The indicator is expected to come down
below the threshold but only during the later stage of projected period. On the other hand, the
NPV of the debt-to-export ratio begins well below the corresponding threshold (150 percent)
and remains there during the entire projection period. This reflects the fact that Mongolia
would continue to benefit from the rich mineral resources that have led to the high export-toGDP ratio. Also, given that most of the external debt is on concessional terms, the debt
service ratio would stay at around 4 percent of exports under the baseline scenario, against
the 20 percent threshold.
Fiscal DSA (Table 1a)
10.
Debt indicators relative to government revenue also stay well below the
threshold, and experience a steady improvement. The NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio would
decline from around 150 percent in the medium term to 121 percent by 2015 and further to
below 100 percent by 2025. The associated debt service ratio would increase to 7.3 percent
in 2009, but subsequently would decline gradually to 5 percent in 2025. These projections
are based on a slight decline of revenue-to-GDP ratio from 39 percent in 2005 to 34 percent
by 2010, keeping the same level thereafter.
C. Bound Tests Applied to Baseline and Alternative Scenarios
External DSA (Table 2b)
11.
The bound tests suggest that external debt indicators could deteriorate
considerably in the face of adverse external developments, especially terms of trade
shocks. Given that copper and gold account for about half of the Mongolia’s total exports,
the impacts of exogenous shocks on these commodities were simulated as a Mongoliaspecific bound test. Specifically, the test assumes that copper and gold prices decline by
30 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in 2008, and each rises by 1 percent annually
during 2009-25; the test also assumes that the volume growth of gold export is half of the
baseline scenario in and after 2008 as the lower price would reduce investors’ motivations
for exploration and development (Case B.2 in Table 2b). As a consequence of these terms of
trade shocks and their income effects, it is assumed that the real GDP growth rate is less by
0.5 percent in 2008 and by 0.25 percent thereafter compared to baseline scenario. Under
these assumptions, both NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio and debt-to-export ratio deteriorate to
well above the corresponding thresholds and do not return to the sustainable paths, showing
high vulnerability to international commodity prices.

- 63 -

APPENDIX

12.
While the shocks to the interest rate remain manageable in the long term, the
debt burden would become heavier in the medium term. This test is to try to capture the
impacts of low concessionality of external borrowing (Case A.2 in Table 2b). We assume
that the average interest rate rises to 1.6 percent in 2008 and gradually to 2.4 percent
until 2012 and stays thereafter, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the
baseline scenario. Under this test, which is equivalent to treating all new external debt as
nonconcessional, the debt burden becomes heavier over the medium term before the debt
dynamics return to the sustainable path in the long term.3 For example, the NPV of
debt-to-GDP ratio would reach 60 percent after 2008, and remains high for several years.
13.
Any relaxation of the authorities’ prudent approach to contracting external debt
could have serious consequences for debt sustainability. In particular, large scale external
borrowing on non-concessional terms, currently under negotiations on top of the baseline
scenario, would further worsen the situation. Especially, the involvement of nontransparent
negotiations and procurement procedures arising from any political pressure would increase
a total cost of projects even if the terms of financial contracts alone were concessional. The
calling for contingent liabilities such as central bank guarantees on private sector borrowing
would also risk a sustainable path under the baseline scenario.
Fiscal DSA (Table 1b)
14.
Indicators relative to government revenue also show vulnerability to some
shocks and alternative scenarios. For example, if real GDP growth and fiscal performance
were to revert to their historical averages (case A1 in Table 1b), the analysis shows that the
level of public debt would be unsustainable, with the NPVs of public debt rising to nearly
100 percent of GDP (300 percent of revenue). Also, under the hypothetical 30 percent real
exchange rate depreciation in 2006 (case B4 in Table 1b), the NPV ratio would jump up to
76 percent of GDP (203 percent of revenue) in 2006 and would remain around 70 percent of
GDP (200 percent of revenue) though 2010.
D. Debt Distress Classification
15.
Mongolia is at moderate risk of debt distress over the medium term, although
the debt burden should be sustainable over the long term if the authorities continue to
contract external debt only on concessional terms and the external economic
environment is not very unfavorable. The NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio indicates a breach of
its threshold over a number of years under the baseline scenario. In addition, some of the
alternative scenarios and bound tests exacerbate other debt indicators by breaching or
3

This assumption reflects a hypothetical situation where possible nonconcessional borrowing
from China and Turkey under negotiations would completely substitute concessional

nearing the relevant thresholds. However, under the staff’s baseline scenario, Mongolia’s
public external debt ratio declines substantially in the long term. Also, given the high
concessionality of external public debt, debt service indicators to export and revenue remain
well below relevant thresholds. Other indicators such as NPV of debt-to-export ratio and
NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio also stay well below the respective thresholds of 150 and
250 percent.
16.
Mongolia’s past record suggests authorities’ strong commitment in meeting
external debt obligations. Reflecting a large share of highly concessional borrowing from
multilaterals, debt service obligation has been manageable. Thus, Mongolia has never availed
itself of the Paris Club debt relief. The authorities continue to negotiate with some bilateral
creditors over rescheduling and/or restructuring agreements that were originated during the
early stage of economic transition.
E. Summary and Conclusions
17.
Under the prudent macroeconomic and external debt management policies,
Mongolia’s debt indicators are projected to improve over the medium-to-long term, but
any slippage of these policies would have adverse consequences on public external debt
sustainability. The stress tests suggest that external debt indicators would become
unsustainable under adverse external developments, especially terms of trade shocks such as
the sharp decline in copper and gold prices or a substantial currency depreciation. Also,
while the shocks to the interest on new external borrowing should remain manageable over
the longer term, the debt burden could initially worsen over the near-to-medium term.
18.
Staying on a sustainable path would crucially require that Mongolia (i) continues
to secure concessional external loans and grants, (ii) resists any political pressures of large
borrowing commitments, which would involve nontransparent negotiation and procurement
procedures. Mongolia also needs to promote private sector development to underpin
investment-led solid growth, which contributes to sustainable debt dynamics.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
September 21, 2005

This statement outlines developments since the staff report was issued. The reported
information does not affect the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Fiscal and monetary developments over the past two months remained broadly consistent
with the trends in the first half of the year.
•

According to the latest available fiscal data, revenues continue to perform strongly
across the whole array of taxes and the stock of net domestic bank financing has been
reduced by 3¼ percent of GDP in the first eight months of the year. If spending
discipline is maintained, the overall deficit could remain below 2 percent of GDP in
2005.

•

Monetary aggregates continued to grow rapidly. Broad money grew by 28 percent,
year-on-year, at end-August, and reserve money growth accelerated, reflecting the
continued accumulation of net international reserves. After issuing extra central bank
bills in July, the Bank of Mongolia has not taken further steps to tighten monetary
policy.

As anticipated in the staff report, inflation is finally slowing down. The annual headline
inflation rate declined to 11½ percent at end-August, from 17½ percent at end-June, while
core inflation also slowed to 5 percent year-on-year, from close to 9 percent at end-June.
Underlying this favorable movement is the waning of supply shocks in the meat and
vegetables markets, and broad stability in other components of the index, including
petroleum products, whose domestic prices did not move between June and August. Further
increases in the price of petroleum products imported from Russia have already been
announced, which would bring Mongolia’s prices closer into line with world market levels.
Nevertheless, inflation for the year as a whole is still expected to be contained to the staff
projection of 10 percent.
Separately, Mongolia’s main Russian supplier of refined products has announced that it
would no longer sell to Mongolian importers after September. While other suppliers are
expected to fill this void, the move has the potential to cause temporary supply disruptions
and could lead to higher domestic prices.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 6, 2005

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Mongolia
On September 21, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Mongolia.1
Background
Mongolia’s overall economic performance was stronger than expected and broad based
in 2004 and early 2005. Sectoral contributions to high growth included a rebound in the
livestock sector from harsh winter shocks of 2000-01 (the “dzuds”) and strong mining
exploration and exports, boosted by a favorable environment of unusually high copper and
gold prices. The balance of payments has been strong, with favorable terms of trade, new
gold operations, good performance by the service sector, and robust capital flows in the
mining sector. The current account (including transfers) is estimated to have been in a
surplus equivalent to about one percent of GDP in 2004. High commodity export prices and
strong tourism and private transfers helped offset the increased cost of oil imports (more
than a fourth of total imports).
After several years of moderation, however, inflation has accelerated, reaching 17½ percent
through June 2005 (before easing significantly in August), as prices of fuels and meat have
increased very sharply in the past twelve months. These inflationary pressures threaten the
hard-won gains in macroeconomic stabilization in recent years.
Fiscal performance was good in 2004, with excellent prospects for 2005. Strong revenue
receipts reflected overall economic growth as well as higher-than-expected prices for
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2copper and volume for gold. The lowest overall deficit since the beginning of transition,
about 2 percent of GDP, allowed a notable decrease in indebtedness. For 2005, betterthan-projected revenue performance in the first half suggest the overall fiscal deficit is likely
to be lower than the budget target of about 3½ percent of GDP.
Monetary policy accommodated supply-side shocks, namely the close-to-full pass-through
of higher world oil prices, regulatory changes in the meat supply chain, and administrative
price adjustments in utilities. Although broad money grew at about the rate of nominal GDP
growth in 2004, slowing down from rates above 40 percent in earlier years, private credit
growth was still high in early 2005, reaching nearly 33 percent year-on-year at endJune 2005.
Concerns for the vulnerability of the banking sector have been heightened by high credit
growth and remaining weaknesses in supervision and enforcement of prudential rules.
The incidence of nonperforming loans (NPLs) increased from 8.3 percent at end-2003 to
more than 10 percent at mid-2005. Moreover, credit risk management of banks remains
fragile due to weaknesses in bank corporate governance, compounded by the sufficient
enforcement of applicable prudential standards.
Progress continues on structural reform, with efforts continuing to improve the tax
administration, banking supervision, and public enterprise restructuring. The authorities are
currently focusing attention on the vital energy sector. In addition, Mongolia’s poverty
reduction strategy concentrates on enhancing growth prospects and improving provision of
key services and social assistance.
Medium-term prospects are broadly favorable, provided the authorities manage to slow
inflation back to single digit and sustain supportive fiscal policies. Growth is expected to
settle around at least 5 percent, with a return to trend growth for the livestock sector. With
appropriate policy action, mainly on the monetary side, inflation should slow down, to about
10 percent year-on-year at end 2005, returning to a 5 percent trend in 2006. The balance of
payments is projected to weaken moderately, in line with a modest decline in the terms of
trade. Export growth is likely to turn negative in 2006 as world prices of copper are
projected to decline by a third from their record levels. However, import growth should slow
down, as oil prices are projected to stabilize. The current account balance (including official
transfers) is projected to move back into a deficit in the range of 4-5 percent of GDP over
the medium-term. Public debt, although high, is broadly sustainable because of its
concessional terms and the external and fiscal outlook.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Mongolian authorities for the recent strong growth
performance, the maintenance of broad macroeconomic stability, and for bringing the public
debt onto a more sustainable path. The potential for large increases in mineral extraction
was strengthening the medium-term economic outlook. Directors observed, however, that
Mongolia remains vulnerable to pronounced declines in copper prices and weather
conditions affecting the agricultural sector. They encouraged the authorities to implement an
ambitious structural reform agenda in order to strengthen sustainable growth and the

-3resilience of the economy, in particular by improving the environment for the private sector,
and to maintain their efforts to tackle poverty and achieve the Millennium Development
Goals. They also saw the need to take advantage of the favorable external environment to
continue debt consolidation and lower inflation further.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ aim to keep the overall deficit in 2005 well below the
original budget target in light of inflationary pressures and weaker current account
prospects. They urged the authorities to avoid expenditure slippages and save additional
revenues. For 2006 and beyond, Directors considered that the fiscal stance should be
broadly neutral, provided that inflationary pressures will have subsided. This would allow a
further sharp fall in borrowing from the domestic banking sector, with public debt declining in
GDP terms, while infrastructure improvements that will be critical for growth would be fully
financed.
Directors encouraged the authorities to proceed with revenue-neutral reforms aimed at
improving the overall efficiency of the tax system, broadening the tax base, eliminating
distortions in income taxes and the VAT, and strengthening revenue administration. On the
spending side, they recommended that the authorities avoid embarking on large
infrastructure projects with low rates of return. Given the still high debt level and the need to
preserve external sustainability, project borrowing should only be on concessional terms,
and without government or central bank guarantees. Directors welcomed plans for further
improvements in public financial management, including consolidating all budget resources
into the treasury single account, to ensure a tight control over public finances and to
improve transparency. They encouraged the authorities to press on with their plans for
reform of the civil service and pension systems.
Directors emphasized that further tightening of the monetary stance is needed to help
prevent supply-driven price increases from becoming embedded in persistent double-digit
inflation. They supported the use of central bank bills to mop up liquidity. Some Directors,
noting the high cost of these operations to the Bank of Mongolia (BOM), also recommended
that the BOM undertake a review of its monetary policy instruments.
Directors emphasized that Mongolia’s flexible exchange rate regime remains appropriate.
Directors urged the government to resist demands for trade-based measures to support
sectors hit by shocks, or other actions that would undermine the country’s open trading
system.
Directors stressed that further progress to strengthen the financial system is essential.
They urged the authorities to resolve the capital weakness of the BOM and improve its
independence and decision-making structure, noting that an enhanced supervisory board
could assist in providing oversight. They recommended that the BOM disengage from gold
operations. Forceful corrective actions should be taken to tighten supervision and enforce
strictly prudential norms for banks, and signs of problems in the non-bank financial sector
should be dealt with expeditiously and vigorously. Directors encouraged the authorities to
complete the process of drafting laws on Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the
Financing of Terrorism, and move to their implementation.

-4Directors observed that restructuring of public enterprises remains a priority. The
governance of enterprises intended to remain in the public sector needs to be improved,
and the privatization program should be reinvigorated. Directors underlined the need for
reforms in the energy sector.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve the quality and coverage of fiscal statistics
and address the priority issues for the national accounts and balance of payments. Also,
they urged the authorities to focus on improved poverty indicators to assist their work on the
Millennium Development Goals.
Turning to the Ex Post Assessment of the Fund’s long-term engagement with Mongolia,
Directors agreed that the overall program design for macroeconomic policies for the last
four Fund-supported programs had generally been appropriate. Nevertheless, a large part
of the structural agenda remained unfinished, with the financial sector still weak, public
enterprises in need of further restructuring, and poverty reduction goals yet unrealized.
Directors stressed the need to continue efforts to forge a broad political consensus on the
reform agenda to strengthen political ownership and improve implementation of policies.
Directors welcomed a continued close policy dialogue between the Fund and the
authorities, which could be backed, as appropriate, by a strong Fund-supported program
that is fully owned by Mongolia.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report for the Article IV consultation with
Mongolia may be made available at a later stage if the authorities consent.
