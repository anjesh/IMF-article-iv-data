EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A marked slowdown in economic activity is inevitable but the inflation outlook has improved
significantly. The international crisis is likely to undermine FDI flows and investor
confidence and net exports of goods and services are set to weaken further as key markets
shrink and export prices fall. However, with world commodity prices falling and output
growth likely to be below potential, the main factors behind this year’s inflation surge have
been reversed. Growth could fall to 4½-5½ percent this year and next (from a 7 percent
average in the last three years), with inflation declining to 8-12 percent over the same period.
The balance of payments has deteriorated and will be vulnerable until the international
economy improves. A surge in imports because of buoyant domestic demand and trade
liberalization all but eliminated the current account surplus by mid-2008, and a sharp reversal
of portfolio flows in August-October 2008 put pressure on central bank reserve assets and the
exchange rate. Though the authorities believe that further balance of payments weakness
would be consistent with a moderate decline in NIR and some additional exchange rate
flexibility, there is the risk of further capital outflows given the global turbulence.
The financial sector has escaped the ravages of the international crisis, so far, and is likely to
continue to do so. The relative financial stability reflects the strengthening of balance sheets
under the reform program, improved banking supervision, conservative practices with respect
to funding, investments, and lending, and the central bank reiterating its existing guarantee of
all bank deposits. The main vulnerability would appear to be a deterioration in loan quality in
the event of a prolonged slowdown in economic activity, which seems unlikely at present.
The authorities intend to support growth and employment through a modest fiscal stimulus
and timely cuts in policy interest rates. A fiscal stimulus of about ½ percent of GDP in
2008/09 will be provided by public infrastructure spending plans, complemented by
accelerating PPP’s to boost private investment. It would be consistent with the budgeted
deficit for the year of 6.9 percent of GDP (as the deficit is on track to fall to below
6½ percent of GDP), a modest increase in the planned medium-term fiscal consolidation path
through 2010/11, and with uninterrupted declines in the debt-to-GDP ratio. Judging the
timing of an interest rate cut is complicated by the risk that cuts could accentuate recent
pressures on central bank reserves and the exchange rate. The central bank should proceed
cautiously until balance of payments portfolio flows have stabilized.
Counter-cyclical policies are risky given Egypt’s poor initial conditions—large fiscal deficit,
high public debt with much of it at short maturity, and high inflation—but staff judge the risk
as worth taking in light of the record of reform and fiscal consolidation, the worsened growth
prospects, and the still high unemployment. Given the emerging balance of payments
weakness and the global crisis, the authorities should manage the exchange rate more
flexibly.
The reform program should give priority to restructuring the public finances to support
medium-term fiscal consolidation and boosting private investment. This would leave the
economy well placed to take advantage of a recovery in the international economy. Important
reforms in these areas would include the VAT, subsidy reform, strengthening cash-based
social programs, and accelerating the privatization program.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Economic performance since 2004 generally has been impressive, underpinned
by a supportive external environment and the structural reform program that has
included the liberalization of foreign trade, investment, the exchange market, the
privatization of state entities, and measures to strengthen bank balance sheets and banking
supervision. Annual GDP growth in the post-reform period was more than double the
average of the previous decade, driven by large-scale foreign and domestic investment.
2.
With the onset of the global crisis the policy challenges facing the authorities
have changed radically. For most of the period since the last Article IV consultation, the
most pressing issue has been to contain inflation when monetary and fiscal policies were
constrained by limited exchange rate flexibility, large-scale capital inflows, and the growing
cost of fuel and food subsides. By the time of the October-November 2008 consultation
mission, inflation appeared to be past its peak and the more urgent challenge was to maintain
growth and balance of payments stability in the context of the global financial turmoil and a
rapidly deteriorating international economic outlook.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Growth has been strong and the surge in inflation may have come to an end, but
the balance of payments has weakened and financial market indicators have
deteriorated (Figure 1).
•

Real GDP growth averaged 7 percent in 2005/06-2007/08 and was relatively broad
based across manufacturing, hydrocarbons, construction, services, tourism, and
agriculture. The main drivers of demand have been private consumption and
investment, aided by strong foreign direct investment. Though reports of skilled labor
shortages have been widespread, official unemployment has remained stubbornly
high at 8½ percent. Inflation reached a peak of 24 percent in August, reflecting a
combination of world commodity price developments, changes in administered
prices, and pressures from buoyant domestic demand; with the subsequent decline in
commodity prices, inflation fell to 20 percent in October.

•

Net international reserves were US$35 billion in October 2008, but reserve
accumulation has slowed sharply since mid-year. Though exports, remittances, and
receipts from tourism and the Suez Canal remained strong, a surge in imports because
of buoyant domestic demand and trade liberalization all but eliminated the current
account surplus by mid-2008; and in August-October there was an abrupt reversal of
portfolio flows as foreigners investors pulled out of the equity and government bond
markets. The central bank responded to the portfolio outflows by running down its

5
foreign currency deposits with commercial banks by over US$10 billion from a level
of US$11.6 billion at the end of June. 1
•

In the year through mid-November, the stock market fell by about 50 percent and
spreads on Egyptian bonds widened by about 175 basis, though these changes were
less than the average for emerging market economies. In September, Moody’s and
Fitch downgraded their investor outlook for Egypt.

4.
Macroeconomic policies struggled to contain domestic demand pressures for
much of 2008:
•

The limited flexibility of the pound against a weak U.S. dollar and the partial
sterilization of capital inflows raised non-U.S. dollar import prices and created the
monetary conditions that ignited second-round inflation effects (Box 1). The nominal
effective exchange rate appreciated by over 6 percent between January and
September 2008, and accelerating inflation appreciated the real effective exchange
rate by 21 percent.

•

The central bank increased policy interest rates by 275 bps (to 11½ and 13½ percent)
in the first eight months of the year, but market interest rates responded slowly until
the abrupt reversal of capital inflows in August-October drained some bank liquidity.
The growth of broad money supply, which accelerated sharply under pressure from
capital inflows slowed from 24 percent in March to 14 percent in September.

•

The central government deficit narrowed to 6.8 percent of GDP in 2007/08,
notwithstanding pressures from sharply increased subsidies, but the deficit at the level
of the general government widened to 7.8 percent GDP, mainly reflecting increased
financial investments by the social insurance fund. The 2008/09 budget left the
central government deficit broadly unchanged and included significant increases in
pensions, wages, and food subsidies to mitigate adverse social effects of high
inflation that were met by a wider income tax base and increases in administered
prices of fuels and other products.

1

In addition to its net international reserves, the central bank placed substantial foreign currency deposits with
commercial banks. These deposits were available to the central bank on a short notice (see CR/07/380).

Box 1. Inflation Dynamics in Egypt
The recent surge in inflation through August 2008 reflected a combination of increases in world
commodity prices, especially foods, and strong domestic demand. To disentangle the impact on headline
inflation of different external and domestic factors, a vector autoregressive model (VAR) was estimated for
Egypt and selected countries. This approach captures the underlying interaction of consumer prices with
different domestic factors and external commodity food and fuel prices. Based on data for the past decade,
changes in world commodity prices explain about 43 percent of the variation in headline inflation in Egypt,
with world food prices playing a much larger role than fuel prices (Table 1). This is in line with the high
share of food in consumption (44 percent of the basket) and the delayed and incomplete pass-through of
international fuel prices. At the same time, domestic demand factors have been significant drivers of inflation
pressures in the past. In particular, staff research indicates that shocks to broad money account for over 42
percent of the variation in headline inflation in Egypt.

1/ The model use monthly data on annual changes in world food and fuel commodity prices (in U.S.
dollars); nominal effective exchange rates; broad money; headline inflation, and underlying inflation for
the past decade.

The recent commodity price shocks have produced second-round effects on inflation. For example, in a
simple VAR model, an initial one percentage point shock to domestic food inflation tends to increase core
inflation by around 0.1 percentage points, with fast adjustment, unfolding on average within one year from
the original shock and peaking within 10 months. Based on past relationships, this implies that the recent
12-month food price increase of 30 percent in Egypt could lead to a 2.5 percentage point increase in
underlying inflation during the following 10 months. However, declining commodity prices and the projected
slowdown in domestic demand suggest that headline and underlying inflation should fall relatively quickly.

The banking system has largely withstood the global financial crisis. Information
through end-September shows net foreign assets positions of banks and the deposit base have
been stable, and the flow of credit to the private sector has continued to grow at the 13-

9
14 percent annual rate of the previous three years. Nevertheless, to encourage continued
confidence in the banking system, the central bank publicly reiterated its guarantee of all
bank deposits.
6.
Progress with structural reform has been mixed: (i) administered prices of fuels
and other items were increased sharply, but fuel subsidies continued to grow under pressure
from rising international prices; (ii) a property tax reform was approved by the parliament
and will be effective in January 2009, but the introduction of the VAT has been delayed until
at least late 2008/09; and (iii) the clean up of nonperforming loans of public enterprises
continued, 2 but the privatization program suffered a setback in July when bids for stateowned Banque du Caire, the third largest bank, were below the minimum targeted by the
government and the auction was cancelled.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
7.
The discussions were dominated by the implications for Egypt of the global
financial crisis and the rapidly deteriorating international economic outlook. As such,
they focused on: (i) the extent of the likely slowdown in economic activity in Egypt; (ii) the
scope the authorities had for counter-cyclical policies to support growth and employment
creation; (iii) the ability of the banking system and the balance of payments to withstand
further buffeting from the international crisis; and (iv) areas that could be given greater
emphasis in the reform program going forward. The discussions revealed a clear awareness
by the authorities of the main challenges and the key risks ahead.
A. The Near-Term Prospects
8.
The authorities viewed a slowdown in Egypt’s growth rate as likely, mainly as a
result of the global slowdown. The international crisis is likely to undermine FDI flows and

A slowdown in the Egyptian economy because of global linkages is supported by recent staff research
suggesting that a 1 percentage point decline in U.S. baseline growth results in a 0.3-0.5 percentage drop in

However, they also believe that there were further downside risks to this projection given the
uncertain outlook for the global economy. In contrast, they saw the inflation outlook as
having improved markedly, reflecting falling world commodity prices and the weaker
Egyptian economy. While the authorities felt it wise to work with a macroeconomic
framework in which inflation declined to the 12-14 percent range by mid-2009, and close to
single digits in 2009/10, they believed that a faster deceleration was more likely and that
inflation could be close to single digits by mid 2009 (see Text Table 1).
9.
Some further weakening of the balance of payments is to be expected until the
international economy improves. Current account revenues from exports, the Suez canal,
and tourism are likely to slow or fall; and continuing financial difficulties in developed
economies could sustain the recent reversal in portfolio inflows and lead to a drop in FDI. In
the authorities’ view, the balance of payments pressures could be met comfortably with a
modest decline in central bank net international reserves and more flexible exchange rate
management through mid-2010.
10.
The authorities judge that the central government deficit could narrow further
to just less than 6½ percent of GDP in 2008/09, mainly reflecting planned measures to
boost revenues and some savings on subsidies from import price declines. While such an
adjustment would be slower than that envisaged under the medium-term consolidation plan,
it suggests that the targeted deficit of 3 percent of GDP by 2010/11 would remain feasible
provided planned reforms were put in place, most particularly, the introduction of the VAT
later this fiscal year. However, they believed that a more gradual consolidation path was in
order given the projected economic slowdown. A near-term macroeconomic framework
broadly consistent with these views is discussed below. While Egypt’s debt indicators have
improved considerably, public debt, the deficit, and annual gross financing needs remain
high and impose a heavier burden on government finances than those of similarly rated
sovereigns. 4
B.

The Scope for Counter-Cyclical Policies

11.
The authorities believe that they have some room for maneuver to undertake
counter-cyclical monetary and fiscal policies to support growth and employment. They
acknowledged that undertaking such policies was risky given the difficulties in assessing
potential output in an economy undergoing significant structural change, the uncertainties as
to the timing of the recovery of the international economy, and the uncertainties regarding
the depth and duration of the recent reversal of portfolio capital inflows.

contributions to growth in Egypt, the global crisis could reduce Egypt’s GDP growth by 1-2 percentage points
this year and next.
4

The interest rate bill—at near 5 percent of GDP—consumes about 17 percent of government revenues,
compared to a median of 7 percent among Standard and Poor’s BB-rated countries; and annual gross financing
needs are over 20 percent of GDP.

11
12.
The room for maneuver with fiscal policy mainly resulted from the likelihood
that the outturn for 2008/09 would be better than budgeted. They saw a modest fiscal
stimulus as

Such a stimulus would
be consistent with only a modest alteration to their planned medium-term fiscal consolidation
path, raising the planned fiscal deficit target by about ½ percent through 2010/11, and with
little impact on the debt-to-GDP ratio (Text Table 2 and Table 6).
13.
The prospect that inflation would decline sharply in the coming months
provided room to ease monetary policy. With key world commodity prices falling and
output slipping below potential, both headline and core inflation were likely to fall. The
authorities believe that an early and aggressive interest rate cut would likely encourage bank
lending and support output and employment, with little harmful impact on the external
position and the exchange rate. However, the central bank has opted to proceed with caution
given the weakened balance of payments and difficult international environment, and to wait
for clearer signs that the economy was slowing and that inflation was firmly on a downward
path before starting to lower interest rates.
14.
The authorities agreed that there is no clear indication that the exchange rate is
misaligned and the discussion on exchange rate policy was confined to its role in dealing
with external shocks (Box 2). They recognized the risks of seeking to limit exchange rate
flexibility at a time of international crisis and with a weakening balance of payments.
However, they viewed the risk of serious balance of payments pressures as low, believing
that any weakening could be accommodated with a modest loss of international reserves and
some additional exchange rate flexibility. More generally, in managing the exchange rate in
the future, they intended to pay greater attention to movements in the euro.

12

Box 2. Exchange Rate Assessment
Assessment of the level of the REER by a variety of commonly applied methods presents a mixed
picture. According to the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) methodology, the value of the
Egyptian pound evaluated at projected values for 2013 is consistent with the level justified by
fundamentals. The macroeconomic balances and external sustainability approaches estimate the
Egyptian pound to be overvalued and undervalued, respectively. However, there is considerable
uncertainty surrounding the estimates, given the recent structural changes in the economy.

to GDP ratio at its end-2006 level, using data taken from the CBE. If NFA data are instead taken
from the Lane/Milesi-Feretti cross-country database, the resulting estimate is +5.1 percent.

Traditional indicators suggest that Egypt’s external competitiveness remains adequate. As of
July 2008, the real effective exchange rate (REER) had appreciated by 14 percent relative to endDecember 2005, mainly reflecting the recent acceleration in inflation. The external current account has
been in surplus, but on a declining trend, during the past seven years, largely on account of import
growth related to trade liberalization and robust domestic demand. Exports have grown at double-digit
rates in recent years, in tandem with the run-up in commodity prices.
Survey-based indicators of external competitiveness identify several structural impediments to
competitiveness. Egypt ranks 77 out of 131 countries in the World Economic Forum’s 2008 Global
Competitiveness Report, lower than many other emerging market countries, with inefficiencies in
government, and inadequate supply of infrastructure and skilled human capital as top impediments.
Going forward, removing these structural bottlenecks should be a high priority.

15.
The authorities believed that the banking system would continue to withstand
the turmoil in global capital markets, reflecting the strengthening of balance sheets under
the banking reform program, improved banking supervision, conservative practices with
respect to funding, investments, and lending (Box 3). 5

5

The 2007 FSAP update mission concluded that the main banking system vulnerability was to a worsening in
loan quality in the event of a prolonged slowdown in the economy, which seems unlikely at present. It also
concluded that the largest banks were resilient to moderate changes in the exchange rate and interest rates, and
that the liquidity positions of most banks could withstand a moderate shock to deposits.

Despite robust economic growth and financial
liberalization of recent years, credit growth has
been moderate. Credit-to-GDP and loan-to-deposit
ratios are low by emerging market standards, and
banks’ reliance on domestic funding to expand
their balance sheets has helped to insulate them
from external financing shocks. With the cleanup
of NPLs, the banking system remains well
capitalized, and provisioning gaps have narrowed.

Notwithstanding the stock market and real estate boom of recent years, the banking
system’s exposure to these sectors remains small, restricted by strict exposure limits.
While foreign bank presence has increased rapidly in recent years, partly on account of
privatization, there is no evidence that foreign-owned banks have cut back on lending on
account of tightening liquidity conditions in their home markets. Corporate sector dependence
on overseas financing is limited, with most corporations relying on retained earnings and
credit from domestic financial institutions to fund new investments and working capital.

C. Medium-Term Prospects and Structural Reform
16.
Egypt’s growth prospects would be enhanced by reforms that support domestic
demand and ensure that the economy is well placed to take advantage of the recovery in
the international economy. Following the moderate showdown expected over the next
18 months, growth should return to its more recent historic rate of 6½-7 percent and inflation
should moderate. In this context, the reforms with the quickest pay-off are likely to be those
that restructure the public finances to support fiscal consolidation, and promote private
investment, including by attracting FDI.
17.
Strengthening public finances remains a priority but meeting the revised
medium-term fiscal consolidation path will be challenging. The planned adjustment will
require implementation of the full battery of measures being considered by the authorities (in
particular, timely passage of the VAT law). Moreover, an adjustment of the magnitude
envisaged may not be feasible unless a marked recovery in growth gets underway.
18.
Tax policy and administration reform will support the fiscal adjustment efforts
through further broadening of the tax base and strengthening tax administration.
Legislation would be submitted to parliament in 2009/10 to: (i) replace the sales tax with a
full-fledged VAT, with an expected yield of about 2 percent of GDP in revenues; (ii) close
loopholes in the landmark 2005 income tax legislation and strengthen its anti-avoidance
provisions. In tax administration, measures are envisaged to integrate the income tax and
sales tax departments, to establish medium and small taxpayer offices in all governorates,
and to clear the backlog of tax arrears.
19.
Public expenditure reforms will focus on streamlining the subsidy system, and
reforming pension and healthcare systems. In-kind food subsidies will be gradually
replaced with a system of cash transfers, although the capacity to target them adequately will
take longer to develop. Pension reforms (to be finalized in the coming months) would
involve replacing the current pay-as-you-go defined benefit system with a system based on
defined contributions. Healthcare reform—plans for which are at an initial stage—would
entail universal coverage, which could pose a significant burden on the budget in the
medium-term.
20.
The authorities intend a second round of privatization of state enterprises. The
shares are to be allocated in three ways: (i) a free transfer of shares to the public at large;
(ii) retained ownership through holding companies for restructuring and debt settlement; and
(iii) investment in a domestic future generations fund. Shares will be allowed to be traded on
the stock market. Legislation and the operational framework will be finalized in the coming
months, with implementation expected over the next two to three years.
D. Other Issues
21.
Further improvements in macroeconomic statistics are needed. Egypt subscribed to
the SDDS in January 2005, but data deficiencies persist in many sectors. Formulating

15
appropriate and timely economic policies requires good data but in Egypt’s case, weaknesses
in the timeliness, coverage, and reporting of economic and financial statistics continues to
constrain informed macroeconomic policymaking and surveillance.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
22.
The policy challenges facing the authorities have changed since the last Article
IV consultation mission in September 2007. With inflation appearing to be past its peak,
the priority is to maintain growth and balance of payments stability in the context of the
global financial turmoil and a rapidly deteriorating international economic outlook. The
economic reforms have given the authorities some room for maneuver to undertake countercyclical monetary and fiscal policies to support growth and employment in the event that a
slowdown in growth materializes, though such policies would not be without risks.
Fortunately, with the economy yet to show clear signs of slowdown, there would appear to be
some time to balance the risks and to calibrate an appropriately cautious policy response.
23.
Staff believes that the size and composition of the proposed ½ percent of GDP
fiscal stimulus in 2008/09 are broadly appropriate. Accelerating public infrastructure
spending would strengthen the weak infrastructure base and help raise potential output. The
main risk would appear to stem from adverse market reaction as a result of the still high
levels of the fiscal deficit and public debt, the fact that much public debt is of a short
maturity, and the credibility of the very back-loaded adjustment effort that is required even to
meet the revised fiscal deficit target for 2010/11. However, it is a risk that seems worth
taking given the need to absorb a rapidly growing labor force. Moreover, the risks could be
mitigated by the authorities’ added policy credibility due to their success under the reform
program and the progress with fiscal consolidation.
24.
Judging the appropriate timing of a cut in interest rates is complicated by the
risk that a rate cut could accentuate pressures on central bank reserves and the
exchange rate. With the initial impact of interest rate cuts much more likely to be on the
exchange rate rather than on the demand for credit, there would appear to be room to keep
policy rates unchanged until there are clear signs that pressure on the balance of payments
has stabilized, and that inflation is firmly on a downward path.
25.
There are particular challenges for managing the exchange rate at a time of
international crisis, when the balance of payments could be weak for an extended period,
and when the exchange rate and reserves already have been under some pressure. Staff
believes that in judging the balance between reserve losses and exchange rate depreciation to
meet any of these pressures, the authorities should allow more exchange rate flexibility; this
could also bring some relief to the export sector. More generally, staff welcomes the
authorities’ intention to pay more attention to the euro in managing the exchange rate in the
future. Staff estimates that the Egypt’s real exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals.
26.
There are reasons to be optimistic that financial intermediation in Egypt will
continue largely unimpeded by the international crisis. The country’s financial system is
less integrated into the global economy than is the real economy, bank balance sheets have

16
been strengthened by the reforms, banking practices have been conservative by international
standards, and the central bank continues to make good progress with the banking
supervision reform agenda.
27.
The authorities are to be commended for their determination to maintain the
reform momentum in the difficult circumstances. That Egypt, so far, has withstood the
international crisis better than many other economies, and the fact that it has some room for
maneuver to protect output and employment, is in large part because of the achievements
under the reform program. Staff believes that the emphasis in the future should be on reforms
that support domestic demand and ensure that Egypt is well placed to take advantage of the
eventual recovery in the international economy, and that would increase further the
authorities’ ability to respond to future economic shocks. Reforms that promote private
investment, including by continuing to attract FDI, and that restructure the public finances to
support fiscal consolidation are likely to be particularly important. In these regards, staff
commends the authorities for their plans to broaden the privatization program and urges that
priority be given to the early introduction of the VAT, which has the best prospect of
yielding the additional revenues needed to improve the public finances and to finance longerterm fiscal structural reforms.
28.
The pressure on Egypt’s public finances from fuel and food subsidies
underscores the need for subsidy reform. Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to work
with the World Bank to improve the efficiency and targeting of subsidy programs. However,
consideration should also be given to introducing automatic adjustment mechanisms for
domestic fuel prices, while strengthening cash-based social programs to protect the most
vulnerable groups.
29.
Egypt’s medium-term outlook is sound. Staff agrees that modest counter cyclical
measures to support growth are appropriate and that authorities’ medium-term fiscal deficit
target could be relaxed by about ½ percentage point of GDP (to 3½ percent of GDP) in
2010/11. Nonetheless, the authorities need to stand ready to respond flexibly if financing
pressures emerge in the balance of payments or in the budget.
30.
The economic and financial statistics provided to the Fund are broadly adequate
for surveillance, but weaknesses in their timeliness, coverage, and reporting continues to
constrain informed macroeconomic policymaking and surveillance.
31.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with the Arab Republic of Egypt
take place on the 12-month cycle

1/ Net debt of general government, including government guaranteed debt. Year t refers to fiscal year t/t+1 (e.g. 2008 is fiscal year 2008/09).
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total
external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency
(e > 0) and a rising GDP deflator.
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both noninterest current account and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP)

VII.

Exchange Rate Arrangement (As of October 31, 2008):

Prior to January 29, 2003, the Egyptian pound was pegged to the dollar, with all foreign
exchange transactions taking place within a ±3 percent range around the central rate, which
was announced by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE). Effective January 29, 2003, the
Egyptian pound was allowed to float. As a result, the exchange arrangement of Egypt was
reclassified to the category “managed float with no pre-announced path for the exchange
rate,” from the category “pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands.” In December 2004,
the CBE officially launched the foreign exchange interbank market with no controls on rates,
governed by a formal interbank convention on foreign exchange trading. The CBE stands
ready to purchase foreign exchange in the interbank market for banks to the extent they
exceed prudential limits on net open positions at the prevailing market rate. Effective
February 1, 2005, Egypt’s exchange rate was reclassified to a conventional peg from a
managed float with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. Since July 2007, the de
facto exchange arrangement has been akin to a managed float. Egypt maintains a bilateral
payment arrangement with Sudan which has been inoperative since the late 1990s.
Egypt maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions; however, Egypt has notified measures to the
Fund, pursuant to procedures under Executive Board Decision 144-(52/51), which apply to
measures imposed solely for national or international security reasons.
VIII.

Article IV Consultation:

Consultations with Egypt are on a 12-month cycle. The last Article IV consultation
discussions were held in Cairo from August 29-September 12, 2007. The staff report
(CR No. 07/380) was discussed by the Executive Board on November 28, 2007. The 2007

Appendix II. Egypt: Relations with the World Bank
1.
Partnership for Development. In the FY2007–FY2008 period, the Government of
Egypt restated its commitment to pursuing the implementation of its national development
agenda which key development objectives are to achieve high and sustainable growth by
(i) enhancing the role of the private sector in the development process; (ii) focusing the
public sector on delivering public goods; and (iii) strengthening the social safety net system.
Within this framework, the World Bank Group is operating as part of a broader international
effort, together with a number of other donors and financiers. The relationship between
Egypt and the World Bank Group has been transformed and markedly improved over the last
few years as a result of the progress Egypt has made in implementing reforms and of the
successful turnaround of the World Bank Group program outlined in its FY2006-09 Country
Assistance Strategy. The WBG has been providing its support through an integrated package
of knowledge, advisory services, technical assistance, and financing, in support of
Government priorities in given sectors such as Mortgage market development or Education
and Skills Development. During that CAS period, the Bank and the government also
collaborated on several pieces of analytical work that led to both a better and a shared
understanding in such areas a investment climate and financial sector, public expenditure,
poverty, pensions and infrastructure. The spirit that marked this collaborative effort bodes
well for the future as the shared understanding will continue to feed into policy and project
design as well as leads to faster implementation of Bank interventions.
2.
World Bank Country Assistance Strategy. The current Bank assistance to Egypt is
anchored in a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) initially for the period FY2006–09 which
was extended to cover an additional two fiscal years, until end-FY11 in June 2008. In line
with the government’s development and reform agenda, the current CAS identified and
implements interventions that will (i) facilitate private sector development; (ii) enhance the
provision of public services; and (iii) promote equity.
3.
IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas. The Bank and IMF continues to
collaborate efforts in supporting the Government in the areas of macro-economic framework
and management; budget and public expenditure management; public sector reform; and
private and financial sector development.

World Bank/IDA Portfolio
4.
As of November 5, 2008,, the Bank had approved 118 projects for Egypt (77 under
IBRD including two supplemental financing and 41 under IDA), valued at about US$8.7
billion, of which about US$1.3 billion remain undisbursed. The current IBRD portfolio
includes 18 projects with a total commitment of US$2 billion. The sectoral composition of
the current portfolio (by value) is as follows: 44 percent for infrastructure, 28 percent for
financial and private sector development, 17 percent for agriculture and 11 percent for social
sectors.
International Finance Corporation (IFC) Investments.
5.
As of November 5, 2008, Egypt is one of the two largest exposure countries for IFC
in the MENA region with a total committed portfolio of US$690 million for 34 projects for
its own account. Its portfolio includes operations in the financial sector, power, exportoriented manufacturing, ports, oil and gas, metals, agribusiness and IT health. IFC’s PEPMENA TA work in Egypt has also been strongly supported by the government to strengthen
financial markets, simplify business start-up procedures, SMEs, corporate governance and
providing transaction advice for public-private partnerships (PPPs) in health, education and
infrastructure
.

7
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) Exposures
6.
MIGA’s most important contribution to date has been to support and enable
investments by an Egyptian telecom company in two telecom projects in Pakistan and
Bangladesh, with a combined gross exposure of US$152 million – an example of SouthSouth investment. Requests for MIGA’s guarantees with Egypt as a host country are
relatively limited for now, since many bilateral agencies provide comparable services.

Appendix III. Egypt: Statistical Issues
1.
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
shortcomings occur in the areas of the national accounts and external sector statistics. Egypt
has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and an IMF data ROSC
report, based on an October 2003 mission assessing the quality of Egypt’s macroeconomic
statistics, was published in July 2005.
2.
National accounts: The National Accounts Department within the Ministry of
Planning compiles annual and quarterly national accounts data based on the 1993 System of
National Accounts (SNA 1993). Shortcomings, however, include inconsistency within the
dataset (discrepancies between quarterly and annual GDP estimates), inconsistency over time
(the base year is often changed without an overlap with the preceding base), and
inconsistency with balance of payments statistics. In addition, the October 2003 data ROSC
mission found: weaknesses in the source data, limited use of surveys, and lack of an
oversight body to provide guidance on the quality of national accounts.
3.
Price statistics: The Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics
(CAPMAS) disseminates a monthly producer price index, bi-monthly CPI data for All Egypt,
and monthly CPI data for eight geographic regions (Cairo, Alexandria, Upper Urban, Lower
Urban, Canal Cities, and Frontier; and every other month for Upper Rural, Lower Rural).The
CPI utilizes expenditure weights derived from a 2004/2005 household expenditure survey.
4.
Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics: The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) compiles
BOP statistics based on the Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5). The 2003
data ROSC mission noted that BOP statistics are affected by source data that do not
reasonably approximate an accrual basis, unreliable merchandise trade statistics from
customs declarations compelling compilers to estimate using banks’ foreign exchange
records, limited coverage and classification of foreign exchange transactions, and lack of
survey data for direct investment enterprises.
5.
Foreign Direct Investment: A series of METAC missions to the CBE, beginning in
March 2005 have provided advice on the measurement of FDI and the development of an
FDI survey and business register. Most recently in August 2008, METAC provided further
technical assistance on improving the response rate and data quality of the pilot FDI survey,
and could consider additional assistance when the results of a full pilot FDI survey are
tabulated.
6.
External debt and the international investment position (IIP). Egypt reports IIP
data for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) and Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY). A 2006 STA mission encouraged the authorities to address
gaps in the data, to connect stocks with flows, and to improve the reporting system on nonguaranteed debt. The authorities have not yet resolved these issues.
7.
Fiscal data: The authorities have largely adopted the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2001 (GSFM 2001), with FAD and STA advice. Nonetheless, the consolidation of
general government operations (budget sector, National Investment Bank, and Social

9
Insurance Funds) under this new classification is incomplete for “below-the-line”
transactions. Annual government finance statistics based on GFSM 2001 are reported for
publication in the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook. Quarterly data on the
budgetary central government are reported for publication in International Financial
Statistics.
8.
Monetary statistics: Monthly monetary and financial statistics are comprehensive
and reported one month after the reference period. Egypt reports monetary data to STA using
the Standardized Report Forms based on the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The
data ROSC mission raised the issue of potential overstatement of foreign assets and foreign
liabilities of the banking sector, as recorded in the monetary statistics, because an offshore
bank located in Egypt is erroneously treated as a nonresident entity.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
December 22, 2008
1.
The information below, which has become available following the issuance of the
staff report, does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Growth prospects for the remainder of FY2008/09 and for 2009/10 have worsened in
the last month in line with the more severe global economic slowdown and the balance of
payments is expected to weaken further, with a larger-than-projected decline in net
international reserves. The downward revision in world oil prices will likely have a marginal
impact on the outlook for the balance of payments as Egypt is a small net exporter of oil.
However, the current account deficit is expected to widen further as external demand in
major trading partners, tourism and Suez Canal receipts, and the terms of trade weaken,
offsetting the impact of weaker domestic demand. Significant downside risks to FDI inflows
and the potential for further portfolio outflows could result in a larger-than- projected loss in
external reserves.
3.

Recent economic data are broadly consistent with staff projections for FY2008/09.

•

The economy has begun to show signs of slowing, with GDP growing at 5.8 percent in
the first quarter of FY2008/09, compared to 7.2 percent in FY2007/08.

•

Inflation pressures continue to ease. Headline consumer inflation ticked down to
20.3 percent in November, while the wholesale PPI declined to 16.9 percent in October.

•

Net international reserves declined by some US$600 million during the month of
November from US$35 billion in October. The exchange rate depreciated by 4 percent
against the U.S. dollar, and appreciated by over 10 percent against the Euro from August
to mid-December.

4.
More information has become available since the issuance of the staff report on the
mass privatization plan. This plan involves the transfer of ownership of up to 155 stateowned companies to its citizens. The shares are to be allocated in the following manner:
60 percent of the shares will be bundled and transferred to citizens who meet the minimum
age requirement of 21; 10 percent will be held in a domestic future generations fund and
earmarked for social spending; and 30 percent will be retained by government holding
companies for debt settlement and restructuring. The plan has the potential to enhance the
private sector orientation of the economy, further deepen capital markets, and overcome the
negative perception of privatization within Egypt. The plan has limited revenue implications
in the near term.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 15, 2009

International Monetary Fund

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
the Arab Republic of Egypt
On December 22, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Arab Republic of Egypt. 1
Background
Economic performance since 2004 generally has been impressive, underpinned by a
supportive external environment and the structural reform program that has included the
liberalization of foreign trade, investment, and the exchange market, the privatization of
state entities, and measures to strengthen bank balance sheets and banking
supervision. Annual GDP growth in the post-reform period was more than double the
average of the previous decade, driven by large-scale foreign and domestic investment.
With the onset of the global crisis the policy challenges facing the authorities have
changed radically. For most of the period since the last Article IV consultation, the most
pressing issue has been to contain inflation when monetary and fiscal policies were
constrained by limited exchange rate flexibility, large-scale capital inflows, and the
growing cost of fuel and food subsides. By the time of the October-November 2008
consultation mission, inflation appeared to be past its peak and the more urgent
challenge was to maintain growth and balance of payments stability in the context of the
global financial turmoil and a rapidly deteriorating international economic outlook.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
Real GDP growth averaged 7 percent in 2005/06-2007/08 and was relatively broad
based across manufacturing, hydrocarbons, construction, services, tourism, and
agriculture. The main drivers of demand have been private consumption and
investment, aided by strong foreign direct investment. Though reports of skilled labor
shortages have been widespread, official unemployment has remained stubbornly high
at 8½ percent. Inflation reached a peak of 24 percent in August, reflecting a combination
of world commodity price developments, changes in administered prices, and pressures
from buoyant domestic demand; with the subsequent decline in commodity prices,
inflation fell to 20 percent in October.
Net international reserves were US$35 billion in September 2008, but reserve
accumulation has slowed sharply since mid-year. Though exports, remittances, and
receipts from tourism and the Suez Canal remained strong, a surge in imports because
of buoyant domestic demand and trade liberalization all but eliminated the current
account surplus by mid-2008; and in August-October there was an abrupt reversal of
portfolio flows as foreigners investors pulled out of the equity and government bond
markets. The central bank responded to the portfolio outflows by running down its
foreign currency deposits with commercial banks.
In the year through mid-November, the stock market fell by about 50 percent and
spreads on Egyptian bonds widened by about 175 basis, though these falls were less
than the average for emerging market economies. In September, Moody’s and Fitch
downgraded their investor outlook for Egypt.
The limited flexibility of the pound against a weak U.S. dollar and the partial sterilization
of capital inflows raised non-U.S. dollar import prices and created the monetary
conditions that ignited second-round inflation effects. The nominal effective exchange
rate appreciated by over 6 percent between January and September 2008, and
accelerating inflation appreciated the real effective exchange rate by 21 percent.
The central bank increased policy interest rates by 275 bps (to 11½ and 13 percent) in
the first eight months of the year, but market interest rates responded slowly until the
abrupt reversal of capital inflows in August-October drained some bank liquidity. The
growth of broad money supply, which accelerated sharply under pressure from capital
inflows slowed from 24 percent in March to 14 percent in September.
The central government deficit narrowed to 6.8 percent of GDP in 2007/08,
notwithstanding pressures from sharply increased subsidies, but the deficit at the level
of the general government widened to 7.8 percent GDP, mainly reflecting increased
financial investments by the social insurance fund. The 2008/09 budget left the central
government deficit broadly unchanged and included significant increases in pensions,
wages, and food subsidies to mitigate adverse social effects of high inflation, to be met
by a wider income tax base and increases in administered prices of fuels and other
products.

3
The banking system has largely withstood the global financial crisis. Information through
end-September shows net foreign assets positions of banks and the deposit base have
been stable, and the flow of credit to the private sector has continued to grow at the 1314 percent annual rate of the previous three years. Nevertheless, to encourage
continued confidence in the banking system, the central bank reiterated its existing
guarantee of all bank deposits.
Progress with structural reform has been mixed: (i) administered prices of fuels and
other items were increased sharply, but fuel subsidies continued to grow under pressure
from rising international prices; (ii) a property tax reform was approved by the parliament
and will be effective in January 2009, but the introduction of the VAT has been delayed
until at least late 2008/09; and (iii) the clean up of nonperforming loans of public
enterprises continued, but the privatization program suffered a setback in July when
bids for state-owned Banque du Caire, the third largest bank, were below the minimum
targeted by the government and the auction was cancelled.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the Egyptian authorities for their sound macroeconomic
management and economic reforms to date. Directors considered that the policy
challenges facing the authorities have changed significantly since the onset of the global
financial turmoil and the rapid deterioration in the international economic outlook. While
the Egyptian economy has withstood the global slowdown relatively well, net exports
and foreign direct investment are likely to weaken as external conditions decline further
in the months ahead. Under these circumstances, and with inflation past its peak, the
priority will be to maintain growth and balance of payments stability. Directors were
therefore pleased that Egypt’s recent economic reforms have provided the authorities
some room for maneuver to cautiously undertake countercyclical policies in the event of
an economic slowdown.
Directors supported the authorities’ fiscal policy aimed at striking a balance between
bolstering short-term activity and ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability. The size
and composition of the proposed fiscal stimulus in 2008/09 to support growth and
employment are broadly appropriate. Directors also noted that the envisaged
acceleration of public infrastructure spending to address existing bottlenecks will result
in only a modest deviation from the planned medium-term consolidation path.
Directors noted that Egypt’s medium-term outlook remains sound. They welcomed the
authorities’ recognition of the particular challenges and uncertainties in the period
ahead, and their readiness to act in a timely manner if balance of payments pressures
heighten. On the fiscal front, Directors urged the authorities to remain vigilant regarding
the challenges posed by the still high levels of the fiscal deficit and public debt, the
short-maturity of debt, and the back-loaded adjustment effort required to meet the
revised fiscal deficit targets. They considered, however, such challenges to be

4
manageable given the authorities’ good record on reform and fiscal consolidation.
Notwithstanding the strong record, Directors stressed that, now more than ever, Egypt
should persevere with its medium-term fiscal consolidation efforts to reduce the
country’s vulnerabilities.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to move cautiously with policy rates until
there are clear signs that the pressure on the balance of payments has stabilized. They
noted that judging the timing of an interest rate cut is complicated by the risk that a rate
cut could accentuate recent pressures on central bank reserves and the exchange rate.
Directors saw scope for the authorities to allow for greater exchange rate flexibility to
help deal with pressures on central bank reserves. Directors noted the staff’s
assessment that the real effective exchange rate of the Egyptian pound is broadly in line
with fundamentals.
Directors noted that the banking system has coped well with the recent global financial
shocks. This resilience is attributable to the authorities’ ongoing banking sector reform
efforts—including a strengthening of banking supervision and regulation, a cleanup of
nonperforming loans, as well as conservative investment and funding practices. Egypt’s
healthy bank balance sheets and low level of financial integration suggest that there are
good prospects that financial intermediation will not be impeded by the international
crisis.
Directors commended the authorities for their determination to maintain the reform
momentum in difficult circumstances. They encouraged them to focus on reforms that
support domestic demand and promote private investment, so as to ensure that Egypt is
well placed to take advantage of the eventual recovery in the international economy.
Reforms that restructure the public finances to support fiscal consolidation also deserve
priority. Directors attached importance to the early introduction of the VAT, which would
have the best prospect of yielding the revenue gains needed for the envisaged mediumterm fiscal adjustment. They welcomed recent government efforts to broaden the
privatization program.
Directors encouraged the authorities to press further with food and fuel subsidy reforms,
and welcomed their intention to improve the efficiency and targeting of food subsidy
programs. Consideration should be given to introducing automatic adjustment
mechanisms for domestic fuel prices to minimize distortions, while strengthening cashbased social programs to protect vulnerable groups.

Several Directors stressed the importance in the current circumstances of further
improving the timeliness of the publication of key macroeconomic data, particularly
regarding the balance sheet of the Central Bank of Egypt.

Statement by A. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for the Arab Republic of Egypt
December 22, 2008
1.
Against the backdrop of a rapidly deteriorating global outlook, the focus for this
year’s consultations was inevitably marked by uncertainty over the fallout from the global
financial crisis and its consequences on the Egyptian economy. The last fiscal year witnessed
solid economic performance in Egypt, supported by sustained implementation of the
economic reform agenda initiated in mid-2004. Growth accelerated further to reach a peak of
7.2 percent in 2007/08, the fiscal deficit continued to narrow for a fourth year in a row,
foreign direct investment (FDI) increased to an all time high of over US$12 billion, and a
surplus was maintained in both the current account and overall balance of payments.
Inflationary pressures, however, increased owing to the surge in international commodity
prices, buoyant domestic demand, and administered price increases, but should witness a
respite from the recent declines in commodity prices and successive hikes in policy rates.
2.
The intensification of global financial strains and the accompanying sharp drop in
global economic activity are likely to challenge the outlook for 2008/09 and increase the
uncertainty surrounding the outlook thereafter. A deceleration in growth is expected, largely
reflecting the negative contribution of net exports as demand in partner countries recedes.
Nevertheless, the authorities believe that the build up in growth momentum over the past
three years will contribute to a soft landing for the Egyptian economy. Growth is therefore
projected to moderate to 5–5½ percent, supported mainly by domestic demand. At the same
time, the authorities view the inflation outlook as better than previously envisaged, in light of
the improved outlook for international commodity prices and the projected moderation in
domestic growth. In the absence of further shocks to the economy, inflation could revert to
single digits by mid-2009. Finally, the reversal in portfolio flows in the second half of 2008
was accommodated by a drawdown of foreign assets of the commercial banks. The
authorities believe that further pressures on the balance of payments are likely to be limited,
and could be mitigated through a modest loss of reserves and additional exchange rate
flexibility.
3.
On balance, the authorities consider the outlook for 2008/09 as challenging but
manageable. However, uncertainty about the depth and duration of the global slowdown
constitute downside risks to growth prospects. For this reason, the authorities are devising a
set of countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies in support of growth and a soft landing for
the economy, while reinforcing its foundations to take advantage of the global recovery later
in 2009. The scope for countercyclical policy can be accommodated by the projected stronger
outturn on the budget deficit, the improved outlook on inflation, and the strengthened
banking sector balance sheets and ample liquidity reflecting progress in banking sector
reforms. The authorities agree with staff that undertaking such policies is potentially risky,
but consider the risks manageable and worthwhile in terms of payoff for the economy.
Fiscal Policy
4.
Despite pressures from sharply increased subsidies, the budget deficit narrowed
in 2007/08 to 6.8 percent of GDP. To offset the social impact of the surge in food prices and

2
inflation, an increase in public wages was granted earlier in May. Importantly, the increase in
wages was fully financed through the introduction of politically difficult measures, including
increases in administered prices of fuel and related commodities, the elimination of tax
exemptions on energy-intensive companies in Free Trade Zones, and increases in excise
taxes. Moreover, and while progress in implementing the Value Added Tax (VAT) has been
somewhat slower given inflation concerns, the property tax reform was approved and is
expected to become effective in January 2009. Barring additional shocks to inflation and if
political economy considerations permit, the VAT Law will be submitted to parliament later
this year and become effective by mid-2009.
5.
The authorities are committed to their medium-term fiscal consolidation path.
For 2008/09, the budget deficit is expected to decline further to about 6.2 percent of GDP,
reflecting planned revenue enhancing measures, including through invoice reform to reduce
tax evasion, as well as savings on the subsidy bill from import price declines. However, in
the current circumstances, they consider that a more gradual consolidation path is warranted.
Specifically, by targeting a broadly unchanged level of the budget deficit as in 2007/08, there
would be a relatively modest fiscal stimulus of about ½ percentage point of GDP through a
combination of spending increases and tax cuts. The stimulus would rely principally on
accelerating infrastructure investment spending, including by expanding Public-Private
Partnerships to promote private investment, in addition to limited measures related to export
promotion and tariff reductions on intermediate goods. As noted by staff, the fiscal stimulus
would be consistent with only a modest alteration in the planned medium-term consolidation
trajectory through 2010/11 and a declining debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
6.
The prospect of a substantial decline in inflation could provide the scope for some
easing in monetary policy. The authorities are of the view that caution is warranted going
forward regarding the appropriate timing of interest rate cuts. Following six consecutive
hikes in policy rates of 275 basis points since early 2008, the central bank left policy rates
unchanged at its last meeting in November. However, it also acknowledged the downside
risks to domestic growth, and will therefore continue to closely monitor incoming data over
the next few months to update its assessment of the domestic growth outlook. The central
bank announced its intention to consider a measured easing of monetary policy to forestall an
excessive deceleration in economic growth.
7.
The authorities believe that the reversal of capital flows during August–October
reflects mainly a risk repricing toward emerging market economies as an asset class, and is
less related to Egypt-specific factors. As such, and while anticipating some decline in FDI
flows and tourism receipts, they consider the risks of further pressures on the balance of
payments to be modest, given the strong reserve position. Potential balance of payments
pressures could eventually be accommodated through increased exchange rate flexibility and
some loss in international reserves, as reported in the staff Supplement.

3
Financial Sector
8.
The financial sector reform agenda further advanced in 2007/08. In the banking
sector, progress was achieved in clearing non-performing loans of public enterprises.
However, against the background of more difficult global conditions, the privatization of
Banque du Caire, Egypt’s third largest public bank, was postponed as bidders failed to meet
the government target reserve price. Importantly, the private sector credit bureau, established
last year, became operational in May, which should help overcome institutional impediments
to bank lending and facilitate credit intermediation to small and medium enterprises.
9.
The authorities are of the view that domestic financial vulnerabilities are limited.
They share staff’s assessment that financial intermediation in Egypt is likely to continue
broadly unconstrained by the international crisis. The Egyptian banking system has been
relatively shielded from the global turbulence, reflecting the pursuit of conservative policies
to funding, investments and lending, as well as strengthened balance sheets and enhanced
regulatory and banking supervision under the central bank’s Banking Sector Reform Program
launched in 2004. Domestic banks have virtually no exposure to structured products, rely
primarily on domestic deposits for loan expansion, remain well capitalized and enjoy ample
liquidity. Additionally, there appeared to be no pressure on foreign-owned banks to restrain
lending as a result of tightening liquidity conditions in their home markets. While continued
volatility in the equity and fixed income markets could be expected, strict exposure limits
have curtailed the banking system’s exposure to the stock market and real estate sector.
Nevertheless, and to provide additional reassurance to the market, the CBE recently
reaffirmed its guarantee of bank deposits. The fundamental requirements for an orderly
functioning of the domestic banking sector are therefore well-entrenched in the system.
Structural Reforms
10.
Going forward, the authorities agree with staff that strengthening public finances
remains a priority, and are committed to the measures on tax policy and administration
reform articulated in paragraph 18 of the staff report. They recognize that fulfilling the
revised medium-term fiscal consolidation path could be challenging if growth prospects are
weaker than projected. In addition, the authorities intend to persevere with subsidy reform
efforts, the pace of which will depend on political economy considerations. Specifically,
energy price reforms will continue through progressive increases in administered prices, and
in-kind food subsidies will be gradually replaced with cash transfers. Pension and health care
reforms are also in the pipeline, and efforts are currently underway to assess their fiscal
implications and identify potential offsetting measures if needed.
11.
The authorities intend to proceed with a second round of privatization of state
enterprises, along the lines outlined in the staff report. The scheme is modeled after the
Czech and Polish privatization experience, with the objective of ensuring broader public
participation in the reform and privatization process. As elaborated in the Supplement, in
addition to a free transfer of shares to the public, a portion of the proceeds would be allocated
toward a future generations fund. The investments of the fund would be limited to domestic
assets, and the returns used to support social investments in health, education, and youth
development.

4
12.
Finally, the Egyptian authorities are keenly aware of the challenges and policy risks
in the period ahead. They are committed to the pursuit of their reform agenda to achieve a
structurally higher growth rate, but the pace would need to take into account changing policy
circumstances. The authorities would like to thank staff for a productive consultation based
on candid dialogue and well-grounded mutual trust, and express their appreciation for the
extensive and highly valuable technical assistance they are receiving from the Fund.
