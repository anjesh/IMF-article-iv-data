IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Liberia

On July 8, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Liberia.
The Ebola epidemic and the fall in commodity prices revealed the vulnerabilities of Liberia’s
economy. After barely positive growth in 2014, GDP was flat in 2015 mainly due to the decline
in activity in the iron ore and rubber sectors. The current account deficit deteriorated, reflecting
weaker exports receipts and the Ebola-related surge in imports. While international gross
reserves increased last year, the Central Bank of Liberia’s net foreign exchange position declined
due to operational deficits and exceptional support to the banking sector, under stress from the
Ebola epidemic. Lower revenue from the natural resource sectors and higher Ebola-related
spending, largely financed by donor support, pushed the FY2015 overall government deficit to
8.4 percent of GDP. The FY2016 deficit is estimated to have declined to 7 percent of GDP as
continued revenue weakness forced the government to contain spending.
In 2016, growth is expected to rise to 2.5 percent, thanks to a rebound in services and the start of
gold production, while inflation should stay in the single digits. The overall government deficit is
projected to remain broadly constant, thanks to strong fiscal measures to address lower natural
resource revenues, declining external budget support, the cost of the 2017 elections, and the
take-over of security from UNMIL.
Over the medium term, economic growth is expected to increase to 5.5 percent on average, due
to a recovery in mining, improvement in infrastructure, particularly energy and roads, and higher
agricultural productivity. The fiscal position should improve, thanks to the authorities’
commitment to improve domestic revenue mobilization and contain spending. Resolution of the

backlog of non-performing loans and improving bank profitability could support economic
growth through higher credit, especially for small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs).
The main risks to the outlook include a stronger-than-anticipated effect of the commodity price
decline, the worsening of security conditions, and a large scale re-emergence of the Ebola virus.
Policy slippages also could weigh on medium-term growth.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that the commodity price shock hit the Liberian economy just when it
started to recover from the Ebola outbreak. Directors observed that, while growth should recover
in the coming years, the outlook faces downside risks, including a stronger-than-expected
commodity price impact, a possible reemergence of the Ebola epidemic, and a deterioration in
security conditions. Directors commended the authorities’ measures to tackle the aforementioned
shocks. They underscored the importance of continued sound macroeconomic policies, and the
stepping up of structural reforms to boost growth, enhance the economy’s resilience and reduce
its dependence on natural resources.
Directors commended the authorities for the ambitious measures embedded in the draft FY2017
budget. They agreed that the domestic revenue mobilization measures would help mitigate the
revenue shortfall from lower activity in the natural resource sector and from the post-Ebola
decline in external budget assistance. At the same time, Directors welcomed that the containment
of expenditure still secures essential social spending such as on health and education. Directors
recommended the further deepening of the revenue base while increasing its fairness. They also
called on the authorities to continue strengthening public financial management. Directors noted
that fiscal policy would benefit from a longer-term orientation, and encouraged the authorities to
consider a medium-term fiscal anchor to improve policy predictability and transparency. They
called for strengthening the medium-term debt strategy to prevent a further increase in the risk of
debt distress.
Directors encouraged the authorities to boost external buffers. In order to build up adequate
international reserves, the Central Bank of Liberia needs to rigorously implement its agreed
three-year financial plan, phase out exceptional support to the banking sector, and limit foreign
exchange interventions to volatility smoothing. Directors stressed the importance of enhancing
the central bank’s independence and its coordination with the fiscal authorities in order to
strengthen liquidity management. Given the constraints posed by the dual currency system, they
also agreed that, in the long run, a gradual process of de-dollarization would increase the space
of monetary policy.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors called on the authorities to address financial sector vulnerabilities, notably by
strengthening bank supervision and establishing a bank emergency assistance framework. While
recognizing that the loss of correspondent banking relationships is a global issue, they
recommended reinforcing frameworks for tax transparency and anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism.
Directors stressed the importance of improving economic resilience. In this regard, strengthening
the business environment could help diversify the economy by supporting private sector
development. Improving financial inclusion would be another channel to support economic
growth and diversification.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context: The Article IV discussions focused on policies to support resilience and growth on
the background of a double shock hitting the Liberian economy. Just when the country was
finally recovering from the Ebola epidemic, the decline in commodity prices, combined with
a post-Ebola fall in external support, put the economy under severe stress, undermining
government revenues, affecting the build-up of international reserves, and intensifying
vulnerabilities in the financial sector. Prolonged weakness of commodity prices has also
lowered medium-term growth prospects, exposing the limitations of a growth model heavily
dependent on the natural resource sector. The authorities have taken decisive steps to
mitigate these macroeconomic challenges, most notably through a draft FY2017 budget law
envisaging ambitious revenue mobilization measures and far-reaching spending cuts.
Outlook and risks: Liberia faces the challenge of balancing pressures from weaker export
receipts and falling external support with the continued need for spending on physical
infrastructure, human capital accumulation, and poverty alleviation. The main risks to the
outlook relate to a stronger-than-anticipated effect of the commodity price decline, the
worsening of security conditions after UNMIL withdrawal, and a large-scale re-emergence of
Ebola. Policy slippages also could weigh on medium-term growth.
Key policy recommendations:


Expand revenue mobilization efforts, and streamline current spending while preserving
key expenditures including health and education;



Strengthen public financial management, including investment planning and execution
and consider adopting a fiscal anchor to support fiscal sustainability;



Limit external debt growth by carefully selecting new projects, prioritizing grants and
concessional financing, and developing a medium-term borrowing strategy;



Rebuild external buffers by implementing the Central Bank of Liberia medium-term
operational budget and allowing more exchange rate flexibility;



Increase financial sector resilience by strengthening bank supervision, establishing an
emergency assistance framework, and addressing AML/CFT shortcomings;



Promote economic diversification by improving the business environment, exploring
horizontal and vertical export diversification, and strengthening financial inclusion.

AN ECONOMY HIT BY A DOUBLE SHOCK
A. Context
1.
The Ebola epidemic and the fall in commodity prices have laid bare the vulnerabilities
of Liberia’s economy. The economy is still reeling from the devastating Ebola outbreak in 2014–15,
that, besides triggering a human tragedy, stopped GDP growth, setting back the country’s
development. The outbreak coincided with the decline of world commodity prices, which is buffeting
Liberia’s economy, heavily dependent on the natural resource sector. Lower commodity prices have
drastically reduced activity, triggered the delay or cancellation of investment plans, undermined
budget revenues, and worsened long-standing weaknesses in the financial sector.
2.
The Ebola epidemic has been generally contained, and occasional flare-ups have been
swiftly addressed. The WHO has declared Liberia Ebola free on three occasions, first in May 2015,
then in September 2015, and January 2016 after the recurrence of small-scale infections. With
capacity vastly improved, the government has reacted quickly to tackle and terminate the small Ebola
flare-ups, but a resurgence cannot be ruled out due to lack of a vaccine and the fragility of the health
systems.
3.
The twin shocks are delaying Liberia’s exit from fragility. Liberia is a post-conflict country
with significant infrastructure and human capital deficits (Annex I), as shown by limited progress
toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals (Table 1). Poverty levels are very high,
especially in rural areas. Nevertheless, poverty declined from 64 percent in 2007 to 54 percent in
2014 thanks to the authorities’ policies, assistance from donors, and a supportive external
environment. Food insecurity remains a concern for at least 49 percent of Liberian households. At
3 percent in 2014, the unemployment rate is relatively low compared to the regional average,
reflecting the predominance of agriculture in the labor market. But, 74 percent of the employed are
vulnerable, due to extensive informality and under-employment. The young demographics, with
42 percent of the population under 15, underlines the need for strong job creation to absorb the
fast-rising labor force.
4.
Liberia faces important political and security transitions. In the coming months, the
country is preparing for its first democratic transition of power with the October 2017 general
elections, which will end the two-term presidency of Ms. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. A large number of
candidates is expected to be seeking the presidency. In the meantime, the United Nations Mission in
Liberia (UNMIL) is drawing down its contingent and handing security over to national security forces.
5.
2016 Article IV discussions focused on policies to boost Liberia’s resilience. In the fiscal
area, the less favorable medium-term external environment requires stepping up the mobilization of
domestic resources to protect development spending. In a highly dollarized economy, Central Bank
of Liberia (CBL) policies should continue to focus on reconstituting buffers to mitigate shocks, and
improving vigilance of the banking sector in light of increased vulnerabilities. Growth diversification
would reduce the economy’s dependence on iron ore and rubber, reducing vulnerabilities to
exogenous shocks.

6.
Follow-up on the 2012 Article IV recommendations has been limited. The 2012
consultation called for: (i) building policy buffers to mitigate vulnerabilities; (ii) harnessing expected
strong natural resource revenue to support the development agenda; and (iii) creating a favorable
business climate to support broad-based growth and job creation. Progress was largely challenged
by delays in budget passage and implementation, weak governance as reflected in the road project
audit by the General Auditing Commission (GAC), the Ebola epidemic, and the decline in commodity
prices that have eroded the fiscal space and reversed central bank’s reserves accumulation efforts.
The 2012 Article IV analysis laid the ground for the current ECF (Box 1).
Box 1. Implementation of the ECF Program
The 2012 ECF arrangement laid the basis for the Fund’s stepped-up support to Liberia during the
Ebola crisis. The ECF arrangement, with an access of 40 percent of quota1 (US$78.9 million), was designed to
accelerate broad-based growth and poverty reduction while maintaining macroeconomic stability. In the
wake of the Ebola virus outbreak in 2014, the program was buttressed by an augmentation of access of
25 percent of quota (US$47.9 million) and a disbursement under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) for
25 percent of quota (US$45.7 million) to enhance the country’s ability to withstand the shock. In February
2015, the IMF also provided debt relief for 20 percent of quota (US$36.5 million) under the newly
established Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust to cover urgent budgetary and balance of payments
needs. Taking into consideration the delay in the program caused by Ebola epidemic, the program was
re-phased and extended until December 2016.
The program has been affected by the Ebola epidemic and uneven policy performance. By and large,
the ECF, which is aligned with the authorities’ own poverty reduction strategy, the Agenda for
Transformation (AfT, Annex II) has so far been successful in helping the authorities maintain macroeconomic
stability and lay the basis for poverty reduction. However, after the swift completion of the second and third
reviews, the fourth review was delayed by the Ebola epidemic, which derailed the implementation of
structural reforms, and policy slippages. Unfunded spending commitments on road projects totaling about
3.8 percent of GDP, highlighted Public Financial management (PFM) weaknesses, and quasi-fiscal activities
by the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) combined with persistent large central bank operational deficits, held
back the accumulation of international reserves. The fourth ECF review was completed in December 2015
based on the authorities’ corrective actions to address PFM weaknesses and strengthen the CBL’s buffer
position.
Progress towards the fifth review has been mixed so far. All indicative targets for end-December 2015
were met. However, reflecting the impact of commodity price decline, the end-December 2015 performance
criterion (PC) on government revenue was missed by US$7 million because of lower tax revenues from the
natural resource sector. Furthermore, the PC on net foreign exchange reserves position was missed by
US$20 million owing to exceptional liquidity support to the banking system, large foreign exchange
interventions, and lower-than-programmed sales of foreign exchange from the government. Two of the nine
structural benchmarks for the fifth review were met, while two were completed with delay, and five have not
yet been completed.
Discussions with staff are continuing on policies that would allow completing the fifth review. The
authorities are closely working with staff to implement corrective measures to address policy slippages.
Agreement has been reached on the main lines of the FY2017 budget recently submitted to the Legislature,
including strong tax and spending measures, and further structural reform mostly focusing on PFM.
Discussions continue on addressing risks in the financial sector.



After a decade of strong performance, growth stalled in 2014–15. The real GDP growth
rate dropped from 8.7 percent in 2013 to 0.7 percent in 2014 and 0 percent in 2015 as the
mining and rubber sectors were hit by the Ebola outbreak and the fall in commodity prices.
But activity is expected to rebound modestly to 2½ percent in 2016, underpinned by
recovery of services, as confidence post-Ebola picks up, and an expansion in gold production.



Inflation is set to remain in single digits. The inflationary pressures generated by the
economic recovery are expected to be partly compensated by the end of the Ebola-related
food supply bottlenecks. Inflation is thus projected to average 8.4 percent in 2016, up slightly
from 7.7 percent in 2015.



Low activity of foreign concessions is impacting government revenues. As a result of
disappointing revenues, Cabinet has submitted to parliament a revised FY2016 budget, with
both revenues and expenditures equally reduced by 3 percentage points of GDP or
11 percent of the original budget, leaving unchanged the envisaged budget deficit at

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

3 percent of GDP. Despite the cut in expenditure, the authorities maintained spending on
health and education as envisaged in the original budget. Based on the revised budget, the
overall FY2016 government deficit, including off-budget items, is projected to remain around
7 percent of GDP.



The CBL’s net foreign exchange position has declined in 2015. Gross reserves have risen
from US$411 million in 2014 to US$446 million in 2015 (2.6 months of imports). In contrast,
the net foreign exchange position of the CBL declined from US$179 million to US$164 million
due to operational losses and liquidity support to the banking sector. In 2016, gross reserves
are projected to increase to US$457 million and net foreign exchange position should rise to
US$189 million, assuming strong policies by the CBL, including implementation of its
operational budget, and sufficient foreign exchange sales by the government.



The two shocks have further eroded bank asset quality and profitability. With subdued
economic activity, non-performing loans (NPLs) as a percent of total loans have risen to
above 20 percent in 2015, weighing on already weak profitability and undermining credit
growth recovery.

The import series is being revised upward after migration to the ASYCUDA customs data platform which has a more
robust coverage.

C. Medium-Term Developments and Risks
8.
The medium-term outlook has weakened. Growth is expected to average 5½ percent over
the medium term, well below the 8 percent projected before the crisis. Production in the traditional
natural resources such as iron ore and rubber is projected to recover over the medium term
following the resumption of investment plans and the restructuring of operations to adapt to the low
price environment. Overall economic activity is also expected to be spurred by infrastructure
spending, particularly on the road network and energy generation centering on the rehabilitation of
the Mount Coffee hydropower plant, which is on track to come on stream by end-2016. Productivity
in the agricultural sector should increase thanks to ongoing government initiatives under the
umbrella of the Liberian Agricultural Transformation Agenda (LATA). Inflation is expected to remain
in single digits, thanks to low U.S. inflation and improved food availability, even though it remains
vulnerable to a rise in oil prices and the weakening of the domestic currency. The current account
deficit is projected to stabilize at 27 percent, and reserves cover would edge up towards 3⅓ months
of imports.
9.
The fiscal position is projected to improve in the medium term as tax revenue
measures kick in. The authorities’ strong tax effort is expected to lift domestic tax revenues.
Government spending in percent of GDP is expected to return toward pre-Ebola levels after the oneoff costs of elections in FY2017–18 with the overall deficit projected to stabilize at 4 percent of GDP
as external support declines over time.
10.
Credit growth and investment are expected to contribute to the recovery over the
medium term. Medium-term projections are predicated on efforts to resolve rising NPLs and
improve bank’s profitability, which should promote lending to small- and medium-size enterprises
(SMEs) and households and support a private-sector-based diversification of the economy.
11.

Downside risks have risen (Annex IV):


A stronger-than-expected impact of the commodity price decline, possibly due to a slowdown
of global growth, particularly emerging markets, which could delay the recovery of the
natural resource sector;



Large scale re-emergence of the Ebola epidemic, which could have a huge effect on activity
and confidence;



A security deterioration, especially after the completion of the UNMIL withdrawal in 2016;



Increasing financial sector vulnerabilities, including further loss of correspondent banking
relationships (CBRs), which may undermine the financial sector’s contribution to growth;



Weak policy implementation, particularly in maintaining fiscal discipline and rebuilding
external buffers (Figure 2).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

Figure 2. Liberia: Alternative Scenario with Weak Policies
Policy slippages could undermine the growth trajectory, affect debt sustainability, and delay the build-up of
external buffers (Figure 2). The alternative scenario assumes (i) on the fiscal side, a lower tax effort combined
with sustained spending in the run-up of, and after the elections, financed by external debt; (ii) on the monetary
side, the resumption of quasi-fiscal activities by the central bank; (iii) on the structural side, a delay in
implementing reforms and improving the business environment. With weaker fiscal discipline, real GDP would
grow faster than the baseline in the short term, but slow down over the medium-term due to poor business
environment. Public debt would grow to well over 15 percent above the baseline at the end of the forecast period.
On the external side, the current account deficit would be higher, with lower exports due to the weak investment
climate and higher imports driven by government spending. The deteriorated current account balance and higher
CBL’s operational expenditures would hamper the accumulation of international reserves.

Authorities’ Views
12.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s views on outlook and risks. They shared
staff’s assessment of the far-reaching impact of the new global price environment. They noted that
the government launched initiatives to diversify the economy, for example by boosting agricultural
productivity and promoting light manufacturing. However, despite these efforts, Liberia still remains
heavily dependent on natural resources. On risks, they generally agreed with staff’s analysis,
underlining the downside risks from the commodity price shock. They stressed that, while Ebola
could resurface, swift containment of recent flare-ups has increased public confidence in the
improved capacity of the health system.

POLICIES TO FOSTER RESILIENCE AND GROWTH
A. Laying the Groundwork for Fiscal and Debt Sustainability
Fiscal Policy
13.
The fall in commodity prices and a decline in external assistance are straining fiscal
resources. Tax and non-tax revenues have declined in FY2016 by an estimated 2.4 percent
(US$11 million) compared to FY2015 (against a growth of 8 percent envisaged in the original FY2016
budget), mainly because of the natural resource sector slowdown. External budget support,
frontloaded to address the Ebola epidemic, is expected to decline from US$155 million on average in
FY2015–FY2016 (including the ECF augmentation and the RCF disbursement) to US$30 million in
FY2017. At the same time, spending is under pressure from the one-off costs of the 2017 presidential
and general elections and the cost of taking security mandate over from UNMIL.
14.
To address the shortfall, the authorities are introducing ambitious measures in the
draft FY2017 budget. These include:


Revenue mobilization: (i) increase in fuel

harmonization of tariffs towards the
ECOWAS Common External Tariff (CET) (Text Table 2). All these measures, except for fuel
storage charge which is an administrative fee, have been submitted to the Legislature
together with the FY2017 budget. In parallel, the Liberia Revenue Authorities (LRA) is
strengthening revenue administration, with Fund TA support, to improve tax compliance and
tax payer audits.



Reduction in current spending: nominal wages and hiring will be frozen, except for selected
hiring in health, education, and security sectors (wages were unchanged already in FY2016).
Goods and services will also be cut by about 10 percent from the revised FY2016 budget,
while maintaining health education spending at the revised FY2016 budget levels, and
ensuring adequate security spending. Overall, current spending, including off-budget
spending, will decline from 28.4 percent of GDP in FY2016 to 27.3 percent the next fiscal year.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

LIBERIA



Prioritization of capital spending: implementation of the Public Sector Investment Program
(PSIP) will be limited to ongoing projects, and domestic and external off-budget debt
financing will be sought for priority infrastructure projects such as Ganta–Yekepa and
Monrovia neighborhood roads, and airport terminal and runway.

15.
The authorities are advancing structural fiscal reform. The government is implementing a
number of reforms to strengthen PFM, including submission of the draft amendment of the PFM Act
to the Ministry of Justice for review, establishment of monitoring and evaluation units for public
investment, launch of online procurement application system,2 and expansion of the IFMIS coverage
to public investment. The Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP) is focusing on
better investment management, with the support of IMF TA, by preparing comprehensive databases
of PSIP and foreign-financed projects and systematically preparing feasibility studies for
domestically-financed projects. The ministry is also stepping up the dialogue with donors to improve
budget planning and liquidity management.
Policy Advice
16.
Staff welcomed the FY2017 budget measures, and recommended further strengthening
the revenue base and streamlining expenditures. Staff recommended further deepening the tax
effort, also with the objective of improving fairness, for example through stronger property tax
design and collection, the streamlining of fuel import duty exemptions, and the roll-out of the VAT in
FY2018 . On the spending side, staff urged pushing ahead with the review of civil service payroll,
ongoing with World Bank support, which would help containing the wage bill, and reforming the
state-owned enterprises (SOEs), starting with the closure the numerous dormant organizations. The
needed streamlining of current spending should ensure however the protection of key social
expenditure items.
17.
Fiscal policy would benefit from a longer-term approach. The determination of the fiscal
stance is focused on the next budget year rather than on the medium-term budget framework.
Furthermore, existing legislation does not allow funding multi-year projects, for which resources
must be sought each fiscal year—a root cause of past extra-budgetary spending. Thus, the fiscal
stance depends on financing availability rather than medium-term fiscal sustainability or demand
management. As such, it is currently ultimately determined by debt sustainability considerations,
formalized into the debt limits under the ECF which are designed to avoid an increase in the risk of
debt distress from moderate to high. Formalization of a fiscal anchor, e.g. an explicit debt target or a
spending rule, would make fiscal policy more predictable and support fiscal discipline. Starting a
policy dialogue on these themes with domestic and external stakeholders could be a first step
towards a more forward-looking fiscal approach.
18.
The authorities should push fiscal reform forward. The authorities have taken important
steps to strengthen PFM, but much remains to be done, notably on the Treasury Single Account

(TSA), which is held back by technical issues but also resistance from line ministries; the development
of public investment database due to limited capacity to monitor progress of each investment
projects; and stronger reporting on SOEs finances.
Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities shared staff concerns about fiscal resilience against external shocks and
progress of PFM reform. They underlined that fiscal space was very tight because of exogenous
shocks, and that the increase in taxation was necessary to maintain a minimum level of expenditure.
They also noted that streamlining expenditure had required difficult choices in light of the adverse
developmental impact of cutting spending items, and felt in particular that the level of capital
investment was well below what was needed to rebuild Liberia’s infrastructure. They looked forward
to additional external assistance to finance some big-ticket items such as the elections. Regarding
PFM reform, they stressed the substantial progress made in some areas, such as the improvement of
procurement processes, and underscored the need for capacity building to accelerate the reforms,
which were delayed by the Ebola crisis.

updated DSA (Annex V) shows that the
economy is increasingly vulnerable to further shocks reflecting the worsened growth and export
outlook. In particular, any further deterioration in exports could push the risk of debt distress to high.
Policy Advice
21.
Staff recommended a prudent borrowing strategy to preserve debt sustainability. In a
medium-term outlook, it is critical to slow down the pace of debt accumulation, prioritize grants and
concessional financing, and carefully choose new borrowing through sound project appraisal and
selection procedures. Debt management capacity should also be strengthened, in particular on the
costs and risks analysis of the debt portfolio, and borrowing should be anchored by a new MediumTerm Debt Management Strategy (Annex VI).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

LIBERIA

Authorities’ Views
22.
The authorities shared staff’s concerns on debt vulnerabilities. They remained committed
to the borrowing targets agreed in the context of the ECF for FY2016 and FY2017, which they saw as
useful to help the government maintain borrowing discipline and avoid locking in the new
administration on new loans. Nevertheless, they highlighted the tension arising from debt
sustainability and the need to close infrastructure gaps, and noted that the growth dividends would
help debt sustainability. The authorities also called for more donor coordination as some of the
externally-financed projects were not high priority but would further increase the debt burden.

B. Improving the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy
23.
The CBL’s net foreign exchange position has weakened. While gross reserves have
increased in 2015, at end-year they were still below three months of imports, well below an adequate
level for such a dollarized economy (Annex III). Further, the net foreign exchange position has
significantly declined due to exceptional support to the banking sector, larger-than-planned foreign
exchange sales interventions to stem the depreciation of the Liberian dollar following the decline in
export revenues, and large operational losses of the CBL arising from capital spending in the past
years, vis-a-vis poor returns from ultra-low global international interest rates.
24.
High dollarization limits monetary
policy effectiveness. Both the Liberian dollar
and U.S. dollar are legal tender, with more than
80 percent of banks’ deposits and 90 percent of
lending in U.S. dollars (Text Chart 3). In this
context, the CBL generally focuses on
smoothing the exchange rate to control
inflation. Its only active monetary policy tool is
the reserve requirement, which currently further
favors intermediation in U.S. dollars. In addition,
given that only a small portion of the monetary
base is in local currency, the CBL can rely on
minimal seigniorage.

25.
Coordination between the CBL and MFDP to improve liquidity management has
improved. In the recognition that large aid flows affect liquidity management, the CBL, MFDP, and
LRA have been regularly holding Joint Liquidity Working Group (LWG) meetings, but the CBL’s
liquidity management has largely been passive. The central bank’s liquidity management capacity
has been further limited by a 2014 amendment to the CBL Act which subjects the issuance of
currency to the approval of the legislature.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

Policy Advice
26.
The authorities should step up their efforts to increase external buffers. The CBL should
implement rigorously the three-year financial plan approved by its Board in December 2015, which
envisages a sizeable reduction in the CBL’s operational deficits. Unbudgeted costs for currency
printing should be absorbed over the three-year financial plan. In parallel, the CBL should consider
allowing more exchange rate flexibility as the inflationary pressures remain limited, while the MFDP
should maintain adequate foreign exchange sales to the CBL.
27.
De-dollarization should remain a long-term objective. The authorities should aim at
gradually reducing the role of the U.S. dollar through the development of domestic financial markets,
the increased use of Liberian dollar for both government and private sector transactions and salaries,
and prudential regulations that encourage the use of Liberian dollar.
28.
Streamlining reserve requirements would improve monetary policy effectiveness. Staff
urged the CBL to unify the Liberian and U.S. dollar reserve requirements to support de-dollarization
efforts and allow banks to meet requirements on average over a maintenance period. Furthermore,
the Joint LWG could take a more active approach to liquidity management.
29.
The removal of parliamentary veto on currency printing should be a priority. The
authorities should step up their efforts to request Legislature’s reversal of the amendment, which
unduly affects the autonomy of the CBL.
Authorities’ Views
30.
The authorities stressed the impact of lower dollar inflows and the need for autonomy
of the CBL. While agreeing with the objective of rebuilding reserves, the CBL indicated that progress
is contingent on the government’s adequate sales of foreign currency, in turn dependent on dollar
revenue inflows, which had been undermined by the external shock. The authorities saw
de-dollarization as an important long-term goal, but felt that it was also a politically delicate topic,
and at this stage they did not see space for major initiatives. They expressed concern about legal
constraints deriving from the CBL Act that would prevent modifying the liquidity reserve requirement
regime. They undertook to seek legislative changes to equip the CBL with ability to manage domestic
currency.

C. Strengthening Financial Sector Stability and Development
Background
31.
Soft lending activity and rising NPLs continue to weigh on banks’ balance sheets,
constraining bank lending. In 2015, NPLs edged up to over 20 percent (according to the CBL’s
Post-Ebola Review of asset quality, which are significantly higher than NPLs reported by banks)
reflecting slow economic activity, a legacy of poor underwriting standards, and weak CBL supervision.
High provisioning for NPLs is a key factor for weak bank profitability (Text Chart 4), also hurt by high
overhead costs and limited investment opportunities. As a result, balance sheet growth is

Given the systemic nature of NPLs, the CBL
is also exploring setting up an Asset Management Company (AMC) to market distressed assets.
32.
The CBL has intervened a non-systemic failing bank. In the absence of a proper
emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) and bank resolution frameworks, including deposit insurance
scheme, the CBL had been providing liquidity to a small non-systemic bank for more than two years,
accumulating a significant exposure which had eroded its international reserve position. After taking
over the bank at the beginning of 2016, the CBL has recently liquidated the bank by transferring
most assets and liabilities to a foreign investor through a purchase and assumption (P&A)
transaction.
33.
Liberia has suffered a significant loss of CBRs. All commercial banks have lost at least one
CBR in the last three years, with the most affected losing about 78 percent of their CBR accounts
(SIP). A survey of commercial banks confirmed that global banks are severing CBRs due largely to the
country’s perceived credit risk, AML/CFT concerns, and low volumes of transactions. Loss of CBRs is
limiting the range of trade financing products, lowering fees and commissions, making the transfer
of humanitarian aid more difficult, and complicating supervision of transfers executed by banks
through peers or parents in different jurisdictions.

34.
Loss of CBRs is partly due to weak AML/CFT framework and tax transparency
frameworks. Liberia is suffering from an image of safe haven for dubious transactions, facilitated
by the U.S. dollar as legal tender, a completely open capital account, and ease of setting up
non-resident corporations subject to very few disclosure requirements. The country has been
recently downgraded from the “expedited” to the “enhanced” follow-up process by InterGovernmental Action Group against Money Laundering in West Africa (GIABA) on account of gaps in
the AML/CFT framework. Furthermore, Liberia is listed as a tax haven by several EU members, and is
yet to sign the U.S. Treasury Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).
Policy Advice
35.
Stepped-up vigilance of the banking sector and clean-up of NPLs should be the
priorities in banking supervision and regulation. Strengthening supervision, notably by
intensifying on-field visits and reporting, is key to flag the need for improvements in business
strategies and recapitalization. Staff welcomes the resumption of the “name and shame” initiative
which however may only help in the short-term. An AMC may be a valid instrument in principle, but
financing may be difficult given limited fiscal space and banks’ negative profitability. Resolving NPLs
would be key to unlocking the potential of the financial sector to contribute to the economic
recovery. Therefore, the CBL should develop a long-term strategy to reduce NPLs, centering on the
mandatory write-offs of legacy NPLs and punitive measures such as a capital surcharge graduated on
NPLs holdings.
36.
Difficulties in the banking sector have highlighted the need to quickly strengthen the
crisis management framework. The CBL’s ad-hoc approach to resolving a bank in distress
underlines the urgent need to establish a complete set of regulations comprising ELA, a bank
resolution framework, and deposit insurance. The CBL should also carry out a comprehensive
assessment of its support to the troubled bank and the weak supervision which has delayed the
resolution and deepened the central bank’s exposure.

37.
Urgent action is needed on AML/CFT to prevent further loss of CBRs. The authorities
should strengthen the AML/CFT supervisory framework to improve the credibility of the banking
system. Of the highest priority are addressing gaps in the AML/CFT Laws relating to terrorist
financing and criminalization of illicit trafficking, and strengthening the Financial Intelligence Unit
(FIU).
Authorities’ Views
38.
The authorities shared staff calls for urgency in tackling deteriorating asset quality and
addressing AML/CFT deficiencies. They underlined the role of institutional factors in delaying the
reduction of NPLs, notably the lack of a secondary market for collateral and of an efficient credit
bureau (Liberia does not have a national identity system), and the inefficient judicial system. They
noted their work with the commercial court to rein in inefficiencies in foreclosure. The CBL noted
that, with Fund TA support, it had already started work on a crisis management and resolution
framework, including ELA and deposit insurance. The authorities recognized the importance of
revising AML/CFT laws and underlined that the FIU would be fully funded in the FY2017 budget amid
broad cuts in a tight fiscal environment.

D. Buttressing Resilience through Economic Diversification and
Competitiveness
39.
The slump in commodity prices has highlighted the case for economic diversification.
Diversification would provide additional growth drivers and reduce growth volatility and vulnerability
to exogenous shocks. Yet, Liberia has not so far developed a robust alternative to rubber and
mining-led growth, and export diversification lags peers.
40.
But, the current business environment is not sufficiently supportive of more dynamic
private sector growth. Infrastructure is severely lacking, with a poor road network (only 10 percent
of the 10,000 km network is paved) and inadequate electricity provision (government generating
capacity is only 32 MW compared to pre-civil war 190 MW (Box 2). The investment climate is weak,
with Liberia ranking 179th out of 189 countries in the World Bank’s 2016 Ease of Doing Business
Rating. Liberia’s recent accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) may benefit the domestic
investment climate through the required legal reforms—with trade benefits, such as lower cost of
imports and wider export markets access, coming later.

Box 2. Developments in the Energy Sector1
Limited provision of reliable and affordable power remains a key bottleneck to growth. Even including
private generators, only 14.4 percent of the population has access to electricity, particularly in rural areas
(3.7 percent). Installed capacity by the state-owned Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC) is currently 32MW
with a customer base of around 37,000 customers (both residential and commercial). Total installed capacity,
including the private sector, is estimated to be higher due to private sector generation, particularly by
mining and rubber companies. Developing infrastructure―including improvements in energy supply―is one
of the main economic objectives of the AfT and the Liberia Rising long-term development strategy. The
government’s goal is to provide electricity access to 70 percent of the urban and 30 percent of the rural
population by 2030.
The government has undertaken several projects to increase energy supply in recent years. To
complement to the existing diesel generators, a first heavy fuel oil (HFO) project financed by the World Bank
recently started power generation, and two more HFO plants are expected to start running over the next few
months, bringing total capacity to around 60MW. The Mount Coffee hydropower facility is set to increase
the country’s capacity by another 88MW, with the first unit (22MW) expected to start running end-2016, and
three more units to connect over the course of 2017. LEC’s transmission grid currently covers only most of
Monrovia and donor-financed projects are underway to extend transmission to rural areas along three main
corridors, as well as connecting the grid with neighboring countries.
Electricity costs are among the highest in Africa and
are a major impediment to business and investment.
Liberia’s energy costs are 13 times average costs in
South Asia and four times the average for Africa. The
average household pays a large portion of its income on
electricity. The government plans to reduce the price
from 52 cents to around 25 cents per KW over the
coming months. A new electricity law, facilitating more
competition in the sector and switch to hydropower
from more expensive fuels, is expected to help ease
prices.

41.
A strong exchange rate may hinder diversification. Standard exchange rate assessments
point to an overvaluation of around 20 percent, likely due to large aid inflows and natural resource
revenues, even though these models are ill-suited to deal with a highly dollarized economy
(Annex III). Further, wages are relatively high compared to regional peers, particularly in the public
sector. These cost factors are likely to hold back the development of competitive non-natural
resource exports.
42.
Financial inclusion, key for private sector growth, is lagging. Limited physical access to,
and usage of financial services is holding back the growth of the non-resource private sector,
particularly SMEs. Low bank profitability and high operational costs in rural areas hamper the
expansion of banking services: bank branches are four per 100,000 adults, while ATMs are only two
per 100,000 adults, lower than the fragile economy and the ECOWAS averages. In response, the CBL
has established rural community banks, ensuring that all counties have access to at least one of such
banks. With regard to usage, banks dominate the financial sector in terms of assets, but non-bank

financial institutions, such as microfinance institutions and credit unions, serve the biggest number of
households, and mobile banking is also gradually spreading, now covering all 15 counties. High
lending risks, weak rule of law, limited collateral options, and low financial literacy are major
bottlenecks of financial development.
Policy Advice
43.
Policies to promote diversification could focus on new lines of economic activity and
higher quality products within existing sectors. The experience of neighboring countries suggests
that potential growth gains of improving export structure could be more than 1 percentage point
annually (SIP). There is scope for horizontal diversification in the mining and agriculture sector. For
instance, Liberia could produce rubber manufactured products beyond crude rubber, and a steel
plant (already planned by an investor) for more products could expand iron ore usage. Horizontal
diversification should be combined with quality upgrading of products, for example for rice, the
quality of which is below global average and neighbors like Côte d’Ivoire.
44.
The authorities should urgently improve the investment climate. The government should
continue to work with donors to facilitate affordable electricity for business and domestic use.
Improving the judicial system effectiveness related to property rights and contract enforcement
should be a long-term priority.
45.
The authorities can implement various policies to improve financial inclusion. Better
banking supervision, leading to improved profitability, adequate infrastructure, and reform of land
registration could help the physical expansion of financial sector. Usage of financial services,
including borrowing, could be boosted by the introduction of a national identification system,
strengthening the credit registry, and collateral regulation reform, while and the planned deposit
guarantee scheme may promote access to deposits. In addition to improvements in the judiciary
process, financial inclusion would benefit from reforming collateral registration and increasing
financial literacy for the population.
Authorities’ Views
46.
Economic diversification and the implementation of business environment reforms are
a high priority. While agreeing on the value of horizontal and vertical diversification, the authorities
remarked how low commodity prices are a disincentive even for the agriculture sector. However, they
noted that some products, such as cocoa, have continued to enjoy relatively high prices. The
authorities agreed that progress on the investment climate is critical for growth and diversification
and noted that the Land Rights Act submitted to the legislature would help secure land rights,
especially in rural areas. New energy projects, notably the Mount Coffee hydropower plant
rehabilitation, are on schedule and would alleviate electricity problems, including lowering costs.
They noted that the government is also working on judicial enforcement.

LIBERIA

OTHER ISSUES
47.
Efforts to improve the coverage and quality of statistics are ongoing. Data availability
and quality is limited, due to weak capacity, lack of adequate collection mechanisms, and limited
cooperation among agencies. These deficiencies significantly hamper policy making and surveillance.
48.
The authorities are stepping up efforts to extend data coverage. The Liberia Institute for
Statistical and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS) has just updated poverty data based on the 2014
household income and expenditure survey (HIES), which was interrupted by Ebola. LISGIS is also
revising national accounts estimates with technical assistance from the IMF and has prepared
preliminary estimates for 2008–13, which will be validated by a HIES for 2016. With support from the
IMF and World Bank, the HIES will also inform the revision of the CPI basket, now several decades
old. The CBL is also revising trade data following the introduction of the ASYCUDA customs system.
49.
Liberia has been receiving substantial amounts of TA from the Fund (See Informational
Annex). Capacity building needs are high in various areas, especially PFM, revenue administration,
liquidity and crisis management, and CPI and national account statistics. Engagement by the Fund
and AFRITAC West has been active even during the Ebola crisis through remote support via online
tools. Reform of revenue administration by the LRA and establishment of liquidity forecasting
framework in the CBL have made progress whereas cash-base public expenditure recording and
financial sector supervision remain weak. Slowdown in reform is also due the Ebola crisis.
Consolidating on this progress, going forward TA will focus on PFM, revenue administration, central
bank operation, crisis management, and national account and BoP statistics. Liberia is piloting the
Capacity Building Framework (CBF) approach to enhance the engagement with fragile and postconflict countries with regard to capacity development under close collaboration among staff, the
authorities, and key stakeholders.3 In line with the CBF and the authorities’ requests, delivery of TA
will shift in part from diagnostic missions to hands-on capacity development, such as training and
workshop.

STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
Liberia has been hit in sequence by the Ebola epidemic and the drop in global
commodity prices. As the country was finally recovering from the Ebola epidemic, the decline in
commodity prices put the economy under severe stress, damaging government revenues, affecting
the build-up of international reserves, and intensifying vulnerabilities in the financial sector.
Prolonged weakness of commodity prices has also significantly lowered medium-term growth
prospects.
51.
And, downside risks have risen. The main risk arises from a stronger-than-estimated impact
of weak commodity prices on the economy, the deterioration of security conditions after the UNMIL
3

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

LIBERIA

withdrawal, and a large-scale re-emergence of Ebola. The overarching risk is the weakening of
economic policies, which would significantly undermine the baseline scenario.
52.
The policies put in place by the authorities to deal with the shocks go in the right
direction. Ebola has been overall contained, despite small-scale flare-ups, and response capacity has
significantly improved. The strong fiscal measures for the FY2017 budget lay the ground for reduced
dependence on natural resources and foreign assistance. The authorities’ focus on diversification is
the correct long-term answer to dependency on traditional mining and rubber exports. But structural
reform, particularly in the fiscal area and business environment, still falls short of what is needed to
make the economy more resilient to external shocks.
53.
The measures to address the shortfall in natural resource-related revenues and the
decline in external assistance are appropriate. The large tax effort and the cuts in non-essential
spending ensure sustainability of the FY2017 budget. To entrench fiscal sustainability, the authorities
should deepen the domestic revenue mobilization effort, while increasing its fairness component.
They should also shift resources from current to capital spending—while protecting key social
items—and take a longer-term approach to fiscal policy, including through the possible introduction
of a fiscal anchor.
54.
Progress in fiscal reform, in particular PFM, is essential in ensuring budget
predictability, efficiency, and transparency. The authorities have made significant progress but
much remains to be done, particularly in advancing the TSA, improving investment management,
and tightening the grip on financial situation of SOEs.
55.
Debt vulnerabilities are rising. While Liberia’s external debt is relatively low, borrowing
pace has picked up in recent years and is projected to remain strong over the medium term, raising
the risk of debt distress to moderate. Yet, the worsened medium-term outlook has reduced debt
space, which would further be affected by any deterioration of exports. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ commitment to adhere to the debt limits under the ECF and to strictly prioritize
borrowing. Debt policy should be supported by a new medium-term strategy, and the authorities
should consider establish formal debt limits beyond the current ECF.
56.
The authorities should strengthen external buffers. International reserves are still not at
an adequate level for the highly-dollarized Liberian economy. The needed build-up of reserves
depends on the rigorous implementation of the three-year CBL budget and phasing out support to
the financial sector—key recommendations of the 2015 Safeguards Assessment update. In this
regard, the CBL should regularly report on the implementation of the three-year financial plan, as
committed to under the ECF. The CBL should also consider limiting foreign exchange interventions
and allow more exchange rate flexibility. These policies must be supported by an adequate provision
of foreign exchange by the MFDP.
57.
The constraints from the dual currency regime and high dollarization make strong
liquidity management particularly important. Further improving coordination among CBL, MFDP,
and LRA, with a common effort towards the issuance of liquidity instruments; unifying Liberian dollar

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

and U.S. dollar reserve requirements, and reforming the reserve maintenance system; and removing
the Legislature approval of currency printing are all necessary steps towards more effective liquidity
management. In the long run, a gradual process of de-dollarization would also widen the space for
the CBL’s monetary policy.
58.
The CBL should step up its supervision of the banking sector and create an emergency
assistance framework, given the increase in vulnerabilities. Despite high reported capitalization
levels, NPLs have topped 20 percent in 2015 and profitability remains negative, largely because of
provisioning. The deterioration in asset quality and the lack of viable business opportunities increase
risks in the banking sector and hold back its lending capacity. A comprehensive strategy to tackle
rising NPLs is needed, centering on the enforcement of mandatory write-offs of fully provisioned
NPLs. In order to address possible banking difficulties while minimizing use of public resources and
ensuring the maintenance of financial stability, the CBL urgently needs to set up a bank safety net
package, including ELA, bank resolution framework, and deposit insurance.
59.
Action on AML/CFT and tax transparency should be an urgent priority and would help
contain further loss of CBRs. The authorities should step up their efforts to address AML/CFT
legislative gaps, strengthen the institutional capacity of the FIU, and improve bank supervision—the
key factor for credibility of the financial sector. These steps are crucial to avoid further loss of CBRs,
which would severe Liberia’s remaining links with the international financial system.
60.
The commodity price decline has highlighted the importance of economic
diversification to improve economic resilience. A regional comparison shows that diversification
can boost GDP, and that Liberia has potential for horizontal diversification and upgrading of its
export products. But exploiting this potential requires improving the poor business environment to
lay the conditions for private sector growth.
61.
Financial inclusion can help improve economic resilience by supporting diversification
and offering credit options to households. Strengthening the population’s access to financial
services and the promoting the usage of financial services—notably lending to SMEs—is key to
support private sector development and ultimately diversification away from mining and rubber, the
traditional drivers of growth. In addition, better access to financial services could help households
better face economic and life events.
62.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the 24-month cycle.

Annex I. Building Resilience in Liberia and
the Role of the Fund1
Liberia is a fragile economy in which the economic base and institutional capital were
substantially damaged by a prolonged violent conflict. Since the end of conflict in 2003, the
government of Liberia has promoted a reform agenda and significant progress has been made in
terms of restoring basic infrastructure, public services, the economy and the consolidation of the
authority of state with long term goal of decentralized administration at county level. The UN
Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) has helped Liberia to move towards sustainable peace and stability.
Despite progress made, Liberia is still characterized by deep inequalities with regard to
financial resources and economic and social opportunities. Many of the issues that contributed
to the violent conflict are still present, including tensions along ethnic lines, stark disparities
between the rich minority and the impoverished majority, and food insecurity. With the economy
struggling with the twin shocks of Ebola and lower commodity prices, these tensions may be
exacerbated by mass youth unemployment, anger at corruption, and political positioning in the
build up to the 2017 presidential elections.
Given the complex challenges facing the country, building resilience in Liberia requires policy
intervention in several fronts. Key elements of a country strategy for building resilience include
increasing economic opportunities, careful management of natural resource wealth, maintaining
peace and security, adequate public infrastructure investment, and well developed economic and
legal institutions. Political inclusion and checks on political power combined with efforts to improve
governance and the anticorruption framework are also important. Continued donor supports can be
important for resilience by helping in the economic recovery and expanding fiscal space to facilitate
public investment.
Economic growth in Liberia needs to be broad based for the country to visibly reduce
poverty. This will require taking advantage of near term opportunities from agriculture and natural
resource based activities to establish the conditions for diversification into light manufacturing and
service exports (SIP). However, exploiting emerging opportunities will depend largely on building
the conditions necessary for the private sector to flourish including stable macroeconomic
conditions, a strong banking sector, well developed energy and transport infrastructure, and
predictable business environment. Over the medium term, the country will need to rebuild its
education and training programs to improve the skills of its working population. Fiscal policy has a
key role to in this regard by for instance helping mobilize sufficient resources to fund growth
interventions and social protection programs.
Several risk factors could derail program implementation and the country’s development
objectives suggesting the need to develop mitigating policy responses. These risk factors
include slowdown of economic recovery stemming from the recent commodity price shock, a
resurgence of the Ebola outbreak, and social turmoil relating to the presidential elections in 2017.
Mitigation policy responses should these risk factors materialized include maintaining close

communication with the government, flexibility in program implementation, remote program
monitoring and deployment of residential advisors, and additional financial support.
Liberia has received a large amount of technical assistance (TA) and training focusing on
public financial management, revenue administration, monetary policy, financial sector
supervision, and statistics. However, limited capacity and the Ebola crisis delayed TA delivery and
the implementation of TA recommendations. The Fund and the authorities are jointly developing a
comprehensive capacity building framework (CBF) to ensure further progress in the post-Ebola
context. Key elements of the country’s capacity development strategy include improving
expenditure control and project implementation capacity and transparency; improving revenue
administration and strengthening tax policy and natural resource management capacity; producing
reliable GDP estimates and building requisite capacity of staff; developing early warning systems to
tackle threats to financial stability; and building capacity for liquidity management to guide
monetary policy.
The capacity development strategy aims to maximize traction in the context of the expiration
of the current ECF program and the forthcoming presidential elections. This is expected to be
achieved through appropriate targeting of TA, linking TA recommendations and training, and
ensuring stronger collaboration within government. In addition, delivery of TA will shift from
diagnostic missions to hands-on capacity development under the CBF. The strategy also seeks to
enhance coordination between donors and country authorities to help better define TA priorities.

Annex II. Liberia: Review of the Agenda for Transformation1
The Agenda for Transformation (AfT) seeks to addresses the main constraints to growth
consistent the long term objective of achieving a middle-income status by 2030 laid out by
Liberia Rising 2030. In addition to income growth, the strategy supports initiatives that allow a
greater proportion of the population to share in the growth and experience better quality of life.
The 5-year plan, launched in 2013 and covering 2012–17, focuses on achieving key objectives across
four main pillars: peace, security and rule of law; infrastructure and economic transformation;
human development; and governance and public institutions.
The peace, security and rule of law pillar has the objective of creating an atmosphere of
peaceful co-existence through reconciliation and conflict resolution, improved security and
access to justice and rule of law. To date, a total of about US$344 million has been spent on this
pillar with some successes. Available data reported by the authorities shows that about
73.6 percent of Liberians are satisfied with protection against crime and 78 percent of Liberians are
satisfied with the quality of the judicial system. The main challenge stems from the inability of the
government to fully execute security deployment plans ahead of UNMIL drawdown and the need
for the institutionalization of peace and reconciliation conference.
The economic transformation component aims to transform the economy through the
development of the domestic private sector, investment in infrastructure, and enhanced
macroeconomic stability. About US$2.4 billion has been invested in agriculture, roads network,
and energy infrastructure, and sea and air transportation. Some progress has been made particularly
in the area of infrastructure development. The electrification rate in the country has increased from
near zero in 2006 to about 14.4 percent in 2015 and about 1000 km of roads have been paved
between 2006–2016. However, progress in agricultural investment has been slow and needs to be
scaled up to reduce the dependence on rubber and iron ore.
The human development pillar aims to improve the quality of life by investing in more
accessible and higher quality education, health, and water and sanitation services. A total of
about US$1 billion has been spent by both the government and the donor community on health
and education with some remarkable successes. Primary school enrolment rate has increased from
30 percent in 2012 to about 55 percent in 2015. Access to safe drinking water has increased from
700,000 gallons per day in 2006 to 4 million gallons in 2016. However, serious challenges remain
including serious lapses in the implementation of free primary education, shortage of health
workers, and weak health care standards and infrastructure.
The governance pillar aims to create transparent, accountable and responsive public
institutions that contribute to economic and social development as well as inclusive and
participatory governance systems in partnership with citizens. A number of initiatives have been
made to enhance governance including the development of the Liberia Rising 2030, National Code
of Conduct Act, and the Civil Society Organizations-Government of Liberia partnership policy.
However, progress has been slow in areas of combating corruption and improving public financial
management.

Annex III. Liberia: External Sector Assessment1
Liberia faces high external vulnerabilities,
with a significant current account deficit
and large exposure to external shocks. As
a small open economy, Liberia is highly
exposed to various external risks, including
commodity price shocks, spillovers from
major trading and investment partners
(e.g., China) and concerns about a
resurgence of Ebola. The recent shocks of
Ebola and commodity prices have
significantly affected the external outlook,
with exports estimated to drop by about
45 percent in 2015 and only recovering over
the medium term. Despite substantial
foreign aid, the current account deficit rose
from 28 percent in 2013 to 34 percent in
2015. The continued uncertainty in
commodity markets and the likely decline in
aid flows may put strain on the balance of
payments.

consistent with the dynamics of the REER. In
light of Liberia’s high dollarization, with
dollar-denominated exports, large import dependency, and extensive indexation, including of
domestic wages, the exchange rate pass through effect on current account is very limited.
Furthermore, Liberia’s international competitiveness ranking remains low, at 179th place out of
189 countries, based on the 2016 Ease of Doing Business index. As a result, policy measures need to

focus on containing wages, infrastructure investment to reduce costs, and structural reform to
improve the business environment.
Gross foreign exchange reserves appear too low. The current level of gross official reserve is
higher than the lower bound of 2.4 months implied by the LIC reserve template, which is based on
the costs and benefits of holding reserves. Reserves, at 61 percent of broad money, are well above
the 20 percent rule of thumb threshold. However, a more demanding benchmark, such as the
standard three-month coverage, may be more appropriate in light of Liberia’s dual currency system,
very high dollarization, post-conflict status, and its vulnerability to terms of trade shocks and large
import dependence. Furthermore, the CBL’s own reserves position has been vulnerable to
operational expenses and exceptional support to banks. Based on such a benchmark, generally
surpassed by post-conflict and dollarized countries (Table), reserves appear insufficient, underlining
the importance of accumulating more buffer as a first line of defense on the part of the CBL.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding
the baseline. The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with
the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex V. Liberia: Debt Sustainability Analysis1
This Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) updates the analysis presented to the Board in
December 2015. Liberia’s risk of debt distress remains moderate but debt vulnerabilities have
risen. The debt-to-exports and debt-to-GDP ratios have deteriorated compared to the last
review, reflecting the worsened exports and growth outlook.2 The economy remains vulnerable
to negative shocks to terms of trade, borrowing terms, exports, and growth.

A. Underlying Assumptions
1.
The baseline macroeconomic projections in the near to medium term have deteriorated
from the December 2015 DSA (Text table 1). Reflecting the larger than expected adverse impact
of the commodity price shock, GDP
growth has been revised down to an

weakened outlook, external debt
significantly accelerated in recent years, rising from 11 percent of GDP at end-2013 to 23 percent of
GDP at end-2015, and is expected to increase further over the medium term.

B. External DSA
2.
The external DSA indicates a moderate risk of debt distress in the baseline scenario. In
the medium term, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to rise steadily from 14 percent in FY2015
to 22 percent by FY2020 in the baseline scenario, and gradually decline thereafter. The deteriorated
exports outlook, mainly owing to the commodity price shock, has contributed to the projected
increase in the PV of debt-to-export ratio from 37 percent in FY2015 to a peak of 96 percent in
FY2021, close to the 100 percent baseline threshold. The evolution of debt-exports ratio suggests a
“moderate-to-high borderline case”, while the probability charts do not show any breach of
thresholds in the baseline, confirming a moderate risk of debt distress (Figure 3). Due to the highly
concessional nature of new debt, debt-to revenues and debt service indicators remain well below the
thresholds.
3.
However, debt vulnerabilities have risen, with worsened PV of debt-to-GDP and debtto-exports ratios under alternative scenarios. Under the extreme shock scenario of adverse terms
of trade shocks, both the PV of debt-to-exports and external debt-to-GDP ratios breach the
threshold around FY 2019–20 and remain higher than the threshold for an extended period. Both the

magnitude and persistence of the breach have increased compared to the previous DSA, indicating
intensified debt vulnerabilities. Further, the current risk rating is very sensitive to export dynamics,
with any further deterioration in exports would likely push the debt rating from moderate to high. As
in the previous DSA, the PV of debt to revenue and debt service related ratios remain well below
thresholds in all scenarios. The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment of moderate risk rating and
shared staff’s concerns on debt vulnerabilities. They plan to streamline new borrowing over the
medium term focusing only on existing pipeline projects while continuing to prioritize grants and
concessional financing. Nevertheless, they highlighted the tension arising from debt sustainability
and the need to close infrastructure gaps, and noted that the growth dividends would help debt
sustainability. The authorities also called for more donor coordination as some of the externallyfinanced projects were not high priority but would further increase the debt burden.

C. Public DSA
4.
The public DSA has not significantly changed compared to the December update. Under
the baseline and shock scenarios, all debt indicators remain below their respective thresholds. Under
the baseline, the PV of public debt-to-GDP rises steadily from 16 percent in FY2015 to around
22 percent in FY2020 and is expected to fall afterwards. The PV of debt-to-revenue ratio rises to a
peak of 81 percent in FY2019 and then follows a gradual downward path towards the end of the
projection period. The PV of debt service-to-revenue ratio reaches its peak of 7 percent in FY2021
and projected to decline afterwards. Under alternative scenarios, public debt indicators are
particularly sensitive to adverse shocks to lower growth, a large real depreciation, and a significant
increase in other debt-creating flows.

D. Conclusion
5.
Increasing debt vulnerabilities call for prudent borrowing policy and economic
diversification, despite the moderate risk rating. The latest DSA results indicate a rise in debt
vulnerabilities compared with the previous review, underlined most notably by the deterioration of
debt to exports and debt to GDP ratios in the extreme shock scenario, though the risk of debt
distress remains moderate as confirmed by the probability approach. Nevertheless, the debt rating is
very close to the high risk category and particularly vulnerable to export shocks. In the case of a high
risk rating caused by any further deterioration in debt and exports outlook, the debt limit
conditionality would be reassessed in line with the new debt limit policy.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the
baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after
the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Annex VI. Liberia: Public Debt Management—Enhancing the
Debt Management Unit1
A. Policy Context for Public Debt Management (PDM)
1.
The debt carrying capacity of Liberia has weakened, underlining the need to further
develop the capacity to analyze the costs and risks of the debt portfolio. The macroeconomic
outlook has been affected by Ebola and the commodity price shock, with exports hit hard and
growth slowing down. In the meantime, external borrowing has accelerated since 2012, with the
external debt stock about to rise above regional and developing country averages. Debt
sustainability analysis indicates that the debt ratios breach the high-risk threshold in shock
scenarios, with the debt outlook particularly vulnerable to shocks to borrowing terms, growth and
exports.

B. Toward an Updated Medium Term Debt Strategy
2.
There is a need to develop the capacity to analyze the costs and risks of the debt
portfolio. As domestic and external debts have various characteristics, including differing lenders,
currency denominations, interest rates and repayment profiles, this exposes public debt to different
future risks and liabilities. The risks inherent in the debt structure should be carefully evaluated and
mitigated.
3.
Once the analytical capacity has been strengthened, it will be important to update the
Medium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS), based on clear debt management objectives. Given the
medium-term macroeconomic outlook, the authorities need to strengthen the framework for public
debt management. A formal update, informed by the recently concluded DeMPA would include a
rigorous analysis of cost and risk and how the debt portfolio is likely to evolve through time. The
debt management strategy should also clearly spell out sources of financing through external or
domestic sources.

C. Legal and Institutional Arrangements
4.
It will be important to adopt a law on PDM, under preparation, which would specify
the borrowing regime for the Government and the role of the DMU. Currently, responsibilities
for debt management activities in Liberia carried out by the Ministry of Finance and Development
Planning (MFDP) and the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL), with inputs from executing ministries/
agencies. The cash planning and loan servicing to creditors are carried out by the MFDP and CBL,
respectively. Pursuant to Section 28 of the PFM law of 2009, the minister of finance is responsible to
oversee all borrowing activities on behalf of the Government of Liberia, subject to the limit granted
by the Legislatures in approving the budget. The minister of finance carries out these functions
through the Debt Management Committee, as Chair, with the Executive Governor of the CBL, the
1

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

LIBERIA

Minister of State without Portfolio and the Minister of Justice as members. The new law would
include elements of the current regime and the functions of an enhanced and reorganized the
DMU.
5.
A new law is required to empower the DMU to achieve the objectives of the PDM. The
capacity of the DMU can be achieved building on its current strengths, as well as the expert support
by the CBL on issuing debt. The DMU should evolve to consist of the front, middle and back offices.
The core functions of the three units should be: (i) front office: carrying out the primary issues and
other portfolio management operations, negotiating and managing of loans and conditional
liabilities; (ii) middle office: developing the portfolio strategy and an annual financing plan,
monitoring implementation of the plan and reporting on activities; and (iii) back office: recording,
reconciling, confirming, effecting payment of transactions, providing IT support and strategies, and
managing the database.
6.
In line with DMU best practices, the following elements are of key importance: (i) the
head of the DMU must be a Director General, who reports directly to the Minister; (ii) management
and reporting of external and domestic debt should be integrated; (iii) the MoF must decide how
best to target the recruitment process, including upgrading the qualifications of current staff
through training programs; (iv) the DMU’s operations should be based on a new procedures
manual, to be prepared, covering internal management, including communication and dealing with
operational risk; new procedures will be needed in due course to cover the new analytical functions
(including preparing and monitoring the MTDS) for when the upgraded DMU becomes fully
operational.

D. Transparency and Accountability
7.
Debt-related, financial and economic statistics should be regularly provided by the
DMO to stakeholders such as senior financial and economic management, the Legislature, the
public and investors. Debt recording, currently primarily carried out in the DMU using the
Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording and Management System (CS-DRMS), and utilized by
the Comptroller and Accountant General and the Budget Department, should be strengthened to
include any arrears and should also be used for publication. The securities market will also benefit
from the regular publication of an issuance calendar and from further clarity. Drawing-up an
agreement between the MoF and the CBL on the use of T-bills for both fiscal and monetary
operations purposes, and a Memorandum-of-Understanding for the securitization of government
debt currently on the CBL balance sheet will enhance transparency and the functioning of the
primary market for government securities. Finally, the secondary market for government securities
needs to be developed and investor relations need to be strengthened and carried out year-round
with the adoption of best practices.

E. Technical Assistance (TA) Needs, Program and Coordination
8.
TA needs identified can be met by the IMF, the World Bank (WB) and the regional TA
training centers. In addition to organizing and enhancing the operations of the DMU and drafting

50

LIBERIA

an operations manual, the authorities plan to request training for Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
preparation, the evaluation of the risk of the debt portfolio, the update of the MTDS and the
development of the capital markets and a LTX resident advisor in PDM. The IMF would provide TA
for training for Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) preparation, together with the regional TA training
centers: the West African Institute of Financial and Economic Management (WAIFEM), where DMU
staff will attend a course on public debt statistics in July 2016, and the Tunisia IMF regional training
center. The IMF is ready also provide TA in enhancing the debt management capacity of the DMU,
the drafting of a procedures manual, the evaluation of the risk of the debt portfolio, the update of
the MTDS (together with the World Bank) and the development of the capital markets. The IMF will
help identify and backstop a LTX in PDM, while the authorities plan to seek financing for the Advisor
from the U.S. Treasury.

Safeguards Assessment
The November 2015 update assessment noted that safeguards risks at the CBL remain elevated due
to the slow progress in implementing safeguards recommendations. The 2015 assessment
recommended aligning the bank’s investment guidelines with best international practice (prior action
for the fourth program review), developing and implementing a strategy to address the imbalances
between operating revenues and expenditures to improve the CBL's financial position (structural
benchmark for the fourth program review), and strengthening independent oversight by the Board
of Governors and the Audit Committee. While the prior actions on the three-year financial plan and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LIBERIA

investment guidelines were met, the other recommendations, including the structural benchmark on
monitoring the financial plan, remain to be implemented. This resulted in further deterioration of the
CBL’s financial position in FY2015 with large operating losses eroding equity reserves.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
Liberia maintains an exchange rate system that is free of restrictions on payments for current and
capital transfers. The currency of Liberia is the Liberian dollar. The U.S. dollar is also legal tender. The
de facto exchange rate regime is classified as ‘other managed arrangement’ since November, 2011
when the exchange rate departed from the stabilized 2 percent six-month band. The de jure
exchange rate regime classification remains ‘managed floating’. The Central Bank of Liberia (CBL)
intervenes in the foreign exchange market to smooth volatility. The exchange rate between the
Liberian dollar and United States dollar at June 7, 2016 was L$92.5=US$1 (mid-point between buying
and selling rates).
Article IV Consultation, Review of the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) Arrangement, and
Request of the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) Arrangement and Debt Relief under the Catastrophe

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
(As of June 2, 2016)

A. Bank Group Strategy
The current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Liberia was discussed by the Board of the World
Bank Group on July 30, 2013. The overarching objective of the CPS (2013 -2017) is to support the
Government’s Agenda for Transformation (AfT) to contribute to sustained growth, poverty reduction
and shared prosperity while exiting fragility and building resilience. In this regard, the CPS pillars are
aligned with three key pillars of the AfT: (i) Economic Transformation to reduce constraints to
rapid, broad-based and sustained economic growth to create employment; (ii) Human
Development to increase access and quality of basic social services and reduce vulnerability; and
(iii) Governance and Public Sector Institutions to improve public sector and natural resources
governance. In addition, the CPS is focused on the themes of capacity development and gender
equity both of which will be mainstreamed throughout the Bank Group’s portfolio.
The World Bank Group’s program under the CPS involves a combination of development policy
lending, investment lending and analytical work in support of the strategic pillars. The IDA allocation
for the lending program for the CPS period is approximately US$308 million, including IDA 16 (up to
June 2014) and the full IDA 17 allocation. The majority of the IDA financing during the CPS period
will focus on investment in the energy and transport sectors to help remove binding constraints to
growth and improve well-being. IDA financing under the CPS will also support building institutional
and human capacity essential for the effective implementation of the AfT and the country’s longterm vision plan.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) investment over the CPS period is expected to average
US$25–35 million per year. The current IFC portfolio comprises US$24.4 million in equity;
US$37.3 million credit and trade lines; US$13 million seed investment in the West Africa Venture
Fund for direct on-lending to, or equity in SMEs (US$6.8 million allocated for Liberia and balance for
Sierra Leone) and US$33.5 million debt financing approved and committed to the rubber and cocoa
sectors. The priority sectors for IFC’s investments include agribusiness, infrastructure including
power, financial services and mining. IFC’s advisory service will include strategic engagement in
investment climate improvement, leasing, finance services infrastructure and private sector
development.
In response to the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak, the World Bank Group has provided
extraordinary support to Liberia, well beyond the scope of the CPS including commitment of some
US$177 million from the Crisis Response Window (CRW). In the wake of the Ebola crisis, the World
Bank Group has undertaken a rapid review of its strategy and portfolio to ensure they remain
aligned with the country’s development needs.

B. Active Projects
There are currently twelve active2 IDA projects in Liberia, including three regional projects, with a
total commitment of approximately US$594.4 million of which approximately US$219.7 million is
undisbursed. Three new projects were approved in FY2016 for a total of US$30.0 million. These three
projects are summarized below:
The Liberia Urban Water Supply Project was approved on March 24, 2016 for US$10 million. The
project development objectives are to increase access to piped water supply services in the project
area in Monrovia and improve the operational efficiency of Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation
(LWSC). The project has two components: (a) infrastructure improvements in Monrovia including
targeted repairs and rehabilitations of the existing distribution network and extension of the
distribution network to new areas and customers, and (b) capacity building for the LWSC, including
the development of improved project management and monitoring and evaluation arrangements.
The Liberia Social Safety Net Project was approved on April 28, 2016 for US$10 million. The
project development objective is to establish the key building blocks of a basic national safety net
delivery system and provide income support to households who are both extremely poor and food
insecure in the Republic of Liberia. The project consists of the following three components:
(i) Strengthening of the National Social Safety Net System. This components supports the
development of an information system for the delivery of social assistance, data collection and
household registration and an eligibility screening mechanism to assess the poverty and food
insecurity conditions of households; (ii) Cash Transfers to Extremely Poor and Food Insecure
Households. This component covers the provision of income support to about 10,000 extremely
poor and food insecure households through regular cash transfers; and (iii) Project Management and
Capacity Building, covering capacity building of the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social
Protection to implement the project and strengthening coordination at the national and subnational
levels.
The Liberia Youth Opportunities Project was approved on November 6, 2015 for US$10 million.
The Project Development Objectives are to improve access to income generation opportunities for
targeted youth and strengthen the government’s capacity to implement its cash transfer program.
The project has four components: (i) Pre-employment Social Support and Household Enterprises for
Urban Youth, addressing youth labor market participation and behavioral constraints; (ii) Productive
Public Works and Life Skills Support, providing vulnerable youth in rural areas with immediate
consumption smoothing support through productive public works and life skills training;
(iii) Capacity Building for Cash Transfer Program, supporting the building blocks for a basic safety net
system, including (a) improving targeting; (b) strengthening ICT systems and electronic payments
systems; (c) establishing information management systems; (d) ensuring a functional M&E system;
and (e) strengthening of social accountability and grievance redress systems; and (iv) Project

Implementation and Coordination, supporting implementation and coordination across ministries
and agencies.

C. Economic and Sector Work
The World Bank has completed a comprehensive Public Expenditure Review (2013), which
explores various options for fiscal space enlargement. Given the large amount of additional
expenditure required for the implementation of the government’s second Poverty Reduction
Strategy- the Agenda for Transformation, it is critical that all options are examined to accommodate
these expenditures. The PER focuses on measures for: (a) improving the efficiency of public
expenditure; (b) increasing the amount of external grants; (c) mobilizing greater revenue from taxes,
non-tax revenue and natural resources; and (d) public sector borrowing.
The World Bank has also completed a human development Public Expenditure Review
covering the education, health and social protection sectors (2012). Public spending on the
human development sector in Liberia is low by Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) standards. The PER,
therefore, examines a number of key public expenditure issues affecting progress in attaining the
MDGs. The Review considers the sources and levels of funding, budgetary allocations across and
within the sectors, and the quality, equity and efficiency of public expenditure on human
development.
The World Bank has completed a policy note on Jobs “Creating More and Better Jobs in
Liberia: Issues and Options (2014).” The Government of Liberia is deeply concerned by what is
perceived to be relatively high rates of joblessness in an economy that is recovering from fourteen
years of civil conflict. A comprehensive policy response to the Government’s concern is constrained
by a lack of critical knowledge. Furthermore, traditional metrics for measuring the performance of
the labor market poorly cover the dominant urban and rural informal sectors, or the extent of
underemployment. The note is therefore intended to help fill the critical knowledge gap through a
systematic analysis of the labor market, focusing on issues related to both the demand and supply
sides. The analysis draws on quantitative information from the 2007 and 2010, Core Welfare
Indicator Questionnaires Survey (CWIQS); the 2010 Labor Force Survey; the 2012 Poverty Note as
well as the host of quantitative and qualitative analyses done on Liberia and in the region over the
last five years. The note focuses on issues on both the demand and supply sides of the labor market,
as well as the effects of employment protection legislation.

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK1
(As of May 15, 2016)
There are 18 active AfDB projects in Liberia, in addition to projects funded by trust funds. The
portfolio has a total commitment of approximately UA 273.86 million, equivalent to
US$377.93 million, of which about 30 percent is disbursed. A brief description of these projects is
provided below.
1.
Integrated Public Financial Management Reform Project (IPFMRP): The AfDB’s
UA 3.0 million grant support for this project was approved on September 10, 2012. Supported by
four donors—the AfDB, World Bank, USAID, and SIDA—this US$28.55 million project represents an
innovative approach for the Bank to support a comprehensive government program for PFM
reform. By using a pooled funding arrangement, the project harmonizes support from the four
donors, increasing development effectiveness while decreasing the administrative burden on the
Government. The project has five components, which are mutually reinforcing: (i) enhancing budget
planning and credibility; (ii) strengthening budget execution, accounting and reporting;
(iii) strengthening revenue administration; (iv) Enhancing transparency and accountability; and
(v) project management and capacity building. This support ends on March 31, 2017.
2.
Regional Payment Systems Development Project: This UA 5 million supplementary grant
enables Liberia to join the West Africa Monetary Zone (WAMZ) Payments System Development
Project. The project aims to improve the financial sector basic infrastructure in the WAMZ region
through the upgrade of the payments systems of The Gambia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. The
project components include: Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system; Retail Payments
Automation (RPA), a clearing system comprising Automated Checks Processing (ACP); Automated
Clearing House (ACH); Central Banking Applications (CBA) system; and telecommunication
infrastructure. The project will increase participation in the formal financial sector and enhance
financial flows at the regional level.
3.
Liberia–Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project (UWSSP): This UA 26.1 million grant
project aims to improve Monrovia’s water and sanitation facilities. The project will: (i) provide access
to adequate, safe and reliable water supply and public sanitation services in Monrovia, Buchanan,
Kakata, and Zwedru; and (ii) enhance the institutional, operational, management capability, and the
long-term financial viability of LWSC. The Project’s components are: (i) Rehabilitation and
augmentation of water treatment and distribution systems; (ii) Provision of public sanitation
facilities; (iii) Institutional support; (iv) Environmental and Sanitation Sensitization.

4.
Agriculture Sector Rehabilitation Project (ASRP): This UA 18.4 million project is financed
by a UA 12.5 million grant from the Bank, UA 3.4 million grant from IFAD, and the balance funded in
kind by the Government of Liberia. The project covers eight of the fifteen counties in Liberia. The
goal of the ASRP is to contribute to food security and poverty reduction. Its specific objective is to
increase the income of smallholder farmers and rural entrepreneurs including women on a
sustainable basis. The project is implemented under three components: Agriculture Infrastructure
Rehabilitation; Agricultural Production and Productivity Improvement; and Project Management,
with Agriculture infrastructure constituting 60 percent of the cost.
5.
Smallholder Agricultural Productivity Enhancement and Commercialization (SAPEC)
Project: This UA 34.08 million project will be funded by a UA 29.08 million grant from the Global
Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), a UA 4.0 million ADF loan, and UA 1.0 million by
in-kind contributions from the Government of Liberia. The intervention seeks to reduce rural
poverty and household food insecurity by increasing income for smallholder farmers and rural
entrepreneurs particularly women, youths and the physically-challenged. SAPEC will be
implemented in 12 of the 15 counties of Liberia over 2014 to 2017 and seeks to scale-up the
on-going Agricultural Sector Rehabilitation Project (ASRP). The project consists of four components,
namely: (i) Sustainable Crop Production Intensification; (ii) Value Addition and Marketing;
(iii) Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening; and (iv) Project Management.
6.
Maryland Oil Palm Plantation (MOPP) – Private Sector: The project is located in
Maryland and Grand Kru Counties in South East Liberia and entails the following: (i) clearing,
rejuvenating, and operating a 9,000 hectare abandoned palm oil plantation in Maryland county;
(ii) developing two oil palms nurseries; (iii) establishing a 6,000 hectare out grower farmer scheme
benefitting 750 families; and (iv) constructing an oil mill with a processing capacity of 90 tons of
fresh fruit bunches per hour. The project cost totals USD 203.3 million with USD 164.9 million to
finance the industrial component and USD 38.4 million for the out grower scheme.
7.
Equity investment of US$1.2 million in the share capital of Access Bank (ABL): Access
Bank Liberia (ABL) is a start-up microfinance bank sponsored in 2009/2010 by Access Microfinance
Holding AG, with co-support by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the European
Investment Bank (EIB). A capital increase of US$209,000 was approved in 2012. Access Bank is also
benefitting from a US$ 460,000 grant funded by the Fund for Africa Private Sector Assistance
(FAPA), approved in 2015, which is supporting technical assistance.
8.
Fostering Innovative Sanitation and Hygiene in Monrovia: The objective of the grant of
Euro 1.2 million from the African Water Facility administered by the ADB is to increase access to
sustainable and affordable sanitation services with improved hygiene and livelihood for Monrovia’s
urban poor. The specific objectives include: (a) increase access to safe, sustainable and affordable
sanitation services; (b) reduce the vulnerability of the urban poor populace to WASH related
diseases caused by water contamination; and (c) implement an effective, efficient and sustainable FS
management system with production of affordable FS fertilizer to increase scalable food security.

9.
Paving Fish Town – Harper Road Project (Phase I): The objective of the Project is to
provide efficient road transport access to South East Counties of Liberia and, by extension, to
neighboring Mano River Union States. The project will involve upgrading from gravel to bitumen
standard the Fish Town–Harper Road (Phase 1): Harper–Karloken section (50km) at an estimated
cost of UA 43.04 million including GoL counterpart funding of UA 1.0 million. The expected
outcomes include: (a) improved socio-economic inclusion of population in south-east region;
(b) attraction of investments with employment creation and stronger government presence;
(c) facilitated cross-border trade in MRU member states; and (d) employment generation during
construction and post construction phase.
10.
Mano River Union (MRU) Road Development and Transport Facilitation Program: The
MRU Road Development and Transport Facilitation program will upgrade to bitumen standard
276.35 km of roads in eastern Guinea, West and South-West Côte d’Ivoire, and eastern Liberia.
The Program will be executed from June 2015 to June 2019 for an estimated net total cost of
UA 221.97 million. Liberia’s portion, covering Karloken-Fish Town (80 km) and Harper-Cavalla
junction (16 km), is a UA 76.88 million loan from ADF and TSF. The project will also include the
construction of joint border control posts.
11.
Regional Electricity Interconnection Project: Cote d’Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and
Guinea (CLSG). The CLSG electricity interconnection project will construct a 1,357-km-long double
circuit high voltage (225 kV) line to connect the national networks of the four countries
(Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea (CLSG)). This line is part of the backbone of the
Mano River Union countries and one of the priority projects of the West African Power Pool (WAPP)
Master Plan. The project will help establish a dynamic electric power market in the West African
sub-region and secure power supply for participating countries which have a comparative
advantage in importing power rather than producing it domestically. The project, estimated at an
overall cost of UA 331.51 million, will be implemented over the 2014–17 period. The contribution of
the Bank Group (ADF, FSF and NTF) amounts to UA 128.15 million (or 38.7 percent of the total cost).
Some 24 million residents in the impact area will benefit from reliable electric power at competitive
cost. The project will raise the average electricity access rate in the four countries from 28 percent in
2012 to 33 percent by 2017. The increased electricity access will contribute to improving the welfare
of the beneficiaries and lead to the development of social and income-generating activities.
12.
Ebola Response Projects: Between 2014 and 2015, the AfDB prepared various multinational
projects in response to the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). While a number closed, the following are still
on-going:
a. Ebola Fight Back Budget Support Program: This is a UA 100.2 million multinational
program across Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, of which Liberia’s portion is a
UA 40.2 million loan. The operation contributes towards addressing the fiscal gap created by
the epidemic in the countries, supporting measures to respond to the crisis, and the need to
address longer term issues to develop economic resilience.

b. Strengthening West Africa Public Health Systems (SWAPHS): This UA 40 million
multinational project, of which a USD 11.4 million grant is directly allocated to Liberia, is
intended to achieve three broad strategic outcomes: building human resource capacity and
systems for emergency response and preparedness, infrastructure development, and
strengthening governance and regional institutions.
c.

13.

Post Ebola Recovery Social Investment Fund (PERSIF) (UA 2 million grant): This program
is providing seed funding to establish a Social Investment Fund to finance demand-driven,
small-scale activities on the basis of calls for proposals issued by the Fund. It is expected to
play a catalytic role in improving community response to outbreaks, thereby contributing to
inclusive growth, gender equality and poverty reduction in the three affected countries.
Technical Assistance from Fragile States Facility and other Trust Funds:

a. Promoting local, participatory governance for County Development Funds:
UA 114,833 grant to minimize corruption and ensure effective delivery of development
initiatives in the 15 counties of Liberia by: (i) increasing the public’s awareness of the two
major funds—County Development and Social Development Funds—allocated for
development in the counties; (ii) building the capacity of 750 youths to engage decision
makers and managers of the funds; and (iii) actively participating in the planning,
monitoring, and reporting on the funds.
b. Capacity Building and Technical Support to the National Housing Authority:
UA 240,000 grant to develop capacity for architects, engineers, draftsmen and surveyors to
oversee effectively the design and implementation of housing projects. The capacity
building will also improve internal functions like budgeting, monitoring, procurement and
financial reporting and IT system
c.

Technical Assistance and Capacity Building Support to the Liberia Institute of Statistics
and Geo-Information Services (TCB-LISGIS): This is a UA 500,000 grant that will support
LISGIS to strengthen institutional and staff capacity, to conduct analysis, publish and
disseminate results from the HIES and other related surveys. The data will be used to
monitor the implementation of Liberia’s national development strategy-the Agenda for
Transformation 2012–2017, and the Bank’s Country Strategy Paper 2013–17.

Program of Assistance to Trade Support Institutions in Liberia (PATSIL): This UA 658,735
project focuses on human capacity building by improving the human resource capacity of key trade
support institutions to analyze and enhance policy framework of the trade sector, formulate and
implement trade policies, improve institutional productivity and performance of the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry and National Ports Authority through provision of logistical support.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 21, 2016)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. Shortcomings are most
serious in the areas of national accounts, government finance, and balance of payments statistics.
National Accounts: Comprehensive national accounts data, including GDP, are not available due to
limited capacity. Fund staff estimate GDP by activity using the production approach and primary source
data provided by the Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS). Estimates for
GDP by expenditure are not available. The processing of the 2012 National Accounts Annual Survey
(NAAS 2012) was completed in June 2014, but several issues were identified within the data.
Consequently, the set of GDP estimates for 2008–13 presents serious inconsistencies. AFRITAC West 2
in coordination with the World Bank assisted the LISGIS to develop a more robust and reliable set of
GDP estimates based on the NAAS 2012 and administrative source data. The authorities are currently
preparing to publish these estimates.
With support from the World Bank, a Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) was conducted
from January to July 2014, but ceased in August due to the Ebola outbreak, and then a full 12-month
HIES was started in January 2016. The data collected to date have been processed and will be used in
developing preliminary estimates of household final consumption expenditure (HFCE).
Price Statistics: Currently, the LISGIS produces a CPI with December 2005 as the base year. Prices are
collected only in Monrovia and the weights were last updated in 2006, based on data from neighboring
countries. The AFRITAC West 2 and the EDDI1 2 projects are assisting the LISGIS to introduce, during
2016, a new market basket based on the six month 2014 HIES. By 2019 it is expected that the weights
will be further updated based on the results of the full 12-month HIES and national price collection will
be introduced.
The LISGIS does not currently compile a PPI for Liberia because this requires that an Economic Census
be conducted, but this is planned for 2016.
Government Finance Statistics: Liberia has reported to STA annual GFS data up to 2013 for budgetary
central government and central government, excluding social security. The Ministry of Finance is in the
process of phasing in the GFSM 2001 framework. The most recent GFS TA mission in 2013 found a
number of areas for improvement, including lack of a legal framework to collect GFS; limited data
sharing and coordination among data-producing agencies; inconsistent institutional coverage of
the general government in other sectors (e.g., national accounts and monetary statistics); omission of
some externally funded flows and nonmonetary transactions; lack of a government financial balance
sheet (Table 6 in GFSY). A DFID funded TA-mission, scheduled for September 2016, will address some
of these issues.

Liberia: Statistical Issues (continued)
Monetary and Financial Statistics: A Monetary Financial Statistics (MFS) mission provided assistance
to the authorities in April 2013, with the aim of helping Liberia implement the standardized report
forms (SRFs). The mission documented some progress in the area of MFS, but the SRF project has not
moved forward since then, and at present there are no plans to finalize it. Data submission was
suspended in March 2014. It resumed in April 2016 with reporting of central bank, other depository
corporations’ and interest rate data until January 2016, but with gaps in the central bank’s reporting
form.
Financial sector surveillance: The authorities provide some basic financial soundness indicators (FSIs).
Data are not sufficient to conduct stress tests of the banking system or a Balance Sheet Approach
analysis. Cross border exposure data for financial corporations are not available.
External sector statistics: Reporting is not comprehensive. Balance of payments statistics are compiled
on a BPM5 basis, but the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) is now making efforts to adopt BPM6
methodology. International Investment Position (IIP) statistics have not yet been compiled. Several
areas need improvement, particularly with regard to primary source data, methodology, compilation
practices, and frequency and timeliness in data dissemination. Coverage needs to be improved in
current (investment income), capital (development aid, remittances,) and financial accounts (direct
investment, portfolio investment, and reserve assets). In August 2015, the CBL developed a three year
work plan to address these issues and to conduct new surveys for improving data coverage and
accuracy.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) since October 2005. Metadata for
most data categories were updated in January
2013.

No Data ROSC mission has been conducted.

III. Reporting to STA
The authorities report, for the related publications (IFS, GFSY, and BOPSY), annual balance of payments
data and government finance statistics. Some financial soundness indicators (FSIs) are provided for the
IMF database, but not all core FSIs; the reported indicators are not timely. Reserves data have not been
reported for many years.

Statement by Chileshe Mpundu Kapwepwe, Executive Director for Liberia and
Ms. Gloria Gasasira-Manzi and Mr. Bernard Wleh Jappah, Advisors to the Executive Director
July 8, 2016
Introduction
We thank staff for the constructive engagement with the Liberian authorities during the recent
Article IV Consultations held in Monrovia, and the well-written set of reports. My authorities
broadly agree with the staff assessment and find the discussions broadly consistent with the
pillars of their medium term economic growth and development strategy, under the Agenda for
Transformation (AFT 2012–2017).
Recent Economic Developments and Macroeconomic Outlook
Economic growth in Liberia has been severely weakened by the steep decline in the international
prices of Liberia’s two major commodities, iron ore and rubber. The outbreak of Ebola in 2014,
further strained the economy, significantly eroding gains made in the areas of poverty reduction
and growth. Consequent to the twin shocks, the economy contracted with GDP growth falling
from 8.7 percent in 2013 to 0 by 2015.
This notwithstanding, economic activity is expected to rebound to 2.5 percent in 2016, averaging
5.5 percent over the medium term, spurred by the resumption of public investment in
transportation and energy. The possible resurgence of Ebola, however, remains a major risk to
the recovery process. To strengthen capacity and resilience to combat any outbreak of the
disease, the authorities have targeted investment in the health sector and the containment of
recent flare ups of the disease allude to the positive returns of this investment. In addition, a Bill
has been submitted to the National Legislature for the establishment of a National Health
Institute, which will help Liberia increase surveillance, laboratory and outbreak response
capacity and efficiency for detection and response to public health threats.
Inflation has remained in single digits benefitting from lower international food and oil prices
and the gradual improvement in domestic food production, occasioned by the halt of Ebola as
well as the relative stability of the exchange rate. The current account deteriorated in 2015
mainly due to a decline in export earnings. The decline in imports due to lower international oil
prices and Ebola-related inflows was more than offset by exports which declined by about
40 percent relative to 2014.
Liberia is scheduled to hold general and presidential elections in October 2017 which are
historical as it will be the first time that an elected leader transfers power to another. The
authorities remain fully committed to continue to institute policies aimed at achieving economic,
political and social stability. In this regard, they have invested in the security sector by recruiting
and training additional security personnel. This is also in line with the drawdown of the United
Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL).

2
Fiscal Policy and Public Financial Management
The 2016/17 Budget resource envelope declined by 11 percent compared to 2015/16. The Budget
is underpinned by stringent fiscal policy measures to provide critical public goods and services
as well as deliver on targeted investment projects. These growth-enhancing measures are well
anchored in the Medium Term Expenditure Framework. To boost revenue generation, the
authorities have submitted to the National Legislature, a number of amendments to the Revenue
Code, including measures focused on strengthening indirect taxation, without further depressing
economic activity. The authorities are also streamlining recurrent expenditures to reflect national
priorities in a manner that safeguards social spending. Capital spending will be limited to
ongoing projects under the Public Sector Investment Plan (PSIP).
The current legal and regulatory framework requires that all budgets submitted for approval by
the National Legislature to be “balanced”, with no room for deficits. The one-off requirements to
support both the 2017 elections and replacement costs in the security sector, compounded by the
envisaged revenue shortfall, have made the application of this principle a challenge to the
authorities. While the 2016/17 budget has been designed to accommodate these developments,
there still remains a case for additional sources of funding including support from development
partners and highly concessional financing for critical projects to steer the country on a firm and
sustainable growth trajectory.
Significant strides have been made in public financial management reforms. The Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) roll-out, payroll verification exercises and
the introduction of new procurement regulations to guide the conduct of vendor transactions are
key steps that have been instituted by the authorities. In addition, steady progress is being made
in the implementation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA).
Debt Management
The authorities are cognizant of the prevailing risks that could escalate the debt thresholds from
moderate to high risk category and are committed to remain within the confines of the borrowing
limits agreed with the Fund. Consultations on a new debt management manual reflecting the
authorities’ policy of keeping debt at sustainable levels are ongoing. Grants are high on the scale
of preference to support infrastructure development, closely followed by highly concessional
options. The authorities are also mindful of the need to maintain borrowing space for future
administration’s development agenda.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
Monetary policy stance is to primarily support low inflation and exchange rate stability. As such,
foreign exchange market interventions are aimed at smoothening the movement in the exchange
rate. The Board of the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) approved a three-year financial plan in
December 2015 that envisages a reduction in the CBL’s operational deficits and prioritizes the
accumulation of reserves, targeting gross reserves at about 3 months of prospective imports by

3
end-2016. Policy credibility and efficacy have been reinforced with improved collaboration
between the fiscal and monetary authorities including through an institutionalized liquidity
management framework.
Further, the government intends to continue discussions with the National Legislature to reverse
an amendment to the CBL Act that mandates the issuance of currency to the approval of the
Legislature, in order to strengthen central bank autonomy and improve the conduct of monetary
policy.
Financial Sector Policies
The authorities are committed to taking bold measures to preserve the stability of the banking
sector, which has been negatively impacted by the commodity price shock and Ebola. As a
manifestation of this commitment, the CBL has engaged the Fund to assist in setting up a
framework for macro prudential supervision of the banking system. In addition, the CBL has
launched the Financial Sector Development Implementation Project (FSDIP) as a vehicle for
instituting reforms to the existing fundamentals of the system, including capital adequacy
regulations and the stress testing frameworks. This would align the central bank’s practices to
standards promulgated by the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision.
To address the issue of high percentage of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs), the authorities are
strengthening the CBL’s enforcement and supervisory capacities, as well as exploring setting up
an Asset Management Company to market distressed assets.
While de-risking is a global problem, there has been a heavy loss of correspondent banking
relationships in Liberia for a wide range of reasons, as highlighted in the staff report (selected
issues paper). With respect to weaknesses in the AML/CFT Framework, the authorities have
committed to fully funding the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) in the FY2017 budget, amid
broad cuts in a tight fiscal environment and to ensure compliance to standards set by the
Financial Action Task force (FATF). In addition, a joint effort between the authorities and the
United States Department of Treasury, Office of Technical Assistance (OTA) has also been
launched to further strengthen the country’s AML/CFT regime.
With the goal to fostering financial inclusion, the authorities are working to develop the
necessary regulatory framework to support additional delivery channels of financial products and
services. In this regard, the CBL, working with other stakeholders, has established 11 rural
community finance institutions (RCFIs) across the country to boost access to finance in the rural
areas.
Structural Reforms
To achieve strong, inclusive growth, the authorities are committed to implement structural
reforms to facilitate economic diversification, improve existing infrastructure and the business
environment. With agriculture as the anchor of the diversification policy, the authorities, are

4
working on a string of initiatives under the Liberia Agriculture Transformation Agenda. This is
expected to spur productivity and diversification of the agricultural sector and related value
additions.
Limited access to electricity, due to low generation, has increasingly become a binding constraint
to business and investment. The limited power supply has tilted consumption cost north of
$0.54 per kilowatt hour, ranking electricity costs among the highest in Africa. To address this
predicament, the authorities have intensified investment in the power sector. In this regard, the
first Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) power plant is already operating and two more plants are expected to
start over the coming months while the Mount Coffee hydropower project is expected to produce
electricity from December 2016. The government has also signed a grant agreement with the
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) to boost transmission, distribution and access to
electricity.
The accession to World Trade Organization (WTO) protocols was ratified by the Senate in April
2016 and is awaiting concurrence of the House of Representatives. The benefits of conformity,
which includes lower cost of imports and access to wider markets, are seen by the authorities as
necessary elements to propel growth.
Conclusion
Emerging from fragility has proved to be a challenge in the face of exogenous shocks. In spite of
the immediate hurdles, the authorities reaffirm their steadfast commitment to building capacity
and instituting prudent policy actions geared towards economic recovery. In close collaboration
with development partners, the Liberian authorities have committed to implement macro-critical
reforms, both fiscal and monetary aimed at reversing the dire situation and build the foundation
for lasting recovery. Additionally, the authorities wish to continue leveraging Fund’s
engagement and technical assistance in the implementation of the Ebola Economic Recovery
Plan, which is a short term off-shoot to the medium term Agenda for Transformation.
