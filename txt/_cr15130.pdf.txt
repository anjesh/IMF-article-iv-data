STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 23, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and risks. The outlook remains challenging from both a cyclical and structural
standpoint. The hoped-for output recovery has not materialized—domestic demand
remains sluggish and inflation low and external uncertainties have increased. More
fundamentally, relatively weak non-manufacturing productivity has been accompanied
by a heavy, and likely unsustainable, reliance on manufacturing exports for growth while
also leaving the economy more exposed to external shocks, and the demographic
headwinds from a rapidly aging population are beginning to build.
Policy assessment. Building on the authorities’ recent monetary, fiscal, and other policy
measures to stimulate demand, efforts should remain focused on shoring up economic
momentum where the currently weak outlook could have a lasting impact on Korea’s
growth well beyond the near term. Given asymmetric costs of the downside risk of low
growth and inflation becoming entrenched the authorities should take additional preemptive stimulatory monetary and fiscal policy actions if clear signs of a recovery do not
emerge soon. At the same time sustaining longer-term growth and reducing external
imbalances call for structural reforms to address low service sector productivity, support
a more dynamic corporate and SME sector, and remove barriers that lead to
underutilized labor. Maintaining a flexible exchange rate is essential both as a buffer
against external shocks and to facilitate adjustment toward domestic sources of growth
and thereby reduce external imbalances.

LONGSTANDING GROWTH CHALLENGES
1.
Long-run growth trends. Korea’s economic performance has been on a declining trend
after decades of robust and sustained growth. Potential output decreased from around 7 percent
during 1990–97 to 4¾ percent during 2000-07, and has been running at about 3½–4 percent since
then. While this rate still exceeds that of many of Korea’s peers, prosperity has been concentrated
within the highly competitive export-oriented conglomerates employing a small share of the
population, whereas household income growth and service sector productivity have been sluggish.
Going forward population aging will be a major drag on potential growth—on current trends the
working age population is projected to peak in 2016 and Korea is expected to become one of the
oldest countries in the OECD by 2050 with the dependency ratio increasing rapidly (text figures).
Even reaching the staff’s projection for potential growth of 3¾ percent will require total factor
productivity playing a larger role than at present.

Export-led growth. Exports are at the center of these trends, accounting for both the period
of rapid growth and the slowdown. Korea’s gross exports have risen steadily since the early 2000s
and currently exceed 50 percent of GDP, significantly higher than the OECD average (text figure). This
growth was driven in large part by the

FINANCIAL SOUNDNESS AND RESILIENCE
3.
Overview. Although potential output growth is poised to slow, Korea’s financial
fundamentals as proxied by the health of aggregate private and public sector balance sheets and
capital and external buffers are relatively sound which limits sources of short-run systemic risk. At the
same time vulnerabilities remain and the structure of private debt markets could be strengthened.

level, driven by a rise in NPLs to large companies
in the shipbuilding and construction sectors, but since then banks’ asset quality has improved
somewhat with the decline in new bad loans and the write-offs and sales of old loans. Growth in the
non-bank financial institutions has slowed considerably and their profitability continues to weaken, in
part from low interest rates and the strengthening of regulations. Banks’ short-term external debt
increased in 2014 although it remains well below the pre-crisis levels, and the sizes of their foreign
currency and maturity mismatches continue to decline. However, Korean banks still rely heavily on
offshore funding, and a tightening of global financial conditions could lead to funding pressures
(text figure).

An FSAP was conducted alongside the 2013 Article IV Consultation.

5.
Household balance sheets. Overall household debt as a share of income has been rising
steadily over the last decade but unlike the experience of many other countries leading up to the
global financial crisis, this has recently been on the back of relatively stable house prices, with
cautious consumer spending keeping household leverage low and stable and the sector’s aggregate
net worth comparable to that in many other advanced economies (text figures and Box 1)—rather
than reflecting increased borrowing for consumption the rise in debt has been matched by a
corresponding increase in household financial assets and may be related to structural factors
affecting balance sheet composition, including more retirees and the prevalence of Korea’s unique
chonsei rental market. While pockets of vulnerability exist,2 the relatively strong aggregate balance
sheet and banks’ solid capital buffers suggest that in the absence of large macroeconomic shocks
the rise in household debt does not pose a systemic near-term threat to the financial sector or the
macroeconomy.
6.
Housing finance. At the same time the
structure of household debt could be
strengthened. Reflecting Korea’s relatively
young and rapidly growing mortgage market
(text figure), a large share of houses are
financed short-term either in the form of
chonsei rental deposits or the rolling over of
floating-rate interest-only mortgage loans with
short maturities and bullet repayments. One key
challenge will be to facilitate the transition by
households and financial institutions toward a
more stable, long-term structure (paragraph 27).
7.
Corporate balance sheets. While aggregate corporate leverage is relatively modest, many
financial soundness indicators have weakened recently and the sector is highly segmented with some
growing pockets of vulnerability (Box 2). In particular corporate income and profits have become
increasingly concentrated in the top-ranked firms whereas troubled sectors with high leverage and
nonviable SMEs requiring public support remain. While capital buffers and adequate provisioning
limit direct risks to the banking sector, the need by many firms to shore up their balance sheets is
likely to constrain corporate investment.
8.
Public finances. Korea’s practice of maintaining a cautious fiscal stance, motivated by the
need to preserve investor confidence alongside the country’s open capital account and to deal with
uncertain future costs related to demographics and possible reunification with North Korea, has kept
government debt below 40 percent of GDP. At the same time the public sector is exposed to
contingent liabilities related to loan guarantees estimated at around 10 percent of GDP. SOE gross
debt amounts to nearly 30 percent of GDP, but the bulk is held by profitable enterprises and backed
by substantial assets.
2

Household survey data suggest that about one third of the low-income, older, and self-employed households have
high debt servicing burdens.

Box 1. Household Debt
Household balance sheet developments in Korea over the last decade are unique in several ways. As in many other
advanced countries, measures of debt-to-income increased steadily in the pre-crisis period. However, this ratio has
continued to increase post-2008, in stark contrast to other countries that experienced a long period of household
deleveraging following the sharp decline in house prices. Likewise, measured household leverage in Korea has
remained low and stable throughout, whereas other countries saw a sharp buildup of financial (non-housing)
leverage and a subsequent fall. In fact, Korean households
have accumulated more liquid financial assets than debt since

has decreased.



First, Korea’s baby boom generation has begun to retire.
As the pension replacement rate remains relatively low,
retirees often purchase small businesses, in part financed
by bank borrowing, to provide retirement income. The
share of household debt held by households in their
fifties and older has increased by more than 10 percent in
the last decade and may continue to rise as population
ages (text figure).
Second, Korea’s unique chonsei rental system, in which
the tenant loans the deposit (a large share of the
property’s value, often borrowed from a bank) interestfree to the landlord and lives rent-free, may also lead to
higher gross household debt than would otherwise be
the case. Chonsei currently accounts for almost half of
Korea’s rental housing market. In recent years its prices
have risen sharply against the declining real house prices
and chonsei-related loans have almost doubled since
2009 (text figure).

Another unique feature of the rise in household debt is that it
has continued despite the recent falloff of house price growth
(text figure). Rather than reflecting increased borrowing for
consumption, this seems to be related to several structural
factors affecting household balance sheet composition.

While the aggregate household balance sheet is relatively stable and rising debt does not pose near-term systemic
risks, pockets of vulnerability exist. Previous staff analyses indicate that the share of debt at risk in total household
debt is particularly high for certain types of households, namely, older, lower-income and self-employed
households. To the extent that these households have relatively higher marginal propensities to consume or are
more likely to be liquidity constrained, an increase in household debt service due to higher debt levels and/or
higher interest rates may have a negative impact on consumption.

Box 2. Corporate Balance Sheets and the Implications for Investment
Korea’s growth momentum has weakened since 2010 partly driven by sluggish corporate investment. Although the
sector’s aggregate balance sheet does not raise alarms, financial soundness appears to have weakened in the past
few years partly due to slowing growth—the growth rate of corporate sales declined from around 17 percent in
2010 to slightly negative in the first half of 2014, the first time corporate sales registered a contraction since the
global financial crisis. Corporate income and profits have also become more concentrated in the top-ranked firms.
The decline in corporate growth and rising concentration of income have affected the sector’s financial soundness.
For firms with high leverage and low profitability and liquidity, their need to shore up their balance sheets will
constrain investment.



Profitability. Listed companies’ operating income-to-sales ratios declined from about 7 percent in 2010 to
5 percent in 2013, even below the levels during the global financial crisis (text figure).



Liquidity. While the top ten firms’ cash flow position remains favorable, other firms’ capacity to repay shortterm borrowings and cover interest expenses have weakened, with their cash flow coverage ratio declining to
below 30 percent by the first half of 2013. The liquidity risk has increased particularly in the shipping, ship
building and construction sectors with several large firms defaulting on their debt. The average annual
corporate bill default rate reached 0.19 in 2014, the highest level since 2001.



Leverage. Although some firms carried out debt reduction in response to the deterioration in growth and
profitability, the sector’s overall debt burden worsened through the first half of 2013 for both large enterprises
and SMEs. The proportion of firms with a debt ratio above 200 percent increased steadily since 2010, reaching
15.5 percent in 2013, before moderating slightly in 2014.

Compared to some other Asian economies, Korea has a relatively high concentration of corporate debt in firms with
high leverage, low profitability, low solvency, and low liquidity—almost 20 percent of corporate debt is owed by
firms with negative profitability (the second highest in Asia), about 20 percent by firms with an interest rate
coverage ratio less than one (Asia’s highest), and 40 percent by firms with a current ratio below one (fourth
highest).1 As such, Korea has a relatively large segment of its corporate sector that is vulnerable to interest and
profitability shocks.
Staff analysis using annual firm level data that covers 2,200 Korean firms in 1995–2013 quantifies the link between
corporate balance sheets and corporate investment in Korea, with regression results showing that high leverage,
low cash flow and low liquidity all have significant negative impacts in this period.

External buffers. Korea has built and
maintained substantial external buffers since the
global financial crisis which could help limit the
impact of renewed financial volatility, including
a reduced and now modest level of short-term
external debt, a positive and growing net
foreign asset position, and a stock of
international reserves which—based on
measures of adequacy—should be sufficient to
buffer against a range of possible external
shocks (text figure).

Sources: CEIC Data Company; and IMF staff estimates.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
10.
Output growth. The growth momentum that had been building since early 2013 has stalled
reflecting a continued high savings rate and low investment on the back of sluggish wage growth
and falling performance in some major manufacturing industries, and closing the output gap remains
elusive. A key turning point was the April 2014 Sewol ferry accident which had a surprisingly large
and persistent impact on consumer and investor sentiment as it led to protracted political turmoil
more broadly. Recent external developments may have also played an indirect role, with news of
slowdowns in China, Japan, and the EU weighing on sentiment. Reflecting this, GDP growth in 2014,
although positive at 3¼ percent, fell below potential for the third straight year.
11.
Inflation. Headline inflation has fallen to about ½ percent, well below the Bank of Korea’s
(BOK) target range, in part because of lower oil prices (text figures). The BOK has cut the policy rate
several times since August 2014—with the most recent move in March bringing the rate to an
historic low of 1¾ percent—citing concerns of a larger-than-expected output gap, low inflation
pressure, fragile sentiment, and more recently the need to take pre-emptive action against downside
risks. Nominal wage growth data are volatile but show a generally declining trend.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

12.
Exchange rate. The won has been on a gradual, appreciating trending since 2012 on a
measured, trade-weighted basis, although this masks important movements in cross rates—in
particular, the won continues its climb against the yen, Japan being Korea’s main export market
competitor, but has weakened against the U.S. dollar in the last several months (text figures).
Nevertheless, we continue to assess the exchange rate as being undervalued. After increasing in the
first half of 2014, official foreign exchange reserves (including the BOK’s forward position) have
declined modestly in U.S. dollar terms reflecting valuation losses related to shifts in the relative
exchange rates of the major reserve currencies (paragraph 33).

13.
Balance of payments. Despite the real appreciation the current account surplus has
increased sharply since 2011, reaching 6¼ percent of GDP in 2014, on the back of lower global oil
prices and weak domestic demand (text figures). Oil imports alone fell from 8½ percent of GDP in
2011 to 6¾ percent last year, although the net windfall from lower oil prices is estimated to be
somewhat lower as many of Korea’s export prices (for petroleum products, shipbuilding, and others)
tend to move in tandem.3 Substantially lower domestic investment which generally has a high import
component has also played an important role. The counterpart to the higher surplus has mainly been

3

Korea’s oil balance (accounting for exports of petroleum products) is about 3 percent of GDP. The 40 percent
decline in oil prices assumed in the baseline for 2015 leads to a first round oil windfall of 1¼ percent of GDP.
Historical trends suggest that spillovers to non-oil exports would reduce this windfall by about ¼ - ½ percentage
points of GDP.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

an increase in corporate retained earnings held abroad. Other capital account developments
including portfolio flows have been broadly stable.
14.
Recent policy initiatives. Recognizing the challenging growth environment, the authorities
put in place a number of measures to spur economic recovery in addition to loosening the monetary
policy stance. These include:


Direct budget stimulus—about ½ percent of GDP in additional spending in 2014 focused on
financial support for home buyers and renters. This was followed by the 2015 budget which
allowed for a more broad-based increase including for social spending.



Increased support for policy-based lending—this includes a capital injection to the Korean
Development Bank to support new growth source projects, including those centered on
intellectual property, through lending as well as diverse forms of hybrid captial.



Ad hoc tax measures to incentivize firms to allocate idle cash to wages, dividends, or
investments.



Measures to try to revive a housing market that has been in a multi-year slump including
legislation to unwind major regulatory roadblocks for housing reconstruction projects which
had been previously introduced to curb house price inflation and speculative demand. In the
wake of these measures, together with some unwinding of the earlier tightening of mortgage
lending restrictions (paragraph 26), there have been some preliminary signs of a pickup in
house prices and transactions volumes.

The policy reorientation also entails stronger
expenditure growth over the medium term with
the timing of the planned deficit reduction pushed
back relative to last year’s budget (text figure).
This will lift the projected public debt profile only
modestly, with debt now expected to peak at
37 percent of GDP. In addition the authorities
have put in place or aim to launch a number of
initiatives to address structural challenges
(paragraphs 37 and 39).

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
15.
Outlook. The Korean economy is at crossroads where macroeconomic trends over the
coming quarters could have implications well beyond the near term. We currently project output
growth for 2015 in a range centered at around 3 percent, where exceeding this midpoint will require
a rebound in aggregate demand this year.4 Recent policy initiatives may succeed in bringing this
4

The baseline, which is broadly consistent with the BOK’s recent downward revision of its 2015 growth forecast to
3.1 percent and the first quarter growth outturn, assumes some gain in growth momentum beginning in the second
quarter in part from a modest increase in construction investment and consumption related to the recent easing of
monetary and fiscal policy and lower fuel prices. The inflation forecast assumes some base effect increase related to a
gradual unwinding of downward supply-side price pressures.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

about although it is still too early to gauge their full impact. A rebound in the construction sector,
while not yet apparent, could be a possible contributing factor to domestic demand. Inflation is
projected to be in the 1–1½ percent range, depending on the one-off impacts of lower oil prices and
the recent increase in administered tobacco prices. An increase in underlying inflation, currently
hovering around 1 percent, would likely require higher wage growth or a nominal depreciation of the
won.
16.
Near-term risks and uncertainties. The outlook will depend on a number of uncertain
factors (Appendix I). Domestically, households’ concerns about future house price and wage growth
could continue to weigh on consumption, and business sentiment will remain closely linked to how
firms view the external environment, the prospects for a rebound in private consumption, and the
future growth potential of the economy. Externally, Korea’s highly open economy exposes it to both
positive and negative global cross-currents. Specifically:


Partner country growth—although growth
momentum in the U.S. may be building,
the outlooks for China (Korea’s main
export market), the EU, and Japan remain
a concern (text figure).



A persistently weak yen—Korean export
volumes have held up so far, but signs
suggest weakening prospects, with Korean
market share beginning to decline in
some industries. Profits and stock prices
for the key exporting firms have taken a
protracted hit, resulting in downward
price pressure on input-providing
domestic SMEs (text figure). The recent
shift in market expectations that the yen
will remain weak for some time could
eventually lead to more off-shoring, lower
investment in domestic capacity and R&D,
and reduced export proceeds. The
ultimate effect on Korea’s growth outlook
is difficult to quantify, as staff analysis
suggests that the weak export volume
response the short run could mask a more fundamental shift in relative competitiveness
which would take some time to materialize (Box 3). At the same time, the strong dollar could
provide some buffer.

Box 3. Impact of the Weaker Yen on Korea’s Exports
Following the Bank of Japan’s launch of its asset purchase program (QQE) in August 2011 the yen has depreciated
against the U.S. dollar by over 35 percent and by about 40 percent against the won. More than prices and
volumes, the effect has been largely felt in the profit margins of Korean and Japanese exporters. This is in line with
historical episodes and econometric analysis which shows a long lag before exports respond to shifts in won-yen
cross rates.
Price pass-through. The pass-through of the weaker yen and won to export prices has been timid so far—both
Korea and Japan have decreased export prices modestly but this is likely to reflect factors other than exchange
rate movements, including the drop in oil prices and the continued trend decline in global prices of electronic
products. Price cuts by Japan’s exporters have been somewhat higher than Korea’s in key sectors where product
similarity is high (metal, electronics, and transportation equipment).
Volume response. Export volumes have also been slow to respond. Japan’s real export volumes continued to
decline until late 2012 before a sharp rebound since late 2014 helped recoup the bulk of the loss. Korea’s real
exports have largely traced a trend similar to the one before the global financial crisis.
Profit margins. With the limited volume and price response, exchange rate movements have been mostly
reflected in higher profits for Japanese exporters and lower for Korean firms. One striking example is the behavior
of profit ratios of car makers—since the first quarter of 2012 Hyundai Motors’ operating margin decreased by
around 20 percent while Toyota’s increased by over 60 percent (figures).

Market share. After rising significantly, Korean exporters’ market share has stalled since 2011 with continued
gains in three leading export destinations—China, ASEAN, and the United States—offset by broad-based slippages
elsewhere. At the same time Japan endured sharp losses across all markets. In terms of product space, Korea has
continued to expand its market share in electronics offsetting flat or declining shares in other leading export items,
while Japan’s market share declined across a broad range of products (figures, next page).
Short- and long-run export responsiveness. The limited price pass-through and high correlation between profit
margin and exchange rate movements are in line with exporters’ historical behavior where they are slow to change
prices in the short-run but do so over time as exchange rate shocks become locked in. This may be related to a
range of structural factors for both countries’ key export industries (such as electronics and automobiles) including
the importance of branding, product cycles, global supply chains, and offshoring of production. In these industries
the impact of persistent exchange rate movements is likely to be felt through lagged adjustment in pricing as well
as non-pricing decisions such as where to invest new capacity, the level of R&D investment, and others. This is
supported by staff’s econometric analysis, which finds a low short-run exchange rate elasticity for both countries
and across products, with the elasticities increasing over the longer-run.1 All of this suggests that the muted price
and volume response so far to the sustained weakness of the yen may mask a more fundamental shift in the
relative competitiveness of Japanese and Korean exporters.



Lower oil prices—as one of the world’s largest importers of oil products Korea is clearly
benefiting from lower prices, but it may take some time before this translates into growth.
The most significant channel would be through an increase in global purchasing power and
corresponding demand for Korean exports, which could in turn lead to firms to invest in new
capacity, while the impact on domestic consumption is likely to be relatively modest. At the
same time persistently lower prices could reduce already low inflation expectations.



Exposure to global financial risks—Korea has been less affected than many emerging markets
to financial turmoil over the last two years and its relatively strong fundamentals and solid
external buffers have led markets to view the country as a “bounded safe haven” where
minor shocks to global markets, possibly related to an unwinding of U.S. quantitative easing,
could lead to capital inflows. At the same time an open capital account exposes it to the risk
of a sudden reversal of capital flows which would likely be accompanied by a fall in asset
prices affecting business sentiment and lead to tighter financial conditions for corporates and
banks. Allowing the won to respond flexibly would provide a key buffer.

17.
Risks of a downside growth and inflation scenario. In this environment there is a risk that
a self-reinforcing downside dynamic could take hold where falling inflation expectations keep
consumer spending suppressed, which coupled with perceived weak external prospects, leads firms
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

to withhold investments and decrease hiring (Appendix I). Ultimately these expectations could
become self-fulfilling and result in significantly slower nominal and real growth relative to the
recovery assumed in the baseline scenario. The growth consequences of a downside scenario could
be protracted. As seen in many other economies, the expectation of low or negative inflation once
entrenched can be very difficult to break and can have long-lasting negative effects on household,
corporate, and public sector balance sheets. Many of the reforms needed to shore up potential
output over the longer term could be more costly and difficult to implement in an environment of
weak economic growth. The likelihood of this scenario may not be high but the costs could be
significant.
18.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed with staff that the near-term outlook was subject
to uncertainties and risks. Although they recognize that the recovery in domestic demand has yet to
take hold, they expected growth to pick up from the second quarter of this year as a result of the
lagged effect of the stimulus policies put in place so far including the series of policy rate cuts and
the expected dividend from lower oil prices. They remain mindful of the possibility that a weakerthan-expected global environment and continued household and investor pessimism could lead to
stagnating or falling nominal and real growth, but at the time of the mission they considered the
likelihood of this scenario to be low. Regarding external risks, they viewed capital flows related to an
orderly tightening by the U.S. Fed as manageable but remained mindful of the risk that there may be
bouts of disruptive financial market volatility. At the same time they recognized that Korea’s strong
fundamentals—positive growth, current account surpluses, low debt, and solid reserve buffers—
make it more resilient to these risks than many other countries with open capital accounts, and
viewed the flexible exchange rate as a key shock absorber.

POLICIES TO BOOST GROWTH MOMENTUM
19.
Overview. Going forward macroeconomic policy decisions will need to be taken before it
becomes clear how effective the measures to stimulate demand already in place prove to be, and
whether the stalled growth momentum and weak inflation has shifted or become entrenched. If the
global outlook improves, for example, or the housing market gains momentum, it may turn out that
the monetary, fiscal, and other policy measures already taken prove more than sufficient. But if
consumer or investor caution is allowed to deepen, then additional measures at the margin might
not have much power to change the psychology from pessimistic to optimistic. While recognizing
that the current uncertainties make policy fine-tuning very challenging, staff argued that the high
costs if the downside scenario materializes warrant a more pro-active use of available policy tools
than would be called for in a normal cyclical environment, and that the risks of doing too little too
late outweigh the risks of doing too much. The lack of clear signs of a recovery of domestic demand
would call for additional use of the authorities’ fiscal and monetary space. The primary aim would be
to send a signal strong enough to shift confidence, which would be aided by a broad-based set of
policy actions that are bold rather than incremental.
20.
Measures already taken. While the full impact remains to be seen, the measures have not
had a material impact on confidence suggesting they may fall short of what is needed. Prospects for

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

recent policy rate cuts to stimulate demand will depend in part on whether they spur households
and firms to take on more leverage to consume and invest, and together with steps to deregulate
housing investment, lead to a recovery in the housing market sufficient to change savings behavior.
While there have been pockets of increased housing market activity recently, the decline in
expectations of future price and wage growth may blunt the impact of recent cuts on real interest
rates. The budget measures to stimulate demand are relatively modest and the impact of the steps
aimed at unlocking idle corporate cash is difficult to predict.
21.
Monetary policy. There is scope for monetary policy to take pre-emptive action against
downside risks. In an environment where households and firms hold excess cash and postpone
spending on the self-reinforcing expectation that wages, prices, and house price growth may
continue to be weak, policy rate cuts can help shift incentives away from cash hoarding toward more
consumption and investment. The longer expectations become entrenched however, the more policy
rates would need to be cut to break this dynamic. With the space to cut limited by the zero lower
bound, waiting to see if additional rate cuts are called for runs the risk of reducing their effectiveness
if ultimately needed. Concerns about their short run impact on household debt ratios may be
counterproductive if withholding monetary stimulus results in weaker nominal income growth, and
are better addressed by the government’s macro-prudential policy tools for mortgage lending
standards (paragraph 26).
22.
Fiscal policy. The government’s expansionary fiscal policy in the 2015 budget is a step in the
right direction for supporting aggregate demand in the near term, and the revised medium-term
deficit path is consistent with utilizing fiscal space when needed while preserving longer-term fiscal
sustainability. Relatively modest public debt allows the authorities the flexibility to take additional
measures if needed to ensure the budget’s planned spending program is carried out in the event
that weaker-than-expected nominal GDP growth results in revenue falling short of this year’s target.
Budget support should be broadened where there is scope for temporary measures to boost
employment and household incomes in a way that does not run counter to needed structural
reforms and longer run fiscal sustainability. The government’s efforts to expand policy-based lending
with budget support would be most cost-effective for both stimulating demand and increasing
productivity if priority is given to the most commercially viable enterprises, including by refocusing
public support for SMEs, and in a way that preserves the financial sector’s profitability and capital
buffers.
23.
Structural reforms. The reforms discussed in paragraphs 36–38 should be undertaken as
quickly as feasible independent of the near-term macroeconomic outlook. But while most of the
reforms will take some time to yield direct growth benefits, maintaining their momentum could have
benefits in the near term by shoring up confidence in the economy’s long run potential.
24.
Authorities’ views. The authorities viewed revitalizing the economy as a key near term
priority and stood ready to take additional policy actions when needed if growth momentum does
not show signs of picking up soon. At the same time Korea’s strong dependence on global economic
developments and its underlying structural factors make this task more challenging. In particular:

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOREA



The BOK recognized that there is still space for further monetary easing if needed, but
highlighted a number of considerations. Headline inflation has been pushed down in part by
supply side factors including low oil prices, and with survey data showing inflation
expectations anchored in the mid-2 percent range it would not be prudent to over-react to
inflation falling below target. Also, they argued that many of the factors driving weak
demand—low wage growth, consumer and investor caution—reflect not so much cyclical
factors as structural rigidities which will need to be addressed through longer-run reforms
and will limit the effectiveness of monetary easing on its own. Overall, monetary policy would
need to strike a balance between growth and stability, and the bank would need to remain
mindful of the possible impact of monetary easing on household debt.



The Ministry of Strategy and Finance emphasized the role that fiscal policy has been and will
continue to play in supporting demand within the boundaries of maintaining fiscal
soundness, including through direct budget spending and expanded and refocused policy
lending efforts. Unlike many countries with sizeable infrastructure needs, Korea has no clear
areas where there is broad-based support for ramping up public spending in the short run.
They highlighted slower than initially-projected nominal output growth as a key reason for
the budget revenue shortfalls over the last several years, and that achieving the nominal
growth target will be important for meeting the revenue target and addressing the increased
social spending needs.



The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment that household debt does not pose imminent
risks and would like to see debt levels stabilize gradually while avoiding a forced
deleveraging which could have adverse impact on growth. The authorities were in broadbased agreement that concerns about household debt would be better addressed through
the government’s existing tools for setting mortgage lending standards, and that a
coordinated approach to monetary and macro-prudential policy would be needed.

FINANCIAL STABILITY AND MACRO-FINANCIAL RISKS
25.
Financial sector reforms. The 2013 FSAP found the near-term vulnerabilities of the Korean
financial sector to be limited (paragraph 4), and while banks’ vulnerabilities to corporate and
household exposures appear contained in the near term, further economic weakness could impair
the soundness of both sectors. Staff urged progress in addressing the high priority recommendations
of the FSAP to further strengthen financial stability analysis and supervision, develop financial market
infrastructure, and reform the institutional framework to separate macroprudential policy making
from crisis management with the aim of increasing transparency and accountability among the
various agencies responsible for economic and financial market policies and ensuring greater
political independence (Appendix III). Although the authorities have initiated a number of measures
in line with these recommendations, they were reluctant to adopt those requiring more fundamental
institutional changes.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

26.
Macroprudential tools and capital flow management measures. The Korean authorities
have a number of tools which they have used with the aim of containing the build-up of systemic
vulnerabilities. These include:


Limits on mortgage lending, including loan-to-value (LTV) and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios,
which were introduced in the last decade in response to sharp increases in house price
growth. These have been adjusted several times since then as financial stability risks related
to housing market conditions change but are currently significantly tighter than when
introduced. In line with this policy, the authorities in mid-2014 took a modest step toward
unwinding the earlier tightening of these ratios given banks’ strong balance sheet position.
This step may have also contributed to the recent slowdown in housing-related lending
growth by non-bank financial institutions.



Measures to contain liquidity and foreign exchange vulnerabilities which were introduced
when the Lehman collapse exposed the volatile funding structure of the Korean banking
system. These include a ceiling on banks’ loan-to-deposit ratio, a leverage cap on banks’
foreign exchange derivatives positions, and a levy on foreign exchange funding.5 The FSAP
determined that together these measures succeeded in increasing financial sector resilience
by reducing exposure to liquidity shocks, reducing maturity mismatches caused by shortterm foreign exchange borrowing to finance derivatives purchases, and more generally
lengthening the maturity of the financial sector’s foreign exchange borrowing, and we
continue to assess these measures as appropriately aimed at addressing systemic financial
sector stability.6

27.
Mortgage financing. To facilitate the transition toward a more stable, long-term structure
the government recently launched a loan conversion program with the aim of increasing the share of
fixed-rate and amortizing loans from currently less than 25 percent to 40 percent by 2017. Staff
emphasized that this is best accomplished by further developing the market and regulatory
infrastructure that would, through market-based incentives, encourage households and banks to
move in this direction. The program involves the provision of new long-term fixed-rate loans funded
by the Korea Housing Finance Corporation (KHFC) through their issuing mortgage-backed securities
(MBS).7 The KHFC securitizes all loans brought to its balance sheet before the close of the same day
which should limit its exposure to credit risks of the long-term amortizing products. Securities are
5

The levy will be expanded to cover non-bank financial institutions and its structure streamlined starting from July
2015.
6

The costs and benefits of these measures will need to be assessed on an ongoing basis, and they should not
substitute for any warranted macroeconomic adjustment. At present, we regard them as effective regulatory tools
available for containing risks to systemic financial stability related to the financial sector’s foreign exchange
transactions and balance sheet positions. In current circumstances their removal would increase the risk of a
rebuilding of banks’ liquidity and maturity mismatches related to short-term foreign exchange borrowing and
hedging activities.
7

The share of KHFC mortgage loans in total mortgage lending by deposit-taking institutions and public financial
institutions rose steadily from around 4½ percent at the end of 2011 to around 8 percent as of end-August 2014.

generally purchased by pension funds looking to match their long-term liabilities. While the program
is in its early stages, it is important that its execution be tightly focused on the objective of
deepening the market for long-term mortgages and increasing the resilience of housing finance.
28.
Authorities’ views. The authorities viewed the financial sector as currently sound with banks
and non-bank financial institutions having maintained improved asset quality and satisfactory capital
adequacy. They expect that the recently launched mortgage loan conversion program will enhance
the structure of the mortgage market, and given the already high demand of the program, are
confident that they will meet the government’s target for increasing the share of fixed-rate and
amortizing loans. The authorities acknowledged that the low corporate profitability in some ailing
sectors could affect financial institutions’ balance sheets, but noted that recent progress in debt
restructuring and lower oil prices have brought about improvements in their leverage ratios and
operating balances, and the authorities will push for further progress in restructuring going forward.
With respect to the 2013 FSAP key recommendations the authorities have implemented various
measures to further strengthen financial stability analysis and supervision and financial market
infrastructure. They emphasized the important role their macro-prudential policy framework plays in
containing systemic risks to financial stability, and viewed the regulatory limits on the financial
sector’s foreign exchange exposure as a key source of Korea’s increased resilience to external market
volatility. However, they do not see the need to establish, as recommended by the FSAP, two distinct
committees with separate mandates on macroprudential policy and crisis management, viewing the
current institutional framework adequate for safeguarding financial stability.

ASSESSING EXTERNAL STABILITY
29.
Overview. While Korea has built up large external buffers and does not currently face
external sustainability issues, the country’s ability to continue growing through a heavy reliance on
gaining export market share is increasingly limited while also leaving the economy more exposed to
external shocks. This means achieving more balanced, sustainable long-run growth depends on
success in closing the large productivity gaps in the non-traded sector, which would be accompanied
by a reduced role for net exports as a source of demand-side growth.
30.
The current account. The current account in part reflects where Korea is in that process and
where it needs to go. In this regard Korea’s underlying current account surplus—even after allowing
for the transitory effects of the windfall from lower oil prices which is expected to continue to put
upward pressure on the surplus in the near term—is larger than would be consistent with the
country’s economic and policy fundamentals. This gap reflects a number of factors including
precautionary savings related to a relatively weak social safety net (Box 4).
31.
Policies to address imbalances. An active policy approach to boost near-term aggregate
demand and longer-run productivity will also help reduce external imbalances, reinforcing their
importance in bringing about a more stable, resilient, and durable structure to the economy. In
particular:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

REPUBLIC OF KOREA



Structural policies. Staff scenario analysis suggests that a 0.3 percentage point increase in
non-traded sector productivity would increase long-run potential output growth by 0.2
percentage points, and for a given real exchange rate would result in a reduction in the
current account surplus of around 1 percent of GDP.



Fiscal policy. The government’s more expansionary fiscal policy stance, both this year and
over the medium term, could help narrow imbalances, all the more so if coupled with an
expanded social safety net that reduces the need for precautionary savings.



Exchange rate flexibility. Even with some closing of the productivity gap, won appreciation
over time will likely be needed to bring about a reduction in external imbalances to levels
consistent with Korea’s fundamentals.

32.
Medium-term current account prospects. Korea faces a number of trends that will affect
the current account and how it responds to price changes in uncertain ways, making it difficult to pin
down the size of Korea’s external gap. Korea’s unique demographics trends where the expected
rapid transition from a relatively young to an old society will take place against the background of
what has been a substantial increase in life expectancy might produce a pattern of higher aggregate
household savings now that unwinds over time. Whether the oil dividend is saved or spent will
depend on how durable households and firms perceive it to be. How the current account will
respond to past and future exchange rate movements, including the relationship between the won
and yen, is a key uncertainty—staff analysis suggests that Korean export volumes have become
highly inelastic to exchange rate movements in the short run, pushing the adjustment into the longer
term where forecasting is particularly difficult (Box 3). The longer-run export prospects will also be
affected by a number of uncertain structural developments such as product innovation and evolution
and entry into the market by newer competitors in China and elsewhere.
33.
Exchange rate and foreign exchange reserve policies. Maintaining a flexible exchange rate
is essential both as a buffer against external shocks and to facilitate adjustment toward domestic
sources of growth and thereby reduce external imbalances, and the won should remain market
determined with intervention limited to smoothing excess volatility. The quantity of reserves has
increased steadily since the sharp decline in 2008 but has been broadly stable (at around 130 percent)
as a share of the IMF’s composite reserve adequacy metric during most of this period. Lacking
published data, foreign exchange intervention proxies based on changes in stocks or balance of
payments data point to periods of net purchases, albeit at levels below those in the first half of 2014,
although these proxies should be treated as suggestive given their high degree of uncertainty.8

8

The recent large shifts in cross rates for the major reserve currencies add a high degree of uncertainty to
constructed proxies using published data on stocks of reserves in U.S. dollar terms, where estimates of valuation
losses are highly sensitive to assumptions about the currency composition of reserves. Our models suggest
cumulative intervention since mid-2014 of anywhere from zero to modest net purchases.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Box 4. External Stability Assessment
Foreign asset and liability position and trajectory. Korea’s net international investment position (NIIP) increased
from -2.9 percent of GDP in 2013 to 5.8 percent in 2014. This position is expected to strengthen further as the
current account is in strong surplus. The net external debt position was -16.7 percent of GDP in 2014. Banks’ short
term external debt remains below the pre-crisis levels, and the risks of currency mismatch are limited as the bulk of
the short term external debt is matched with forward hedging activities mainly by exporters. The NIIP position and
dynamics present little risk to external sustainability.
Current account. Drawing on various approaches including the IMF’s model-based External Balance Assessment
(EBA) regression exercise (after adjusting the results to account for various Korea-specific factors), staff assesses the
cyclically-adjusted current account surplus in 2014 to be in the range of 2½ to 5 percent above the level consistent
with fundamentals and desirable policies. A part of this gap could be accounted for by relatively low public social
spending in Korea and the fiscal policy gaps of other countries.1

Real exchange rate. Based on the assessed current account gap and considering other EBA-related regression
estimates, the measured, trade weighted real exchange rate (REER) for 2014 is assessed as weaker than the level
consistent with fundamentals and desired policies. By precisely how much is subject to uncertainty, particularly given
both the difficulty in predicting when and by how much Korea’s exports will respond to exchange rate movements
(paragraph 32 and Box 3), as well as the diversity of estimates produced by the EBA’s exchange rate regression
models. Applying a plausible range of elasticities to the current account gap produces a range for the exchange rate
2
gap of 5–13 percent.
Capital and financial accounts: flows and policy measures. With an increase in net portfolio outflows and a
decrease in net banking outflows (about 1¾ percent of GDP for both) offsetting each other, the overall net capital
flow deficit remained at 5 percent of GDP. A proposed technical change to an existing bank levy, predicted to take
effect later in 2015, does not substantially alter the macroprudential policy setting. Overall, Korea’s net and gross
flows appear sustainable.
FX intervention and reserves level. Korea has a floating exchange rate. The quantity of reserves has been broadly
stable as a share of the IMF’s composite reserve adequacy metric during most of period since 2008.3 Intervention
should be limited to smoothing excessive volatility. The stock of reserves should be sufficient to buffer against a
range of possible external shocks.
Based on the above information staff assesses that Korea’s external position in 2014 was substantially stronger than
that implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Developments as of March, 2015, point to a
somewhat stronger external position in 2015.
______________________
1

Staff’s assessment is based on an EBA model which has recently been modified to incorporate changes in the treatment of
demographic explanatory variables, which relative to the previous model results in an increase in Korea’s estimated current account
gap through a corresponding increase in the unexplained residual. Staff interprets this as indicative of the existence of important
country specific factors that are not fully captured by the model’s variables and cyclical adjustments. After adjusting for these
factors, the recent methodological changes to the EBA model do not materially alter staff’s assessment of the current account gap.
2

Staff used the assessed current account gap and applied a range elasticities, both EBA-based and staff’s own calculations, as well
as information on the REER gap itself coming from the EBA’s exchange rate models. EBA exchange rate estimates vary widely, with
the “index model” showing a positive gap of 0.1 percent and the “level model” a negative gap of 13.8 percent.

Staff assessment is based on the IMF’s framework for assessing reserve adequacy, and accounts for Korea’s deepening financial

34.
Authorities’ views. While agreeing that a narrowing of the current account surplus from its
current level would be desirable, and expected as the economy recovers and temporary factors
recede, the authorities emphasized that the surplus appears unrelated to a weak exchange rate
boosting export competitiveness—indeed, the increase has taken place despite the substantial
appreciation of the won in real terms since 2012 and appeared to be driven mostly by the sharp fall
in oil prices, weak domestic demand, and changes in demographics. They continue to view the IMF’s
econometric approaches used in informing the staff’s external sector assessment as suffering from a
number of methodological and data shortcomings which prevent them from fully capturing key
country specific factors such as past experiences of foreign exchange liquidity crises, the speed of
population aging, and trade elasticities. While they did not view the exchange rate as undervalued,
they agreed that a flexible exchange rate could play a role in reducing external imbalances, but put
more emphasis on the role of boosting near-term growth and productivity-enhancing structural
reforms in bringing about this transition. In this context they reiterated their policy of allowing the
exchange rate to be freely determined in the market with intervention limited to smoothing
operations to counter any large fluctuations in flows.

ADDRESSING LONGER-RUN GROWTH CHALLENGES
35.
Key structural challenges. The Korean economy faces many well-diagnosed impediments to
productivity growth, particularly in the non-traded sectors. These include:


Low service sector productivity—the ratio of service-to-manufacturing sector productivity in
Korea is very low compared to its peers and investment in services has been consistently
lagging. There are many reasons for this gap, including regulatory barriers in the sector that
impede competition.



An un-dynamic SME sector—low service sector productivity is closely tied to SMEs as they
provide the bulk of services and employ around 90 percent of the workforce. The sector is
highly heterogeneous, but includes a myriad of unprofitable firms which, given the de facto
social safety net role they play, are kept on life support through government guarantees,
subsidies, and protections. This ties up labor, capital, and budgetary resources in low
productivity activities and stifles innovation.



Labor market rigidities and distortions—a number of these lead to underutilization of
productive resources. Female labor force participation is low and dips sharply for women
aged 30–40 years, an age-linked compensation system encourages firms to push older and
more skilled workers into early retirement, and labor market duality—the large and growing
gap between the high protection for regular workers, particularly in large manufacturing
firms, and over half of the labor force who are self-employed and non-regular workers—
leads to higher turnover and lower firm-based training, and hampers the employment
prospects of market entrants, largely young people.

Structural policy priorities. We see several key priority areas where actions are clearly
needed and have the potential to yield the highest long run growth payoff.9 Many are overlapping
and mutually reinforcing, and will contribute to higher productivity while at the same time reducing
income inequality (Box 5):


Increasing service sector productivity. Considerable productivity gains could be achieved by
promoting competition in health, education, and other protected professions, and by
removing regulatory impediments to investment.



Making firms more dynamic. Phasing out government support that sustains unviable SMEs
and further progress on restructuring ailing enterprises would free up resources for more
productive activities.



Reducing labor market rigidities. This entails addressing gaps in legal protection for regular
and non-regular workers, moving to performance- rather than seniority-based wages,
reducing incentives for forcing early retirement, and improving unemployment insurance.



Increasing female labor force participation. Options include improving public support for
childcare, facilitating part-time work, and enhancing job search and training support.

More generally, strengthening the government’s role in providing a social safety net would add to
the effectiveness of many of these reforms and make them more politically and socially viable.
37.
Government initiatives. The government largely shares these priorities, but as its growth
strategy recognizes, tackling these challenges will require far-reaching reforms which should begin
now as they may take some time to bear fruit. Particularly important is the government’s efforts to
support labor market reform momentum following on the May, 2013, tripartite agreement between
unions, employers, and the government. Discussions have covered a wide range of areas which have
impeded productivity and wage growth, including workforce duality, low labor participation rates,
low unemployment and employment-related public support, retirement, and the age-dependent
compensation structure. But progress toward bringing about the desired changes will require a
process of consensus-building among the stakeholders which will take time and require overcoming
significant political and economic hurdles.
38.
Tax reform. Korea’s relatively low public debt affords it the flexibility—unlike in many other
countries—to undertake needed structural reforms that may have short-run fiscal costs, particularly
since achieving higher growth potential will have a lasting fiscal payoff down the road. At the same
time revenue in Korea is low relative to countries at similar levels of development in part reflecting
weak compliance and high levels of exemptions (Box 6). Tax reform focused on broadening the base
could generate meaningful revenue gains, helping address future fiscal needs consistent with the
government’s emphasis on fiscal prudence, and in a way that would reduce rather than increase
policy distortions and improve economic productivity.

These are discussed in the 2013 Korea Article IV Staff report, paragraphs 29–35 (IMF Country Report No. 14/101).

Box 5. Income Inequality in Korea
Korea’s standard, composite metrics of inequality such as Gini coefficients are near the average for OECD countries,
but underlying these are trends pointing to increasing polarization.
Social mobility. Korea has traditionally been an egalitarian society. Since industrialization began social mobility—
including through educational attainments and entrepreneurship—has buttressed Korea’s economic success. As
Korea’s catch up process has matured, however, societal standing has become more entrenched. Studies find that
Korea’s social mobility is relatively high but falling. They also show that the intergenerational correlations for
educational attainment and socioeconomic status have increased in the last decade or so.
Middle class. Perceptions of middle class attainment have changed. Before the 1997 crisis the shared social belief
was that a college degree would through a decent job allow anyone to rise to the middle class. In part as the result of
Korea’s economic transformation after the 1997 crisis (e.g., corporate and bank restructuring), there is now a
perception of two extremes in opportunity—lucrative jobs that require exceptional qualifications and mediocre jobs
with no easy way to transition from the latter to the former.
Relative Poverty Rates by Age Group 1/

1/ The figure shows the poverty rate for each age group using an index, with the rate for the entire population set at 100. The
poverty threshold is set at 50% of median income of the entire population. The OECD average includes 18 member countries.

Elderly poverty. Korea’s elderly poverty problem, worst among the OECD, is largely a consequence of (i) an
immature social insurance system; (ii) rapid changes in social norms, (iii) shortfalls in retirement savings; and (iv) a
substantial increase in life expectancy.

Policy remedy? The challenge of rebuilding social mobility
and maintaining the middle class is complex and requires
coordinated actions in multiple fronts, including structural
reforms in the labor market, the educational system, the
SME sector, the services sector, and conglomerates.
Consideration could be given to role of fiscal policy, where
measures of fiscal redistribution are among the lowest in
the OECD.

Gender occupational inequality. A combination of weak

women, a shortage of childcare availability, and increasing
competition for forerunning cohorts in early childhood
education, result in a sizeable drop in labor force
participation for women in the childbearing age group.

Box 6. Tax Revenues in Korea
Korea’s tax revenue is low compared with most OECD countries, reflecting a number of factors and with
implications that are broad-based.

Total revenue. Total revenue (including
social contributions and local
governments) reached 24.3 percent of
GDP in 2013. This relatively low level is
explained by narrow tax bases, lower tax
rates, and potential compliance issues.
Using a stochastic frontier tax analysis,
staff found that Korea has considerable
fiscal space given its relative high level of
potential theoretical tax capacity but also
importantly due to the low level of tax
revenues currently collected.1

Composition of revenue. VAT is the
main source of revenue, followed by taxes

on income. VAT collections reached
4.3 percent of GDP and accounted for 24 percent of tax revenues (excluding social contributions). Personal Income
Tax (PIT) generated 3.7 percent of GDP and Corporate Income Tax (CIT) 3.4 percent. Customs duties represent
around 0.8 percent of GDP.
Income inequality. The PIT features a high level of deductions and credits which diminish the progressivity of the
tax. The government has recently attempted to curtail personal income tax exemptions, namely by replacing them
with tax credits which are less regressive.
Income shifting. The large difference between PIT rates, CIT rates, and rates on capital gains might facilitate
avoidance and increase the returns to shifting income artificially across categories. Moreover, the taxation of
capital income should aim to achieve the greatest possible degree of neutrality, with the goal of minimizing
distortions in the economy. The complexity of the CIT - comprised of three rate levels (10, 20 and 22 percent)
depending on the tax base - complicates monitoring and control.
Property taxation. Despite recent reductions, it is still tilted towards taxing transactions, which might create an
additional bottleneck to the recovery of the real estate market. Shifting to recurrent taxes on immovable property
would also enhance tax efficiency.
With Korea’s low revenue and high level of exemptions, there is a case for reforms that broaden the tax base both
to increase the efficiency of the tax system while also reducing economic distortions. Staff estimates show that
even without changing rates the potential revenue yield could be substantial across a range of tax areas.2

Authorities’ views. The authorities shared staff’s views that addressing impediments to
productivity growth is essential to supporting Korea’s long run potential growth. The government’s
Three-Year Plan for Economic Innovation for 2015 is led by reforms in four major areas: labor market,
finance, public sector, and education. The government is committed to tripartite discussions with
unions and employers to advance comprehensive labor market reform and bring about a more
flexible and stable labor market, better working conditions for irregular employees, and a more

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

comprehensive social safety net. At the same time, they recognized that building consensus in these
areas will take time before leading to the changes in laws, regulations, guidelines, and labor and
business practices that affect the structure of Korea’s labor market. Other reforms include those
aimed at boosting financial sector dynamism by promoting finance-IT convergence, invigorating
venture capital, and fostering an economic “ecosystem” where creative ideas can thrive. They also
noted that progress has been made in refocusing SME financing and building public-private
partnerships for infrastructure investment.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
The outlook for Korea remains challenging from both a cyclical and structural
standpoint. Growth momentum has stalled reflecting sluggish domestic demand, inflation is low,
and external uncertainties have increased. From a longer run perspective, relatively weak nonmanufacturing productivity has been accompanied by a heavy, and likely unsustainable, reliance on
manufacturing exports for growth while also leaving the economy more exposed to external shocks,
and the demographic headwinds from a rapidly aging population are beginning to build.
41.
The near-term growth outlook is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. With a
highly open economy, Korea faces global cross-currents. Korea will clearly benefit from lower oil
prices, although it may take some time before this translates into growth through higher investment
and consumption, while the growth outlook for Korea’s trading partners is mixed and the prolonged
weakness of the yen has been a challenge to some Korean export industries.
42.
There is a growing risk of a self-reinforcing downside scenario where the expectation of
falling price and wage growth keeps consumer spending suppressed, and coupled with perceived
weak external prospects leads firms to withhold investments and decrease hiring. Ultimately these
expectations could become self-fulfilling. The growth consequences of such a downside scenario
could be protracted, as the expectation of low or negative inflation once entrenched can be very
difficult to break, and can have long-lasting negative effects on household, corporate, and public
sector balance sheets.
43.
Policies should remain focused on shoring up economic momentum. The authorities’
recent measures to spur economic recovery including monetary easing and fiscal policy initiatives are
steps in the right direction, although it is still too early to gauge their full impact. The cost of getting
stuck in a low growth, low inflation trap warrants a more pre-emptive use of available policy tools
than would be called for in a normal cyclical environment, and additional steps should be taken if
clear signs of a recovery do not emerge soon. There is room for further monetary policy easing if
needed and relatively modest public debt allows the authorities the flexibility to broaden public
support for the economic recovery while still preserving longer run fiscal sustainability.
44.
Korea has built external buffers which enhance the economy’s resilience to shocks, and
together with exchange rate flexibility, would help limit the impact of any renewed global financial
volatility. At the same time Korea’s external position is substantially stronger than that implied by
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Building growth momentum could have some

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

impact on reducing this imbalance but a more durable reduction will require shifting away from
Korea’s heavy reliance on manufacturing exports for growth, aided by structural reforms to boost
productivity growth in the non-traded sector. This reinforces the need for the authorities to maintain
an active policy approach to support the economic recovery and address longer-run challenges,
which will help improve the economy’s resilience to shifts in the external growth environment. Real
exchange rate appreciation over time should also play a role. In this regard, the won should remain
market determined with intervention limited to smoothing excess volatility.
45.
Korea’s financial fundamentals are relatively sound which limits sources of short-run
systemic risk. The financial system is broadly stable with solid capital buffers. Overall household
debt has been rising but this has been matched by a corresponding increase in household financial
assets rather than reflecting an increase in borrowing to finance consumption, and although there
are pockets of vulnerabilities, we do not see debt levels as a near term threat to financial stability and
the macroeconomy. At the same time, the structure of household debt could be strengthened, and
one key challenge will be to facilitate the transition of mortgage market towards a more stable, longterm structure, in line with the government’s objective of increasing the share of fixed rate, longermaturity amortizing mortgages.
46.
The government’s focus on boosting Korea’s future growth potential is welcome and
recent initiatives to begin addressing labor market and other rigidities are steps forward on a long
road of policy actions that will be needed, and should begin now as they may take some time to bear
fruit. Korea’s relatively low public debt affords it the flexibility—unlike in many other countries—to
undertake needed structural reforms that may have short-run fiscal costs, particularly since achieving
higher growth potential will have a lasting fiscal payoff down the road.

Medium

The risks may stem from excessive build-up of
corporate leverage, asset-price misalignment
and delays in fiscal and structural reforms,
which could lead to large negative
consequences for economic growth and
potential spillovers.

Notwithstanding the recent resilience of Korea, side effects
from global financial imbalances could lead to a sudden
reversal of capital flows and fall in asset prices which would
hurt business sentiment and investment. Also, sharply tighter
financial conditions could be a drag on growth as financing
costs of banks and corporate rise.

Low
The stalled growth momentum and weak
inflation, against a difficult and more
deflationary global environment, could
become entrenched, with household and
investor pessimism leading to stagnating or
falling nominal and real growth.
Low
Despite the relatively benign aggregate
picture, there are pockets of vulnerabilities in
household and corporate balance sheets (Box
1 and 2), which could pose risks to financial
stability under extreme shocks to
macroeconomic growth.

High
As seen in many other economies, the expectation of low or
negative inflation once entrenched can be very difficult to
break, and can have long-lasting negative effects on
household, corporate, and public sector balance sheets. Many
of the reforms needed to shore up potential output over the
longer term could be more costly and difficult to implement
in an environment of weak economic growth.
High
The FSAP suggests that a shock comparable to that faced by
an average firm during the 2008 crisis would induce
aggregate expected losses comparable to late 2008 levels. A
sharp deterioration in the housing market possibly triggered
by extreme shocks to the macroeconomy, could also lead to
an upsurge in household credit risks.

Risks from North
Korea

Low
On the downside, a sharp rise in geopolitical
tensions in the peninsula could potentially
escalate and lead to destabilization of the
Korean peninsula. On the upside, a peaceful
reunification scenario could also materialize.

High
The fallout of a serious escalation would have a vast impact
on South Korea and will be multifaceted, entailing
considerable fiscal costs and financial market instability. On
the other hand, a peaceful reunification scenario would, while
having immediate and possibly large fiscal costs, could confer
long term benefits related to access to additional labor input
and investment opportunities.

Policy Response: In most of the scenarios related to external shocks, the appropriate policy response would entail utilizing Korea’s
ample fiscal space and monetary loosening to mitigate the effect. Korea’s international reserves should also be sufficient to buffer
against a range of possible external shocks. The ability of the won to respond flexibly is also a key buffer, and intervention can be
used to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility.
1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline
(“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a
probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the
time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix II. Main Recommendations from the
2013 Article IV Consultation and Follow Up
The 2013 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on January 10, 2014. At the
time, Executive Directors noted that, while a modest recovery is underway, domestic demand
remains relatively weak and the output gap is expected to remain negative through 2014. Against
this backdrop, Directors considered it important to ensure that the monetary and fiscal stances
remain supportive of the recovery until it is firmly entrenched.
Directors commended the authorities for their fiscal prudence. Most of them supported the
authorities’ current medium term fiscal path to restore a balanced budget, given rapid population
aging, contingent liabilities, and geopolitical risks, while others saw scope for somewhat higher
deficit targets—implemented prudently—in support of social needs and rebalancing growth toward
domestic demand
Noting that Korea’s external imbalance is widening and the won is assessed to be moderately
undervalued in real effective terms, Directors were of the view that the won should continue to be
market determined, with intervention limited to smoothing disorderly market conditions. They
supported the authorities’ reform agenda aimed at increasing labor force participation, reducing
labor market duality and boosting service sector and SME productivity. Directors agreed the financial
sector is sound overall and underscored the importance of further improving the supervisory
structure, including by strengthening operational independence, group wide supervision, and
institutional coordination.
Since then, growth momentum has stalled somewhat. Inflation pressure is low with the headline
inflation projected to remain subdued in 2015. Against this backdrop, the authorities have put in
place a number of measures to spur economic recovery:


Direct budget stimulus—about ½ percent of GDP in additional spending in 2014, followed by
another increase in the 2015 budget.



Increase financial support to SMEs (by about 2 percent of GDP) through credit guarantees
and lending by policy banks and ad hoc tax measures to incentivize firms to allocate idle cash
to wages, dividends, or investments



Measures to try to revive a housing market including a modest loosening of relatively tight
mortgage lending restrictions (reducing LTV and DTI ceilings) and legislation to unwind
major regulatory roadblocks for housing reconstruction projects.



The Bank of Korea cut its policy interest rate three times to 1.75 percent since August 2014.



The won appreciated by 6.5 percent in 2014 on real effective terms.



To strengthen the structure of household debt, the government launched a loan conversion
program with an aim to increase the share of fixed-rate and amortizing loans from currently
less than 25 percent to 40 percent by 2017.

The government also announced in February 2014 a sweeping economic reform agenda that targets
a potential growth rate of 4 percent, an employment rate of 70 percent of the population, and per
capita income of $40,000 (compared with approximately $24,000 at present).

Appendix III. Implementation of
2013 FSAP High Priority Recommendations
Recommendations

Timing

Overall Financial Sector Oversight and Coordination
Establish a dedicated and formal macroprudential council, with a stronger role for the BOK,
the power to recommend regulatory action on the part of other bodies and transparency
over policy deliberations.
Not initiated. The authorities noted that Korea already has the framework to monitor
macroprudence at the regular Macroeconomic Financial Meeting with participants including
deputies from the MOSF, FSC, BOK and FSS.

Medium
-term

Strengthen the independence of the FSC and FSS and increase transparency of the
allocation of decision-making responsibilities among the two authorities.
Not initiated. The authorities noted that reviewing and setting measures for strengthening
independence is a medium-term project, and decision-making responsibilities among FSC and
FSS are stipulated in the laws and regulations.

Short to
Medium
-Term

Enhance enforcement effectiveness by broadening the range of administrative and civil
penalties and increasing the amount of administrative fines and civil penalties.
Initiated. The authorities have clarified standards for making accusation and enhanced
working-level-review-procedure to be taken before filling accusations. The use of monetary
fines also increased.

Medium
-term

Financial Stability Analysis, Stress Tests, and Financial Supervision
Enhance coordination among agencies involved in stress testing (FSS and BOK).
In progress. The BOK and FSS are in the process of establishing a communication channel for
sharing their stress test results and discussing the related issues.

Shortterm

FSS should carry out a comprehensive validation of banks’ stress testing exercise.
In progress. The authorities revised regulations to provide for banks’ stress testing in March
2014 and reviewed banks’ implementation of revised regulation in August 2014. The
authorities plan to steadily strengthen FSS’ validation standards.

Shortterm

Disclose to the public the results of the stress tests conducted by the authorities.
In progress. FSS is in the process of reviewing whether to disclose the result of FSS-BOK joint
stress testing. The BOK currently conducts macro stress tests to evaluate financial system
resilience to various potential risk factors, and discloses their results, if needed, mainly
through its Financial Stability Report. Regarding regular disclosure of further detailed results,
the BOK is in the process of reviewing this.

ShortTerm

Empower supervisors to set capital ratios above the Basel II minimum, implement all
principles of Pillar-2 of Basel II, and extend calculation of Basel II capital to group holding
companies.
Initiated. The authorities are currently undertaking procedure to revise relevant regulation
and detailed regulation.
Implemented. Financial holding companies are now subject to Basel II capital requirement
since the revision of Regulation on Supervision of Financial Holding Companies on
February 11, 2014.

Shortterm

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

Apply regulatory framework consistent with that for banks to all NBDIs, with larger entities
also subjected to stricter supervision.
In progress. For cooperatives their asset classification and loan loss provisioning standards
are gradually being enhanced until July 2015. For mutual savings banks, the standards for
taking Prompt Corrective Action are gradually being strengthened for large savings banks to
be in line with banks in a gradual manner.

Shortterm

Implement a risk-based approach to AML/CFT supervision, and expand supervisory
activities to all deposit-taking institutions, and the designated non-financial businesses and
professions.
In progress. The authorities have introduced measures to implement risk-based approach to
AML/CFT supervision including (1) implementing RBA to KoFIU’s AML/CFT supervision
activities; (2) conducting risk assessment on all institutions that made reports in 2013; (3)
examining the banking sector based on RBA principles; and (4) reviewing measures to
implement RBA examinations in non-banks. The authorities noted that all deposit-taking
institutions are now subject to AML/CFT implementation. AML/CFT supervision of DNFBPs
currently encompasses only casino businesses.

Shortterm

Ensure sufficiently comprehensive audit oversight and introduce minimum standards for
appointing external auditors of banks over and above existing requirements, reflecting
expectations of experience and expertise.
In Progress. On April 30, 2013, FSC submitted a bill to the National Assembly on amendment
of Act on External Audit of Stock Companies to give supervisory authorities discretionary
power to determine the standards for appointing external auditors of stock companies and
financial companies (the bill is currently pending).

Medium
-term

Enhance risk-sensitivity of supervision via more flexible and frequent examinations that also
provide sufficient coverage of the smaller supervised entities and enhancement to the
judgmental component of the assessments.
Implemented. For banks, the authorities introduced Examination Improvement Measures in
May 2014 and reflected the changes to examination plans and detailed operating plans. For
savings banks, the authorities are actively providing consulting on vulnerabilities related to
business operation. A team has been set up to monitor whether internal control system is
effectively operating on a continuous basis.

Medium
-term

Crisis Preparedness and Crisis Management Framework
Establish a dedicated apex committee for leading and coordinating crisis preparedness and
management work; undertake periodical crisis simulation exercises.
Not initiated. Crisis preparedness and management work is carried out by a cooperative
arrangement involving relevant organizations such as Economic Ministers Meeting.

Shortterm

Replenish the deficit in deposit insurance fund; assure KDIC back-up funding.
Initiated. The authorities will provide measures on replenishing the deficit in deposit
insurance fund, taking into account the results of savings banks restructuring program.
Implemented. In accordance with the current KDIC Act, KDIC will have a back-up funding in
times of emergency from the government, BOK, insured financial firms and etc.

Shortterm

Address potential moral hazard risks by enhancing banks’ risk management; and ensuring
that government support is not assured or open-ended.
Not initiated.

Medium
-term

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

Systemic Liquidity Management and Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs)
BOK to ensure that its crisis management contingency plan adequately covers
ELA-related decisions. Put in place a Memorandum of Understanding to ensure effective
coordination between BOK and FSC in FMIs matters, and provide BOK with more
enforcement tools.
Implemented. The BOK has its contingency plan for crisis management in place where risk
factors in financial and foreign exchange markets are identified in stages of their development
and corresponding measures are specified including the overall scheme of emergency
provision of liquidity. The BOK considers an adequately-equipped contingency plan as critical
for its crisis management, and thereby will continue to further develop more detailed
elements of its current contingency plan.

Shortterm

Put in place a Memorandum of Understanding to ensure effective coordination between
BOK and FSC in FMIs matters, and provide BOK with more enforcement tools.
Not initiated. The authorities plan to discuss and review measures to enhance efficient
cooperation among relevant organizations relating to FMI including the FSC and BOK.

Shortterm

Reform the credit risk and management framework for the securities market, and increase
the number of KRX staff managing companywide and CCP-related matters.
In progress. (1) Revision of the default waterfall for the listed products: a public preannouncement of legislation of the FSCMA was made by the FSC on October 8, 2014, to revise
the default waterfall in line with PFMIs (CCP’s skin-in-the-game prior to JCF and assessment
power after the depletion of pre-funded resources). Currently, the proposal is on the
parliamentary process for the approval of the National Assembly. (2) Shortening the
substitute price of listed bonds: in order to improve the adequacy of collateral assessment,
KRX reduced the calculation period of the substitute prices of listed bonds from weekly to
daily basis in June 2014. (3) Establishment of the stress testing and back testing guideline:
KRX articulated the basis for stress test for calculating the JCFs for the listed markets through
revision of the Enforcement Rules of the Membership Regulation in November 2014. KRX has
enough re-funded assets to cover possible damages from the extreme but plausible stress
condition in the securities market. Nonetheless, KRX is planning to expand the total size of
JCF in the long term. (4) Increasing the number of KRX staff: on top of the existing companywide risk management team, KRX is planning to establish a business unit which will be
dedicated to monitoring, controlling and managing settlement risks for a more professional
and sophisticated management of CCP related risks.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Korea’s exchange rate system has been classified as “floating” since 2009. Over 1997–2008, the
exchange rate was classified as “free floating” (“independently floating” under the older classification
system). Korea maintains exchange restrictions for security reasons, in accordance with UN Security
Council Resolutions, which have been notified to the Fund under the procedures set forth in
Executive Board Decision 144 (52/51).
FSAP and ROSC Participation:
An FSAP update, requested by the authorities, was conducted in April and July 2013. The missions
included an assessment of various financial sector standards; the soundness of the financial sector,
including vulnerability to macroeconomic shocks; and the crisis preparedness and management
framework of Korea. Prior to this, the previous FSAP mission was conducted in October 2002. The
Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) report for the 2003 assessment has been published
(Country Report No. 03/81) and is available on the web at:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/fsap/fsap.asp.
FAD: Discussions on fiscal transparency were held in Seoul during June 2000, and a report was
drafted and finalized in November 2000, with input from APD staff. The report has been published
and is available on the web through the following link:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/rosc/kor/fiscal.htm.
STA: Discussions on Korea’s data dissemination practices against the IMF’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) were held in Seoul during December 2009, and a Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was drafted and finalized in July 2010. The report has
been published and is available on the web through the link:
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2010/cr10229.pdf
Technical Assistance:
FAD: A technical assistance mission on government finance statistics took place in Seoul during the
period November 8–19, 2010. A mission visited Seoul during August 31-September 16, 2005 to
provide technical assistance on the reform of tax policy and administration. A technical assistance
mission visited Seoul during January 8–19, 2001 to evaluate current practices in budgeting and
public expenditure management and to provide advice on setting up a medium-term fiscal
framework.
MCM: Technical assistance missions visited Seoul to provide advice on financial holding company
supervision and derivatives regulation during December 8–17, 2008, on measures to deepen the
money market during December 4–14, 2007, on strengthening the debt management function and
further development of the government securities market during September 20–October 2, 2006, on

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

the reform and development of the foreign exchange market during March 30–April 13, 2006, and
on macroprudential and derivatives supervision during October 27–November 7, 2005.
STA: Technical assistance missions visited Seoul during March 29–April 12, 2000 to provide advice
on balance of payments and external debt statistics, with a view toward improving the recording of
financial derivatives and developing an international investment position statement, and during
November 28–December 11, 2007 on the GFSM 2001 framework. Two missions to support reforms
related to government finance statistics visited Korea during November 28–December 11, 2007 and
November 8–19, 2010, respectively.
Resident Representative:
The resident representative office in Seoul was opened in March 1998 and was closed in September
2008.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of April 10, 2015
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: The overall structure of the national accounts follows the recommendations of the
2008 System of National Accounts. Chain-linked (reference year 2010) and nominal GDP estimates are
compiled using the production and expenditure approaches; nominal GDP estimates are also compiled
using the income approach. The estimation method for expenditure components, which had used the
commodity flow method before the revision to reference year 2005, adopted the direct estimation
method, in which each expenditure component is measured directly. The size of the informal sector has
not been measured.
Consumer Price Index: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) covers 92.9 percent of total households of Korea;
it excludes farming and fishing households. The geographical coverage, which includes 37 urban areas,
should be extended to rural areas. The consumption basket is updated only every five years; currently,
expenditure weights are derived from the 2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. The new CPI
index adopts both geometric means and the ratio of arithmetic means. The geometrics means should be
used for all unweighted aggregation. The missing prices of products, except for the seasonal items, are
imputed by the price movements of similar products of the same item in the same geographic area.
However, the CPI could be improved further by imputing missing prices of the seasonal items rather than
carrying forward the last reported prices.
Producer Price Index: The Producer Price Index (PPI) covers all domestic industrial activities and a large
segment of service activity. It excludes exported products, however, because the Export Price Indexes are
compiled separately in Korea. The rebased PPI (2010 = 100) employs 2008 SNA concepts and definitions
for the record and valuation of the prices and weights. The PPI could be improved by making more use of
imputing missing prices using the prices of similar commodities, rather than carrying forward the last
reported price. Mostly, the simple geometric average and the weighted geometric average are employed
in the elementary level index compilation. But in some, the indices are computed by the weighted
arithmetic average. Nevertheless, the headline PPI should be changed to the one based on a geometric
mean at the elementary level. The PPI classification by activity conforms to the KSIC, which is itself based
on the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC)––with slight modifications only to reflect local
considerations. The Korean commodity classification used for the PPI does not conform to the Central
Product Classification (CPC) and one based on the CPC should be adopted as soon as possible.
Government Finance Statistics: Two sets of government finance statistics (GFS) are compiled for the
central government, one using national definitions and the other using internationally recognized
standards. Concepts and definitions used in the latter followed the recommendations of the Manual on
Government Finance Statistics 1986 until recently. The authorities have embarked on an ambitious
program to implement reporting according to GFSM 2001, and the first set of financial statements based
on the reformed system was released in 2012. The 2009 ROSC indicated that while compilation practices
are generally sound, some room for improvement of the accessibility and timeliness of data and
metadata existed. Following the 2009 ROSC, the Korean authorities resumed reporting consolidated GFS
data on the general government for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

REPUBLIC OF KOREA

The timeliness of these data does not comply with SDDS requirements, mainly due to the lack in
timeliness on local government source data. During the 2009 ROSC, the authorities also agreed to
improve national dissemination practices and initiated work on improving national websites. However,
high frequency data for inclusion in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) are not yet reported.
Financial Sector Data: Monetary and financial statistics (MFS) compiled by the Bank of Korea (BOK)
broadly follow the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistical Manual 2000. Both liabilities and assets in
foreign currencies are converted into Korean Won at the previous business day's trading volume
weighted average rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. The data are revalued monthly. The BOK is in
discussion with STA about reporting MFS using the standardized report forms (SRFs) and drafting related
metadata for publication in the IFS. Draft SRFs for the central bank and other depository corporations
were reported to STA.
Korea participates in the regular reporting of Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) to the IMF for
dissemination on its website. FSI data and metadata are available to the public through the IMF’s website
at: http://fsi/FSIHome.aspx#Country.
External Sector Statistics: The BOK currently compiles the BOP and IIP statistics consistent with the
Balance of Payment and International Investment Position Manual, sixth Edition (BPM6) analytical
framework (see http://ecos.bok.or.kr/). The BOK has completed the final-stage implementation of the
BPM6 in March 2014.
The quality of the quarterly external debt statistics has greatly improved. In early 2007, the BOK switched
from annual to quarterly reporting of the International Investment Position. Data dissemination on
international reserves and foreign currency liquidity meets the SDDS specifications. Since April 2006, the
authorities have disseminated foreign reserves data on a monthly basis rather than twice a month, as had
been done since 1997.
Korea reports balance of payments and IIP data for the IFS (quarterly data) and the Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook (annual data) publications.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Korea has subscribed to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since September
1996, and it uses SDDS flexibility options for the
timeliness of the general government operations,
central government operations and. analytical
accounts of the banking sector data. Korea is also
availing itself of a relevant flexibility option for the
coverage of exchange rates.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 13, 2015

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Korea
On May 8, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Korea.
Growth momentum that had been building since early 2013 has stalled. Average quarterly
growth rate declined to about 0.5 percent in the last three quarters of 2014 from about 1 percent
in the previous four quarters. A turning point was the April 2014 Sewol ferry accident which had
a surprisingly large and persistent impact on consumer and investor sentiment. Headline inflation
has fallen to below 1 percent, well below the Bank of Korea’s target band of 2½–3½ percent.
Despite some real appreciation the current account surplus remains at around 6¼ percent of
GDP, on the back of lower global oil prices and weak domestic demand.
Growth is projected to be in a range centered around 3 percent in 2015, where exceeding the
midpoint would require a rebound in aggregate demand during the year, possibly from the lagged
effect of the stimulus policies put in place so far and the dividend from lower oil prices. The
main external risks include slower-than-expected growth in Korea’s main trading partners, the
impact of a persistently weak yen on Korean export industries and side-effects from the global
financial conditions.
Recognizing the challenging growth environment the authorities put in place a number of
measures to spur economic recovery. The Bank of Korea lowered its policy interest rate by
75 basis points since last August to 1.75 percent. The government implemented about ½ percent
of GDP in additional spending in 2014, followed by another increase in the 2015 budget. Other
stimulus measures include increased support for policy-based lending and measures to revive the
housing market.
The resilience of the Korean financial system has increased since 2008 and near-term
vulnerabilities are limited. Overall household debt has been rising, but it has been matched by a
corresponding increase in household financial assets rather than reflecting an increase in
borrowing to finance consumption. Some of the corporate sector financial soundness indicators
have weakened recently and the sector is highly segmented with growing pockets of
vulnerability.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Korea’s ongoing recovery, but noted that the economic outlook
hinges on the authorities’ success in tackling remaining cyclical and structural vulnerabilities. In
particular, sluggish domestic demand is holding back the pace of activity and a rebalancing away
from export-led growth, while relatively low productivity in the service sector and a rapidly
aging society sap potential output growth. Against this background, Directors generally saw
merit in pro-active policies to shore up growth momentum in the near term, together with
structural reforms to sustain it over the longer run.
Directors welcomed recent monetary, fiscal, and other policy changes to reinvigorate domestic
demand. If clear signs of restored growth momentum from this counter-cyclical support do not
emerge soon, additional stimulative policies should be considered to forestall an adverse
feedback loop of low or negative inflation and depressed aggregate demand. In particular,
Directors agreed that there remains room for further monetary easing, if needed, and that Korea’s
low public indebtedness provides ample room for additional fiscal stimulus and reinforced social
safety nets without prejudice to debt sustainability.
Directors commended the authorities for progress in implementing the recommendations under
the 2013 Financial Sector Assessment Program and agreed that Korea’s sound financial
fundamentals limit sources of short-run systemic risk. Nonetheless, they noted that the structure
of household debt could be strengthened through additional steps to facilitate the transition of the
mortgage market toward more stable, longer-term lending.
Directors emphasized that the country’s ability to continue growing through a heavy reliance on
gaining export market share is increasingly limited. They concurred that achieving a more
balanced growth path depends critically on addressing long-standing barriers to higher
productivity in the non-traded goods and services sectors. Accordingly, Directors welcomed the
authorities’ plans to boost Korea’s growth potential through a variety of reforms including
initiatives to address labor market rigidities, support commercially viable small- and mediumsized enterprises, and foster competition.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that the won appears to be weaker than the level
consistent with fundamentals and desired policies, but underscored that methodological
shortcomings amplify the uncertainty surrounding such an assessment. In this regard, a few
Directors called for more in-depth analysis of Korea’s external position and its policy
implications. Directors stressed that maintaining a flexible exchange rate is essential to facilitate
Korea’s adjustment toward domestic sources of growth. Accordingly, they concurred that official
foreign exchange interventions should be limited to smoothing excessive exchange rate volatility
and not prevent needed exchange rate adjustment.

Statement by KwangHae Choi, Alternate Executive Director for Korea
and Il Young Park, Senior Advisor
May 8, 2015
We thank staff for a well-organized report and their constructive dialogue with the
authorities. We appreciate the staff’s assessment, which is broadly aligned with the
authorities’ policy directions.
The Korean economy is now facing challenges on multiple fronts arising from growth
deceleration, low inflation, and lagging structural adjustments. Despite proven resilience to
the global financial crisis, post-crisis recovery has been sluggish with actual growth falling
short of the potential for several years in a row, and also with seemingly diminished effects
of policy stimulus. Moreover, as noted in the report, the source of growth has been uneven
with exports being the dominant driver while population aging has undermined labor
productivity and supply.
However, we firmly believe that Korea still has great potential to grow and prosper given
Korean people’s strong zeal for economic success and education. Various reforms are being
implemented, albeit not as fast as desired, to further improve our growth potential. Firms are
keen on improving productivity and undertaking large R&D investments. Workers are more
than willing to upgrade their productivity through learning-by-doing and higher-level
education. Korea’s fiscal position remains strong compared to other OECD members and the
government is expanding its role in supporting private economic activities and improving
income distribution.
In this vein, we consider the staff’s view on the near-term outlook is too pessimistic. While
we generally agree with the listed uncertainties, growth is likely to overshoot the 3% growth
projection by staff for 2015 given signs of strengthening employment, investment and
confidence.
Regarding Korea’s financial sector and macro financial stability, we highly appreciate staff’s
appraisal. Through the continuous efforts with the help of the Fund, Korea has established
solid capital buffers, a sound financial system and strong public finances. However, we have
a strong concern that the staff assessment of Korea’s current account gap is overstated. In
particular, we remain concerned that methodological and data shortcomings mean that the
assessment has not been able to fully capture relevant country specific factors.
Going forward, we agree with staff’s assessments about what needs to be done to lift growth
potential. In particular, the staff’s assessment is in line with the main thrust of Korea’s
‘Three-Year Plan for Economic Innovation’, which aims at revitalizing the economy through
structural reforms, with a focus on public, financial sector, labor market and education

2
reforms. As emphasized by the staff, structural reform should be the focus of our efforts to
cultivate our long run competitiveness.
Economic outlook and major policies
Staff projects growth for 2015 in a range at around 3 percent, with greater weight on a
number of uncertainties and risks. We understand that the growth forecast is a reflection of
the Bank of Korea’s recent downward revision. Staff is of the view that it would take some
time to see the clear signs of recovery, requiring vigilance to a risk of a self-reinforcing
downside dynamic.
Nevertheless, we consider staff projection too timid or even pessimistic for several reasons.
First, staff projections may not adequately reflect most recent high-frequency indicators and
some developments in the labor market, which are pointing toward a better improvement in
the economy than the staff projected. Specifically,







Stock price index (KOSPI) has gained by over 11 percent since the beginning of this
year while business sentiment index (BSI) improved in April this year compared to
Q4 of the last year.
Real wages are expected to rise further in line with a 7.1 percent increase in the
minimum wage. The employment rate also climbed to 65.3% in 2014, up from 64.4%
in 2013, and is expected to gain further this year. Higher wages and increased
employment would support consumption growth.
The top 30 corporations plan to increase their investment aided in part by policy
initiatives to promote corporate investment (15 trillion won).
We have seen a rise in new house sales since Q1 of this year, a positive sign for a
rebound in the construction sector.

In addition, we agree with staff that external uncertainties remain high this year. But an
upturn in global trade volume this year would have a positive impact on Korea’s exports. For
instance, exports of mobile phones, one of Korea’s major export products, would likely
benefit from the improved global market conditions.
We would like to highlight that the Korean authorities have ample policy space to maneuver.
The Korean authorities have already taken numerous measures to boost domestic demand
through macroeconomic policies. The FY 2015 budget envisaged a more expansionary fiscal
stance with front-loading of fiscal spending. To be specific, about 60 percent of the budget
will be disbursed in the first half of the year. The Bank of Korea has cut the policy rate three

3
times since August 2014 to 1.75 percent at present. The authorities stand ready to take further
pre-emptive actions if deemed necessary.
Last but not least, the downward revision of growth projections is quite large for Korea,
compared to other major countries. Staff revised growth projection down to around 3 percent
from 4 percent of the last October WEO. The staff report should be clearer about what
underlies such sharp downward revision. We are worried that pessimistic projections could
trigger self-fulfilling dynamics, throwing cold water to already weak sentiments.
Macro-financial stability and resilience
We appreciate that the staff report delivers a strong message that the Korean economy is
equipped with effective firewalls in many respects. We concur with the staff view that
macro-financial stability is sound, and both the financial and external sectors are resilient to
possible shocks at the aggregate level.


As the 2013 FSAP found, the assets of financial institutions are prudently managed
with levels of capital being well above regulatory requirements. Financial sector
regulation and supervision is competent, within frameworks that are generally
comparable to global standards. Financial intermediation is robust.



Staff assessed that external buffers remain adequate, helping limit the impact of
renewed financial volatility, and the external vulnerabilities in the financial system
have diminished due to macro prudential measures.



Regarding rising household debts, staff rightly assessed that household debt was not a
near-term threat to financial stability, as rising debt has been matched by a
corresponding increase in household financial assets.

We particularly welcome staff’s favorable recognition of effectiveness of macro-prudential
policies in Korea as well as and their agreement that these measures should remain in place at
this juncture. As staff rightly pointed out, macro-prudential measures, adopted as
complementary measures to macroeconomic policies, have successfully contained the buildup of systemic vulnerabilities in financial markets as well as the external sector. Macroprudential measures have also complemented macroeconomic policies in the course of
dealing with the global financial crisis, enabling the authorities to safeguard sufficient policy
space for macroeconomic management. The authorities will stand ready to carefully monitor
macro-financial risks and remain flexible in adjusting macro-prudential policies to evolving
market conditions while being mindful that they should not substitute for needed
macroeconomic policies.

4
Staff pointed out that pockets of risks exist. However, with adequate macro- and microprudential regulations being in place and the balance sheets of market participants being
generally prudent, the Korean authorities are continuing efforts to further solidify macrofinancial stability and resilience as we are shifting toward a more balanced growth model.
First, staff rightly pointed out the need to improve the structure of household debt, a large
portion of which is comprised of floating-rate interest-only mortgage loans with short
maturities and bullet repayment. We remain vigilant to monitor the pace of the increase in
household debt and the soundness of its structure. The authorities will continue to maintain
the current strong macro-prudential toolkits, including LTV and DTI measures, to prevent
systemic risks from building up. Structural vulnerabilities in mortgage finance have declined
recently, aided by the successful wrap up of a loan conversion program in April 2015. The
loan conversion program, targeting only the most vulnerable borrowers converted high-risk
floating-rate mortgage loans with bullet repayments into much safer fixed-rate and
amortizing loans. About 8 percent of total mortgage loans benefited from the program. Going
beyond such a one-off measure, the authorities are undertaking various policy efforts to
deepen the mortgage market and strengthen related market institutions.
Second, with regard to the corporate sector soundness, staff appraised that many financial
soundness indicators have weakened recently and corporate income and profits have become
increasingly concentrated in the top-ranked firms, although aggregate corporate leverage was
relatively modest. We consider that the corporate sector as a whole is healthy with large
enterprises being generally sound and profitable. While there are a number of marginal firms,
they are likely to go through financial restructuring. In order to promote and expedite an ongoing corporate restructuring, the authorities are preparing for an amendment to the
Corporate Restructuring Act aiming at streamlining restructuring procedures and
encouraging market-based incentives for debt restructuring. In Box 2, staff presented that,
compared to other Asian countries, Korea has a high concentration of corporate debt in firms
with low profitability and high leverage. We are not convinced by the simple comparison and
assessment with other Asian countries which may be at different level of development.
Third, while staff assessed the current account gap widened relative to last year based on
application of new EBA approach, we suggest cautious interpretation of this result in light of
limitations in the methodology. As staff rightly noted, the increase in the surplus has been
largely driven by a decrease in imports due to slower growth and a fall in global oil prices.
Forward-looking caution in consumption from anticipating the decrease in working age
population from 2016, has also contributed to decrease in imports, not to mention the lower
domestic investment by large Korean enterprises in the course of increasing overseas
investment as part of a process of off-shoring production. However, we do think that the
EBA approach does not adequately take into account these country specific factors, let alone

5
the limitations of the model that staff correctly admitted in footnote 1 in Box 4. Regarding
the exchange rate gap, we also see scope for improving accuracy of assessment by applying a
lower elasticity in accordance with the staff assessment in Box 3 of the high inelasticity of
Korean export volumes to exchange rate movements.
While the current account registered large surpluses in recent years due to many countryspecific and global factors, in line with staff advice, we expect external imbalances to
gradually narrow as GDP gap closes. At the policy level, various efforts have been
undertaken to stimulate domestic demand and keep the exchange rate to be determined by the
market. As a related matter, we welcome staff’s presentation in Box 3 of the impact of the
weaker yen on Korea’s exports as it suggests how future exports of Korea would develop if
devaluation of yen persists.
Structural reform
We share the staff’s view that structural reforms are warranted. As pursued by ‘The Three –
Year Plan for Economic Innovation’, the Korean authorities have clearly defined that the
directions and measures of our reform are comparable to the staff’s assessment. In particular,
as suggested by the staff, our reform efforts have focused on addressing low service sector
productivity, un-dynamic SMEs and labor market rigidities and mismatches.
We note staff’s analysis that considerable gains could be achieved by increasing service
sector productivity in the area of health, education and other protected professions. The
priority of our policies lies in promoting competition through further deregulation. Removing
barriers to market entry and promoting innovation and investment are major policy goals, and
to that end, the authorities are promoting competition in major high value-added service
sectors, including medical, tourism, education and financial services. The differential tax
treatment of service sectors relative to the manufacturing sector will also be removed.
While staff proposes to phase out the credit guarantee support to SMEs, we note that the
current SME credit guarantee support does not function as a life-support for unviable SMEs
given that such support is predicated on the viability of an SME. Consideration also needs to
be given to the fact that SMEs are a critical part of the value chain and also represent a de
facto social safety net. We are systematically reviewing the SME credit guarantee system in
order to enhance efficiency and eliminate redundancy among public guarantee providers.
Regarding labor market reforms, as staff report properly pointed out, reducing market
rigidities and increasing female labor force participation are key priorities. We are setting up
implementation plans following the high-level tripartite agreement in December 2014. The
implementation plans will encompass measures to abolish discrimination against non-regular

6
workers, reform unemployment insurance and promote youth employment. The education
reform is also being pursued to close skill mismatches by improving vocational training and
coordination between industries and universities. Various measures are being taken to
promote female force participation in the labor market, including public support for
childcare.
In addition, we are pursuing a series of structural fiscal reforms to safeguard longer-term
fiscal sustainability. Reform on the government employee pension, has been passed at the
special committee in the National Assembly with a view of increasing the contribution by
employees while reducing the fiscal cost of benefits. The management of the National
Pension system is also being reviewed in order to bolster independence and the efficiency of
asset management. In addition, the function and organizational structures of all state-owned
enterprises are also being re-examined in order to improve the efficacy of the SOEs by
eliminating the overlaps or redundancy of functions.
As we all know, pursuing structural reform can be a very challenging task as well as a
difficult process of balancing the interests of different groups. However, Korea is fully
committed to reform efforts on every front. We continue to seek the Fund’s engagement and
support.
