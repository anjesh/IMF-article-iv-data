EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Through the HIPC process, the authorities began to address policy challenges and economic
fragilities. As a result, the economy has become more resilient and policy making and
transparency in oil wealth management have improved. Yet, formidable development
challenges remain. The authorities plan to scale up capital spending to ease infrastructure
bottlenecks, financed mostly by own resources. Discussions focused on balancing
development needs and fiscal sustainability, and policies to strengthen the business climate.
Background and outlook
Congo weathered the global downturn well, and indicators point to an acceleration in
economic activity. The outlook is favorable, provided public investment and policies to
strengthen the business climate are successful in raising future non-oil growth.
The Authorities’ policies and views


In support of fiscal consolidation, efforts focus on raising non-oil revenue collection
and reducing current expenditure to make space for higher capital spending while
continuing to save a large share of oil revenue.



Measures are being taken to safeguard investment efficiency, including strengthening
public financial management and project appraisal, implementation and monitoring.



Significant challenges remain to increasing credit to the private sector, despite
elimination of interest rate ceilings and regulations aimed at transparency in lending.



Guided by the newly adopted action plan to improve the business climate, work is in
train to foster public-private dialogue and establish an investment promotion agency.

Staff’s recommendations


Program performance through end-June was satisfactory. All performance criteria and
structural benchmarks were met.



The broad thrust of fiscal policy is appropriate, but sustained consolidation efforts are
required to achieve sustainability.



Strong public financial management is key to successfully implementing the 2011
fiscal program. To safeguard public investment efficiency, the procedures put in place
during the HIPC process should be used consistently, starting with project
prioritization and appraisal, and supported by heightened monitoring.



Prospects depend critically on developing a strong non-oil sector. Frontloading of
actions to reduce the cost of doing business, strengthen human capital and resolve
land-use issues should complement basic infrastructure, and be supported by policies
to increase credit to the private sector, including by lowering the cost of collateral.

Staff recommends completion of the Fourth Review under the Three-Year ECF arrangement
on the basis of performance to date and the strength of the program.

4
I. THE ECONOMIC AGENDA
1.
The road leading to the HIPC completion point was long, with a pronounced period
of adjustment during which the poor did not perceive an increase in welfare in line with
Congo’s burgeoning oil wealth. Yet, through this process, the authorities began to address
policy challenges and economic fragilities, making strides toward macroeconomic stability
and fiscal sustainability. They also made progress on improving public financial management
and took some initial steps to strengthen institutions. As a result, the economy has become
more resilient and policy making and transparency in the management of oil resources have
improved.
2.
With HIPC behind them, the authorities aim to address challenges posed by still-high
poverty and oil dominance, setting their sights on the next phase of development—fostering a
dynamic non-oil sector. And, building on gains in macroeconomic and external stability, they
plan to redouble efforts to reduce poverty and bring the benefits of stability and oil wealth to
the people. Their three-pronged approach focuses on (a) investing in basic infrastructure and
human capital, (b) raising pro-poor spending, and (c) supporting growth of the non-oil
economy. At the outset, key public infrastructure will be completed to ease bottlenecks in
transportation and public utilities which have held back non-oil activity, while upgrading and
constructing new health and education buildings.
3.
Discussions focused on the authorities’ shift in policy direction. Key issues included
striking a balance between development needs and safeguarding stability and sustainability;
the steps the government could begin to take to strengthen the business climate; as well as the
need for greater focus on improving health and education services.
II. PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING POLICY OBJECTIVES
Despite the global downturn, developments since the last Article IV have been positive and
Congo is reaping the benefits of sustained policy implementation and HIPC debt relief. Yet,
progress to date in social areas such as health and education has been disappointing.
4.

Economic resilience has increased markedly since 2008, despite oil dominance.



Macroeconomic stability is now well
established. Economic activity remained
robust as the global economy faltered,
buoyed by rising oil production and
sustained non-oil growth in construction,
telecommunication and transport, which
more than offset the hard-hit timber
market. Inflation returned to the low single
digits.

5.
Fiscal consolidation through June 2010 progressed somewhat faster than
envisioned at the time of the last Article IV consultation, but spending pressures began
to mount in the third quarter.


As oil revenues plummeted in 2009, the authorities slashed current expenditure while
modestly raising non-oil revenue collection to register a consolidation of the basic
non-oil primary deficit (BNOPD) of 8½ percentage points of non-oil GDP.



Consolidation continued in the first half of 2010, with revenue over performance and
under execution of capital projects more than offsetting a tick up in current
expenditure across spending categories. The authorities observed the end-June
BNOPD program target.



Preliminary data indicate that
current spending pressures
intensified in the third quarter,
rising to 93 percent of annual
budget allocation by endSeptember. About half of the
increase is estimated to be due to
the need for the government to
respond with increasing public
resources to the refugee crisis in

the North of the country and a move toward a pay-for-use system for some public

Anniversary of Congo’s Independence celebrated in August. A recent severe outbreak
of polio has necessitated a mass vaccination campaign, placing further strains on
government finances.

7.
Progress was made in addressing institutional weaknesses in the context of the
HIPC process. The authorities took steps to strengthen public financial management through
establishing a functional classification of expenditure, integrating public investment into the
2010 budget process through the medium term expenditure framework (MTEF), and
rationalizing budget execution procedures. They also adopted and have implemented a new
procurement code, which supports transparency and competition. Oil sector transparency and
governance has been improved through quarterly certification of oil revenues and transfer of
oil receipts to the treasury within 45 days of shipment (structural benchmarks).

1

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees reports that there are 115,000 refugees in Congo, more than
80 percent women and children, of which 39,000 attend school. Camps are spread over 500 km along the river
on 106 sites. The government has been increasingly providing logistics and security services, in addition to
schooling for those students not in refugee schools and some medical services. Exact amounts are difficult to
pin point as they span various expenditure categories (transfers, materials/supplies, and local authorities).
2

Since meters had been destroyed in the war, common charges for electricity, water and telecoms were being
charged on a flat rate basis, with a detrimental impact on the balance sheets of public utilities in these sectors.
Some public utility companies have started implementing meters and pay-for-use billing systems, which will
also apply to services provided to state institutions.

7
8.
At the same time, tangible improvement in key social areas such as the provision
of health and education services has yet to become apparent.3 While the 2011 draft
budget contains higher spending, less than 5 percent of the overall budget is allocated to
health and education, much of which is targeted toward infrastructure not service provision,
and strategies to place doctors and teachers in rural areas face challenges.4
III. PROSPECTS AND RISKS IN THE POST-HIPC ERA
9.
The outlook is favorable, despite continued high dependence on oil. Oil
production in currently operational fields is expected to peak in 2011, but new contracts may
be signed following the change in the oil taxation regime underway leading to new fields
coming on stream by 2015. Prospects for the non-oil economy depend on the success of
public investment in basic infrastructure and improvements in the business climate in raising
future growth. In the near term, growth will be supported by strong activity in the
construction, telecoms and transport sectors related in large part to the scaling up of public
investment, but looking ahead activity will need to increasingly rely on private sector
participation in the economy. There are strong indications that economic activity is
accelerating, and growth is forecast to reach 9 percent in 2010. Under the baseline scenario,
non-oil growth is expected to pickup markedly over the medium term (from a low base) as
infrastructure projects are completed, but oil dominance would remain. Inflation would
remain somewhat higher than trading partners over the near term, as bottlenecks in
transportation limit the supply of consumption and investment goods in the capital city, but
decline steadily as projects to increase rail and road capacity are completed. In the absence of
new oil fields coming on stream, the current account would return to deficit by the end of the
medium term. However, debt sustainability would further strengthen given the appreciable
decline in the net external debt ratio as gross official foreign assets rise to above 135 percent
of GDP in 2015.

4

Congo’s social indicators remain weak and in some cases—notably health—have worsened (Table 8).

Lack of basic infrastructure, housing and public services in rural areas has thwarted attempts to hire and place
medical and education professionals in the most underserved regions.

The outlook is subject to domestic as well as external risks. In addition to risks
stemming from oil price volatility or lower oil production, downside risks center around
uncertainties about the ability of public investment and structural reform to raise future
growth, deliver promised poverty reduction and strengthen social cohesion. Risks to fiscal
sustainability and policy credibility are heightened by ambitious planned revenue and
expenditure measures. New oil discoveries are an upside risk.

IV. BALANCING DEVELOPMENT NEEDS AND FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
Formidable development challenges remain in both basic infrastructure and social service
provision. With the country on a stronger economic footing, the authorities plan to step up
efforts to reduce infrastructure bottlenecks. Discussions focused on striking an appropriate
balance between scaling up expenditure and fiscal sustainability.

9
Fiscal policy
11.
The authorities are taking measures to solidify 2010 consolidation efforts. As
previously noted, the authorities experienced spending pressures in the third quarter, some
related to unforeseen humanitarian and utility costs, but also overruns attributable mainly to
the Fifty-year Independence celebration, with little pro-growth impact. Aided by the
seasonal drop off in spending in the fourth quarter, they are taking measures to rein in current
spending while building on over performance in non-oil revenue by strengthening customs
collection and ensuring that dividends from profitable public enterprises are collected.
Allowing for additional humanitarian and immunization spending and the change in the
utility billing system, the authorities expect a consolidation in 2010 of 1.3 percentage points
of non-oil GDP in 2010, bringing consolidation over the first two years under the three-year
ECF arrangement to 9.6 percentage points of GDP. The authorities noted that such an
adjustment is broadly equivalent to the three year adjustment contained in the original
program (IMF Country Report No. 09/74), and could justify a slower pace of consolidation in
order to address development challenges which are holding back non-oil growth and poverty
reduction.
12.
With HIPC behind them and ample policy buffers, starting with the 2011 budget
the authorities plan to scale up public investment, while continuing to save a large share
of oil revenue.5 They pointed to paved road density in Congo that is one-quarter that of SubSaharan Africa and the country’s insufficient and unreliable electricity supply.6 They stressed
that frontloading public investment will lay the foundation for future growth, which is key
for job creation and poverty reduction as oil production declines, and rebuffed the validity of
anchoring policy strictly on a permanent income model that does not differential between
consumption and investment spending.
13.
That said, the authorities reiterated their commitment to fiscal sustainability
and investment efficiency. Their 2011 BNOPD target of CFAF 753 billion (34.5 percent of
non-oil GDP) is consistent with the consolidation envisioned in the original program. They
plan to achieve this target through further efforts to strengthen non-oil revenue collection and
restrain current expenditure to make space for a 37 percent increase in domestically financed
public investment, while continuing to save a large share of oil revenue. Specific actions the
authorities intend to take include:

5
6

The draft 2011 budget is expected to be adopted by parliament by December 31, 2010.

The World Bank’s Africa Infrastructure Diagnostic for Congo identifies transportation and electricity
bottlenecks as the key factors restraining growth, and estimates that raising the infrastructure platform to the
level of Mauritius would increase per capita GDP growth by 3.7 percent per year.

10


Non-oil revenue: measures to broaden the tax base (payment of forestry and telecoms
royalties to the treasury, taxation of transactions related to public contracts); reduce
exonerations; and improve administration, with particular emphasis on customs
appraisal and control. The expected net gain is 1 percentage point of non-oil GDP.



Current expenditure: continue efforts begun in early 2009 to reduce current
expenditure, focusing on bringing transfers and spending on materials and supplies
down from the high levels experienced in 2010 due to one-off events. The expected
reduction in non-wage primary current expenditure is 2.9 percentage points of non-oil
GDP. While appearing ambitious relative to the high base of 2010, compared to 2009
the decline mostly reflects lower transfers to loss-making state enterprises.



Domestically financed capital expenditure: carry out the necessary investment for
growth and poverty reduction taking into account capacity constraints. While
continuing to pursue additional sources of non-oil revenue, in the event these fail to
materialize, cap domestically financed capital expenditure (excluding the use of HIPC
interim assistance funds) at CFAF 650 billion through project prioritization and use of
strict measures to ensure project quality. While somewhat lower than that envisioned
in the 2011 draft budget, this envelope is sufficiently ample to cover execution of all
projects currently in train and the launch of new priority projects.7 The authorities will
continue to finance investment mostly out of their own resources, with some highly
concessional foreign co-funding.

14.
The authorities are conscious of the risks that ongoing current expenditure
pressures place on their deficit target, and stand ready to take measures. Pressures may
emanate from an unresolved refugee crisis, the impact of inflation on spending on materials
and supplies, higher transfers to compensate for royalties being paid into the treasury, the
need for more healthcare and education professionals, and rising operations and maintenance
costs as infrastructure projects are completed. A preliminary costing of the planned threeyear phase-in of the civil service reform which takes effect in January 2011 does not appear
to put undue pressure on public finances.8 The authorities will remain vigilant and reduce
non-priority current outlays to meet the deficit target while protecting social spending, which
appears feasible given still-high total current spending.

7
8

A World Bank assessment identified more than 75 percent of projects as pro-poor or pro-growth (value terms).

The civil service reform (a) rolls back the moratorium in place since 1994 on civil servants receiving wage
payments stemming from promotions, and includes (b) a reclassification of job grades and (c) a new meritbased salary scale. Parallel efforts to reduce ghost workers and eliminate workers collecting multiple salaries
have begun to show results. After a slight tick up in 2011, the wage bill would resume a downward trend.

11
15.
Over the medium term the authorities will continue efforts toward achieving
fiscal sustainability. Ongoing efforts to boost non-oil revenue will be redoubled through a
planned tax reform aimed at broadening the tax base and reducing complexity (with FAD
technical assistance), and significant efforts to strengthen tax administration. On expenditure,
current spending will be streamlined to make space for increased social service provision and
operations and maintenance costs, and while investment expenditure is expected to remain
elevated over the near term, it will come down as major projects are completed. (Box 1)
Structural fiscal measures
16.
Despite progress on PFM, the authorities recognize that there is still work to be
done on addressing weaknesses in budgetary control and treasury operations. They are
increasing vigilance over the length of the budgetary chain, and plan to work with
development partners to strengthen treasury operations.
17.
The authorities plan to redouble efforts to safeguard public investment quality
by more fully employing the toolkit developed as part of the HIPC process. Beginning
with the appraisal process, the authorities will ensure that all projects have a feasibility study
and are aligned with the MTEF, and re-enforce budget execution procedures and controls at
the commitment stage of the expenditure chain. They will also complement competitive
bidding under the procurement code with increased coordination among agencies involved in
the investment process, and prepare a procurement plan for 2011 with quarterly monitoring
reports, in collaboration with the World Bank.
V. SUPPORTING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION
The authorities are in the process of developing a second generation Poverty Reduction
Strategy for 2011–16. Identified motors of growth include agriculture and agro-industry, and
transportation through development of a transit corridor to central Africa. Discussions
focused on putting in place the necessary conditions for private sector-led non-oil growth.
18.
The authorities have taken some measures to increase banking sector credit to
the private sector, but large challenges remain. They have allowed greater competition
through the entry of new banks; begun eliminating ceilings on lending rates; and pushed for
greater transparency of loan conditions, including publication of the complete costs of loan
offerings, including fees and charges. They have also had some success in increasing the use
of banking services by paying some wages and pensions through direct deposit, eliminating
account fees, and closing the postal bank, although the latter has reduced financial service
coverage in rural areas. Despite these efforts, credit to the private sector has increased only
modestly, reflecting the low capacity of SMEs to produce financial statements and business
plans, the lack of quality projects, and the high cost of collateral.

12
Box 1: Update on Fiscal Sustainability
Congo has achieved significant fiscal consolidation over the course of the current ECF program (Country Report No.
09/74), with a projected reduction in the basic non-oil primary balance of almost 10 percent of non-oil GDP over 2008 and
2010. Despite this sizeable progress, further consolidation efforts are needed to ensure fiscal sustainability.
Key variables affecting the sustainable fiscal deficit are now projected to be more favorable than at the beginning of
the ECF program, notably the oil and growth profiles. Oil revenues (in cumulative terms) over 2008–28 are projected to be
18 percent higher (Figure 1; left panel), mostly due to larger expected oil production (12 percent higher). Projected nominal
GDP growth is also higher, mostly reflecting growth-enhancing public investment.

To illustrate possible adjustment paths we consider three scenarios: a baseline in which sustainability is reached by the
time oil is exhausted in 2028 (a 1.8 percentage point average consolidation per year); a “good” scenario with a faster rate of
consolidation; and a “bad” scenario with a slower pace of consolidation. Under the baseline net government assets
amounting to around 96 percent of GDP are accumulated by the end of the oil period, implying a sustainable long-term
primary deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP annually. Under the “good” scenario, fiscal sustainability is attained earlier (by 2022),
and a net asset accumulation of 128 percent of GDP could sustain a long-term primary deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP.
Conversely, under slower consolidation, a significant fiscal adjustment would be needed at the end of the oil period to reach
a sustainable long-term primary deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP.

The authorities have recently adopted an action plan to improve the business
climate. The near-term priorities contained in the comprehensive plan include improving
public-private dialogue; simplifying and making the tax system more business friendly;
ensuring investment security; and addressing issues related to land use and tenure, such as
the use of long-term leasing. With the help of development partners, the council for public
private dialogue is operational, while work is already in train to establish an agency for
investment promotion, an industrial standard setting agency, as well as an office for the
protection of intellectual property.

The exchange rate regime has anchored
macrostability in Congo, and the real effective
exchange rate is broadly in line with policy dependant
medium term fundamentals given the uncertainty
surrounding such estimates.9 However, external
stability in the CEMAC region requires regionally
lower public expenditure and structural reforms to
bring the real effective exchange rate in line with
medium-term fundamentals.

VII. THE FOURTH REVIEW UNDER THE ECF—GROWTH ORIENTED POLICIES
21.
Program implementation
through June was satisfactory. All
quantitative performance criteria and
structural benchmarks were met,
including the strategic study of the oil
sector (end-September structural
benchmark) (Table 6). Net domestic
financing was higher, reflecting in part
lower oil revenue.
22.
Policies over the remainder
of 2010 are aimed at sustaining
fiscal consolidation. The revised
BNOPD target of CFAF 663 billion
(Appendix I, LOI, Table 1), reflects
(a) higher outlays to address the
refugee crisis in the North of the

The zero ceiling on nonconcessional external debt does not apply to forthcoming external loans from the
European Investment Bank and the Central African States Development Bank, as specified in paragraph 11 of
the Technical Memorandum of Understanding.

country, (b) the cost of the universal Polio vaccination campaign, and (c) the move toward
pay-for-use billing systems for some utility services. To safeguard the deficit target the
authorities are committed to reining in public expenditure while strengthening customs
revenue and ensuring that dividends from profitable public enterprises are collected
(Appendix I, MEFP, paragraph 6).
23.
Fiscal policies for 2011 center around scaling up investment expenditure while
safeguarding public investment quality. The authorities BNOPD target of CFAF 189
billion for end-March (final test date of the program) and BNOPD projection of CFAF 753
billion for end-December (-34.5 percent of non-oil GDP) allows for a 37 percent increase in
domestically financed public investment (excluding HIPC funds), financed in large part by
measures to boost non-oil revenue collection and restrain current expenditure. Investment
quality will be improved through increasing use of the toolkit put in place during the HIPC
process (Appendix I, MEFP, paragraphs 7 and 9). In the event that announced measures fail
to materialize, the authorities are committed to further reducing capital expenditure to meet
the budget target.
24.
Under the government’s program, the
adjustment under the three year program
would be in line with the envisioned adjustment
over the course of the original program, with a
frontloading of consolidation of current
expenditure. The programmed total adjustment is
9.8 percentage points of non-oil GDP
(9.8 percentage points in the original program).

VIII. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Congo is reaping the benefits of sustained policy implementation and HIPC debt
relief, and economic resilience has increased markedly. Macroeconomic stability is now well
established, the external position has improved appreciably, and fiscal consolidation has
progressed somewhat faster than envisioned. Yet, a large basic infrastructure gap remains
and tangible improvement in key social areas such as health and education services has yet to
become apparent. Swiftly directing resources to these areas would improve the quality of life,
but could also serve to strengthen social cohesion.
26.
The medium-term outlook is positive, provided that public investment and measures
to improve the delivery of public services and the business climate are successful in raising
non-oil growth. Ensuring public investment efficiency is critical to realizing a strong growth
dividend. With oil production set to peak in 2011, growth in the future will need to
increasingly rely on private sector participation in the economy. Non-oil growth is expected
to pickup markedly over the medium term supported by robust activity in the construction,

15
transport and telecoms sectors and improved basic infrastructure, but excessive dependence
on oil would remain.
27.
Staff supports the broad thrust of fiscal policy which aims to strengthen non-oil
revenue and restrain current expenditure to make space for needed infrastructure spending.
However, sustained consolidation efforts are required over the medium term to achieve fiscal
sustainability, especially in light of mounting pressures on current expenditures. Measures
being taken to rein in spending over the remainder of 2010 and collect addition non-oil
revenue are welcome and feasible, as are the authorities’ planned efforts to reinforce quality
control in the context of a sizeable increase in public investment in 2011. However, the
authorities should stand ready to safeguard the deficit target in the event that consolidation
gains fail to materialize, while protecting social outlays.
28.
The moderate planned scaling up of investment is welcome, but strong public
financial management will be key to successfully implementing the authorities’ 2011 fiscal
program. There is still considerable scope to strengthen budget control and treasury
operations and the authorities should to work closely with development partners. In order to
safeguard public investment efficiency, the authorities should fully implement the procedures
put in place during the HIPC process, starting with project prioritization and appraisal, and
supported by heightened monitoring.
29.
Prospects depend on developing a strong non-oil sector. The authorities’
comprehensive action plan to improve the business climate is welcome, and frontloading of
key actions to reduce red tape and resolve land use issues would be an important compliment
to the increased provision of public infrastructure. These efforts should be supported by
policies to increase the banking sector’s provision of credit to the private sector, including by
decreasing the cost of collateral.
30.
The exchange rate regime has anchored macrostability in Congo. However, external
stability in the CEMAC region requires regionally lower public expenditure and structural
reforms to bring the real effective exchange rate in line with medium-term fundamentals
31.
Staff supports the establishment of end-March performance criteria and the
authorities’ request for the modification of the end-December 2010 performance criterion on
the basic non-oil primary balance, and recommends completion of the Fourth Review under
the three-year ECF arrangement on the basis of performance to date and the strength of the
program.

APPENDIX I—LETTER OF INTENT

Brazzaville, December 20, 2010
The Minister of Finance, Budget
And Public Portfolio
To:
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431
United States of America
Dear Managing Director:
The Republic of Congo continues to pursue a medium-term economic and financial program
aimed at supporting balanced growth, low and stable inflation and fiscal and external
sustainability, supported by the IMF under the Three-year Extended Credit Facility
arrangement approved by the Executive Board in December 2008. In the attached
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP, Attachment I), we outline the
broad thrust of our macroeconomic policies and the structural reforms we intend to take in
the period ahead to achieve the objectives of our original program. These objectives include
an increase in real non-oil GDP growth, maintenance of low and stable inflation, and
medium-term fiscal adjustment toward long-term sustainability.
Prospects for the Congolese economy are favorable. Economic indicators for the first half of
the year are encouraging, pointing to robust growth in the non-oil sector and rising oil
production. On the external front, the recovery in the terms of trade and rising oil and timber
exports are expected to shift the current account into surplus in 2010. Moreover, the overall
fiscal surplus will add to the significant improvement in the external position resulting from
HIPC debt relief, and we will continue to use our best efforts to conclude bilateral debt
agreements and to use good faith efforts to obtain comparable treatment from commercial
creditors as soon as possible.
Mr. Managing Director, over the course of the first half of the program we have made
significant progress toward achieving program goals, despite the global financial crisis and
the volatility of world oil prices. In particular, macroeconomic stability is now well
established and strides have been made toward fiscal sustainability through consolidation
which has outpaced that envisioned in the original program. We attribute this to close

26
program monitoring and implementation in the run up to, and in the period following, the
HIPC completion point.
The implementation of our Fund-supported program through end-June remained satisfactory
and we observed all quantitative performance criteria and structural benchmarks, including
the strategic study of the oil sector (end-September structural benchmark). However, in
recent months spending has come under pressure from, on the one hand, a need to respond
with increasing public resources to the refugee crisis in the northern department of Likouala,
and on the other, a severe polio outbreak, as well as the move toward a pay-for-use system
for some public utility services. We also faced higher expenditures related to our 50th
Anniversary celebration held in August.
Over the remainder of 2010 we will redouble our consolidation efforts, reining in public
expenditure while strengthening customs revenue and ensuring that dividends from profitable
public enterprises are collected. Given the large expenses we are incurring to address the
humanitarian and health crises as well as the change in utility billing mechanism, we have
revised our end-December basic non-oil primary deficit (BNOPD) ceiling to CFAF 663
billion, while taking measures to mobilize an additional CFAF 22 billion in revenue. In the
event that these measures are unsuccessful, we will further restrain expenditure to stay within
the deficit ceiling. It is important to note that the revised end-2010 BNOPD ceiling implies a
consolidation of about 1.3 percentage points of non-oil GDP relative to 2009, and a
cumulative adjustment under the first two years of the program of 9½ percentage points of
GDP, which is broadly equivalent to the total three-year adjustment envisioned in the original
program. This strong performance provides greater fiscal space for much needed investment
and allows us to achieve the objectives of the program.
In this context and given ample policy buffers, in 2011 we intend to scale up growthenhancing and poverty-reducing public investment, and to focus on closing the large
infrastructure gap which is holding back economic diversification and growth. Total capital
expenditure is budgeted to increase by 55 percent relative to 2010 to 15.2 percent of GDP,
with projects aligned with the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). With a view
toward fiscal sustainability, and in order to continue to save a large portion of oil revenues,
we plan to finance a substantial share of the increase in capital spending by significant gains
in non-oil revenue collection and restraint of current expenditure. At the same time, it is
important to note that the budget also aims to strengthen social cohesion following a long
period of adjustment during which the poor did not perceive the benefits of the nation’s
soaring oil wealth. Let me reiterate that it is our firm belief that the frontloading of these
projects, especially in basic infrastructure, is key to laying the foundation of durable growth
and poverty reduction.
That said, the budgeted capital expenditure for 2011 should be viewed as indicative. As
firmly as we believe these projects are necessary, we are also fully aware of the challenges

27
and risks associated with such a large increase in capital expenditure, even in our current
situation where the base is low. While gains to date in capacity building and public financial
management have been substantial, we are conscious that there remains significant scope to
further improve project appraisal, monitoring and implementation. Moreover, such a large
increase in domestic demand in the face of transport and other bottlenecks may raise nearterm inflation and crowd out private sector activity, not to mention pose risks to fiscal
sustainability in the event that revenues come in much lower than currently projected or
envisioned revenue and current expenditure measures fail to materialize.
For these reasons, the government of Congo is committed to limiting domestically financed
capital spending (excluding HIPC funds) in 2011 to CFAF 650 billion, an increase of
37 percent over 2010, and maintaining a prudent external financing policy. Such an
investment envelope would cover all projects currently in train and provide space for us to
launch priority new projects. It also implies a small consolidation of the BNOPD to
34.5 percent of non-oil GDP given that 4 percentage points of the increase would be financed
by measures to both strengthen non-oil revenue and reduce current expenditure. At current
oil price forecasts, some $3.2 billion in oil revenue (66 percent of total oil revenue) would be
saved, corresponding to an overall fiscal surplus of 24 percent of total GDP.
We intend to achieve the domestically financed capital spending target mostly through
imposing strict measures to ensure project quality and pushing back the start date of lower
priority projects; in the event that these are insufficient, we will take measures to further
prioritize new projects. As regards strengthening project quality, we will focus on fully
implementing the reforms put in place as part of the HIPC process, as detailed in the MEFP.
But again, if these measures prove insufficient, we will further prioritize to stay on target.
We believe that the policies and measures set forth in the attached MEFP are not only aligned
with the objectives of our Fund-supported program, but will pave the way to achieving our
long-term goal of becoming an emerging market. During the implementation of the program,
we will consult with Fund staff on the adoption of any measures which may be necessary to
achieve its objectives, at the invitation of the government, or whenever the Fund staff
requests such a consultation.
The government intends to make the contents of this letter and those of the attached
Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU, Attachment II), as well as the staff report
accompanying its request for completion of the fourth review of the program, available to the
public and authorizes the IMF to arrange for them to be posted on the Fund’s website,
subsequent to Executive Board approval of its request.

28
The fifth and sixth (final) reviews under the ECF arrangement are expected to be completed
by end-June 2011 and end-September 2011, respectively.
Sincerely yours,

/s
Gilbert Ondongo
Minister of Finance,
Budget, and Public Portfolio

APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT I
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, 2010–11
Brazzaville, December 20, 2010
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Building on achievements to date and HIPC debt relief, in the period ahead we will
continue to pursue macroeconomic policies and structural reform consistent with the
objectives laid out in the program approved by the Fund’s Executive Board in December
2008, which is guided by our Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (PRS). In our view,
these objective are not only achievable, they comprise the main building block toward our
long-term goal of becoming an emerging market. This Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies (MEFP) provides further details on policies over 2010–11 consistent with
the medium-term program we laid out in our Letter of Intent and accompanying MEFP in
November 2008.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS
2.
Over the past couple of years, resilience of the Congolese economy has increased
significantly through sustained policy implementation and HIPC debt relief. Economic
activity remained strong throughout the global downturn, even when faced with a large
deterioration in the terms of trade. The external position has improved markedly, and Congo
is now at moderate risk of debt distress. Indicators for 2010 are suggestive of an acceleration
of growth, and inflation remains manageable.


Growth is accelerating and will likely reach 9 percent in 2010. Oil production
continues to rise as new fields come on stream, and is expected to peak in 2011.
Importantly, non-oil growth is booming in the construction, telecommunications and
transport sectors and is expected to attain the level required to durably reduce poverty
over the near term before rising to double digits as transport and electricity
bottlenecks are eased. Inflation will likely edge up over the near term as the pace of
growth quickens and remain above the CEMAC convergence criteria of 3 percent, but
would decline fairly rapidly as basic infrastructure is completed.



The current account should swing back into surplus in 2010 as a result of the
improvement in the terms of trade and rising oil exports, and register a healthy
surplus over the next few years before trending downward with oil production.
Adding to the gains resulting from HIPC debt relief, the external position would be
further strengthened by an accumulation of foreign assets resulting from running a
sustained overall fiscal surplus. We have completed bilateral agreements with most

30
Paris Club creditors, and we will continue to use our best efforts to conclude the
remaining bilateral debt agreements and to use good faith efforts to obtain
comparable treatment from commercial creditors as soon as possible.
3.
Policy implementation over the course of the first half of our three-year Fundsupported program has been satisfactory and we have made significant progress toward
achieving program goals. Notably, fiscal consolidation has outpaced that envisioned in the
original program and macroeconomic stability is now well established. Performance in the
structural area has also been satisfactory, with gains in public financial management and oil
sector governance. We attribute these positive results to close program monitoring and
implementation in the run up to, and in the period following, the HIPC completion point.


We have continued to make progress toward fiscal sustainability. Building on the
large fiscal consolidation of 8½ percentage points of non-oil GDP in 2009, efforts
continued in the first half of 2010. The basic non-oil primary deficit (BNOPD) at endJune was CFAF 350 billion, in line with the program target. We accomplished this
through strong efforts to strengthen non-oil revenue and enhanced expenditure
control.



We have solidified the early gains in public financial management and oil sector
governance started under the HIPC process through sustained observance of
continuous structural benchmarks. The strategic study of the oil sector and the audit
of the arrears of restructured public enterprises have also been completed. In sum, we
observed all structural benchmarks through end-September.
III.

THE PROGRAM FOR 2010–11

4.
Over the next year or so, we will maintain the broad thrust of macroeconomic policies
aimed at fostering future growth with low inflation, while saving a portion of oil revenues for
future generations. Structural policies will aim to solidify gains to date in public financial
management and oil sector governance, and ensure that public investment financed by oil
wealth is growth enhancing and poverty reducing.
A. Fiscal Policy
5.
From end-2008 through June 2010 our fiscal policy entailed a period of sharply
frontloaded fiscal adjustment. However, we have recently needed to respond with increasing
public resources to the refugee crisis in the northern department of Likouala of the country
and a severe polio outbreak. The acceleration of expenditure in the third quarter of 2010 was
also due to higher infrastructure spending in what was an exceptionally good dry season
which allowed us to advance project implementation, and higher common charges resulting
in part from a move toward a pay-for-use billing system for some utilities which was not

31
envisioned in the program target. At the same time, higher spending was also incurred related
to the celebration of 50 years of independence held in August.
6.
Over the remainder of 2010, we will redouble our efforts, reining in public
expenditure while strengthening customs revenue and ensuring that dividends from profitable
public enterprises are collected. Our revised BNOPD for end-2010 of CFAF 663 billion
(34.7 percent of non-oil GDP) implies a consolidation of the fiscal position by about
1.3 percentage points of non-oil GDP relative to 2009. Such a target implies a fiscal
adjustment over the first two years of the program of over 9½ percent of GDP, which is
broadly equivalent to the total three-year adjustment envisioned in the original program. This
strong performance reduces the required adjustment over the course of the remainder of the
program and provides greater fiscal space for much needed investment given our higher level
of net foreign assets and somewhat stronger oil profile.
7.
Consequently, starting with the 2011 budget we plan to scale up public investment to
support non-oil activity, increase employment and reduce poverty while making sustained
progress toward our long run goal of becoming an emerging market. Given our recognized
capacity constraints and the macroeconomic risks to a rapid increase in capital spending, we
will target a BNOPD for March 2011 of CFAF 189 billion and an indicative target for end2011 of CFAF 753 billion (34.5 percent of non-oil GDP), adding slightly to the adjustment
achieved through end-2010. We plan to achieve this target by further efforts to strengthen
non-oil revenue collection and restraint of current expenditure to make space for a 37 percent
increase in domestically financed public investment, while continuing to save a large share of
oil revenue.
8.
Specifically, we plan to implement measures to strengthen non-oil revenue and
restrain current expenditure amounting to 4 percentage points of GDP.


We will raise non-oil revenue collection through measures to broaden the tax base
(payment of forestry and telecoms royalties to the treasury, taxation of transactions
related to public contracts); reduce exonerations; and improve administration, with
specific focus on improving customs appraisal and control. We envision an increase
of 19 percent in non-oil revenue compared to 2010, equivalent to an adjustment of
1 percentage point of non-oil GDP.



We will continue efforts begun in early 2009 to reduce current expenditure, focusing
on bringing transfers and spending on materials and supplies down from the high
levels experienced in 2010 due to one-off events. While the envisioned reduction
appears large relative to the high base of 2010 (2.9 percentage points of GDP relative
to 2010), we believe it is feasible when compared to end-2009.

9.
We will carry out the necessary domestically financed investment for growth and
poverty reduction—which is embodied within the 2011 budget envelope of CFAF 800

32
billion—taking into account absorptive capacity. We will also seek out additional non-oil
revenue sources which may become available. However, if new revenue sources fail to
materialize, we will cap domestically financed capital expenditure (excluding HIPC funds) at
CFAF 650 billion in 2011. This envelope is sufficiently ample to allow execution of all
projects currently in train and new priority projects contained in the 2011 budget. To achieve
this target we will:


impose strict measures to ensure project quality. We will focus on fully
implementing the reforms aimed at strengthening investment quality put in place as
part of the HIPC process, starting with re-enforcing budget execution procedures and
controls at the commitment stage of the expenditure chain. Beginning with the
appraisal process, we will ensure that all projects have a feasibility study and are
aligned with the MTEF. We will also complement competitive bidding under the
procurement code with increased coordination among agencies involved in the
investment process, and prepare a procurement plan for 2011 with quarterly
monitoring reports, in collaboration with the World Bank.

In the event that these measures are insufficient, we are committed to taking further measures
to delay projects of lower priority to ensure we stay within the CFAF 650 billion cap on
domestically financed capital expenditure.
B. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
10.
Congo is a member of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community
(CEMAC), which has a regional central bank (BEAC) and a fixed exchange rate of
CFAF 659 per euro since 1994. BEAC projects broad money growth for Congo of about
14 percent for 2010, consistent with the continued financial deepening of the Congolese
economy.
11.
To increase the growth of credit to the private sector, we are implementing a financial
sector reform strategy drafted with the assistance of Fund staff. This strategy provides a
roadmap and a timetable of actions, which we are moving forward with in consultation with
the private sector. In the period ahead, reforms will focus on facilitating access to credit,
especially for small businesses and households, through fostering competition, removing
interest rate ceilings and increasing transparency regarding loan offerings.
C. External Sector Policies
12.
The government will continue its policy of financing development mainly through its
own resources, and will seek grants and foreign assistance only on highly concessional terms
(with a minimum grant element of 35 percent). It will continue to use best efforts to conclude
agreements with bilateral creditors and good faith efforts to obtain comparable treatment
from remaining commercial creditors, including those under litigation.

33
D. Structural Policies
13.
The policies which we aim to pursue over the coming years in our quest to attain
emerging market status will be laid out in our long-term National Development Plan
(NDP 2011–25) and growth, employment and poverty reduction strategy (second generation
PRS, 2011–16) which are currently under preparation. A key pillar of our strategy is to
support economic diversification through improvements to the business climate, while
solidifying gains in PFM, governance and transparency. Guided by our newly adopted Action
Plan to Improve the Business Climate, we have established a Council for Public-Private
dialogue to deepen the government’s understanding of the concerns of the private sector, and
over the near term will work to (i) strengthen investment security, (ii) simplify the taxation
system and (iii) resolve issues related to land use, including long-term leasing.
E. Program Monitoring
14.
Over the remainder of 2010 and 2011, the program will be monitored through reviews
based on biannual quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2010 and end-March
2011 (Table 1) and structural benchmarks (Table 2). Detailed definitions and reporting
requirements for all quantitative performance criteria and structural conditional are contained
in the accompanying Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU, Attachment II). The
authorities will make available to the Fund staff all core data, appropriately reconciled and on
a regular and timely basis, as specified in the TMU.
15.
The fifth and sixth (final) reviews under the ECF arrangement are expected to be
completed by end-June 2011 and end-September 2011, respectively.

APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT II
Technical Memorandum of Understanding
Brazzaville, December 20, 2010
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) describes the definitions that
are intended to clarify the measurement of the quantitative performance criteria and
indicators in Table 1 of the Letter of Intent (December 20, 2010) and the Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP, dated December 20, 2010) covering 2010–11. All
quantitative performance criteria and indicators for 2010 will be evaluated in terms of
cumulative flows from December 31, 2009, and all quantitative performance criteria and
indicators for 2011 will be evaluated in terms of cumulative flows from December 31, 2010.
Also, the TMU specifies the periodicity and deadlines for transmission of data to the staff of
the IMF for program monitoring purposes.
I. DEFINITIONS AND COMPUTATION
A. Government
2.
Unless otherwise indicated, government is defined as the central government of the
Republic of Congo and does not include local governments, the central bank, and any public
entity with autonomous legal personality (i.e., wholly- or partially-owned state enterprises)
not currently covered by the government’s consolidated financial operations table (tableau
des opérations financières de l’Etat—TOFE).
B. Basic Primary Fiscal Balance
3.
The scope of the government’s financial operations table (TOFE) includes the
general budget and the special accounts of the Treasury (including the forestry and road
funds) and the government debt management agency (Caisse Congolaise d’Amortissement,
CCA).
4.
The government’s non-oil basic primary fiscal balance is defined as total non-oil
revenue excluding grants and investment income (on the government’s accounts in the
central and commercial banks), minus total expenditure (including net lending), which is to
exclude transfers to Hydro Congo, interest payments on debt, externally-financed capital
expenditure, and capital expenditure financed by debt services savings under the enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. It is calculated from the budget execution
outturn reported every month in the TOFE prepared by the Ministry in charge of finance.

37
5.
The government’s total revenue is reported in the TOFE on a cash basis. It includes
all revenue collected by the Treasury (from tax and customs receipts, oil, services and
forestry), whether they result from past, current, or future obligations. Receipts also include
those recorded on a gross basis, in special accounts.
6.
Oil revenue is defined as the government’s net proceeds from the sale of oil,
including the provision for diversified investments, royalties paid by oil companies, and the
government’s share of excess and profit oil. It excludes all forms of prepayment and prefinancing. The oil revenue projections take account of the 45-day lag between the date of
shipment and the date of receipt of the sale proceeds by the Treasury.
7.
Expenditures are recorded on a payment order basis. They include current
expenditure, domestically-financed capital expenditure, foreign-financed capital expenditure,
and net lending. Current expenditures include expenditures on wages, goods and services,
common charges, interests on debt (domestic and external), transfers and subsidies, and other
current expenditures. Subsidies to the state-owned oil refinery, CORAF, are estimated on the
basis of the enterprises income statement.
8.
Pro-poor spending is defined in the budget on the basis of the functional
classification.
C. Net domestic financing of the central government
9.
Net domestic financing (NDF) of the central government is defined as the change in
the government’s net position (claims minus deposits at the BEAC and commercial banks) in
the banking system, which is elaborated in the table of Position Nette due Gouvernement
table (PNG). NDF also includes the change in the stock of Treasury bills and bonds issued by
the Congolese Treasury in CFA francs on the CEMAC regional market, when those
securities are established but exclude the change in the outstanding of IMF credits at the
BEAC (recours au credits due FMI) . At end-December 2009, NDF was assessed at -956.29
billion CFAF. For each test date, any adjustment by the BEAC to the data reported by
individual commercial banks, on account of their misclassification of government or for
other reasons, will be reported to the Fund.
D. Foreign Debt and External Arrears
10.
The definition of government used for the various external debt indicators includes
government, as defined in paragraph 2, public institutions of an administrative nature
(Etablissements Publics Administratifs), public institutions of a scientific and/or technical
nature, public institutions of a professional nature, public institutions of an industrial and/or
commercial nature (Entreprises Publiques d’Intérêt Commercial), and local governments,
with the sole exception of the national oil company (SNPC)—see paragraph 12 below.

38
11.
For the purposes of this memorandum, debt and concessional loans are defined as
follows:


As specified in the guidelines adopted by the Executive Board of the IMF,1 debt will
be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a
contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future
point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones
being as follows: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made
on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future
(including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and
temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under
which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts
where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until some time after the
date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e.,
arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right to use
for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total
expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property.
The debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments
expected to be made during the period of the agreement, excluding those payments
that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the property. Under the definition
of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from
the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are
debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this
definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.



Loan concessionality is assessed on the basis of the commercial interest reference
rates (CIRRs) established by the OECD. A loan is said to be on concessional terms if,
on the date of conclusion of the contract, the ratio of the net present value of the loan,
calculated on the basis of the reference interest rates, to its nominal value is less than
35 percent (i.e., a grant element of at least 35 percent).2 For debts with a maturity
exceeding 15 years, the ten-year reference interest rate published by the OECD is

1

See Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140) as amended by Decisions Nos. 11096-(95/100) and 12274(00/85), and 14416-(09/91), August 31, 2009, effective December 1, 2009.

http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/121809.pdf,, December 22, 2009.

39
used to calculate the grant element. For shorter maturities, the six-month market
reference rate is used.
The concessionality requirement applies not only to the central government, but also covers
debt incurred by public enterprises. The sole exception to this concessionality requirement is
the projected external loans to the Port Authority of Pointe Noire to support its rehabilitation
from the European Investment Bank in an amount up to euro 29 million, and from the
Central African States Development Bank in an amount up to euro 9.1 million.
12.
The quantitative indicative target with respect to external debt apply not only to debt
as defined in the above-mentioned guidelines, but also to commitments incurred or
guaranteed for which no value has yet been received or on which only partial drawings have
been made. However, this does not apply to financing from the IMF or to Treasury bills and
bonds issued by the Congolese Treasury in CFA francs on the CEMAC regional market.
13.
For external debt with an initial maturity of less than one year (a continuous
quantitative performance criterion), normal short-term import and export credit are excluded
from the scope of the indicator, including the prepayments.
14.
The ceiling on any new nonconcessional external debt with a maturity of more
than one year contracted or guaranteed by the SNPC, with or without government
guarantee, will be observed continuously. The SNPC may borrow only to finance
investments related to its core activities (research, exploration, production, refining and
distribution of oil, construction of a Brazzaville headquarters, creation and strengthening of
its database, etc.). In addition, these investments must be included in the SNPC’s investment
budget approved by its board of directors. The ceiling on debt does not apply to changes in
loan accounts with oilfield partners or to loans with maturities of less than one year.
15.
The accumulation by the government of external payment arrears is the difference
between (i) the gross amount of external debt service payments due (principal and interest,
including penalty and/or late interest, as appropriate) and (ii) the amount actually paid during
the period under consideration. Under the program, the government commits itself to not
accumulate external payment arrears on non-reschedulable debt (that is, debt to Paris Club
creditors contracted after the cutoff date and debt to multilateral creditors). Nonaccumulation of external payment arrears is an indicator to be continuously observed.
E. Oil-Collateralized External Debt and Oil Prepayments
16.
Oil-collateralized external debt is external debt which is contracted by giving an
interest in oil. Pre-financing is defined as an oil-collateralized loan which is repaid by the
sale of the oil in a different calendar year. New pre-financing by or on behalf of the
government is strictly prohibited under the program. The refinancing and/or deferral of the
existing stock and/or due dates are permitted but should not give rise to an augmentation of
the existing stock of oil-collateralized debt.

40
17.
A prepayment is defined as an advance payment by the purchaser of oil on a specific
oil shipment. Prepayment-related operations must be repaid within 6 months but in any case
within the calendar year in which they were contracted.
F. Payment Arrears and Domestic Debt
18.
Domestic payment arrears of the government are equivalent to the difference over the
period under review between the amount of payments authorized and the actual payments
made (within 90 days).
II. INFORMATION FOR PROGRAM MONITORING

The government will submit the following information to the staff of the IMF through
its Resident Representative, and within the time period specified below.

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts can not be added.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the assistance.
Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt
owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

IX. Safeguards Assessments:
The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of the
Central African States. The most recent safeguards assessment of the BEAC was
completed on July 6, 2009. The findings of this assessment indicate that implementation
of previous safeguards recommendations on financial reporting, internal audit, and
internal control has been limited, and that the changing risk profile of the BEAC foreign
exchange holdings requires further actions to strengthen safeguards at the BEAC.
Subsequent to revelation of Paris office fraud, a series of initial measures and longer term
safeguard measures were agreed between IMF and BEAC in order to continue with
country programs. In December 2009, BEAC adopted an action plan with the aim of
reforming its own governance, and strengthening key safeguards. While implementation
of the 2009 action plan is still in progress, BEAC adopted additional measures to address
the weaknesses highlighted by the first special audit.
X. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Congo’s currency is the CFA franc, which is pegged to the Euro at a fixed rate of
CFAF 655.957 = Euro 1. Congo does not impose any restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.
XI. Article IV Consultations:
Consultations with Congo are on a 24-month cycle, based on the Board decision on
consultation cycles in program countries. The 2008 consultation discussions and request
for a new three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement were held in
Brazzaville on May 21–30 and August 21–27, 2008. The staff report (www.imf.org) was
considered by the Executive Board on December 8, 2008.

Annex III
Republic of Congo—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of December 8, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The limited statistics
coverage and long delays in the provision of national accounts and balance of payments statistics are
particularly problematic. Since the occurrence of governance problems at the Bank of Central African States
(BEAC), timely delivery of financial sector data has been hampered. Poor coordination among different
governmental agencies is also an issue. Technical assistance has resulted in some progress but there is still need
to consolidate these gains and further strengthening of statistical capacities.
National Accounts: National accounts data is weak, with inconsistencies, both internally and with balance of
payments statistics. The Directorate General of Statistics (DGS) of the Ministry of Finance (MoF) provides
Fund missions with a breakdown of GDP by expenditures and sectors, both in nominal and real terms. In the
framework of moving to the SNA93 system of accounts, the DGS completed the national accounts estimates for
2005 (the new base year) and for 2006, with the assistance of the resident statistical expert and Central
AFRITAC. Authorities are currently working with the Central AFRITAC to revise the national accounts’
estimates back to 2000 and up to 2008. Annual data on employment in the central government are available
from the MoF, but are not consistent with data from the civil service roster of the Ministry of the Civil Service.
As part of the structural reforms undertaken in the context of the post-conflict program, the government
completed an audit of public service employees, but the two civil service’s databases are yet to be unified.
Price statistics: Movements in the prices of commodities consumed by households are recorded for the capital
city of Brazzaville and for Pointe Noire—the second largest city. Data are compiled on a monthly basis.
Starting August 2010, the authorities introduced a new CPI measure with new weights and a new composition
of the basket of good and service. This new CPI is harmonized with that of other countries in the Central
African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC).

Government finance statistics (GFS): Progress is underway to increase the comprehensiveness of the data
through the adoption of systematic compilation practices and steps have been taken to computerize expenditure
chain accounting. The Caisse Congolaise d’Amortissement (CCA) produces comprehensive data on the
outstanding stock of external public debt, including arrears and their composition, together with detailed
projections on debt service due. These data are provided to Fund missions. However, the debt-stock data cannot
be reconciled with flow data in the balance of payments. The CCA also produces domestic debt data. Concerns
still exist with regard to the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary statistics. There is no centralized,
comprehensive database on the operations of public enterprises. However, some information has been made
available to Fund missions by individual enterprises. TOFE compilers do not have access to relevant financial
statements of the Société Nationale des Pétroles Congolais (SNPC), which carries out several operations on
behalf of the government (notably in the oil sector).

Monetary statistics: BEAC regularly reports monetary, interest rates, and exchange rate statistics for
publication in IFS, but delays occur sometimes in the submission of data to STA. In 2007, the BEAC started a
project to migrate monetary statistics of member countries of the CEMAC to the methodology in the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). As a part of this project, a regional workshop was organized by the
BEAC in December 2007 to finalize the mapping of source data from commercial banks to the MFSM concepts
and framework. STA participated in this workshop to provide guidance and advice. Submission of data by the
BEAC using the standardized report forms is pending. Following governance issues occurred in 2009 at the
BEAC data delivery on financial system indicators has been hampered.

9
The accuracy of national monetary statistics may be affected by large cross-border movements of BEAC issued
banknotes among CEMAC member countries. However, the Republic of Congo is moderately affected by such
movements: 6.2 percent of banknotes issued in the Republic of Congo by the BEAC national directorate
circulate in Cameroon and 1.2 percent in Gabon, while currency in circulation in the Republic of Congo
includes 2.3 percent of banknotes from Cameroon and 3.2 percent from Gabon. The magnitude of banknote
movements between the Republic of Congo and CEMAC member countries other than Cameroon and Gabon is
very small.

Balance of payments: Although BEAC produces balance of payments data, delays occur and data suffers from
significant inconsistencies with other datasets. The opacity surrounding certain transactions in the oil sector
introduces an extra layer of imprecision. In addition, net investment flows are overestimated by significant
unrecorded disinvestment operations that are part of the tax regime arrangements obtained by nonresident oildrilling companies. Balance of payments data for 1995 through 2005 are published in the Fund’s International
Financial Statistics (IFS), and STA is working with the authorities in updating the data series. In February 2007,
a follow-up STA balance of payments statistics mission made a number of recommendations aimed at
improving institutional arrangements for balance of payments statistics compilation and validation. Progress in
this regard has been slow, consequently delaying the process for finalizing BOP data for 2005–08.

II. Data Standards and Quality
The Republic of Congo participates in the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since November
5, 2003. However, the metadata posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) has
not been updated or certified since 2003.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA
The Republic of Congo has reported (in September 2008) GFS data to STA for fiscal years 2004 and 2005
using the GFSM 2001 template—data for 2006 and 2007 has experienced delays. High-frequency fiscal data
has not yet been reported for publication in IFS. The compilation of GFS statistics to be reported to the Fund
should be carried out in close cooperation with the division in charge of TOFE statistics.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Congo
On January 19, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Congo.1
Background
Economic performance remained robust throughout the global downturn and shows
signs of further strengthening. Despite the massive terms of trade shock experienced in
2009, real economic activity expanded by 7½ percent supported by rising oil production
and sustained non-oil activity in construction, telecommunications and transportation.
Inflation fell below the Communauté Economique et Monétaire des Etats d’Afrique
Centrale (CEMAC) convergence criteria of 3 percent, reflecting falling food and fuel
prices over the course of 2009 and the strength of the euro to which the CFA franc is
pegged. Indicators point to an acceleration of activity in 2010, accompanied by a tick up
in inflation as transportation bottlenecks tighten.
In 2010, the external position improved significantly, as fiscal surpluses raised official
foreign assets and Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt relief significantly
reduced external liabilities. With the recovery in oil prices and rising oil production, the
current account turned toward surplus, while the real effective exchange rate rebounded
in the second half of year as the euro strengthened vis-à-vis the US dollar.
Fiscal consolidation from end-2008 through June 2010 progressed somewhat faster than
envisioned at the time of the last Article IV consultation, owing to stepped up efforts to
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up
can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
raise non-oil revenue and reduce current expenditure. As a result, the basic non-oil
primary deficit declined by 8½ percentage points of non-oil GDP in 2009. Consolidation
continued in the first half of 2010, with revenue over performance and under execution of
capital projects more than offsetting a pick up in current expenditure.
The underdeveloped financial system was unscathed by the global financial turmoil, and
appears generally sound. While liquidity in the domestic market remains ample, credit to
the economy remains low at around 4 percent of GDP.
Looking ahead, with oil expected to peak in 2011, non-oil activity is expected to
accelerate over the medium term to double digits from a low base as public investment in
basic infrastructure eases transportation and energy bottlenecks. Inflation would remain
elevated over the near term, as rising domestic demand strains limited railway capacity,
but fall as transport infrastructure is completed. The current account would remain in
surplus, but decline over time as oil exports wane, while the net external debt ratio would
decline appreciably as gross foreign assets accumulate. Downside risks include oil price
volatility and uncertainties regarding the efficiency of public investment in raising future
growth, while new oil discoveries represent an upside risk.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Congolese authorities for the continued satisfactory
implementation of their program supported by an Extended Credit Facility (ECF). As a
result of the sustained implementation of prudent policies, macroeconomic stability is
now well established and the external position has improved markedly, while structural
reforms have moved ahead. Directors noted that Congo’s medium-term economic
outlook is favorable, provided that public investment and measures to improve the
business climate are successful in raising non-oil growth. Significant challenges remain
and strong efforts will continue to be needed to increase private sector participation in
the economy and accelerate poverty reduction.
Directors praised the authorities for the significant fiscal consolidation achieved since the
program’s approval in December 2008, which provides space for much needed
infrastructure spending. At the same time, they cautioned against mounting current
spending pressures and called on the authorities to strike an appropriate balance
between scaling up capital spending, long-term fiscal sustainability, and enhancing the
level and effectiveness of priority social spending. Directors underscored that fiscal
sustainability requires continued consolidation efforts, including measures to collect
additional non-oil revenue, reining in non-priority spending, improving expenditure
efficiency with stronger quality controls, and further strengthening oil wealth
management, including by accelerating progress toward full compliance with the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
Directors emphasized the importance of strong public financial management for the
successful implementation of the authorities’ 2011 fiscal program. They saw significant
scope for improving budget control and strengthening the treasury and accounting of
fiscal operations. They encouraged the authorities to work closely with development
partners to implement the mechanisms put in place during the HIPC process for

3
strengthening the management of public investment, in particular project prioritization,
appraisal, and monitoring.
Directors concurred that promoting private sector development is key to reducing oil
dependence and assuring sustained poverty-reducing growth. As a complement to
scaling up public investment, they encouraged the authorities to take prompt action to
improve the business climate by frontloading the implementation of key measures of the
recently-adopted Action Plan. These efforts should be supported by policies to increase
the private sector’s access to credit, deepen financial intermediation, and raise the
operating and financial performance of state-owned enterprises.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth Review Under the Republic of Congo’s ECF
Arrangement and Approves US$1.9 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fourth
review of the Republic of Congo’s economic performance under a program supported by the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The Board’s decision enables the immediate disbursement of
an amount of SDR 1.2 million (about US$1.9 million), bringing total disbursements under
the ECF to The Republic of Congo to SDR 6.0 million (about US$9.4 million).
At the conclusion of the Executive Board's discussion on the Republic of Congo,
Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Congo has weathered the global downturn well, supported by prudent macroeconomic
policies under the ECF arrangement with the Fund. Economic activity has remained robust,
buoyed by rising oil production and sustained non-oil growth in construction, telecoms, and
transport. Inflation has declined to low single digits. The external position has improved
significantly, as fiscal surpluses have raised official foreign assets and HIPC debt relief
significantly reduced external liabilities. The outlook is favorable provided that non-oil sector
activity accelerates on the back of improvements in basic infrastructure and the business
climate.
“Significant fiscal consolidation has provided space for much needed infrastructure spending.
Given the risks of mounting current spending pressures, an appropriate balance should be
struck between scaling up public expenditure and macroeconomic stability. Over the medium
term, fiscal sustainability requires continued consolidation efforts, including implementation
of measures to collect additional non-oil revenue, reining in non-priority spending, enforcing
quality control to improve expenditure efficiency, and further strengthening oil wealth
management.
“Good progress has been made on structural reforms in the areas of public financial
management and the management of oil wealth. The reform agenda should now focus on

2

addressing weaknesses in budgetary control and treasury operations. The authorities’ plans to
safeguard public investment quality by fully implementing the mechanisms elaborated in the
context of the HIPC process are welcome. In particular, measures aimed at improving the
project appraisal process, reinforcing budget execution, monitoring, and control, and
increasing coordination among public agencies, are all important steps in the right direction.
“To support non-oil growth and to durably reduce poverty, further efforts are needed to
increase private sector participation, enhance the financial performance of state-owned
enterprises, and deepen financial intermediation. As a complement to scaling up public
investment, it will be important to swiftly implement key measures of the recently-adopted
Action Plan to improve the business climate in close collaboration with development
partners,” Mr. Shinohara added.

Statement by Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director for the Republic of Congo
January 19, 2011

INTRODUCTION

I would like to thank Management and Staff for their continuous support to my Congolese
authorities, and for the valuable policy advice and assistance provided over the years. My
authorities would like to reiterate their firm commitment to the policies under the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF), and they remain determined to reaching their objectives as set out in
the program i.e., stabilizing the economy, consolidating the budget, and raising growth to
higher and more sustainable levels. Consistently with Congo’s PRSP, another key objective
of the program is to fight poverty more efficiently and increase employment opportunities,
particularly among the youth.
Performance under the ECF-supported program continues to be satisfactory with all end-June
2010 quantitative performance criteria and structural benchmarks met. In particular, steady
progress continues to be made in improving governance in the oil sector through the
observance of all related structural benchmarks.
Macroeconomic performance was also strong in 2010 despite the difficult global
environment and volatile oil prices. While oil continues to be the country’s main engine of
growth, the non-oil sector’s contribution to real GDP is increasing. Also in 2010, fiscal
consolidation has accelerated despite the pressure that was put on the budget due —in part—
to events outside the authorities’ control i.e., a refugee crisis and a polio outbreak.
Concerned about the need to better spread the benefits of growth to the most vulnerable
segments of the population, and to create a better economic environment conducive to private
sector-led growth, my authorities have embarked on a scaling up of pro-poor investment in
infrastructure. However, they would like to assure Directors that they will take all necessary
measures to avoid associated risks, including through a capping of the total amount of capital
spending projected in 2011 and imposing strict measures to ensure project quality.
In their efforts to close the country’s large infrastructure gap, my authorities will finance the
bulk of their investment through domestic resources and will seek grants and foreign
assistance only on highly concessional terms. They would like to express anew their gratitude
to the international community and to the IMF in particular, for the debt relief granted under
the HIPC and MDRI initiatives. The fiscal space created following the reaching of the HIPC
completion point and the important resources freed will continue to be used to improve the
situation of social sectors, in particular the health and education sectors where they are aware
that significant progress still needs to be made.

2
II.

POLICIES UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY
1. Fiscal Policy

My authorities have continued their fiscal consolidation efforts in 2010, reducing the basic
non-oil primary balance to approximately 34 percent of GDP, down 10 points from 2008
(44 percent). They are in a good position to achieving this year the total fiscal consolidation
that was targeted for the whole period of the three-year arrangement at the time of its
approval by the Board, thereby providing additional fiscal space for needed infrastructure
investment. As a result of their accelerated consolidation efforts, my authorities plan to scaleup public investment in 2011 in order to ease notably transport and electricity bottlenecks,
and therefore help support non-oil activity and accelerate economic diversification.
However, they are mindful of the country’s capacity constraints and the macroeconomic risks
associated with a rapid increase in capital spending, including potential inflation and fiscal
sustainability risks. Thus, they plan to further strengthen non-oil revenue collection and
restrain current expenditure to make space for the projected 37 percent increase in
domestically-financed public investment in 2011. Non-oil revenue collection will also be
reinforced through measures to broaden the tax base, reducing exonerations, and improving
tax administration.
As regards outlays, the higher level of expenditure in the second part of 2010 was due to the
urgent need to respond to the refugee crisis in the northern department of Likouala, and a
severe polio outbreak, as well as higher spending related to the celebration of the 50 years of
independence. At the same time, my authorities took advantage of an exceptionally good dry
season to advance a number of infrastructure projects. I would like to add that my authorities
remain committed to the objective of reducing non-priority spending, and efforts to reduce
current outlays will be further strengthened focusing primarily on bringing transfers and
spending on materials and supplies down from the high levels attained in 2010. However,
should revenues fail to materialize, domestically-financed capital expenditure will be capped
at CFAF 650 billion in 2011, and projects of lower priority will be delayed. My authorities
will also focus on imposing strict measures to ensure project quality. In particular, they will
ensure that all projects have a feasibility study and are aligned with the medium-term
expenditure framework.
2. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
Congo being a member of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community
(CEMAC) follows a regional monetary policy, with an exchange rate pegged to the Euro.
This has served the country well and has been an anchor for macroeconomic stability.
In the banking sector, despite renewed competition with the opening of two new banks in
Brazzaville and abundant liquidity, credit to the private sector remains weak. To improve the
private sector’s access to credit, my authorities are currently implementing a financial sector
reform strategy which was drafted with IMF assistance. More specifically, the reform will

3
focus on facilitating access to credit for small businesses and households, removing interest
rates ceilings to further enhance competition, and increasing transparency in the offering of
loans.
3. Structural Reforms
One of the key objectives of Congo’s PRSP and its Fund-supported program is to accelerate
the diversification of the economy away from the main reliance on finite oil. To this end,
Congo’s authorities will pursue their efforts to improve the business climate. Through the
newly adopted Action Plan to Improve the Business Climate, they have established a council
for public-private dialogue to deepen the government’s understanding of the concerns of the
private sector. They will work in the near-term to strengthen investment security, simplify
the taxation system, and resolve issues related to land uses, including long-term leasing.
III. CONCLUSION
I would like to reiterate my authorities’ firm commitment to the policies and objectives set
under the Fund-supported program. On their behalf, I would like to request Executive
Directors’ support for the completion of the fourth review under the ECF and the
modification of a performance criterion—the basic non-oil primary balance target for endDecember 2010—that had to be revised as a result, in part, of unforeseen events as explained
above.
