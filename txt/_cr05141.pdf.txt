EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
State of the Economy
Singapore’s economy has recovered rapidly since mid-2003, having weathered a series of
adverse shocks since the Asian crisis. Lately, job creation has gathered strength. This
turnaround owes much to a favorable external environment, supportive macroeconomic
policies, and continued structural reforms. Inflation has crept up, but remains contained. With
the softening in global demand, particularly the cresting of the world electronic cycle, growth
could slow to about 4 percent in 2005, close to potential. There are risks to this outlook,
especially on the external front.
Policy Stance
With the improvement in economic conditions, both monetary and fiscal policies have
focused on orderly and gradual withdrawal of the stimulus provided in the recent past.
Discussions
Against this background, policy discussions centered on the appropriate stance in the
uncertain environment to support growth while keeping inflationary pressures under check.
On the structural front, the discussion focused on assessing progress on planned reforms and
the direction of new initiatives to enhance Singapore’s competitiveness.
•

The current tightening of monetary policy is appropriate as there is little slack in the
economy. The labor market has tightened and real wages are set to rise. This, along
with high energy prices, could push up inflationary pressures moderately. However, if
the slowdown appears to be more severe, then monetary policy may need to become
supportive. This year’s higher-than-expected growth has provided room to cut the
personal income tax rate and further strengthen the existing social safety net in next
year’s budget.

•

Medium-term prospects depend on the strength of new engines of growth in the face
of competition from regional economies. A wide range of structural reforms is being
implemented to enable new sources of growth to take hold. The government is
negotiating bilateral free-trade agreements with neighboring countries. Several
schemes have been put in place to retrain and upgrade skills of the unemployed in
response to the rise in long-term unemployment.

•

The financial sector remains robust. Bank profitability and capitalization are strong.
Progress has been made in implementing many of the FSSA recommendations.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
In last few years, Singapore’s economy has been hard hit by a series of external
shocks. These shocks—the Asian crisis, the bursting of the technology bubble, and the SARS
outbreak in 2003—have disrupted an economic

Competitive pressures from regional low-cost
1975 1979 1983 1987 1991 1995 1999 2003
economies have pushed Singapore’s
manufacturing sector to restructure and
diversify. The services industry is also undergoing changes. Partly reflecting this
restructuring, the unemployment rate has remained above its historical average, despite the
recovery.

3.
To facilitate an orderly adjustment to these changes, a wide range of structural
reforms has been undertaken in the past few years. These reforms include changing the
tax system to reduce business costs; increasing wage and labor market flexibility; liberalizing
the banking, telecom, and utility sectors; enhancing the financial regulatory and supervisory
framework; and negotiating free-trade agreements with major trading partners.
4.
Amidst these economic changes, last August the country witnessed its second
leadership transition since independence. Lee Hsien Loong, son of independence leader
Lee Kuan Yew, became the new Prime Minister. He retained the finance portfolio, but was
replaced by former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong as the head of the Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS). The new cabinet contains few changes, signaling policy continuity. The
ruling People’s Action Party, in power since independence, remains firmly in control with an
overwhelming majority in Parliament.
5.
In recent years, the Executive Board has broadly endorsed the government’s
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. The authorities’ pragmatic use of
countercyclical policies over the past few years has been supported by the Board. The MAS
has implemented many of the recommendations of the FSSA that was concluded last April,
and has taken steps to enhance the transparency of the monetary policy framework. While
endorsing the government’s structural reform agenda, the Board noted that the divestment of
the government-linked companies (GLCs) has been somewhat gradual. On certain other
issues, the authorities’ views have diverged from those of the staff and the Board. For
example, on fiscal policy, the authorities have proceeded more cautiously to expand the

-5-

social safety net despite large reserves. This partly reflects their concerns over the
vulnerability of the economy to a dilution of investor confidence, if such measures were
viewed as large liabilities constraining the government’s ability to strengthen Singapore’s
competitiveness in the future.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
6.
The frenetic pace of the recent
recovery has now begun to slow. The
recovery—mainly driven by exports, reflecting
strong global electronics demand, and since
early 2004 supported by domestic
investment—delivered an unprecedented four
straight quarters of double-digit growth from
Q3 2003 to Q2 2004. In Q3 and Q4 2004, the
pace slackened markedly as electronics exports
and consumption slowed. For the year, growth
is expected to reach around 8 percent in 2004,
recovering from 1.1 percent in 2003.
7.
Over the recovery, employment
growth increasingly gathered strength. The
unemployment rate has fallen from its 17-year
high of 5½ percent in Q3 2003 to 3½ percent in
Q3 2004, but still remains above its historical
average of around 2 percent. Construction job
losses have continued as the sector has
remained on a declining trend that began in
1999. Long-term unemployment among the
unskilled has also emerged. Rapid productivity
growth has so far outstripped real wage
increases, resulting in a substantial decline in
labor cost. The National Wages Council, made
up of representatives from employers, the
unions, and the government, has recommended
moderate wage increases for 2004/05, the first
proposed rise in three years.

The corporate and financial sectors remain strong. The corporate sector is
profitable with low debt-to-equity ratios. Domestic banks are well capitalized with rising
non-interest earnings and low nonperforming loans. With ample liquidity, bank lending has
risen since mid-2003 mainly due to growing household credit. However, growth in corporate
credit has been anemic, with firms relying on internal savings and bond issues to finance
investments. Stock prices have risen in line with regional trends and new issuance of equity
has increased. The property price deflation appears to be bottoming out.
Household credit has driven bank loan growth.

Nonperforming loans are low by regional

On the policy front, the MAS announced a modest and gradual tightening of its
monetary stance in April, and maintained this position in last October’s policy review.
Operationally, the MAS shifted the “zero appreciation” path of the nominal effective

exchange rate (NEER) adopted in mid-2001 to a modest and gradual appreciation, citing a
firming up of inflationary pressures.1 After having depreciated by 6½ percent since 2001, the
NEER (as calculated by IMF) appreciated modestly in Q3 2004, but reverted to its pre-April
announcement level toward end-2004. The yield curve has flattened and the SGD-USD

The current fiscal stance is broadly neutral.2 Last year, the fiscal surplus was over
6 percent of GDP, higher than expected due to lower-than-budgeted capital spending. This
year’s budget also plans on large capital spending, which combined with an increase in the
GST rate, aims at keeping the fiscal stance neutral.
III. ECONOMIC PROSPECTS AND RISKS
13.
Looking ahead, staff expects activity to moderate to more sustainable levels in
the near term. The softening in global demand, particularly the cresting of the world
electronic cycle, could slow GDP growth to about 4 percent in 2005. Leading indicators such
as purchasing managers’ index (PMI) also point in this direction. Domestic demand will play
a larger contributory role, including through a restocking of inventories, which were depleted
in the recovery. Despite the moderation in activity, there is likely to be very little slack in the
economy going forward, reflecting the recent rapid growth. With the labor market tightening,
real wages are also set to rise to catch up with the productivity gains. These factors, along
with high energy prices, will raise inflationary pressures. Under the present monetary stance,
however, inflation should remain within 2 percent. As export growth slows and investment
increases, the current account surplus should narrow.

Singapore’s monetary policy is based on the management of a trade-weighted exchange rate within an
undisclosed band, with the primary objective of maintaining price stability.

This outlook is subject to some
uncertainty, especially on the external
front. Much will depend on how world
demand reacts to the volatility in oil prices, on
the extent of the downturn in the global
electronics cycle, and on the level of activity
in China.3 Geopolitical tensions and security
threats also pose risks. If these risk factors
materialize, growth could be lower.
Nevertheless, given Singapore’s strong
external and fiscal positions and resilient
financial system the risk of a crisis is low
(Table 5).4 On the domestic front, recent
employment gains and sizeable cyclical
increases in corporate profits could portend
stronger consumption and investment growth.

On current forecast, global semiconductor sales are expected to remain flat in 2005 after growing by nearly
30 percent in 2004. GDP growth in US, the Euro area, and China are also expected to fall. Estimates suggest
that a 10 percent decline in the semi-conductor sales growth can reduce GDP growth by 1 percentage point.
Exposure to U.S. demand is large. Direct exposure to China has grown in recent years, but is still relatively
modest. However, the combined exposure to Indonesia, Malaysia, and Hong Kong SAR—economies that are in
turn affected by activity in China—is significant.

Public finances have been in surplus for the last two decades, and the government has accumulated a
substantial net asset position, estimated at about 120 percent of GDP at end-March 2004. Singapore does not
have any external public debt. The outlook for the fiscal and external current account position remains
favorable.

- 10 -

15.
The medium-term outlook hinges on how effective recent reforms will be in
establishing new areas of growth. In response to increasing competition from low-cost
regional economies, the authorities have undertaken a wide range of reforms to diversify the
economy and make it more competitive. The manufacturing sector is moving up the quality
ladder, market share of electronics exports has increased, and new industries, such as
pharmaceuticals, are expanding rapidly (Box 1). Singapore’s role as an international hub for
goods and services is also expanding, with

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
16.
Policy discussions took place against the backdrop of improved economic
conditions and substantial progress on structural reforms. The authorities agreed with the
staff’s assessment of near-term uncertainties, and added disorderly adjustment to the global
current-account imbalance to the list of risk factors. Discussions, thus, centered on the
appropriate policy stance in this uncertain environment to support growth while keeping
inflationary pressures under check. On the structural front, the discussions focused on
assessing progress on planned reforms and their early impact, and the direction of new
initiatives to further enhance Singapore’s competitiveness.

BOX 1. IS SINGAPORE MOVING UP THE QUALITY LADDER?1
With increased competition from low wage countries in the region, Singapore is searching for
different ways to stay competitive. It is more difficult for advanced economies like Singapore to
compete on wages, and since they are probably already close to the technology frontier in many
products, large productivity improvements are likely to be infrequent. One avenue, which Singapore
has successfully followed, is to diversify its production into technologically advanced industries, like
bio-chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Another way, which is a little harder to identify, is to upgrade the
quality of products in existing industries. Although less attention has been directed at quality
upgrading, it remains an important means of maintaining competitive edge.
Measuring quality differences in products is generally difficult. One approach is to use differences in
prices as an indicator of quality differences. This approach is feasible provided data is sufficiently
disaggregated such that one is comparing like with like. If this is the case, then price differences
indeed pick up quality differences rather than simply compositional differences. The U.S. provides
highly disaggregated bilateral trade data, which for some countries includes more than 10,000
products for any given year. We assume that

The quality gap has increased relative to its low-wage competitors. Relative to China, this has
increased from 70 percent in 1989 to 110 percent in 2003.

•

Although the average quality of Singapore’s products is still lower than that of Japan and the
U.K., the size of the quality gap has narrowed.

Thus, these results suggest that Singapore is successfully moving up the quality ladder. This is a very
encouraging sign for its future growth prospect. By differentiating its products from its low-wage
competitors, exports can continue to be a key driver of high growth rates in the period ahead.

A. Near-Term Policies: Treading a Cautious Path
17.
With little slack in the economy going forward, the staff supported MAS’s
announced monetary policy tightening. Although inflationary pressures were likely to be
moderate, the announced tightening would pave the way for an orderly and gradual
withdrawal of the stimulus provided in recent years to support growth. That said, in the
staff’s view, monetary policy needed to become more supportive, perhaps even ahead of the
scheduled policy review in April 2005, if the downside risks to the outlook became ominous.
The authorities responded that if the need arose they would change policy between the biannual reviews, as was done after September 11, 2001. They also noted that the band around
the target NEER path provided some room to accommodate unexpected developments in the
economy.5 The authorities did not consider a possible increase in exchange rate flexibility in
regional currencies, particularly in the renminbi, as complicating their monetary policy given
that they already use a trade-weighted exchange rate as an intermediate target.
18.
The mission welcomed MAS’s ongoing efforts to increase the transparency of its
monetary policy framework. These efforts have been well received by market participants
and have helped strengthen policy credibility. In recent years, MAS has published its
Monetary Policy Statement, and disseminated operational information and data on money
market transactions. Nevertheless, the trade-weighted exchange rate index and the policy
band, together with its central rate, are not published. The MAS has contended that this
deliberate “translucence” prevents the market from testing the trading band and allows them
to correct policy mistakes without severely disrupting the economy. This practice does not
appear to have impaired credibility, as evidenced by the low and stable inflation rate over
almost ten years, despite several large shocks to the economy during the period.
19.
The authorities and the mission discussed factors behind the surge in current
account surpluses in recent years, including the possibility of real exchange rate
misalignment. The current account surplus has more than doubled from around 14 percent of
GDP in 2000 to nearly 31 percent of GDP in 2003, although it is expected to moderate
somewhat this year. Despite the relatively small size of the Singapore economy, the absolute
level of these surpluses is significant. Over this period, the real exchange rate depreciated by
about 8 percent.

5

The MAS does not make explicit either its inflation or NEER targets, but past behavior suggests that monetary
policy is well approximated by a Taylor rule that puts 80 percent weight on the deviation of the 9–12 month
ahead expected inflation from a “target” inflation rate of 2 percent, and 20 percent weight on the output gap.
The appropriate level of the NEER is then set based on estimates of direct and indirect pass-through effects of
changes in the NEER on inflation and growth. Based on this analysis and the current outlook, staff estimates
that another 1–1½ percent appreciation of the NEER is needed to keep the 9–12 month ahead inflation under
2 percent. This appreciation will likely be spread over the next 3–6 months.

The MAS considered both the surge in the current account surplus and the
current level of the real exchange rate to be in line with fundamentals. They noted that
the spike in the current account surplus reflected households’ and the corporate sector’s
market-based response to the increased uncertainty in recent years. In response to adverse
external shocks to the Singapore economy, investment had been reduced domestically (by
over 18 percentage points of GDP) and increased abroad to take advantage of the relatively
better opportunities and higher returns overseas.6 Going forward, the authorities and the
mission agreed that the current account surplus was likely to decline as economic prospects
stabilized, but would remain fairly high given Singapore’s demographics.7 On the issue of
real exchange rate misalignment, the authorities pointed to the study published in its most
recent Macroeconomic Review, which found the REER to be broadly in line with its
equilibrium level.8
21.
The staff cautioned that the large current account surpluses was not fully
explained by private sector behavior. The government and GLCs are major contributors to
domestic savings, and how they allocate resources between domestic and foreign investment
is an important factor in the determination of the exchange rate. Their active investment
abroad may have alleviated upward pressures on the real exchange rate despite the high
current account surpluses. However, the staff noted that there were no perceptible signs of a

Much of Singapore’s high saving is undertaken by corporations (including those by GLCs) at around 25–
30 percent of GDP, partly reflecting the large share of profits in national income Central government saving has
averaged around 9 percent of GDP during this period. Household saving rate is comparable to international
levels at around 8–10 percent of GDP, of which net saving through the mandatory saving program (CPF)
accounts for only around 2½ percent of GDP.

strengthen the existing social safety net (such as
by increasing medical benefits to the elderly) in the FY2005/06 budget, without straining the
medium-term balanced budget objective. The authorities noted that several measures,
including strengthening social assistance, were under consideration.
24.
The authorities are seeking ways to fortify the automatic stabilizers to reduce
reliance on discretionary measures as a countercyclical tool. To this end, they are
considering changing the basis of tax assessment to current-year income from the existing
practice of previous-year income. The mission supported this change, but the authorities
noted that the reaction from corporates had not been positive in view of the perceived

- 15 -

increase in compliance costs. The authorities are also considering treating ex ante spending
limits on certain categories of spending and transfers more flexibly to improve their response
to cyclical changes.
25.
The government considers its high level of fiscal reserves to be a crucial factor
underlying the strong investor confidence in Singapore. If faced with competitive
pressures in the future, these reserves assure investors that the government has sufficient
funds to finance tax cuts and infrastructure spending. The reserves also provide a buffer
against rising health costs as the population ages. The mission observed that without
compromising this insurance need, the government could leverage its fiscal strength to
provide some additional assistance to the long-term unemployed and retirement benefits
targeted to low-income earners. The authorities, however, were unwilling to introduce any
entitlement program at this juncture and considered retraining and job-matching schemes that
improved employment opportunities to be better suited to provide social insurance. For the
medium term, the authorities intended to continue formulating policy within the existing
budgetary framework.9 The staff noted the merits of this rules-based system and suggested
that the present 50-percent limit on the use of yearly investment income, which appeared
somewhat arbitrary, could be reviewed against Singapore’s future revenue and spending
profiles. The authorities responded that while they were always seeking ways to improve the
fiscal framework, this limit was important to safeguard the reserves.
26.
The staff welcomed the first public review of Temasek’s operations—the
government holding company in charge of all SOEs (Box 2). The review indicates that
Temasek’s portfolio is well diversified across sectors and countries. Following Temasek’s
example, the staff suggested that the government could also consider publishing, without
disclosing sensitive details, the aggregate assets of Government of Singapore Investment
Corporation (GIC), the broad elements of its portfolio, and its overall returns. The
authorities, however, argued that GIC operations remained strategic and there was sufficient
internal oversight to ensure its proper functioning. They did not see any benefit of disclosing
the market value of GIC’s assets, since they were not burdened with debt and thus did not
need to build investor confidence on this front. They were also reluctant to compile
consolidated public sector accounts on the grounds that individual entities were audited under
Singapore law and their accounts were available publicly. The authorities agreed, in
principle, to participate in the fiscal ROSC exercise, but needed to better understand the
resource costs before committing to a timetable.

9

This framework (made up of both formal rules and established practice) calls for the government to maintain a
balanced budget over the election cycle. Any surplus over the cycle is transferred to the reserves, while deficits
can be financed by the reserves only with the consent of the President, who is elected independently of the
government. Within each year, the government can use only up to 50 percent of the investment income.

- 16 -

BOX 2. TEMASEK
The government of Singapore owns interests in various enterprises, both locally and abroad. These
investments have been managed by the government’s holding company Temasek, incorporated in 1974. It
manages a portfolio of about US$53 billion (55 percent of GDP) roughly equally divided between domestic
and foreign investments and spread across a wide range of industries, including holdings in local industry
leaders such as Singapore Airlines, Singtel, and DBS. Temasek companies (TCs) account for some 13 percent
of Singapore’s GDP. The holding company’s performance has been respectable with a total shareholder’s
return of 18 percent per annum over the past 30 years, although, partly due to the Asian crisis, returns have
been lower, 3 percent to 6 percent, in the last 5–10 years.
Temasek’s success stands out in contrast to the generally held view that state-controlled enterprises are
unprofitable and inefficient. Temasek attributes this

Notwithstanding this success, concerns have been
raised that the presence of TCs in certain sectors may
be hindering private participation. This is recognized in
the recently published Temasek’s charter which directs
it to divest its non-strategic holdings without, however,
setting a time frame. Several Temasek’s holdings are
also a legacy of state-led development policies of the
past. Nevertheless, a stronger commitment to exit from
sectors where the private sector can be an effective
alternative will help to dissipate concerns that TCs
crowd-out private entrepreneurship.1
While listed TCs are subject to the rules of disclosure
imposed by the Singapore Exchange, Temasek itself is
not listed and is not required to publish or disclose its
financial accounts. Thus, the recent publication of the
company’s charter and review represents a welcome
move toward greater transparency. In the coming years,
transparency will assume even greater importance as
Temasek expands its operations overseas.

B. Medium-Term Issues: Searching for New Engines of Growth
27.
The authorities underscored that economic prospects over the medium term
depended on the strength of new engines of growth. Regional economies, particularly
China and India, had been eroding Singapore’s traditional advantages by their increased
openness and low-cost structure. Thus, to “remake Singapore” in response to these
challenges, the government adopted the recommendations of the Economic Review
Committee (ERC) in 2003. The ERC recommended measures to enhance competitiveness,
promote private entrepreneurship, and facilitate economic diversification (Table 7). The
authorities explained that significant progress had been made to increase wage flexibility,
reduce business costs, and promote the outward expansion of domestic firms and Singapore
as a business hub.10 The mission noted that it would be important to evaluate the impact of
these reforms and review the need for new ones.
28.
The mission encouraged the authorities to accelerate their planned divestment of
GLCs. The government has been a major player in Singapore’s development, delivering a
remarkable economic transformation since the mid-1960s. Nevertheless, looking ahead, the
ERC envisioned a greater economic role for the private sector and recommended divesting
GLCs to provide room for entrepreneurship. In this regard, the authorities felt comfortable
with the present measured pace of divesting GLCs on a case-by-case basis. On a related
issue, some private sector observers expressed concern that competition may be stifled by the
extensive presence of GLCs in certain sectors of the economy. The authorities acknowledged
the presence of such an impression in some quarters, but stressed that effective firewalls
separated the legislative, regulatory, and participatory roles of the government. The staff
hoped that the newly legislated Competition Law would help allay to some of these concerns,
but urged the government to review sector-specific competitive conditions.
29.
Singapore has sought out new markets through bilateral free trade agreements
(FTAs) in recent years.11 The authorities explained that their bilateral FTAs (which they
considered to be consistent with WTO principles) were accelerating the momentum of trade
and investment liberalization, thereby strengthening the multilateral trade system. They also
ensured that their bilateral FTAs were not in conflict with multilateral and ASEAN-based
agreements.
30.
The authorities are refocusing the mandatory savings scheme (CPF) as a core
retirement scheme, rather than use it as a discretionary countercyclical instrument.
They noted that the increasing use of flexible wage contracts had reduced the need for
discretionary changes in employer contribution rates for countercyclical purposes. The
10

funds under a small number of asset
managers with simpler choices of risk-return portfolios. The government plans to align CPF
rates of return with long-term government security yields, which should improve the returns
on members’ balances over time.
31.
The authorities are concerned about the emergence of structural unemployment.
They noted that continued loss of low-end manufacturing jobs and the ongoing restructuring
toward capital intensive industries have increased long-term unemployment.13 With the
economy moving toward more knowledge-based activities, there is a growing danger that the
less-educated and less-skilled workers may find themselves permanently unemployed. The
authorities were addressing this problem through a wide range of retraining and skills
upgrading programs. A new government statutory board, the Workforce Development
Agency, was formed in 2003 to coordinate and strengthen these programs.
32.
The mission held extensive discussions on the regulatory challenges arising from
banks’ overseas expansion and the increase in asset management firms in Singapore.
The authorities noted that bank profitability and capitalization remained strong and that local
banks have responded to increased domestic competition with the expansion of foreign banks
by consolidating at home and expanding abroad (Box 3). The mission observed that the
expansion abroad could pose new risks and regulatory challenges. The authorities said that
12

Given the large share of wealth held in residential properties (over 90 percent of households are homeowners
with a total net wealth of over 150 percent of GDP), retirees in Singapore often face the dilemma of being
“asset rich, but cash poor.” Net household wealth held as equity in pension funds (including CPF) is around
65 percent of GDP. Overall, net wealth of households is around 350 percent of GDP, comparable to that in the
U.S. but less than that in Japan or in the U.K.
13

According to the authorities’ estimates, the natural rate of unemployment has been creeping up to around 3–
3½ percent in recent years from around 2 percent before the Asian crisis.

BOX 3. SINGAPORE: OVERSEAS EXPANSION OF DOMESTIC BANKS1
In recent years, bank activities in many emerging market economies have been progressively
liberalized. Financial reforms have eased legal barriers to entry, liberalized deposit and loan rates,
relaxed restrictions on bank portfolios and ownership, and reduced reserve requirements.

Interest Rate Margin

In Singapore, there has been a continuous process of financial reform and liberalization since the
1970s, and a major five-year program was launched in 1999 to liberalize access by foreign banks to
Singapore’s domestic market. This liberalization, together with the less benign post-Asian-crisis
macroeconomic environment, has challenged the traditionally highly profitable Singaporean banks.
Foreign banks have played an important role in compressing intermediation margins, especially in
certain segments, for example, mortgage lending. However, the banking sector remains concentrated.
The three local Singapore banks control

to the relative efficiency of Singapore’s
banks, which have the second lowest cost-to-income ratio in the region. Other advantages for the
Singapore’s banks in their expansion abroad have been a sound regulatory environment, high
capitalization, and low NPLs. Since 1999, Singapore banks have acquired interest in Malaysia, Hong
Kong SAR, Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia. (Temasek, which is a major shareholder of
Singapore’s largest domestic bank, DBS, has separately also acquired shares in Indian, Malaysian,
and Indonesian banks.) The performance of the overseas acquisitions so far has been mixed: with
successes in Hong Kong and Malaysia, and problems in Thailand and the Philippines. This pattern
has largely reflected local conditions rather than the efficiency of Singaporean banks.

The opening of Singapore’s domestic market to foreign competition and the expansion of Singapore’s
banks abroad pose new challenges for bank regulators. The growing presence of foreign banks raises
new supervisory issues—the objectives of the parent bank and the local institution may differ and
local regulators may lack important information about the parent bank’s financial stability. The
expansion of local banks into foreign countries with different market, legal, and regulatory
infrastructures also brings new risks—problems in their foreign ventures may threaten the stability of
the parent banks.
MAS is well aware of these risks and has been actively seeking cooperation with bank regulators in
countries hosting Singapore’s banks subsidiaries and in the home countries of the major foreign banks
active in Singapore.

The MAS has set up a unit to coordinate implementation of the FSSA
recommendations. Progress has been made, including in lowering the minimum capital
requirement for local banks from 12 percent to 10 percent, a step endorsed by the FSSA
(Table 8). The mission welcomed the advances and encouraged the authorities to clarify the
roles of the monetary authority and its accountability in the planned amendments to the MAS
Act. It also supported the introduction of a deposit insurance scheme, scheduled for 2005,
and encouraged the authorities to regularly update and publish financial soundness
indicators.14 Earlier this year, the MAS published the Financial Stability Review, a new biannual publication, which reiterated the overall soundness of Singapore’s financial sector.
The authorities intend to implement the Basel II standards in tandem with the G10 countries,
by end-2007. The FSSA had concluded that regulatory and supervisory practices were close
to international standards and codes, including in accounting standards, and that the
authorities had taken initiatives to improve corporate governance and strengthen the
framework of disclosure practices. Despite these efforts, the recent incident related to
speculative oil trading by a Singapore-listed subsidiary of an overseas company indicates that
there is room for further improvement in these areas.15
34.
The mission welcomed the authorities’ continued efforts to enhance data quality
and its timeliness. The authorities have published net international investment position (IIP)
data for 2001–2003. The mission welcomed this data release, but noted that the levels
appeared understated in light of Singapore’s large current account surpluses since the 1990s.
Officials remarked that this could reflect different market values of the portfolios of foreign
and resident investors. Singapore remains a destination, since the 1970s, of large foreign
investment, and only in the 1990s has outward foreign investment become substantial. In
addition, as the IIP surveys had been started recently, the sample may not be fully
representative. As the coverage of the surveys was widened the quality of the data would also

company sought bankruptcy protection after losing $550 million in speculative oil trading. With the loss more

improve. Indeed, the IIP positions have been revised upward recently. The officials
responded positively to staff suggestion of conducting a comprehensive review of the
statistical bases by participating in a data ROSC. The authorities are reviewing the modalities
and resource cost of the ROSC, before making a final decision.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Singapore’s economy has recovered rapidly since mid-2003, having weathered a
series of adverse shocks since the Asian crisis. Lately, job creation has also gathered
strength following large productivity gains in the earlier part of the recovery. This turnaround
owes much to a favorable external environment, including strong global electronics demand.
It was also helped by supportive macroeconomic policies as well as continued structural
reforms to improve competitiveness.
36.
Looking ahead, economic activity is expected to moderate to more sustainable
levels in the near term. Taking into account the softening in global demand, particularly the
cresting of the global electronic cycle, output growth could slow to about 4 percent in 2005.
The outlook is shrouded in considerable uncertainty, especially on the external front. Despite
the expected moderation in activity, however, there is likely to be little slack in the economy,
reflecting the recent rapid growth. The tightening in the labor market and high energy prices
could raise inflationary pressures.
37.
In this environment, the current tightening stance of monetary policy is
appropriate. This will also pave the way for an orderly and gradual withdrawal of the
stimulus provided in recent years to support the economy. However, if the slowdown appears
to be more than expected, monetary policy may need to become more supportive. MAS’s
monetary policy framework centered on the management of the trade-weighted exchange rate
has worked well to keep inflation low and stable. MAS’s ongoing efforts to increase the
transparency of the framework are commendable.
38.
There are no apparent signs of a real exchange rate misalignment, but the rise in
recent current account surpluses is not fully explained by private sector behavior.
Foreign investment by the government and GLCs could have played a part in warding off
upward pressures on the real exchange rate despite the rise in current account surpluses.
However, with the expected increase in domestic investment and the authorities’ intended
appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate, current account surpluses should narrow
in the near term. This will also aid in the orderly adjustment of the global current account
imbalances.
39.
Fiscal policy has been judiciously used in recent years to support the economy.
With the higher-than-expected growth, the fiscal position this year is likely to be better than
budgeted. Such an outturn would provide room for the authorities to cut the top personal
income tax rate in the next budget, and strengthen the existing social safety net. Singapore’s
fiscal-policy framework of maintaining a balanced budget over the medium term remains
appropriate, although the framework could be improved further by setting the limit on the use
of the annual investment income within the context of Singapore’s future revenue potential
and spending needs.

- 22 -

40.
The recent public review of Temasek’s operations is a significant milestone in
increasing fiscal transparency. Following Temasek’s example, the government could also
consider publishing, without disclosing strategic and sensitive details, GIC’s aggregate
assets, broad elements of its portfolio, and its overall returns. Such a move could further
enhance investor confidence by testifying to the strength of the government’s financial
position. More generally, publishing the consolidated public sector accounts, in line with
international accounting standards, would greatly help in this regard. The staff welcomes the
authorities’ interest in undertaking a fiscal ROSC in the near future.
41.
In response to rising competition from low-cost regional economies, the
authorities have implemented an array of reforms to enhance competitiveness. As a
result, significant progress has been made in increasing labor market and wage flexibility,
reducing business taxes and costs, and promoting the outward expansion of Singapore firms.
Moreover, quality upgrading and diversification in the manufacturing sector and Singapore’s
expansion into a hub for regional asset management, health, and education services are also
taking place. These developments will provide a new basis for sustained growth over the
medium term. Nevertheless, to promote entrepreneurship and increase the role of the private
sector, the staff encourages the authorities to step up the GLC divestment process. The newly
legislated Competition Law should help to strengthen the separation of the roles of the
government as a referee and a player in the economy.
42.
The authorities have rightly focused attention on the regulatory challenges
arising from banks’ overseas expansion. The financial system remains robust and benefits
from an efficient legal system, good accounting standards, and ongoing initiatives to promote
corporate governance, as noted in the FSSA. The authorities are encouraged to implement the
remaining FSSA recommendations, including clarifying the roles of the monetary authority
and its accountability in the planned amendments to the MAS Act. Recent events, related to
speculative trading by a listed company, suggest the need for increased regulatory vigilance
of companies trading in the Singapore exchange.
43.
Given the aging population, a key challenge is to ensure that the retired are
adequately provided for. Thus, the measures taken to refocus the CPF as a core retirement
scheme are welcome. Moreover, the increasing use of flexible wage contracts has reduced
the need for discretionary changes in contribution rates for countercyclical purposes. The
CPF investment scheme’s high transaction costs could be reduced by pooling funds under a
single or a small number of asset managers with simpler choices of risk-return portfolios,
which could allow a more extensive use of this scheme.
44.
Singapore is in observance of the SDDS and generally publishes economic and
financial data on a timely basis. The authorities’ continued efforts to improve data quality
are welcome. The staff encourages the authorities to consider a comprehensive review of the
statistical base by participating in a data ROSC.
45.
The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Singapore be
held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Singapore’s exchange rate regime is a managed floating system. The Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS) monitors its value against an undisclosed basket of currencies and intervenes in the market to
maintain this value within an undisclosed target band. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. As of
November 30, 2004, US$1=S$1.6417.
Singapore has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange
rate system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions.
Singapore maintains restrictions on Singapore-dollar credit facilities, and bond and equity issuance.
Singapore-dollar proceeds obtained by nonresident financial entities (such as banks, merchant banks,

ANNEX II

SINGAPORE—STATISTICAL ISSUES

Singapore provides data to the Fund generally on a timely basis and meets the SDDS
specifications for the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of the data, and for the
dissemination of advance release calendars. The authorities have continued to improve the
quality of data, including publishing more disaggregated data, but there are a number of
deficiencies in statistical practice, particularly in the external and fiscal areas.
•

In early 2003, the Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS) completed a rebasing of
the Singapore System of National Accounts to reference year 1995 from 1990. The
DOS also made improvements in data sources and methodology. One issue addressed
in this exercise was the treatment of a value-added tax, namely the Goods and
Services Tax (GST), introduced in April 1994. Also, a reconciliation of various
national accounts estimates was conducted, resulting in lower statistical
discrepancies, and work on further improvements, particularly with respect to
changes in inventories, is ongoing.

•

Merchandise trade statistics do not fully include trade with Indonesia, although trade
transactions with Indonesia are captured elsewhere in the current account of the
balance of payments. In January 2004, the authorities released some trade data with
Indonesia covering 2003. The authorities plan to publish additional information on
trade with Indonesia as part of their plans to accede to the Harmonized System
Convention of the World Customs Organization (WCO).

•

In December 2003, the DOS introduced a new reporting format for the BOP’s
services account that includes the standard services components (except
communication services), in line with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual (BPM5). Other goods and services receipts and payments, which are
substantial, used to be not disaggregated. The DOS used data from the Survey on
International Trade in Services (launched in 1996) as an additional source for the
compilation of more detailed services statistics.

•

Information on government assets held abroad is not published nor provided to the
Fund. Interest on these assets and debt service payments on domestic debt made from
the extrabudgetary Government Securities Fund are published on an annual basis, but
are not fully reflected in the fiscal position. More generally, data on the financial
position of the consolidated public sector are not published. Singapore has
nevertheless complied with the expanded SDDS requirements to include data on the
international investment position.

Annual balance of payments data are reported to STA each year. Since September 2004, data
on quarterly gross direct and portfolio investment inflows have been provided to STA
following the dissemination of such data from the Q1 2004 issue of the Quarterly Economic
Survey of Singapore.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with
Singapore
On February 7, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Singapore.1
Background
In recent years, Singapore’s economy has been hard hit by a series of external shocks.
These shocks—the Asian crisis, the bursting of the technology bubble, and the SARS outbreak
in 2003—disrupted an economic expansion largely uninterrupted since the 1970s. The shocks
have come at a time when Singapore is also facing increasing competition from regional lowcost economies. To facilitate an orderly adjustment to these changes, a wide range of structural
reforms has been undertaken in the past few years.
Aided by supportive macroeconomic policies and improved external conditions, Singapore’s
economy has recovered rapidly since mid-2003. Lately, job creation has also gathered strength.
The turnaround—mainly driven by exports, reflecting strong global electronics demand, and
since early 2004 supported by domestic investment—delivered an unprecedented four straight
quarters of double-digit growth from third-quarter 2003 through the second quarter of 2004.
Since then, the pace has slackened as electronics exports and domestic consumption slowed.
Despite this slowdown, GDP growth is expected to reach around 8 percent in 2004, recovering
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

from 1.1 percent in 2003. Inflation has crept up, but remains low. The current account surplus
has narrowed, reflecting higher imports as investment picked up.
With emerging inflationary pressures, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced a
modest and gradual tightening of its monetary stance in April 2004, and maintained this position
in last October’s policy review. After having depreciated by 6½ percent since 2001, the tradeweighted exchange rate index (as calculated by the IMF) appreciated by 1¼ percent in 2004,
although it moderated in the latter part of the year.
The current fiscal stance is broadly neutral. The fiscal surplus was over 6 percent of GDP in
FY2003, much higher than expected due to lower-than-budgeted capital spending. This year’s
budget also contains a large planned capital outlay, which, combined with an increase in the
goods and services tax rate, aims at keeping the fiscal stance broadly neutral. The budget also
includes several measures to support private enterprise and to attract investment, particularly in
the wealth management industry.
The financial sector remains robust. Bank profitability and capitalization are strong, and
nonperforming loans are low. Local banks have responded to increased domestic competition
with the entry of foreign players by consolidating at home and expanding abroad. In June 2004,
the minimum capital requirement for local banks was lowered from 12 percent to 10 percent.
An array of structural reforms has been undertaken in the past few years. In response to
increasing competition from low-cost regional economies, the government adopted the
recommendations of the Economic Review Committee (ERC) in 2003. The ERC recommended
measures to enhance competitiveness, promote private entrepreneurship, and facilitate
economic diversification. Significant progress has been made in implementing these
recommendations, such as increasing wage and labor market flexibility, reducing business
costs and taxes, and promoting the outward expansion of Singapore firms and Singapore as a
business hub.
Looking ahead, economic activity is expected to moderate to more sustainable levels in the
near term. Taking into account the softening in global demand, particularly the cresting of the
global electronic cycle, output growth could slow to about 4 percent in 2005. The outlook is
subject to some uncertainty, especially on the external front. Despite the expected moderation
in activity, however, there is likely to be little slack in the economy, reflecting the recent rapid
growth. The tightening in the labor market and high energy prices could raise inflationary
pressures. Over the medium term, IMF staff expects growth to average around 4-5 percent.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the Singapore economy’s strong turnaround since mid-2003,
which has owed much to a favorable external environment, supportive macroeconomic policies,
and continued structural reforms to diversify the economy and improve its competitiveness.
Directors considered that Singapore’s sustained fiscal surpluses, lack of external debt,
comfortable net asset position, healthy reserves, and large current account surpluses provided

-3-

a strong buffer against exogenous shocks. At the same time, they welcomed the authorities’
determination to resist complacency, and to continue to identify new sources of growth in an
increasingly challenging regional and global environment.
Directors observed that growth had begun to slow and was likely to return to more sustainable
levels as world demand softened. Given the little slack remaining in the economy following the
recent rebound, the moderation in activity could be helpful in restraining inflationary pressures
coming from tightened labor market conditions and higher energy prices.
Directors saw the current tightening stance of monetary policy as paving the way for an orderly
withdrawal of the stimulus provided in recent years. However, if the downside risks to growth—
especially from external factors—were to materialize, threatening a sharper deceleration than
expected, Directors considered that monetary policy might need to become more supportive.
Directors welcomed ongoing efforts to increase the transparency of the monetary policy
framework, which had been effective in keeping inflation low and stable. A few Directors
considered that releasing more detailed information about the government’s inflation target and
exchange rate policies would be helpful.
Directors agreed that the real exchange rate for the Singapore dollar appeared broadly
appropriate notwithstanding the large current account surpluses. It was observed that active
foreign investment by the government and the government-linked companies may have kept the
real exchange rate from appreciating. However, Directors considered that, as domestic
investment recovered from its recent low levels, the current account surpluses were likely to
narrow in the period ahead. Keeping exchange rate policy biased toward appreciation, together
with greater flexibility, would also help in this regard.
Directors commended the authorities’ use of fiscal policy in recent years to support the
economy, while adhering to the objective of a balanced operational budget over the medium
term. The prudent medium-term fiscal framework had resulted in a significant reserves
accumulation that had strengthened investor confidence. Some Directors suggested that the
strong fiscal position created scope for additional targeted social spending, particularly on the
elderly and the unemployed, and personal income tax reductions. Many Directors also
supported the authorities’ focus on retraining and job-matching schemes to address the
structural changes in the labor market and help reduce unemployment further.
Directors welcomed the recent public review of operations of Temasek, the government’s
investment holding company, as a milestone in enhancing fiscal transparency. Following this
example, they encouraged the authorities to consider publishing general information on the
Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), and to develop and disseminate
consolidated public sector accounts. Directors also encouraged the authorities to undertake a
fiscal Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) in the near future.
Directors supported the authorities’ implementation of structural reforms to enhance
competitiveness and sustain growth in the medium term. Significant progress had been made in
increasing labor market and wage flexibility and reducing business taxes and costs. Also

-4-

encouraging were the quality upgrading and diversification taking place in the manufacturing
sector, and the emergence of Singapore as a hub for regional asset management, health, and
education services. Directors welcomed the government’s adoption of the recommendations of
the Economic Review Committee, aimed at furthering research and development and
investment in human capital. Many Directors observed that a faster pace of divestment of those
government-linked companies not of strategic importance to the country would promote
entrepreneurship and the growth of the private sector. Others, however, agreed with the
authorities’ careful approach.
Directors viewed the financial system as robust, benefiting from an efficient legal system and
good accounting standards. They welcomed the authorities’ increasing attention to the
regulatory challenges arising from banks’ overseas expansion. They commended the progress
made in implementing the recommendations of the Financial System Stability Assessment
(FSSA), and looked forward to the timely operationalization of the remaining recommendations.
Directors noted that a key challenge of Singapore’s aging population was to ensure that the
retired are adequately provided for. Thus, they welcomed the recent measures to refocus the
Central Provident Fund (CPF) as a core retirement scheme. They recommended that, to make
participation in the CPF’s investment scheme more attractive, the scheme’s transaction costs
be reduced, by pooling funds under a smaller number of asset managers with simpler portfolio
choices.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued efforts to improve data quality, which they agreed
was broadly satisfactory for surveillance purposes. They encouraged the authorities to begin a
comprehensive review of the statistical base by participating in a data ROSC in the near future.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by the Singapore Authorities
February 7, 2005

Introduction
The Singapore authorities would like to thank the IMF staff for the 2004 Article IV
Consultation. The discussions with the staff on various issues pertaining to recent
developments and outlook of the Singapore economy, as well as longer-term structural
policies were useful and stimulating. The authorities also welcome the three interesting
studies contained in the Selected Issues paper, which provided the opportunity to explore
topical issues in greater depth. This statement provides an update on the latest economic
developments in Singapore and discusses some of the policy issues raised in the Staff Report.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
The Singapore economy has rebounded since mid-2003, underpinned by an upturn in
demand in key export markets, supportive macroeconomic policies and continued structural
reforms, which have strengthened the competitiveness of domestic businesses in international
markets. GDP growth reached a four-year high of 8.1 percent in 2004, boosted by doubledigit growth in the first half of the year. In the second half, GDP growth slowed to a more
moderate pace, with both manufacturing and services sectors recording weaker growth,
following above trend rates of expansion earlier in the year.
The strong economic rebound has in turn led to the creation of 66,200 jobs last year. As a
result, the unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent in Q4 2004, down from 4.6 percent as at
end-2003. Going forward, Singapore’s GDP is likely to grow at a more modest pace of
3-5 percent in 2005, reflecting expectations of weaker growth in the external economies and
the global IT industry.
Domestic inflationary pressures have been on the rise as a result of the strong economic
recovery and higher commodity prices. Nevertheless, overall CPI inflation was capped at
1.7 percent in 2004. For 2005, CPI inflation is likely to come in at 1-2 percent, reflecting the
pass-through of high commodity prices as well as firming domestic cost pressures.`
The government is also pushing on with structural reforms to enhance Singapore’s growth
prospects. In particular, Singapore will continue to develop technologically advanced
industries and applications such as pharmaticeuticals, biotechnology and nanotechnology,
and move up the “quality ladder” to stay competitive in the region. This strategy has already
met with success as observed by the staff in its study on Singapore’s export composition.
Indeed, there were more than 3,600 high-tech business start-ups in Singapore last year. At
least a quarter of them were foreign enterprises from countries in the Asia-Pacific region,
attracted by the presence of a diverse pool of international players, the availability of
alternative sources of funding, and connectivity to markets within the region and beyond. In

-2-

addition, Singapore has made considerable progress in developing niche areas in fund
management, healthcare, and education.
Monetary and Fiscal Policy
Singapore’s overall macroeconomic policy stance has evolved in line with the economy’s
cyclical developments over the past few years. Fiscal and monetary policies were
expansionary in 2002 and 2003, to assist businesses and workers who were adversely
affected by the economic downturn and facilitate the recovery process. The policy stimulus
was gradually withdrawn with the improvement in underlying economic conditions in 2004
and as the output gap turned positive by the middle of the year.
Monetary Policy
In April 2004, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) shifted from a neutral to a tighter
monetary policy stance in anticipation of rising inflationary pressures amidst a strong cyclical
upswing in the economy. The appreciating policy stance of targeting a modest and gradual
appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) was
subsequently reaffirmed in October.
The MAS is of the view that the appreciating policy stance remains appropriate in anchoring
price expectations in the domestic economy, even as economic growth slows to a more
moderate pace in 2005. The policy stance will be reviewed in April 2005, taking into account
the underlying economic conditions and prospects at that time. Should the outlook change
significantly in the interim, the MAS is ready to make the necessary adjustment to the policy
stance. Moreover, the flexibility accorded by the exchange rate policy band would, in the
first instance, accommodate any unexpected slowdown in economic activity.
The authorities welcome the staff’s endorsement of the initiatives taken to enhance
transparency of the policy framework. Since the public release of the Monetary Policy
Statement in 2001, the authorities have been disclosing information on the historical
movements of the S$NEER and on key parameters of the policy band where this would not
compromise the effective management of the exchange rate or cause disruption to the
markets. As a result, market participants have a very good understanding of the policy stance.
Fiscal Policy
The fiscal stance will be appropriately neutral, in line with expectations for the economy to
grow at its potential in 2005. The government will seek to restore budget balance and ensure
fiscal sustainability going forward. The FY2005 Budget will be announced on February 18,
2005, and can be expected to address the three-broad areas of enhancing Singapore’s
economic competitiveness, assisting vulnerable groups such as the elderly and unemployed,
and assuring fiscal sustainability.

-3-

In addressing the needs of the vulnerable segments, the government will adopt measures that
target those who are most in need, while ensuring that there is no erosion of the work ethic.
The government has announced its intention to provide greater assistance to Singaporeans
through top-ups to a newly-established Community Care Fund1 and the existing Medifund2.
A new Re-employment Assistance Programme will be launched to help older, less skilled
workers through job redesign, job referrals, and skills upgrading. The experience with the
former re-employment scheme has been encouraging with some 21,000 mature workers
acquiring new jobs during the recent economic downturn.
Financial Sector Issues
FSSA Recommendations
Many of the FSSA recommendations have been implemented. With regard to the key policy
recommendation for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism, the
MAS would like to point out that Singapore has a continuing programme of Mutual Legal
Assistance Treaty (MLAT) negotiations with several countries, with a few of them near
completion. In November 2004, Singapore also signed a regional MLAT with seven ASEAN
countries. The MAS will address the other recommendations where appropriate.
Corporate Governance and Disclosure
The authorities note that Singapore's regulatory regime for listed companies is premised on
accurate and timely disclosures by issuers, and effective enforcement when laws are
breached. In recent years, Singapore’s disclosure, accounting and corporate governance
standards have been substantially enhanced and are in line with international best practices.
In particular, failure by listed companies to disclose material information on a timely basis
has attracted criminal and civil liabilities under the Securities and Futures Act since 2002.
Quarterly reporting for larger listed companies (with a market capitalisation above
S$75 million) and mandatory compliance with accounting standards, which are aligned with
International Accounting Standards, were introduced in 2003. All listed companies must
explain deviations from the Code of Corporate Governance in their annual reports.
The authorities recognise that scandals and failures can occur in any financial centre. No
amount of regulation or enforcement can guarantee that a company will never deviate from
disclosure rules and corporate governance standards. The hallmark of a well-regulated centre
is how effectively it responds and deals with such events. In this connection, the China
Aviation Oil case is currently being investigated by the relevant authorities. Appropriate

medical care, either by themselves or with the help of their family, despite government
subsidies.

-4-

enforcement actions will be taken if any laws or regulations are found to have been breached.
Once the results of the investigations are clear, the MAS will review the need for any
changes to the rules and standards of corporate governance and market conduct.
Other Issues
Central Provident Fund (CPF)
The government is refocusing the CPF as a core retirement scheme, to help ensure that
Singaporeans set aside sufficient savings for their retirement years. To improve long-term
returns on members’ CPF savings, reduce members’ investment cost and provide simpler
choices, the CPF Board explored the possibility of introducing privately-managed pension
plans (PPPs) as an option under the CPF Investment Scheme. Following an extensive
industry and public consultation last year, the CPF Board will be assessing the framework for
PPPs and studying other pension funds to determine the most appropriate model that would
serve the majority of CPF members’ needs.
Government-linked Companies (GLCs)
The staff had observed that the performance of Temasek’s companies stood in contrast to the
generally held view of unprofitable and inefficient state-controlled enterprises. This attests to
the fact that GLCs are operated strictly on a commercial basis and enjoy no favours or
guarantees from the government. They are held to the same high levels of corporate
governance and regulatory standards as other companies in the private sector. On the issue of
divestment, Temasek has consistently made clear its intent to divest stakes in companies that
are not of strategic interest to the country. This commitment is evidenced by its divestment of
stakes in 36 companies over the last two years.
The authorities would like to reiterate that competition has always been a key tenet of
Singapore’s economic strategy, as it leads to greater productivity gains and more efficient
resource allocation. To reinforce Singapore’s pro-enterprise and competition policies, the
Competition Commission of Singapore was established in January this year following the
enactment of the Competition Act.
