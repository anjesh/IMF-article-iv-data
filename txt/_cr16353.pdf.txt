IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Sweden
On November 14, 2016 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Sweden.
Sweden is enjoying strong economic performance, with real GDP growth heading for about
3.4 percent in 2016 on the heels of an expansion of just over 4 percent in 2015. Employment
has increased by 1.5 percent so far in 2016, pushing unemployment down to about 7 percent.
Growth is expected to moderate to a still solid 2.4 percent in 2017. Core inflation (HICP
basis) has risen significantly to an average of 1.2 percent in 2016 and inflation expectations
have moved closer to Riksbank’s target. After a further easing in early 2016, the central bank
has kept the repo rate at -0.5 percent and it has continued bond purchases.
House price rises slowed to about 5 percent annualized in the last ten months from around
15 percent for most of 2015. This slowing may reflect the high level that prices reached in
the Fall of 2015 along with some anticipation of the introduction of an amortization
requirement on new mortgages in June 2016. Nonetheless, housing prices stand at some
40 percent above their 20-year average relative to income, and expensive housing has
resulted in a growing share of new borrowers taking on high debts relative to their income.
The fiscal deficit is expected to be small in 2016 even as migration-related government
spending has almost doubled to about 1.4 percent of GDP owing to the surge in refugee
inflows in 2015. The budget for 2017 provides for initiatives totaling 0.5 percent of GDP in
education, active labor market policies, and child and elder care, yet still targets a small fiscal
deficit. Despite current favorable labor market conditions, the integration of migrants into
jobs is lengthy and unemployment is high among less educated foreign-born workers.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
Sweden participated in the IMF’s Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2016, the
findings of which suggest Swedish banks are largely resilient to solvency shocks, although
they are very reliant on wholesale funding. The findings of the FSAP are summarized in the
accompanying Financial System Stability Assessment.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended Sweden’s macroeconomic policies, which have supported
strong economic growth, a reduction in unemployment, and a rise in inflation from low
levels. Directors called for balanced policies to sustain solid growth. These policies should
include returning inflation to target to rebuild space for monetary policy to cushion future
downturns, containing the rise in housing market and household debt vulnerabilities,
ensuring the resilience of the financial sector, and accelerating the integration of refugees.
Directors welcomed the rise in inflation expectations as a clear signal of the commitment of
the Riksbank to the inflation target. They recommended that monetary policy remain
stimulatory for some time given the prospect for inflation to rise only gradually. Directors
considered that any unwinding of stimulus should await confirmation of a durable rise in
inflation, while greater stimulus would be appropriate if inflation or inflation expectations
were to weaken. At the same time, Directors strongly encouraged the authorities to continue
monitoring the effects of negative interest rates on the financial sector and bank profitability,
even as the financial sector is considered to be in good health.
Directors called for housing market reforms and macroprudential measures to contain
household debt vulnerabilities. To moderate the uptrend in housing prices they recommended
reforms to maintain an adequate land supply for construction, phasing out tax deductibility of
interest payments, and phasing out rent controls while protecting the vulnerable. With
household debt likely to keep rising in the medium term, Directors emphasized the need to
reinforce macroprudential policies through timely adoption of a debt-to-income limit.
Directors welcomed the recent agreement on expanding the financial supervision authority’s
(FI) ability to take macroprudential measures to address emerging risks in a timely manner.
To further support FI’s ability to preserve the resilience of Sweden’s regionally important
financial sector, Directors recommended an expansion of its resources to achieve an
appropriate frequency of supervisory inspection. They supported timely adoption of a
leverage ratio as a backstop and a strengthening of foreign exchange liquidity requirements
on banks in view of their high reliance on wholesale funding, in line with the
recommendations of the Financial System Stability Assessment.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Given Sweden’s strong fiscal position, Directors recommended that fiscal policy
accommodate the temporary migration-related costs, making the modestly expansionary
fiscal stance planned for 2017 appropriate. They noted that the proposed revisions to the
fiscal framework would continue to protect Sweden’s fiscal health. Directors also supported
utilizing the fiscal room available in coming years to further support migrant integration
given the employment and long-term fiscal benefits within the new fiscal targets.
Directors commended the Swedish authorities’ efforts to improve migrant reception and
settlement. They called for further initiatives to provide affordable housing, ensure sufficient
educational capacity at the municipalities, and improved coordination across agencies. To
alleviate high and rising unemployment among less educated workers born outside Sweden,
most Directors recommended that social partners allow temporary and targeted exceptions to
high entry-level wages to enable on-the-job skill building. They also recommended that
employment subsidy programs be streamlined and employer-employee matching be
improved to maximize employment gains.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Sweden is enjoying robust growth aided by supportive macroeconomic policies.
Growth is heading for about 3½ percent in 2016 helping bring unemployment down to
about 7 percent. Domestic demand is the key growth driver, boosted by the stimulatory
monetary policy along with higher government spending related to migration in 2015–
16. Growth is expected to moderate to a still solid 2½ percent in 2017.
Balanced policies are needed to sustain Sweden’s solid growth by:


Returning inflation to target in order to rebuild space to cushion future downturns;





Containing the build-up of vulnerabilities from household debt;
Ensuring that Sweden’s large financial sector remains resilient; and
Accelerating the integration of refugees into the workforce.

Macroeconomic policies should continue supporting the economy while observing
medium-term targets. Monetary policy needs to remain stimulatory for some time with
any unwinding of stimulus awaiting clear confirmation of a durable rise in inflation. It
was appropriate for fiscal policy to accommodate the sharp rise in migration-related
costs in 2016–17, including by boosting education spending. Meeting the revised fiscal
targets over the medium term will continue to safeguard Sweden’s fiscal buffers.
Housing market reforms combined with macroprudential measures would best
contain vulnerabilities. Moderating the trend rise in housing prices and household
debt requires reforms to maintain an adequate supply of land ready for development,
phase out mortgage interest deductibility, and gradually remove rent controls. A limit on
debt-to-income would contain growth in the share of highly‑indebted households.
The resilience of Sweden’s regionally-important financial sector should be
preserved. The legal framework for macroprudential policy should be fixed to enable
timely measures. Greater supervisory intensity is needed, supported by expanded
resources. The interconnected Nordic-Baltic financial system also requires arrangements
that ensure close coordination in supervision, liquidity support, and resolution.
Integrating the surge of refugees from 2015 into work entails complementary
action by government and social partners. Additional affordable housing and
educational capacity in municipalities would help refugees prepare for the Swedish labor
market. Employment outcomes would be boosted by streamlining employment subsidy
programs and improving job matching, and also by allowing temporary and targeted
exceptions to high entry-level wages.

ROBUST GROWTH YET MIXED PROGRESS
1.
Sweden’s robust growth is
reducing unemployment and raising
resource utilization (Figure 1).
Excluding volatile items within services
exports, GDP growth was very strong at
4 percent y/y in the first half of 2016,
on the heels of 3.7 percent growth in
2015.1 Domestic demand is the key
driver, with the 4.7 percent y/y rise in
2016 H1 underpinned by high private
investment growth, especially new
dwelling construction, and by solid
growth in private and public
consumption. Export growth
moderated to just over 4 percent, still
performing well in relation to the
modest growth of trading partners.
Employment gains of 1.5 percent y/y
helped bring trend unemployment
down to 7 percent in August from
around 8 percent in 2011–14. Survey
indicators and output gap estimates
point to a rise in resource utilization to
just above normal levels.

2.
However, the progress in addressing Sweden’s three main economic challenges is
mixed, as elaborated in the remainder of this section:


Integration of migrants: Refugee inflows have declined markedly in 2016, but administrative
capacity is stretched, impeding their progress toward integration into the labor force.



House prices and household debt: Housing price increases have slowed, yet the share of
households taking on high debt relative to income continues to rise.



Low inflation: Strong monetary policy efforts have helped to raise inflation expectations
significantly, but core HICP inflation has stabilized at about 1.2 percent for the past year.

A spike in exports of research and development and royalties and license fees in 2015:H2 contributed about
0.5 percentage points to GDP growth in 2015, even though these items were only 2 percent of GDP in 2014.

3.
Migration inflows have subsided after last year’s historic surge, but there are
significant hurdles to integrating the large stock of asylum seekers. Almost 163,000 people
(1¾ percent of the population) sought asylum in Sweden in 2015, with just over one-fifth being
unaccompanied minors, notably higher than in previous migration waves. These inflows dropped to
just over 15,000 in the first half of 2016, mostly due to external developments, but Sweden has also
temporarily introduced border controls and tightened rules for asylum seekers. As a result, the
Swedish Migration Agency (SMA) has revised down its forecast to between 30,000 and 50,000
asylum seekers this year. Nonetheless, the large stock of asylum seekers with pending applications
for residence permits is straining Sweden’s reception capacity and impediments beyond the asylum
period may slow their integration into the labor market and Swedish society (Box 1).

House price increases have slowed significantly but household debt is steadily rising.
Housing price inflation declined to about 5 percent annualized in the last 10 months, from around
15 percent for most of 2015. Stockholm apartment prices have been broadly flat since September
2015, after jumping by 54 percent in the three preceding years. This slowing may reflect the high
level housing prices reached in the Fall of 2015, renewed public discussion of reducing tax

Inflation and inflation expectations
have risen significantly from low levels,
although core inflation has stabilized more
recently. Sweden’s output gap widened to
2½ percent in 2013, contributing to core HICP
inflation falling to just ½ percent in 2013–14,
below the 1.1 percent rate in the euro area.
Core inflation rose to an average of 1.1 percent
in 2015, with depreciation of the Swedish krona
in 2014 playing a significant role. This progress,
together with the Riksbank’s strong
commitment to its inflation target,
underpinned a rebound in inflation
expectations from their record lows in early
2015. Nonetheless, the wage round in 2016
(covering about 80 percent of private sector
employees), agreed wage growth of only
2.2 percent, below the historical average despite
labor market tightening. Core inflation has since
picked up only marginally, to average
1.2 percent so far in 2016, which may contribute
to expectations leveling out in recent months.

MACROFINANCIAL OUTLOOK AND RISKS
6.
Growth is expected to moderate, with inflation rising towards the target only
gradually, and residential investment remaining relatively high. Strong domestic demand
growth in 2015–16 was aided by expansionary monetary policy and rising spending on migrants. Yet
most of the monetary easing took place in 2015, public consumption growth is expected to be
significantly lower in 2017, and very high growth in residential investment is expected to slow in the
face of resource constraints, so domestic demand and GDP growth is expected to cool from 2017.
Nonetheless, residential investment recently reached 5 percent of GDP compared with a 25-year
average of 3 percent, and the high level of housing prices is expected to sustain a high level of
construction in coming years unless land supply and other supply-side constraints become binding.
Export growth is expected to remain at moderate levels consistent with prospects for trading partner
growth. The output gap turns positive from 2016, feeding into a renewed inflation pick up from
2017, yet core HICP inflation takes three years to approach the target. Despite solid growth and
rising employment, the unemployment rate is projected to stop declining after 2017 as newly
arrived migrants start to join the labor force but take a number of years to gain jobs (Box 2).

At the same time, household debt is expected to keep rising in the medium term as
banks are well placed to meet rising household credit demand. The acceleration in housing
prices that began around 2013 was principally driven by a combination of growth in incomes and
financial asset holdings and lower interest rates. The impact of population growth and urbanization
is evident in the rapid increase in apartment prices in the main cities.2 The financial sector does not
appear to be a key driver of this residential property cycle, with household credit growth lagging the
acceleration in housing prices and remaining well below the pace of those gains.3 As a result,
although household debt has risen relative to income, it has fallen relative to household assets.
Based on past patterns of household balance sheet adjustment, households are expected to seek
higher debt in coming years. Banks are well placed to supply this credit as they enjoy solid
profitability despite negative interest rates and have buffers over capital requirements (Table 6).

Macroeconomic vulnerabilities related to the distribution of household debt could
build even if financial stability is maintained. The recent rise in dwelling construction is welcome
to address shortages and support labor mobility and productivity.4 But many past episodes of debt
accumulation to finance property investment warn about stability risks. The FSAP findings suggest
the banks are largely resilient to potential solvency shocks, although they are very reliant on
wholesale funding (Box 3). Nonetheless, a rise in the share of highly-indebted households would
increase macroeconomic vulnerabilities.5 Although the distribution of household debt-to-disposable
income (DTI) ratios has shifted out relatively modestly in recent years, the shares of new mortgage
borrowers with DTI ratios above 600 percent rose by 7 percentage points from 2011 to reach
17 percent by 2015, and the share over 450 percent rose 16 percentage points to 37 percent. This
suggests the share of highly indebted households could rise more rapidly going forward.

Such rising vulnerabilities would exacerbate the impact on Sweden if downside risks
are realized, with potentially significant spillovers to the region (see also Box 4):


External risks: Sweden is highly exposed to external shocks including through banks’ high share
of wholesale funding and strong trade linkages with Europe including the UK. Weak growth in
major advanced and emerging economies would impact primarily via lower exports, while
economic fallout from political fragmentation in Europe, including uncertainty associated with
post-Brexit arrangements, could weigh on investment. The adverse impact on Sweden’s growth
and inflation would be greater if the nature of policy responses in these major economies
resulted in a significant appreciation of the krona.

Based on detailed regional data from the National Board of Housing and Planning, a shortage of 140,000 units is
estimated, equivalent to 3½ years of dwelling construction at the recent rate of completions.
4

Using Swedish household level data, Flodén and others (2016) find a large effect from interest rates on household
consumption via a cash-flow channel. The estimated marginal propensity to consume is around unity or even higher
in response to changes in interest expenses. So highly indebted households reduce consumption by several
percentage points more in response to a one percentage point increase in the household interest rate than
households with little debt.



Housing risks: The market seems to be cooling off from the high price levels reached last fall. A
gradual increase in housing supply is expected to moderate prospective rises in housing prices
rather than resulting in a significant decline. Nonetheless, Swedish house prices are historically
high, at some 40 percent over their 20-year average relative to income, implying potential for a
significant fall with a likely recession-like impact on consumption and unemployment.6

10.
Authorities’ Views. The authorities shared a similar macroeconomic outlook, although they
projected lower investment growth as it was already high by historical standards, and the Riksbank
considered inflation would likely rise more rapidly. While housing supply shortages reduced the
likelihood of a significant fall in prices, the authorities shared concern about the implications of trends
in household debt levels and composition for macroeconomic stability.

FINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE
11.
Sustaining solid growth while containing macrofinancial vulnerabilities requires well
targeted policy efforts. The expansionary monetary stance needs to be maintained to avoid
prolonged low inflation that would prevent monetary policy regaining space to cushion shocks, and,
if needed, some room remains to ease monetary policy. Fiscal policy should emphasize addressing
migrant integration and housing challenges while moving to the new surplus target in the medium
term, and it will need to play a larger than usual role in cushioning the economy in case of adverse
shocks. Further macroprudential steps are needed to contain vulnerabilities associated with a likely
continued rise in household indebtedness, which adds to the urgency of fixing the legal framework
to enable more timely adoption of macroprudential measures as risks evolve. Expanded education
should be complemented by temporary and targeted flexibility in entry-level wages to help migrants
and others gain employment and over time become contributors to Sweden’s strong social model.

A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
12.
To raise inflation and inflation
expectations the Riksbank eased
further in 2016 using unconventional
monetary policy (UMP) tools. The repo
rate was cut by a further 15 bps in
February to -50 bps. Additional bond
purchases were also announced, bringing
total purchases to about 37 percent of
government bonds by end 2016,
amounting to some 6 percent of GDP.
Moreover, the pool of eligible assets for
these purchases was expanded to include
inflation-indexed bonds, signaling the

capacity for further action. Since these purchases began, nonresident holdings of Swedish
government bonds have declined by almost 25 percent, equivalent to about 40 percent of total
bond purchases, but more recent purchases are mainly from residents.
13.
Combined use of UMP instruments has enhanced the impact on yields, with limited
side effects on banks to date and mixed readings regarding the impact on bond market
liquidity. Repo rate cuts and commitments to keep rates low have most effect on the short end of
the yield curve while asset purchases directly compress term premia. Deploying a package of all
three measures shifted yields down by at least 50 bps at all maturities since end-2014. Moreover, the
strong pass-through into the cost of the wholesale funding of banks has helped mitigate adverse
impacts from negative interest rates on Swedish bank profitability (Box 5), although these effects
should continue to be closely monitored. Although the National Debt Office considers that the large
volume of bond purchases contributes to increased use of its repo facility, the Riksbank notes that
market interest in its regular auctions remains strong, suggesting scope for further purchases.

The Krona has been broadly stable
despite easy monetary policy in the major
currency areas. Since February 2015, the
Riksbank’s monetary stimulus has kept Swedish
yields roughly in line with German Bunds, despite
the ECB’s monetary easing. Given the strong
correlations between yield differentials and the
exchange rate, this has supported broad stability
of the Swedish krona during 2015–16. Although
the Riksbank signaled its readiness to intervene
at the foreign exchange (FX) market if necessary,
in practice no FX purchases have been made.

Inflation is expected to rise, but the return toward the target will likely be gradual. A
range of forecasting tools indicate inflation will gradually rise over time, although at a slower pace if
euro area inflation does not rise as projected. Yet, there is uncertainty about how quickly resource
pressures will feed into inflation. Wage setting is one source of this uncertainty, as wage growth

inflation to rise more rapidly partly reflects a greater rise in firms’ margins than staff expects.
16.
The expansionary monetary stance therefore needs to be maintained for some time.
An unwinding of the monetary expansion should await clear confirmation that tightening resource
utilization is translating into a durable rise in inflation, and any unwinding should be at a measured
pace that accepts a broadly symmetric risk of inflation being above or below the target. In case
inflation prospects and expectations were to weaken, further rate cuts would be appropriate,
although such an easing would need to be accompanied by heightened vigilance regarding
household debt vulnerabilities and preparedness to tighten the macroprudential stance. Bond
purchases could be extended while continuing to monitor debt markets.
17.
Sweden’s external position is moderately stronger than the level consistent with

remain a last resort. The current account surplus of 5 percent of GDP reflects a number of factors
including measurement issues (Appendix II). Taking these factors into account, the surplus modestly
exceeds staff’s view of the norm for Sweden, hence the krona is assessed to be moderately
undervalued. In that context, FX intervention should be a last resort after exhausting other
instruments, being limited to averting a decline in inflation owing to rapid Krona appreciation.
18.
A parliamentary review of the Riksbank law should be used to strengthen Sweden’s
monetary and financial stability arrangements. Given the communication challenges from the
immediate positive impact of the policy rate on the headline CPI, the inflation target should be in
terms of the internationally comparable HICP.7 Greater symmetry in inflation targeting would be
desirable, with inflation (CPI with fixed interest rates) below the target for over 70 percent of 12-year
period prior to the GFC. Even as the Finansinspektionen (FI) is the designated authority for
macroprudential policies, the Riksbank’s role in financial stability should be put on a firmer legal
footing, including in relation to systemic financial risks and emergency liquidity provision (FSSA ¶66).
19.
Authorities’ Views. The Riksbank broadly agreed with staff views on the monetary and
exchange rate policy. The authorities will continue monitoring developments in the financial markets
and institutions closely for potential adverse effects from UMP. The authorities endorsed the
recommendation to clarify the Riksbank’s financial stability mandate.

B. Housing and Household Debt Policies
20.
Minimum amortization requirements on new mortgages became effective in June,
which will help cement the progress made in recent years. The FI’s Swedish Mortgage Market
report indicates amortization of mortgages with an LTV of 70–85 percent rose from 0.8 percent of
principal in 2011 to 1.3 percent by 2015. New mortgage borrowers are required to make annual
repayments of at least 1 percent of the debt principal for mortgages with LTV over 50 percent, and
at least 2 percent for those with LTV above 70 percent. The direct macroeconomic impact of higher
amortization is contained as only new borrowers are affected.8 As amortization net of refinancing is
key to containing the development of household debt vulnerabilities the adequacy of these
minimum amortization rates should be reviewed annually. The macroprudential stance was also
tightened by raising the counter-cyclical capital buffer to 2 percent effective March 2017, even as
the credit-to-GDP gap has declined substantially in recent years.
21.
But the current conjuncture calls for broader efforts to lean against the evolving risks.
Income and population drivers of housing demand are expected to remain strong in Sweden and
interest rates may remain exceptionally low for some years. Hence, even with the recent rise in
construction (less than 1 percent of the total dwelling stock annually), the potential for a renewed
increase in housing prices remains. The resulting upward pressure on high-DTI borrowing would not
The CPI with fixed interest rates is subject to significant fluctuations in imputed components such as depreciation
while the HICP includes only observed prices of goods and services (see Riksbank Studies, September 2016).
7

While nearly all mortgages with LTV above 70 percent were being amortized, average repayments were only
1.3 percent of debt, below the new 2 percent requirement. For mortgages with LTV of 50–70 percent, only
51.2 percent were being amortized, by an average of 0.9 percent of the debt.

be contained by the current framework of an LTV ceiling (85 percent), minimum risk weights
(25 percent) on mortgages, and minimum amortization requirements. A sustained rebalancing of
housing demand and supply in order to moderate the trend rise in housing prices is therefore key to
protecting the financial resilience of households over the longer term. New macroprudential tools
also have a significant role to play in containing the rise in vulnerabilities over the medium term.
22.
Rebalancing housing demand and supply requires deep reforms of Sweden’s poorly
functioning housing market, that would have broader benefits including for labor mobility:


Sustaining the increase in housing supply.
Maintaining an adequate supply of land that
is ready for development is needed to
sustain the recent welcome rise in
construction, requiring more transparent,
standardized, and timely municipal land sale
and planning procedures. Expanded
budgetary support for affordable rental
housing—currently at 0.1 percent of GDP—
would also help enhance supply while
avoiding an increase in household debt.



Tax reform to reduce demand and incentives for debt financing. A first-best approach
would be to raise the very low ceilings on property tax to broaden the tax base in a progressive
manner. The low interest rate environment makes it ideal to also phase out the tax deductibility
of interest payments. The proposal to temporarily remove the threshold for deferring capital
gains tax on a primary residence would promote more efficient use of existing dwellings.



Phasing out rent controls is key.9 Long queues for rental apartments leave new entrants little
option but to buy, “lock-in” effects from rent controls hinder the efficient use of housing, and
the incentive is to build tenant-owned rather than rental housing. Phasing-out rent controls
while protecting vulnerable households through the housing allowance and exempting all new
construction from controls would reduce housing imbalances.

23.
In addition, the macroprudential toolkit should be reinforced by a DTI limit. Banks
report that they are taking household DTI into account in mortgage origination, with some having
internal thresholds that are resulting in a larger share of loan applications being rejected. Signs of a
tightening of lending standards are seen in average LTVs on new mortgages declining to
68.3 percent in 2015, from around 70 percent in 2012–14. However, banks that are competing with
each other are unlikely to fully internalize the macroeconomic risks of having a large share of
highly-indebted households in their loan-by-loan origination decisions. Reflecting such concerns, a
mortgage loan-to-income (LTI) threshold that only a minority of borrowers may exceed has been
adopted in the UK and Ireland and a DTI is under consideration in New Zealand. A study by FI of the
9

Rent controls are strictest in Sweden among European countries according to a European Commission index.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

SWEDEN

macroeconomic effects of the DTI limit suggests that a cap of 600 percent of disposable income,
with exemption of 15 percent of mortgages, would slow the rise in household debt while having
modest negative effect on growth.10
24.

A limit on the share of high DTI loans should be adopted soon in order to:



Lean against growth in the share of households with high DTI ratios while allowing some
flexibility for individual household circumstances. This would contain increases in the interest
sensitivity of consumption and protect households’ resilience to income losses in a recession.



Automatically reduce LTVs on high DTI loans when housing prices rise faster than incomes,
providing larger buffers for a potential adjustment in house prices.



Make lending responses to house price increases somewhat less elastic than relying solely on an
LTV ceiling, helping to dampen the potential for an upward credit-price spiral.

In view of the lengthy process to adopt new tools, the FI should initiate the adoption of a DTI limit
soon, but a final calibration of the DTI limit could be deferred until the tool is authorized to take into
account developments including experience with the amortization requirement.
25.
An approach based on risk weights and close supervision could allow more timely
implementation than a regulated DTI limit. Other countries have applied higher risk weights for
mortgages above certain LTV thresholds.11 Following a similar approach, FI could raise the risk
weight for the portion of mortgages exceeding a certain DTI threshold to be considerably above the
current floor of 25 percent or it could adopt a capital surcharge on such loans. Such measures would
clearly signal that banks should contain the volume of high-DTI lending. It would be important to
support such a signal with regular supervisory monitoring and engagement on the scale of such
lending by each bank. But if these signals and supervisory efforts are not sufficiently effective a
regulatory limit on DTI would be needed.
26.
Authorities’ Views. The authorities are alert to housing supply challenges, noting that recent
improvements in construction permitting would streamline processes for buildings of a similar design.
However, gaining consensus on raising the property tax is unlikely and political support for the present
rent setting system is strong given concerns that reforms would bring high rents and reduced security
of tenure. The government considers there needs to be political consensus with opposition parties to
hold discussions on reducing mortgage interest deductibility. The Government and FI prefer to first
assess the impact from the amortization requirement before taking further measures. The FI will
continue to study a range of options regarding household DTI limits, with the Riksbank noting that
implementation of such tools is urgently needed, where regulation would have a more certain impact
on containing risks.
10

Analysis by van Santen and Ölcer (2016) finds that household’s gross income averages 40 percent more than
disposable income. This suggests that 600 percent of disposable income in Sweden is equivalent to 430 percent of
gross income, making the former threshold broadly comparable to that in the UK of 450 percent of gross income.
11

For example, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand raises standardized mortgage risk weights from 35 to 50 percent if
LTV is over 90 percent, in Luxembourg, the risk weight goes from 35 to 70 percent for amounts exceeding an LTV of
80 percent, and in Switzerland, a risk weight of 100 percent is applied for loan tranches above an 80 percent LTV.

C. Prudential Policy and Financial Safety Nets
27.
The legal framework for macroprudential policies should be fixed to enable timely
action, a priority that is heightened by prospects for household debt to keep rising. The recent
introduction of amortization requirements on new mortgages came after long delays, revealing
shortcomings in the process for the FI to adopt new macroprudential tools that it considers to be
justified primarily on macroeconomic stability grounds.12 Accordingly, the law should be amended
to remove uncertainties around FI’s macroprudential powers and provide FI with a toolbox that can
be used to address systemic risks in a timely and effective manner (FSSA ¶38). Experience in a range
of countries suggests approaches to providing effective oversight by governments and parliaments
while achieving timely authorization of new tools.13
28.
The coming review of the Financial Stability Council (FSC) should seek to structure its
operations to most effectively support FI’s fulfilment of its macroprudential mandate. The FSC
has provided a valuable forum for sharing information. Joint work on risk analysis and on the design
and impact assessment of potential measures should be expanded. To foster cooperation among
the authorities involved, and to take full advantage of Riksbank expertise in the assessment of
macrofinancial risks, the FSC should have the power to make recommendations, preferably with the
FI having a responsibility to comply or explain (FSSA ¶39).
29.
FI needs to step up supervisory intensity. FI is responsible for supervising some of the
largest and systemically important banks in the Nordic region. But analysis by FI of its resources
assigned to the banking sector compared with other supervisors finds a resource gap of
approximately 45 percent. FI resources should be expanded to achieve an appropriate frequency of
inspections (FSSA ¶48). Moreover, delays in introducing regulations while relevant legislation and
ordinances are being amended should be minimized to support FI’s capacity to safeguard stability.
30.
A leverage ratio can provide a useful backstop to risk-based capital requirements.
Reflecting the strong capital buffers of Swedish banks, stress tests suggest that their solvency is
resilient under a severe scenario where a slump in global growth is associated with a sharp rise in
unemployment and a large fall in housing prices. Yet, the exercise also illustrated the challenges of
modeling tail risks in Sweden. It is therefore welcome that FI has proposed a new supervisory
approach to risk weights on corporate exposures.14 Timely adoption of a leverage ratio as a
backstop would further safeguard against model and measurement errors (FSSA ¶24).

FI has previously adopted a ceiling on LTV ratios under its consumer protection mandate and a floor on mortgage
risk weights under its mandate for financial stability, but it lacks a legislative mandate for macroeconomic stability.
12

13

See first chapter of Selected Issues.

14

In May 2016 the FI announced a new supervisory method on IRB models for corporate exposures. Corporate risk
weights are expected to rise to over 30 percent, raising capital requirements by about 2.5 percentage points (see
Sweden FSSA Technical Note on Stress Testing, 2016).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31.
To address systemic liquidity issues in foreign currency, a further tightening of FX
liquidity requirements should be evaluated.15 Swedish banks, excluding subsidiary banks in the
region, had about 50 percent of GDP in short-term external debt at end 2015. Banks have improved
their FX liquidity following the global financial crisis, with liquidity coverage ratios (LCRs) in U.S.
dollars and in euro well above 100. Nonetheless, in case market funding is interrupted, banks could
need sizable FX liquidity support, in part because some of banks’ liquid assets are held in securities
that may not be widely traded in a crisis such as covered bonds. Taking into account the time that
may be required to replenish foreign reserves by borrowing or to access central bank swap lines,
and the desirability to have a buffer for contingencies, it would not be appropriate to reduce
Sweden’s existing reserves of 11 percent of GDP. The adequacy of reserves could be further assured
by monitoring an extended (three-month) LCR in U.S. dollars and euros (FSSA ¶46) and ensuring that
an adequate portion of banks’ high quality liquid assets can be sold on the market in a crisis.
32.
Sweden plays a central role in the highly interconnected Nordic-Baltic financial system
requiring close coordination in supervision, liquidity support, and resolution. Sweden hosts
four of the largest publicly-listed banks in the Nordic region, with assets amounting to about
120 percent of Nordic region GDP, including Nordea which is a top-3 bank in Denmark, Finland, and
Sweden. Swedish banks also account for large shares of total bank assets in Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania. Regional cooperation on financial stability should therefore be enhanced, building on the
Nordic-Baltic Macroprudential Forum established in 2011 (FSSA ¶36). Memoranda of Understanding
under discussion between the regional supervisors should entail full access to supervisory
information including participating in on-site inspections. In parallel, cooperative agreements
among the relevant authorities are needed regarding potential liquidity support and to ensure
financial stability in all countries is protected in event of resolution.
33.
Authorities’ Views. Recognizing the deficiencies in the legal framework for macroprudential
policies, the Finance Ministry is analyzing options to clarify FI’s mandate in this regard. Although the
authorities aim to make best use of the FSC, it is not possible under Sweden’s constitution for the FSC
to make recommendations to FI entailing a comply or explain obligation. The budget for 2017 provides
additional resources to FI, and these would be reviewed once again at the next budget. While the
Riksbank supports the FSAP’s call for timely adoption of a leverage ratio as a backstop, FI considers
that steps to make risk weights more robust better address model risk concerns. FI also notes that a
leverage ratio, should it be constructed as a minimum requirement, would remove most of the current
capital buffers. On banks’ FX liquidity, FI noted that Swedish LCR implementation exceeds international
norms, and already is focused on requirements in foreign currency. The Riksbank, however, supported
consideration of a further tightening of FX liquidity regulation. The authorities agree on the need to
continue strengthening regional coordination in supervision, liquidity, and resolution.

D. Fiscal Policy
34.
The budget for 2017 targets a continuation of a small deficit. Migration-related
spending almost doubled to about 1.5 percent of GDP in 2016 despite lower than assumed refugee
inflows. But the budget is expected to record only a small deficit owing to strong revenue
performance and lower than expected spending including on healthcare. Looking to 2017,
migration-related spending is expected to rise modestly as introduction program costs rise when
refugees obtain residence permits and settle in municipalities. New initiatives of about 0.5 percent of
GDP include education and active labor market measures together with expanded elderly and child
care. These are only partly covered by a new bank tax, higher taxes on chemicals and energy, and
state income tax. A reversion to a more normal revenue performance also contributes to the
expected small decline in net lending to -0.3 percent of GDP in 2017.
35.
A modestly expansionary fiscal stance is appropriate in the near-term given the need
to accommodate temporarily high migration-related spending. In 2015 the Fund recommended
that swings in migration-related expenses should be accommodated in the near term and funded
over time as part of achieving medium-term fiscal targets. Over 2015–17, the decline in the
structural balance is estimated to broadly match the 0.8 percent of GDP increase in

36.
The proposed revisions to the fiscal framework will continue to safeguard Sweden’s
fiscal buffers. With effect from 2019, the surplus target is to be reduced from 1 percent of GDP to
0.33 percent of GDP in view of the reduction in Sweden’s debt to 43 percent of GDP in 2015. A debt
anchor at 35 percent of GDP is a new element, serving as a benchmark consistent with the surplus
target rather than an additional operational target, with the government required to explain
deviations of more than 5 percent of GDP from this anchor. Staff’s debt sustainability indicates that
public debt is on a downward path toward the new anchor (Appendix II). This new debt anchor is

valuable considering the importance of Sweden’s strong fiscal position for cushioning potential
shocks, such as potential liquidity needs of the large financial sector. In practice, these targets
should be achieved over periods sufficient to avoid a procyclical fiscal stance.
37.
Fiscal policy has room to cushion the economy if needed and there is also room to
help address structural challenges while still adhering to the revised fiscal framework. On a no
policy change basis, the structural balance is expected to reach 0.6 percent of GDP by 2019,
somewhat above the new medium-term target (Text Table). Public debt is expected to be only a
little above the 35 percent target. This strong fiscal position allows full operation of automatic
stabilizers and for proactive stimulus in adverse scenarios, which is particularly valuable at a time
when monetary policy space has decreased. This outlook also indicates that there is some room for
new initiatives in coming years in migration and housing, along the lines discussed in Sections B and
E, while still observing the new fiscal targets. Such investments may have significant up-front costs,
but will yield longer-term benefits as more refugees become net contributors to the public finances
and as improved housing supply facilitates mobility and employment. As highlighted by the Fiscal
Policy Council, it would be important to frame such initiatives within a credible medium-term plan.
38.
Authorities’ Views. The government’s approach to fiscal policy is indeed to accommodate the
temporary element of migration-related costs. While recognizing these costs, the Fiscal Policy Council,
considered that 2017 budget should be less expansionary given Sweden’s position of the business cycle.
The authorities noted that there was broad political consensus on the proposed revised fiscal targets,
and there was flexibility to observe them while avoiding overly rapid adjustment.

E. Labor Market Policies
39.
The Swedish labor market is performing well but skill mismatch is growing. Strong job
creation in recent years has been largely concentrated in higher skilled occupations. As a result, the
unemployment rate among those with lower education has risen to 20 percent, similar to that for
workers born outside the EU. This trend reflects the underlying imbalance between skill demand and
supply in the Swedish labor market, where employers increasingly demand labor with at least
upper-secondary education, while lower skilled workers dominate the pool of job seekers.16 This

imbalance could become more severe in coming years as the recent influx of refugees, many of
whom have less education, enter the workforce. At the same time, high collectively-agreed wage
floors (75–80 percent of average wages), and high similarity of wages across sectors, limit scope to
create jobs that would be more suitable for absorbing the skill mix of the unemployed.
40.
Reforms should focus on promoting higher employment among the vulnerable
groups. Recent education initiatives to upgrade the skills of job seekers are important, but it would
also help to boost the demand for lower skills to build skills on-the-job:

To expand hiring of lower skilled workers, greater wage flexibility at the firm level or temporary
and targeted exceptions to entry level wages have been used in nearby countries (e.g.,
“apprentice wages” in Denmark for newly arrived migrants, “mini jobs” in Germany). In this
respect, the social partners have a key role to play. Carefully designed social supports and tax
credits (e.g., lower payroll taxes targeted at low wage earners) would protect living standards
while preserving work incentives. Employment subsidy programs (e.g., “Step In” and “New Start”
jobs for new arrivals) have proven effective in helping migrants gain unsubsidized jobs
subsequently. To encourage wider use of these subsidies, the PES should step up outreach to
employers and streamline the numerous programs to reduce the administrative burden on
employers, while also improving job matching to enhance employment gains.

41.
More immediately, further improvements in refugee reception and establishment are
critical for their integration into the labor market. Sweden has a well-developed refugee
integration framework and the current favorable labor market conditions are helpful. However,
asylum reception capacity is under great pressure given the exceptional number of new arrivals, and
various hurdles undermine the effectiveness of the introduction program (Box 1). The authorities
have announced measures to reduce burdens on reception, speed up introduction such as offering
early language/civic training, adult education and skills assessment during asylum period (Box 6),
and to open more pathways into the labor market. In view of the scale of the challenge, further
efforts are urgently needed to provide affordable housing to avoid settlement delays (Section B),
ensure sufficient capacity at the municipalities for individually-tailored language training and basic
education, and improve coordination among the many agencies involved in the integration process.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

SWEDEN

42.
Authorities’ Views. With the majority of migrants below 35 years of age, the government
sees potential from new education initiatives. Representatives of trade unions and the PES also stressed
the importance of education as a sustainable long-term strategy given that a large share of the 2015
asylum seeker wave are young and have little education, and that wage subsidy programs do not
generate sufficient volumes. While it does not interfere in collectively-agreed wages, the government is
also providing incentives for municipalities and private employers to employ low-skilled workers in
sectors with labor shortage (e.g., elderly care) which could potentially facilitate integration of migrants.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Sweden’s economy is performing well and balanced policies are needed to help sustain
solid growth. Supportive monetary and fiscal policies have contributed to strong economic growth
in recent years, helping to reduce unemployment and raise inflation from low levels. Growth is
expected to moderate yet remain solid in coming years, but household indebtedness will likely
continue to rise. The priorities are rebuilding space for monetary policy to cushion the economy
against future downturns by returning inflation to target, containing the rise in housing market and
household debt vulnerabilities, ensuring that Sweden’s large financial sector remains resilient, and
accelerating the integration of refugees into the work force.
44.
Monetary policy needs to remain stimulatory for some time. Monetary easing in recent
years has kept Swedish yields roughly in line with those on German Bunds and the krona broadly
stable. The commitment demonstrated by the Riksbank has lifted inflation expectations close to the
target. Nonetheless, core inflation has been around 1.2 percent for the past year and it is expected
to rise relatively gradually to the target in coming years. Any unwinding of monetary stimulus
should therefore await clear confirmation of a durable rise in inflation. If inflation or expectations
were to weaken, greater stimulus would be appropriate, yet foreign exchange intervention should
be a last resort. The parliamentary review of the Riksbank law is an opportunity to refine monetary
arrangements and to clarify its role in relation to financial stability.
45.
A combination of housing market reforms and macroprudential measures would best
contain the rise in household debt vulnerabilities. Although housing price gains have slowed
since the Fall of 2015, expensive housing is requiring a growing share of new borrowers to take on
high debts relative to their income. Moderating the upward trend in housing prices entails reforms
to maintain an adequate supply of suitable land to help sustain the recent rise in construction,
phasing out tax deductibility of mortgage interest, and also phasing out rent controls while
protecting the vulnerable. Reinforcing the existing macroprudential policies through timely adoption
of a limit on DTI ratios is needed to contain growth in the share of highly‑indebted households,
ensure that any further rise in already high housing prices leads to lower LTVs on high-DTI loans,
and dampen feedbacks between credit and housing prices.
46.
The legal framework for macroprudential policy should be fixed to enable FI to take
timely actions. The lengthy process to introduce mortgage amortization requirements revealed
deficiencies in FI’s macroprudential mandate and powers. To fulfill its macroprudential mandate,

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWEDEN

legal amendments are needed to provide FI with the capacity to adopt new tools to address
emerging risks in a timely manner. The FSC should expand joint work on risk analysis, tool design,
and impact assessment, and the coming review of the FSC should seek to most effectively support
FI’s fulfilment of its macroprudential mandate.
47.
Preserving the resilience of Sweden’s regionally-important financial sector is essential.
Reflecting the strong capital buffers of Swedish banks, stress tests suggest that their solvency is
resilient under a severe scenario. To support FI’s capacity to safeguard financial stability, its
resources should be expanded to achieve an appropriate frequency of supervisory inspection, and
delays in the introduction of regulations owing to legal amendments should be minimized. The
proposed new supervisory approach to corporate risk weights is welcome, yet a leverage ratio can
provide a useful backstop to risk‑based capital requirements. Although Swedish banks meet
international liquidity requirements, strengthening regulation in this area should be considered
when reviewing foreign reserves. The highly interconnected Nordic-Baltic financial system also
requires arrangements that ensure close coordination in supervision, liquidity support, and
resolution, with enhanced cooperation building on the Nordic-Baltic Macroprudential Forum.
48.
Fiscal policy should accommodate the temporary element of migration-related costs
and support measures with long-term benefits while observing the new fiscal targets. Last
year’s historic surge in asylum seekers has doubled migrant-related spending by 2017 compared
with 2015. Considering Sweden’s strong fiscal position and the significant temporary component of
such spending, it is appropriate that the 2017 budget allowed a broadly similar decline in the
structural balance over that period, while adopting new initiatives in education and active labor
market policies that will support the integration of refugees. Sweden’s fiscal health will continue to
be protected following the proposed revisions to the fiscal framework, including a surplus target of
0.33 percent of GDP and a new debt anchor of 35 percent of GDP. The medium-term fiscal
projections show some room that should be used to further support migrant integration and
affordable rental housing in coming years while still observing these new targets.
49.
The social partners have a key role to play in facilitating the integration of migrants
into the workforce to limit prolonged unemployment. Unemployment is high and rising among
less educated workers born outside Sweden, and many of the new arrivals that will be seeking work
in coming years have less education. The authorities have taken a range of steps to improve migrant
reception and introduction, but further efforts are needed to provide affordable housing, ensure
sufficient educational capacity at the municipalities, and improve coordination across agencies.
Initiatives in adult education and vocational training will help migrants prepare for work, but it is
also important for the social partners to facilitate arrangements that enable skills to be built on-thejob. Temporary and targeted exceptions to high entry-level wages can be combined with expanded
tax credits and strengthened benefit conditionality to protect living standards and improve work
incentives. Employment subsidy programs should be streamlined to increase their take-up and
employer-employee matching should be improved to boost subsequent employment outcomes.
50.
It is recommended to hold the next Article IV consultation with Sweden on the
standard 12–month cycle.

Box 1. Issues with Refugee Reception and Establishment1
Sweden has a well-developed framework for integrating refugees.2 However, the exceptionally large wave
of asylum seekers in late 2015 exposed several challenges in the current system of receiving and establishing
the new arrivals, impeding their path to successful integration in the labor market and Swedish society. Some
of these impediments are being addressed with new initiatives in the 2016 Spring and 2017 Budget Bills
(Box 6).
Reception of newly arrived refugees. At the start of 2016, about 182,000 people were registered in the
SMA’s reception system, straining administrative capacity. The large number of unaccompanied minors
compounds the challenge as more intensive support is needed in these cases. As a result:

Processing time for asylum applications has increased substantially, delaying residence permits
that are needed to start the introduction program. Processing time has increased from under 5 months in
2014 to between 15 months and 2 years currently. The lengthy stay in reception centers also raises the housing
costs, as about 55 percent of asylum seekers choose to stay in SMA-provided accommodation.

There is a long wait before refugees are settled in a municipality which means the introduction
program is further delayed. Even after a residence permit is granted, refugees currently have to wait about
5 months before being assigned to a municipality—often due to lack of affordable housing.
Establishment of refugees with a residence permit. The two-year introduction program is the cornerstone
of the integration framework. It helps prepare the refugees for entry to the labor market and Swedish society.
An introduction plan that is tailored for each migrant covers Swedish language training, employment
preparation and social studies. A range of hurdles are undermining the effectiveness of the introduction
program, however, including:

Low participation in introduction activities means that the refugees are not receiving sufficient
training designed to help them integrate. Although many new arrivals lack upper secondary education, very
few take up basic education programs. Participation in labor market training including work placement is also
low. In addition, language training—a key to labor market success particularly in Sweden—is often interrupted.
These facts could reflect health and/or social issues with the new arrivals, but also inadequate training capacity
and difficulties in coordinating the parallel measures among different agencies.

Delays in education assessment and skill validation prevent refugees with sufficient
qualifications from quickly entering the workforce. For refugees with higher education, waiting and
processing times for recognition of foreign qualifications remain long, especially in the health sector. Validation
of vocational skills is also under-utilized.

Unclear division of responsibilities and sometimes lack of cooperation among different agencies
involved in the integration process can further undermine the quality of introduction. Insufficient
coordination between the Public Employment Services (PES), which draws up the introduction plan for each
migrant, and the municipalities, who largely implement it, can undermine the effectiveness of introduction and
lead to varying quality of language and civic training. Responsibility for health/social support of the newly
arrived refugees also needs to be clarified.

Box 2. Impact of Migration on Potential Output and Labor Market
This Box investigates the impact of last year’s migration surge on Sweden’s potential output and labor
market, focusing on the supply-side effects of the labor supply expansion.
Assumptions are made regarding how quickly the refugees move from the asylum phase to the
establishment and integration phases. In particular, out of the 163,000 asylum applicants last year,
57 percent are of working age. Of these, historical country-specific acceptance rates indicate that about
75 percent would be granted residence permits. It is assumed that half of the residence permits are granted
in 2017 and half the following year. The refugees can then decide to join the labor force (or not) while
participating in the introduction program, i.e. the establishment phase. The potential addition to aggregate
employment during 2017–21 is calculated by applying the historical employment rates that prevail among
the refugees during their first five years living in Sweden. An alternative scenario illustrates the impact of
faster integration by applying the corresponding employment rates among refugees in Germany, whose
integration performance is among the best in the EU.

Box 3. Main Findings of Sweden’s FSAP
Bank solvency and liquidity
Stress tests suggest that bank solvency is resilient under a severe scenario. The Swedish authorities have
strengthened capital requirements to exceed Basel III standards ahead of many peers. Even in a severe stress
scenario, including a 6 percentage point rise in unemployment and a 30 percent fall in real housing prices, no
bank would break the regulatory threshold and only one bank would fall below the supervisory threshold
(which does not take into account that some bank capital buffers may be released in a crisis). Lower net
interest income and higher provisions for credit losses, primarily on corporate exposures, are the main drivers.
The system-wide leverage ratio would fall by 0.3 percentage points in the stressed scenario (from 4.1 percent in
2015).
Yet, doubts about the reliability of banks’ and supervisors’ models point to the need for the timely
adoption of a leverage ratio as a backstop. Available models may suffer from overreliance on recent
historical experience, and have difficulties capturing unexpected losses occurring in extreme but plausible
scenarios. Recognizing the importance of preserving the risk-based approach to supervision, the leverage ratio
is a valuable complement providing a simple and transparent backstop to safeguard against model and
measurement errors in calculating capital ratios.
Moreover, the stability impact of a house price decline with an associated loss of confidence in housing
collateral, could be amplified by Swedish banks’ reliance on wholesale funding. Given the
interconnectedness within the Nordic-Baltic financial systems, such a shock could have significant spillovers
across the region. The Swedish Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) suggests banks are resilient to liquidity shocks.
However, some banks would face liquidity pressures, especially in foreign currencies, if the stress scenario
intensified and lasted longer than one month. The FSAP therefore recommended to adopt an extended (threemonth) LCR in euros and U.S. dollars, initially for monitoring purposes. It also recommended to closely monitor
banks’ cross-holdings of covered bonds, and consider measures to contain the concentration risk.
Nonbank financial sector
The nonbank financial sector appears resilient to shocks, but has pockets of vulnerability. In the stressed
scenario, only two insurance companies drop slightly below a solvency ratio of 100 percent, and the total
additional capital that would be needed to restore full coverage of the solvency capital requirement amounts
to less than 1 percent of GDP. The solvency impact is mostly due to the equity shocks and a default of largest
banking counterparty. Over the medium term, the low interest rate environment is challenging for the life
insurance sector, making it difficult to find alternative assets without taking on undue credit risks, as a large
share of the current fixed-income portfolio with high coupon rates will expire in the next 5 years. Investment
funds have grown significantly, and the FSAP’s liquidity analysis suggests that corporate bonds markets may
face stress if investment funds were to face tail event redemption shocks.
Supervisory powers, resources, and cooperation
The authorities are encouraged to address key data gaps that reduce the efficacy of systemic risk
oversight. Given the high household indebtedness, a crucial missing element is data on the distribution of
household financial assets, available in other countries but discontinued in Sweden. For systemic risk
monitoring purposes, the mission recommended introducing comprehensive anonymized surveys of
household balance sheets. The mission recommended enhancements in the stress testing framework for banks,
insurance companies, and investment funds. FI should improve the availability and quality of investment fund
data, to enhance the authorities’ ability to conduct stress testing and other analyses to assess market sensitivity
to extreme redemptions from investment funds. To better understand the effects of shocks on the broader
economy, it will be important to undertake periodic stress tests of corporate resilience.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWEDEN

Box 3. Main Findings of Sweden’s FSAP (concluded)
The institutional framework for systemic risk oversight needs an upgrade. Sweden has a unique
framework, in which the macroprudential mandate was given by an ordinance to the supervisory agency (FI)
that reports to the Government. The FSAP called for establishing a firm legal mandate that removes
uncertainties around FI’s macroprudential powers and provides FI with a toolbox that can be used address
systemic risks in a timely and effective manner. The FSAP also recommended providing the Financial
Stability Council with a statutory basis.
On the microprudential level, FI needs to step up supervisory intensity. Achieving it requires financial
and human resources that are sustainable and adequate given the size and complexity of the Swedish
financial system. Current budgeting arrangements have so far failed to meet this need. Higher charges on
the industry should be considered to generate more resources. FI should put new staff through extensive
supervisory training program, make full use of other Nordic supervisors in support of cross border
operations, and it could also bring in supervisors from foreign supervisory agencies. In the medium term, FI
needs to develop an HR strategy to build and retain a larger group of experienced supervisors. This will
likely require more support for senior supervision staff to reduce turnover, and improved terms and
conditions of service to make FI a more attractive career option. In the area of securities supervision,
enhancements to cross-border supervisory cooperation and active participation in the work of the European
Securities and Markets Authority are necessary complements to FI’s active domestic supervisory program.
FI also needs a broader mandate to issue binding regulations on safety and soundness issues. In
instances such as the issuance of credit risk standards, introduction has been delayed by several years
awaiting legal amendments to provide the specific power required. FI should have a broad ability to issue
regulations related to any safety and soundness issues. If this not feasible, the government should amend
the laws or ordinances promptly to address issues identified by FI.
The FSAP called for further strengthening financial safety nets. It welcomed Sweden’s new resolution
framework for credit institutions and investment firms. It called for ensuring agency-specific and national
financial crisis preparedness, and suggested a revamp of the Nordic-Baltic Stability Group to fulfill a similar
role regionally. It also recommended defining strategies for liquidity assistance to banks in resolution and
ensuring that resources for recovery and resolution planning are commensurate with the size and
complexity of Sweden’s financial sector. The mission emphasized the need to amend the law to clarify the
Riksbank’s financial stability mandate, including by giving it authority to provide emergency liquidity for
financial stability purposes.

The introduction of negative policy interest
rates raises concerns about their impact on
bank profitability. Negative interest rates can
reduce bank profitability as banks must pay for
their deposits at the central bank. Even though the
Riksbank does not apply tiering or other methods
to moderate this impact of negative rates on bank
profits, in practice it is relatively small. It would be
more important if negative rates put pressure on
banks’ net interest margins, which would happen if
lending rates fell by more than their overall
funding costs.

Nonetheless, reductions in wholesale funding costs since February 2015 have cushioned overall net
interest margins. In contrast with the stickiness of deposit rates, the overall cost of wholesale funding—
reflecting the combination of short-term funding and use of long-term covered bond funding with hedging of
interest and FX risks—has decreased since negative interest rates were introduced in Sweden. With wholesale
funding supporting over half of Swedish bank loans, their reduced costs helped maintain bank profits in 2015. 2

Nonetheless, the effects of negative rates on bank profitability should continue to be closely monitored.
Despite fast asset repricing owing to the high share of variable rate loans, profitability could weaken as repo
rates have been significantly lower in 2016 compared with 2015. Although an erosion of bank profitability
owing to such factors would not soon threaten the financial soundness of banks, possible risks to the quantity
and quality of lending if profitability was compressed for an extended period require careful oversight.

Box 6. Recent Initiatives to Improve Refugee Integration
The government has introduced measures aimed at improving refugee integration. The
measures focus on speeding up introduction of the new arrivals, improving labor market access
for those with skills that are in demand, and streamlining refugee establishment efforts across
different government agencies. In particular, they include:


Introducing early language and civic training and adult education for those who have been
granted residence permits but are still living in reception centers (e.g., due to lack of housing
delaying settlement at a municipality). This measure aims at promoting early introduction and
making better use of the (currently lengthy) asylum period.



Early skills assessment offered by the PES during the period when the refugees are still in the
process of seeking asylum. This would facilitate the design of an introduction program more
appropriately tailored to individual needs.



In coordination with social partners and employers, creating “fast track” schemes to speed up
labor market matching for refugees with skills in professions with labor shortages (e.g., chefs,
teachers, nurses and physicians), and to facilitate entrepreneurship for migrants with start-up
experience.



Making schemes that combine work and training available to newly arrived immigrants, such
as “trainee jobs” and “vocational introduction employment”.



Increasing the standard compensation to municipalities for refugee reception while removing
their autonomy over settlement decisions. The latter ensures that municipalities, especially
those with housing and job availability, take sufficient responsibility for settling the refugees.



Giving resources to the county administrative boards to (i) coordinate early measures to
promote introduction during the asylum period, (ii) develop targeted measures to support the
unaccompanied minors, and (iii) strengthen reception capacity in municipalities.

More broadly, the government has identified several areas in which it needs to focus its
efforts to improve refugee reception and establishment. The Minister for Employment and
Integration has been given the mandate to coordinate policies across different ministries, with a
view to manage the refugee situation in a comprehensive manner. The identified priority areas
include, among others, (i) dealing with the housing shortages, (ii) ensuring adequate capacity,
including supply of teachers, in schools and language training and basic education programs, and
(iii) streamlining establishment efforts and creating more pathways into the labor market.
Emphasis is also placed on collaboration between different actors, including regional and county
councils, municipalities, businesses and civil society organizations.

Historical Scenario

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Sweden
Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Overall Assessment:
Sweden’s external position in 2015
was moderately stronger than the
level consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable
policies. As of September 2016,
subsequent developments do not
point to a clear change in the
external position.
Staff assesses the Sweden’s current
account norm to be relatively high
due to structural factors, including
its status as a financial center, its
role as a hub for merchanting
trade, and its fully-funded pension
schemes. Measurement issues may
also overstate current account
surpluses. There is an absence of
obvious policy distortions affecting
the current account or the
exchange rate.
Potential policy responses:
Current policies are broadly
appropriate. Monetary policy is
highly stimulatory, supporting
strong domestic demand growth
which is expected to help narrow
the current account surplus
modestly over the medium term.
Fiscal policy is accommodating
spending on migrants, making the
fiscal stance expansionary in the
near-term. A gradual fiscal
consolidation toward the mediumterm target is effectively deferred
to a period when output is
expected to exceed potential.

Appendix II. External Sector Assessment

45

SWEDEN

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Background. The Swedish net IIP rose by 4.5 percentage points in 2015 to 4.1 percent of GDP. It is expected to rise further in
the medium term, reflecting the outlook for continued current account surpluses. But in the last decade, the average increase in
the net IIP was only about 2.2 percent of GDP annually, well below the average surplus of 6.2 percent of GDP. This gap may in
part reflect negative valuation effects, but may also reflect some overstatement of the surplus as discussed below. Hence it is
appropriate to project a smaller IIP rise than the cumulative surplus.
Assessment. Gross liabilities were 266 percent of GDP in 2015, with over a third being external debt (97 percent of GDP).
Although rollovers of external debt (which include banks’ covered bonds) pose some vulnerability, risks are moderated by the
banks’ capital buffers. Sweden’s strong FX reserves and low public debt help ensure capacity to manage pressures.
Current
Background. The current account balance was 5.2 percent of GDP in 2015, modestly below its average in the past decade. Over
account
the medium term the current account is expected to gradually decline to 4.5 percent in 2021, mostly reflecting a strengthening
of domestic demand and appreciation of the krona as monetary policy normalizes.
Assessment. The cyclically-adjusted current account was 5.3 percent of GDP in 2015—in line with its average for the past
decade—but 7 percentage points above the cyclically-adjusted EBA norm of -1.9 percent of GDP. However, there are no clear
and substantial policy distortions impacting the current account. A number of factors may be behind the EBA estimated CA gap:
- A high saving rate, reinforced by pension and welfare reforms since the mid-1990s, including a shift to a defined contributions
pension scheme and a decline in social supports.
- Structural factors: (i) Sweden is identified as a systemically important financial center for the Nordic region (with banking assets
over 400 percent of GDP, of which about 170 percent of GDP in assets are outside Sweden) and (ii) the country plays a
significant role in merchanting trade, contributing about 1.7 percent of GDP on average to the trade balance since 2006.
- The surplus may be overstated, with errors and omissions contributing about 2.6 percent of GDP on average to the reported
surplus in the last decade.
Taking these factors into consideration, staff assesses Sweden’s adjusted current account norm to be around 3 to 5 percent of
GDP, implying a current account gap in the range of 0 to 2 percent of GDP in 2015.
Real exchange Background. The Swedish krona depreciated 7 percent in 2015 in real effective terms relative to its average level in 2014. As of
rate
June 2016, the REER had appreciated by 2 percent compared with its 2015 average. This appears to reflect expectations for ECB
policy easing and perhaps Sweden’s recent strong growth led markets to expect less easy Riksbank policy in future.
Assessment. EBA estimates using the REER index and level approaches suggest a gap of -20.1 and -17 percent, respectively, for
2015. However, consistent with the assessment of the CA gap, staff assesses the krona to be undervalued by 0 to 12 percent.
This REER gap is expected to be temporary, with the krona likely to appreciate once the monetary easing cycle ends.
Capital and
Background. Given their size and funding model, Sweden’s large banks remain vulnerable to liquidity risks stemming from
financial
global wholesale markets even though banks have improved their structural liquidity measures in recent years.
accounts:
Assessment. A further decline in banks’ short-term funding in favor of longer maturities is desirable over time. Macroprudential
flows and
policies, including planned increases in capital buffers of domestic banks, raising funding stability standards, and mortgage
policies
amortization regulations on the household side, can help contain vulnerabilities and hence potential liquidity risks.
FX
Background. The exchange rate is freely floating—Riksbank statements regarding their potential to intervene have not as yet
intervention
been implemented. Foreign currency reserves stood at USD 52.9 bn in August 2016, which is equivalent to about 20 percent of
and reserves
the short-term external debt of monetary and financial institutions (primarily banks) and about 11 percent of GDP.
level
Assessment. In view of the high dependence of Swedish banks on wholesale funding in foreign currency, and the disruptions in
such funding that have occurred at times of international financial distress, it would not be appropriate to reduce Sweden’s
existing reserves. A further tightening of FX liquidity requirements on banks should be evaluated.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION–SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Prepared By

The European Department

This supplement updates the staff report (SM/16/297).
1.
The Swedish authorities recently announced a political agreement on
expanding the ability of Finansinspektionen (FI) to take macroprudential measures.
The Government, together with a number of other political parties, agreed on
October 26, 2016 to expand the ability of FI to counteract financial imbalances in the
credit market. In particular, the government will introduce new legislation to provide the
FI with a formal mandate to propose new measures for the government’s approval. A
legislative proposal will be sent for public consultation by the Ministry of Finance, with
the aim for it to become effective from 2018.
2.
This agreement is a promising step toward enabling timely
macroprudential policy action, a key recommendation of the Financial System
Stability Assessment and the Article IV Staff Report. Although details are not yet
available, the agreement would appear to enable the adoption of new tools without
specific authorizing legislation, as was necessary recently in the case of the requirement
for minimum amortization of new mortgage loans. The resulting clearer and shorter
process for implementing possible new requirements on the credit market would enable
FI to act more quickly should there be a sharp increase in credit market risks. Staff notes
that this welcome strengthening of FI’s macroprudential authority should not itself delay
measures to contain vulnerabilities, such as those related to a further rise in the share of
households with high debt-to-disposable income ratios.

Statement by Mr. Thomas Ostros, Executive Director for Sweden,
and Mr. Thomas Pihl Gade, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
November 14, 2016
On behalf of the Swedish authorities would like to thank the mission teams for the
reports as well as for the open and constructive policy discussions during the FSAP
mission and Article IV consultation with Sweden. The authorities broadly agree with
the conclusions and recommendations of the staff reports.
Recent macroeconomic development and outlook
The Swedish economy is enjoying robust growth on the back of strong domestic
demand. Growth is high relative to main trading partners. Household consumption,
residential investment, and public consumption related to rising spending on migrants
have all contributed to growth. As a result, strong job creation has led to a decrease in
unemployment. Inflation has picked up as resource utilisation has increased,
supported by expansionary monetary policy. Growth is expected to moderate in 2017
as the increase in housing investments will slow due to supply constraints and public
consumption growth will be lower. Net exports are only expected to leave small
contributions to growth due to a slow international recovery.
While there is robust growth, Sweden faces challenges. Migration inflows rose sharply
in 2015, totalling 163 000 individuals, with one fifth being unaccompanied minors.
Inflows have dropped substantially in 2016, due to measures taken by Sweden, such
as temporary border controls, and measures in other countries including in the EU, but
the reception capacity is still stretched. The newly arrived must receive education and
training and then be given opportunity to start working and contributing to society.
Additionally, rapidly increasing housing prices have brought household debt to high
levels. While housing price increases have slowed recently, debt relative to income is
high and poses macroeconomic stability risks.
Financial stability and macroprudential policy
Household indebtedness and housing prices have continued to rise since Sweden’s last
FSAP in 2011, giving rise to concerns from both a macroeconomic and a financial
stability perspective. These risks should be seen in the context of a banking system
which is large relative to the Swedish economy and dependent on short-term wholesale
funding, to a large extent from abroad, adding to potential vulnerabilities. The
authorities remain cognizant of the need to be vigilant in view of these risks. At the
same time, staff analyses show that direct effects of potential declines in housing prices
on Swedish households appear limited, with FSAP stress tests suggesting that financial
institution solvency is resilient under severe scenarios.

The authorities have implemented a number of the recommendations from the FSAP in
2011, including the creation of the Financial Stability Council (FSC) and increased
resources to Finansinspektionen. A new resolution framework for credit institutions
and investment firms has also been adopted. All of these measures have contributed to
strengthening the policy and regulatory framework. At the same time, the authorities
note that more work is needed in order to further strengthen the financial stability
framework and enhance resilience in the financial system.
Macroprudential and Financial Stability Framework
Steps have been taken to tackle risks emanating from rapid credit growth and
increasing household indebtedness. An amortization requirement was recently
introduced as a measure to mitigate increased household indebtedness. It is still too
early to draw any firm conclusions of the subsequent effects of this reform. The
authorities are continuously monitoring the situation to assess whether further
measures are needed. Potential further action will have to be duly analysed in advance
of implementation. The authorities make somewhat different judgements on the
timing of further measures, as illustrated in the Authorities’ Views in the Article IV
report.
The authorities agree that it is important to ensure a clear legal mandate for
macroprudential policy. Finansinspektionen has been designated as the
macroprudential authority to apply a range of macroprudential tools. Additionally, the
Government has in October, together with the centre-right parties and the Left Party,
agreed to expand the ability of Finansinspektionen to take measures to counteract
financial imbalances on the credit market. The agreement means that
Finansinspektionen will receive a formal mandate, enabling it to draw up proposals for
additional tools that will then be approved by the Government. The new framework
should ensure swifter implementation of potential measures. As to the role of the
Riksbank in financial stability, a future parliamentary inquiry will revert with possible
proposals for clarifying the Riksbank’s responsibilities.
The authorities note the recommendations with respect to the FSC. Although the
authorities aim to make best use of the FSC and welcome suggestions to increase
inter-agency cooperation on crisis preparedness, it is not possible under the Swedish
constitution for the FSC to make recommendations to Finansinspektionen (or any
other public authority) entailing a comply or explain obligation.
Prudential Supervision
The Government concurs with the need to ensure that adequate resources are allocated
for prudential supervision. In this context, it can be noted that in the recent budget bill,
Finansinspektionen is allocated increased resources as a result of being tasked with
additional responsibilities resulting from new legislation and the need to strengthen
existing activities, primarily supervision. The appropriation is continuously reviewed
under the yearly budget process.

The Swedish authorities note the recognition that the supervision and oversight of
Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) has been effective in improving risk
management practices in Swedish FMIs. The Swedish authorities agree with the
recommendations of the importance of crisis preparedness, meaning that further
enhancements should be made and work has already been initiated, in line with the
recommendations.
On recommendations regarding the introduction of a leverage ratio, the Government
notes that this will be part of the upcoming negotiations on revised capital requirement
rules within the EU, which should ensure a timely adoption. The Riksbank, however,
prefers an early introduction of a leverage ratio as a backstop. As regards banks’
foreign exchange liquidity requirements, the authorities welcome analytical
considerations on the need for a further tightening. At the same time, the Government
notes that Swedish liquidity coverage ratio implementation exceeds international
norms and is already focused on requirements in foreign currencies.
Crisis readiness, management, and resolution
The cooperation between the relevant authorities in Sweden regarding crisis
preparedness and crisis management has historically functioned well. Given the recent
introduction of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) into Swedish
legislation, the authorities are in agreement with the recommendation for further
measures and resources to ensure operational capacity of the new framework in order
to rapidly be able to deploy recovery and resolution tools. Work is already underway in
this area. In addition, since the FSAP mission, a first crisis-simulation exercise was
held under the auspices of the FSC, fostering stronger crisis preparedness and interagency cooperation.
The authorities also agree with the need to expedite work on resolution planning for
systemic financial institutions and the resolution handbook. As a part of this work,
analysis of the liquidity provision to a bank in resolution, including Emergency
Liquidity Assistance (ELA), will be considered.
The authorities can see the merits with swap agreements between central banks and
agree that such should be endeavoured. However, swap agreements cannot be a
substitute for liquidity coverage in foreign currency at the level of the individual bank,
a strong financial sector and an adequate level of foreign exchange reserves. Several
of these aspects are currently under review by the Government. The issue of
indemnification of losses related to ELA is also important in this regard. The
aforementioned parliamentary inquiry will be tasked with reporting on the need for an
explicit guarantee for any losses relating to ELA.
Regional cooperation
Financial integration in the Nordic-Baltic area is extensive, making it essential to have
strong cross-border cooperation arrangements. The Nordic-Baltic Stability Group has
recently been revamped under Swedish leadership and the authorities are planning for a

regional crisis- simulation exercise in the near future. The Nordic-Baltic
Macroprudential Forum, created in 2011 between central banks and supervisory
authorities, is continuing its work on financial stability risks and macroprudential
policy. The authorities remain committed to continuing to deepen the already strong
regional cooperation.
Monetary policy
Monetary policy has contributed to the positive development of the Swedish economy,
with high GDP growth, rising inflation, and long-term inflation expectations
increasing towards the inflation target. The expansionary measures have had an effect
on market interest rates, households’ and companies’ financial conditions and on the
exchange rate that is broadly in line with expectations. The negative interest rate has,
so far, not impaired the functioning of the financial system, and no major adverse
effects directly linked to the unconventional monetary policy have been observed. The
Riksbank is continuously monitoring the effects of the low interest rates on the
financial system.
In 2014/2015 inflation continued to undershoot the inflation target after having done so
for several years and inflation expectations were trending downwards. At the same
time, monetary policy in the euro area was entering into a new phase, with a new
program of large- scale asset purchases – measures that risked putting even more
downward pressure on inflation in Sweden via a stronger exchange rate. The Riksbank
therefore needed to undertake further expansionary monetary policy measures, in
order to ensure that inflation increased towards the target and long-term inflation
expectations remained anchored around the inflation target. The repo rate has since the
beginning of 2015 been lowered in four steps to -0.50%, and so far the Riksbank has
announced government bond purchases of SEK 245 bn.
Swedish monetary policy also needs to relate to the low level of international interest
rates. Global economic developments and the monetary policy decisions of the large
central banks affect financial conditions in Sweden, and therefore the scope for a further
increase in inflation. The krona exchange rate is an important channel for how monetary
policy abroad affects the Swedish economy. So far this year, the exchange rate has been
weaker than expected, but the Riksbank assesses that it will slowly strengthen in coming
years. This gradual strengthening of the krona is assessed to be consistent with inflation
increasing towards the inflation target. But a too rapid strengthening of the exchange
rate can lead to slower growth in the prices of import-related goods and services, and to
a lower demand for Swedish exports. Such a development would make it more difficult
for the Riksbank to attain the inflation target. Since inflation has been low for a long
time, it is crucial that the strengthening of the krona is slow.
Monetary policy is, thus, continuing to support the upturn in inflation. However,
considerable uncertainty about the global economy, and uncertainty about how fast
inflation will increase, necessitates a high level of preparedness to quickly make
monetary policy even more expansionary if necessary. The Riksbank has clearly

communicated that there is still scope for further cutting the repo rate and to expand
the purchases of securities. There are also additional tools, described in the Riksbank’s
Monetary Policy Reports, which the Riksbank can use if the upturn in inflation is
threatened. The expansionary monetary policy underlines the Riksbank’s aim to
safeguard the role of the inflation target as a nominal anchor for price setting and wage
formation.
However, the Swedish authorities share the IMF’s view that even though monetary
policy needs to be expansionary to get inflation back to target, there are risks
associated with long periods of very low interest rates, such as increased risk-taking
on the financial markets and potential overvaluation of assets. Housing prices are
rising faster than income and household debt is increasing, making households and
banks more vulnerable. A heavily-increased reporate would certainly slow down the
build‐up of debts, but at the cost of a rapid appreciation of the krona, lower inflation,
and higher unemployment. It is therefore essential to implement targeted measures
within macroprudential policy, housing policy, and fiscal policy to limit the
accumulation of debt by households.
Fiscal policy
The Government agrees with staff’s fiscal assessment, that accommodating the sharp
rise in migration-related costs is appropriate. The unprecedented increase of refugees in
2015 has p u t an upward pressure on expenditure in the short run. It is reasonable to
allow exceptional and temporary events of this kind to be accommodated without
requiring short-term contractionary budgetary measures. Public debt is low and
estimated to be on a downward trend as percent of GDP. This provides fiscal space to
accommodate these expenditure increases in a socially and economically responsible
way, without jeopardizing the long-term sustainability of public finances.
The Government intends to pursue a prudent fiscal policy in the coming years, without
jeopardizing the economy´s long term growth prospects. Refugee-related expenditure is
still expected to be substantial in 2016 and 2017, but will then decline in the following
years. The general government fiscal position is estimated to improve with unchanged
policies so as to be in near balance in 2018 and reach a surplus of 1.5 percent of GDP
in 2020.
The Government agrees with staff that the parliamentary committee agreement on the
surplus target is welcome. The committee agreed to recommend that the target,
currently at 1 percent of GDP over the cycle, should be reduced to one third of a
percent of GDP. It also agreed to recommend a debt anchor to be introduced. The
fiscal policy framework has served Sweden well and the proposed changes will further
strengthen the framework.

Structural issues
Labor market policy
The Swedish labor market is performing well. Unemployment is falling and the
employment rate is the highest in the EU. Despite this there are too many unemployed.
The objective of the Government’s employment policy is to reduce unemployment so
that it will be the lowest in the EU by 2020.
Although the influx of refugees has declined in 2016, staff assesses that there are
significant hurdles to integrating the large stock of asylum seekers. The Government is
well aware of the challenge the recent influx of refugees implies. Foreign born
individuals between 16 and 74 years old represented 20 percent of the Swedish
population in 2015, out of which 25 percent has only primary education. At the same
time, the share of low-skilled is as high as 48 percent in the group of newly-arrived that
participate in the introductory activities at the Public Employment Services. The
Government offers the newly arrived several alternative paths for adult education and
agrees with the IMF on the importance of recent education initiatives.
There are different ways to make workers more attractive in the labor market. The
Government agrees that recent initiatives to make trainee jobs and vocational
introduction employment programs available for the newly arrived migrants and
increase resources for basic education and vocational training are essential. Another
alternative is to offer subsidized employment during the first years in the country
while the individuals learn the language and adapt to the Swedish labor market. The
Government agrees with the IMF on the effectiveness of employment subsidy
programs and is analyzing how to streamline the numerous programs.
Regarding the discussion on entry wages, wage formation in Sweden is the
responsibility of the social partners. This arrangement has contributed to stability and
wage development in line with productivity in the last two decades.
Household debt and housing
The Government shares the IMF’s view that addressing the high household debt and
housing prices is an economic challenge. How to curb the rising debt levels is a delicate
matter as the Government does not want to trigger a rapid decline in housing prices. The
Government’s approach is two folded. It is important to increase the supply of housing
and, if needed, take further measures directed at the mortgage market. The amortization
requirement was introduced less than half a year ago, and before further steps are taken
the Government wants to assess its effects on house prices and mortgage growth.

The design of the tax system is one of many factors that can influence levels of
household debt. Any potential measures in this area must be seen in a long-term
perspective and therefore need to be based on a broad political consensus. Changes
must be handled with great care, due to the potential negative effects on growth. Taxes
can also influence the number of transactions in the housing market. The Government
has proposed a temporary removal of the threshold for deferring capital gains tax. This
reform will give greater incentives to move in the near future for those with high
capital gains, often older persons who have lived in their current house for a longer
period. The reform is expected to lead to a larger number of transactions and a better
allocation on the housing market.
The Government agrees that adequate supply of land is a necessary precondition to
sustain the construction of new dwellings at a high level. In the budget bill for 2017 the
Government has declared more thoroughly its intention to regulate the quantitative
aspect of the municipalities planning for housing. In a short-term perspective the supply
of qualified labour within the building and planning sector is the most notable
constraint. A public inquiry is evaluating the situation and will present its
recommendations later this year.
