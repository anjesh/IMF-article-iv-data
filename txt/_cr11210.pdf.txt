REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO
Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation and
the Initiation of a Staff-Monitored Program
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2011 Consultation with the Republic of Kosovo
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Jan Kees Martijn
June 21, 2011
KEY ISSUES
Setting. Kosovo is a young country still in the process of building key social and economic
institutions. Assets include a young population, cost-effective social security systems, and low public
debt. Growth in the past decade has been robust but tilted towards domestic demand, funded by
remittances and foreign direct investment from Kosovars living abroad. Social challenges loom large,
with about 40 percent of the workforce unemployed. Fiscal policy is increasingly under strain as it
addresses rising capital and social spending needs from a limited revenue base. The financial system
has evolved rapidly but maintained a sound funding structure.
Article IV topics. Discussions focused on policies to (i) enhance competitiveness to support the
emergence of a tradable sector and promote self-sustained growth, through administrative and legal
reforms, better infrastructure, and wage restraint, (ii) restore fiscal sustainability by exercising
restraint on current spending and raising more permanent revenue, including from direct taxes, and
(iii) safeguard financial stability and foster the development of the financial sector. The authorities
and staff largely agreed on the key themes.
Staff-monitored program (SMP). An 18-month Stand-By Arrangement approved by the Executive
Board in July 2010 went off track in 2011, reflecting inter alia large increases in public sector wages.
On this mission, the authorities and staff reached understandings on a SMP until end-2011. It includes
important steps towards restoring fiscal sustainability and strengthening budget planning and
execution. Successful implementation would create a track record of sound fiscal management that
could pave the way to a program endorsed by the IMF Executive Board in 2012.
-------------------Mission team: Messrs. Wiegand (head), Castro, Druck (all EUR), Alper (FAD), and Lanau (SPR)
visited Pristina May 17–30. The mission met with Prime Minister Hashim Thaçi, Minister of Finance
Bedri Hamza, Central Bank Governor Gani Gerguri, other government officials, parliamentarians,
private sector representatives, the head of the International Civilian Office Pieter Feith, and other
envoys representing the international community. Messrs. Sulemane (Resident Representative) and
Domi (Economist in the Resident Representative’s Office) assisted the mission. Mr. Kiekens (OED)
attended the concluding meeting.
Publication: The authorities have agreed to publication of the staff report.

I. CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. The Setting
1.
Kosovo is a young country still in the process of building key social and
economic institutions. For much of the 2000s Kosovo was under the administration of the
United Nations. In 2008 it declared independence, and in June 2009 Kosovo became the
186th member of the IMF. While international institutions, notably the International Civilian
Office (ICO) and the rule of law mission of the European Union (EULEX), still play some
role, Kosovo is today mostly self-governed (Box 1). Efforts to build core functions of a
public administration and strengthen governance have over the years benefitted from
considerable external assistance, including from the World Bank, the European Union, the
United States, and the IMF (Box 2).
2.
Kosovo’s economic performance over the past decade has been robust, even
though growth has been heavily tilted towards domestic demand, fuelled by transfers
and non-debt creating capital inflows (Figure 1). Large remittances from Kosovars living
abroad boosted consumption, while foreign direct investment fuelled activity in particular in
the services sector and in construction. By contrast, Kosovo’s (labeled “UVK” below) export
sector has remained small, even by regional standards, and produces mostly
low-valued-added products, especially base metals. Per-capita GDP remains at one of the
lowest levels in Europe. Social challenges loom large, with unemployment estimated at more
than 40 percent of the workforce, although much of this arguably reflects informal
employment.

Kosovo has unilaterally adopted the euro as its legal tender. While this supports
stability by providing a strong monetary anchor and has generally served the economy well,
it places a premium on disciplined macroeconomic policies, the maintenance of competitive
wage levels, and flexibility to react to external shocks through internal adjustment. The
absence of an independent monetary policy also implies that fiscal policy is the main
instrument for domestic demand management.

5
4.
Kosovo’s financial system has expanded rapidly in the 2000s, but—in contrast to
other countries in the region—has avoided the build-up of large funding imbalances
(Figure 2). Financial assets as a share of GDP more than doubled from 33 percent in 2003 to
73 percent in 2010 (Box 3). The financial system is dominated by banks, most of them
foreign owned, and is largely deposit funded, in part from remittances. As a result, the
Kosovar banking system enjoys one of the most conservative loan-to-deposit ratios in the
region. Supported by technical assistance, the central bank has gradually taken over the
responsibility for financial supervision, and it is building the capacity to provide emergency
liquidity assistance (ELA) to banks if needed. In a fully euroized economy such as Kosovo’s,
the funds for ELA stem mostly from deposits of the government at the central bank.
5.
During most of the 2000s, Kosovo pursued a conservative fiscal policy. The
potential for fiscal expansion was constrained by limited administrative capacity, the narrow
coverage of domestic tax instruments—especially direct taxes—and the government’s
inability to issue debt. As a result, Kosovo enjoys not only low levels of public debt,1 but the
government also holds cash buffers in the form of deposits with the central bank.
Government spending as a share of GDP is modest compared to Kosovo’s neighbors, owing
in part to a low level of transfers. This reflects on the one hand Kosovo’s young population2
and on the other the fact that many social security systems schemes were rebuilt after 1999,
notably the pension system. More generally, Kosovo does not bear a burden of large
long-term obligations—to pensioners, veterans, or creditors—that threaten the finances of
any neighboring countries.

Kosovo owes 5 percent of GDP to the World Bank, and another 0.8 percent of GDP to the IMF and
Germany’s KfW. A final determination of Kosovo’s share in the debt of former Yugoslavia is still outstanding.

6
B. Recent Developments
6.
The global financial crisis had only a modest impact on Kosovo, owing in part to
limited integration into international financial and goods markets.


Real GDP growth slowed from close to 7 percent in 2008 to about 3 percent in 2009,
before recovering to 4 percent in 2010 (Tables 1 and 2, Figure 3). This contrasts with
many countries in the region where activity contracted. The solid growth performance
owed much to robust domestic demand, which was buttressed by higher government
spending as well as remittances and non-debt creating capital inflows from the
diaspora (Table 3). Many Kosovars live in Germany and Switzerland, countries in
which growth and employment held up relatively well. By contrast, in many
neighboring countries sharp capital flow reversals forced disruptive current account
adjustments through a compression of domestic demand. At the same time, Kosovo’s
small export base limited the impact of weak demand in trading partner countries.



Inflation fell into negative territory in 2009, reflecting lower import prices for food
and gasoline, but has since recovered. Core inflation remained well behaved
throughout the crisis.



Growth in credit to the private sector slowed from more than 30 percent in 2007–08
to about 13 percent in 2009–10 (Table 4, Figure 4). The quality of bank assets
deteriorated only modestly. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) increased to 5.9 percent in
March 2011 from 3.3 percent at end-2008 (Table 5). High coverage of NPLs through
provisions and an aggregate capital adequacy ratio of 18 percent suggest that banks
continue to have large shock-absorbing capacity. They have also remained liquid and
profitable.

7.
Since 2008, growth in government expenditures accelerated, with the resulting
deficits financed from accumulated savings, the sale of assets, and donor support
(Figure 5). As a result, the general government balance shifted from a surplus of more than
7 percent of GDP in 2007 to a deficit of 2.6 percent in 2010. Capital spending has been the

7
main driver of this expansion. Last year, construction started on a highway connecting
Pristina with Albania’s border, with total costs estimated at more than 20 percent of annual
GDP spread over a period of 4 years. The central government would be subject to large
penalties in case of rephasing if, for example, the necessary land expropriations proceed less
rapidly than planned, which adds considerable risks to the fiscal outlook. In 2011, the
government increased public sector wages and benefits for war invalids and their families
between 30 and 50 percent; additional, potentially costly spending initiatives are in
preparation (see below).
8.
An 18-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) was approved by the IMF Executive
Board on July 21, 2010, but went off track in 2011. The program supported by the SBA
was built around (i) restraint on current spending, higher revenues and privatization receipts
to contain the impact on the investment program on the overall deficit, and (ii) bolstering the
government’s deposits with the Central Bank to build buffers for fiscal and financial
contingencies (Box 4). The 2011 budget adopted by the newly constituted Assembly deviated
from the budget agreed in the context of the SBA, notably the large public sector wage
increases. Unfunded social spending initiatives with unclear budgetary impacts posed
additional risks to fiscal sustainability. As a result, no review under the program could be
completed.
II. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
The short-term economic outlook is benign, even though high food prices put
upward pressure on inflation.


Growth. Continued robust remittances inflows, solid credit growth, especially to
households, and the increase in public sector wages are projected to support
consumption, while public investment and FDI are expected to remain fervent.
Anecdotal evidence suggests especially strong construction activity. Exports are
growing fast, although from a low base. Staff projects real growth at 5.3 percent in
2011 and 5 percent in 2012.



Inflation. Consumer price inflation is projected to rise temporarily to more than
8 percent (annual average), boosted by rising prices for imported food and gasoline,
but would return to levels consistent with euroization once commodities prices
stabilize. While thus far there are few indications of a pass-through to core inflation,
developments have to be watched carefully, in particular as the increase in public
sector salaries may affect private sector wage dynamics.

8


External balance. The current account deficit is projected to increase to 25 percent of
GDP in 2011, reflecting higher import prices and highway-related imports. It is
expected to be financed mostly by FDI and other non-debt creating inflows.3

10.
For the medium term, staff projects real GDP growth to converge to 4½ percent.
The GDP deflator would increase at a rate of slightly below 2 percent, in line with euro area
inflation, while consumer price inflation would fluctuate around the deflator in line with
import prices. The long-term sustainable current account deficit is estimated at about
15 percent of GDP, financed to a large extent with non-debt creating inflows.
11.
The economic outlook is subject to large downside risks, from both domestic and
external sources.


Domestic risks include the potential for political turbulences that could trigger higher
government spending pressures, putting confidence in fiscal management at risk. A
marked slowdown in construction activity is another risk.



External risks relate in particular to weaker growth in Europe, which could be
triggered, for example, by an intensification of the euro area debt crisis. This could
depress incomes of Kosovars living abroad, thus reducing transfers and FDI inflows,
which, in turn, would force a contraction in domestic demand. Lower inflows and
remittances could also have a negative impact on the public finances, by decreasing
the yield from consumption taxes, and on the banking system, by reducing both
deposits and the capacity of debtors to service their debts. A small-probability risk is
that of liquidity strains for Western European parent banks of Kosovar subsidiaries
triggering liquidity outflows from Kosovo’s banking system. If large enough, such
outflows could constrain credit growth.



In case of a marked slowdown, the scope for countercyclical policies would be
limited, given Kosovo’s already stretched fiscal position.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Strengthening External Competitiveness and Fostering Self-Sustained Growth

12.
Staff emphasized—and the authorities concurred—that Kosovo’s growth model
needs reorientation. To date growth has relied mostly on exceptionally high remittances and
FDI, but the authorities acknowledged that the longer-term prospects for these flows were
subdued as diaspora Kosovars integrate more closely into their host countries. There was
consensus that going forward, the key challenge was the emergence of a tradable sector that
would drive economic development and growth.

3

Kosovo’s current account deficit may be overestimated due to underreporting of cash transfers.

9
13.
Staff and the authorities agreed that numerous constraints were impeding the
development of a tradable sector (Figure 6). Public infrastructure is lacking, notably in
transport and energy. The business climate is hampered by limited administrative and
judiciary capacity. Education and skill levels of large parts of the population are low,
reflecting inter alia severe disruptions in the public provision of education prior to
independence. Severe data limitations preclude a

14.
The government’s recently adopted economic development strategy contains
important steps in the right direction. Key pillars are administrative and legal reforms to
improve Kosovo’s ranking in the World Bank’s “Doing Business” survey; support for the
agricultural sector; and the government’s ambitious highway construction program, although
the fiscal burdens arising from these projects need to be managed carefully (see below). Staff
commended the authorities’ intention to privatize energy distribution and generation in
2011–12, with technical assistance from the World Bank. Progress in this area is critical to
improve the quality and reliability of energy supply, and to limit costs to the budget.
15.
Staff emphasized that the impact of government policies on labor costs needed to
be watched carefully. It noted that the sharp increase in public sector salaries this year may
trigger undesired spillovers to private sector wages. Moreover, staff underscored that the
minimum wage level suggested by the Socio-Economic Committee commission of
€170 per month was high relative to both minimum wages in neighboring countries and
Kosovo’s average wage level. As a result, an even larger share of the labor force could be
pushed out of formal employment, especially younger workers—a concern shared by World
Bank staff. The authorities replied that they saw scope for a lower minimum wage for
younger workers.
B. Restoring Fiscal Sustainability
16.
The authorities and staff agreed that fiscal policy should be anchored by two
complementary objectives: adequate liquidity management and sustainability of public
debt.


Liquidity management. There was agreement that in a euroized economy, bank
balances of the government with the Central Bank of Kosovo (CBK) were needed not
only to satisfy the government’s liquidity needs, but also to make resources available

10
to the central bank to provide emergency liquidity assistance if needed. Staff
suggested that an adequate yardstick was one month of government expenditure plus
one-tenth of banks’ non-equity liabilities, resulting in targeted cash buffers of about
€300 million (about 6 percent of GDP).4


Debt sustainability. Staff suggested targeting a very gradual increase of public debt
that would allow public debt to stabilize at ratio of about 30 percent of GDP in the
long-term. The authorities noted that Kosovo’s public debt law prescribes a maximum
public debt ratio of 40 percent of GDP, thus, the targeted long-term level leaves the
government room to react to external or growth shocks. To achieve this objective,
staff advised to target a medium-term primary deficit of about ½ percent of GDP.

17.
Staff pointed out that Kosovo’s current fiscal stance was inconsistent with either
objective (Tables 6, 7). Liquidity management was complicated by the large outlays on the
highway—about €300 million (6 percent of GDP) per year until 2013—that give rise to large
albeit temporary deficits. One option in principle was to issue domestic debt, but the amounts
that can be placed would likely be limited, given that Kosovo has not yet built an adequate
macroeconomic track record. As regards sustainability, staff estimates the underlying
primary deficit at 3½ percent of GDP, although any such estimate is dependent on uncertain
assumptions about long-term capital spending.5 Thus, the implied fiscal adjustment need is
close to 3 percent of GDP.
18.
Specifically, while in 2011 fiscal challenges appeared manageable, in 2012 bank
balances would likely fall below desired levels in the absence of disbursements from
IFIs and/or fiscal adjustment.


Revenue. Tax revenues have evolved well thus far in 2011Q1, growing by about
one-quarter compared to Q1 2010. The authorities emphasized, that while some of
this improvement owed to inflation, structural factors such as improved revenue
collection and better tax payer compliance also played a part, measures often taken in
response to IMF technical assistance.



Spending. The public sector wage hike (that took effect in March) is projected to
raise current expenditures permanently by about 1 percent of GDP. In this year’s
budget, the increase is partly compensated by lower capital spending.



Staff projects the overall deficit for 2011 corresponding to these policies at
5.7 percent of GDP, with receipts from the privatization of the post and telecom
operator (PTK) being the main source of deficit financing. The authorities stated that

4

The central bank has also some own resources for ELA, notably central bank capital and reserves. Overall,
available resources add up to 15–20 percent of total bank deposits.
5

The underlying deficit excludes (temporary) highway expenditures. 3½ percent of GDP is the medium-term
primary deficit that would result without fiscal adjustment.

11
the sale is on schedule to be finalized by the end of the year. Bank balances would
remain close to adequate levels in 2011, but staff emphasized that, on unchanged
policies, the government’s cash buffers were likely to be depleted by end-2012.
19.
Against this background, the authorities and staff agreed that fiscal adjustment
was needed of about ¾ of a percent of GDP annually over a period of four years. This
would safeguard both adequate liquidity buffers and a sustainable fiscal stance, provided
international assistance would resume in 2012. Specifically, bank balances could be
maintained at levels around €300 million, and by 2014 the fiscal stance would be close to
debt-stabilizing levels. Adjustment should come primarily from higher revenues and restraint
on current spending.

20.
Several policy initiatives in the pipeline would create additional but
difficult-to-assess fiscal costs. The authorities and staff agreed that fiscal burdens from these
initiatives would need to be compensated by potentially substantial additional adjustment
elsewhere.


As regards capital spending, the government is considering a second highway from
Pristina to Skopje/Macedonia. Staff cautioned that this would require careful
evaluation. In particular, a thorough cost-benefit analysis and a sound and transparent
financing plan consistent with fiscal sustainability were indispensible prerequisites;
especially in view of the fiscal risks created by the ongoing highway construction
project to Albania.



As for social policy initiatives, the government’s priorities include a pension for war
veterans and benefits for former political prisoners. Staff argued—and the authorities
agreed—that more work was needed to identify eligible beneficiaries before such
benefits could be adequately designed and costed, with staff pointing to the negative
experiences of the Federal Republic of Bosnia with war related benefits (Box 6).



An employer-employee financed health care fund could—depending on the
design—also have fiscal implications, although the authorities insisted that the only

12
spending item would be relatively limited employer contributions for public sector
employees.
21.
More generally, staff argued that the ambitiousness of the government’s
spending plans required a strategic reorientation of fiscal priorities. The current model
of funding additional expenditures mostly with one-off revenues was unsustainable to the
extent that spending pressures were permanent. In this case, a higher level of permanent
revenues was needed. One option would be to increase the low yield from direct taxes. In this
context, the authorities expressed interest in close cooperation with an upcoming IMF
technical assistance mission on tax policy.
22.
The authorities and staff agreed that Kosovo’s system of fiscal decentralization
needs amendments. A well-designed system of budgetary grants leaves adequate funds for
municipalities, but there are little incentives for municipalities to raise own-source revenue,
which results in exceptionally low municipal tax rates (Box 7). Staff recommended raising
the minimum rate on the property tax that is collected by municipalities, and reducing central
government grants accordingly. The authorities agreed in principle, but noted that such a
reform required careful preparation—notably a revision of the grants system.
23.
Staff warned against using unorthodox funding measures to fill financing gaps.
In particular, the existing stock of assets held by the Kosovar pillar II pension fund should
not be used to fund the fiscal deficit, although going forward a part of new inflows into the
fund could be used to purchase government paper, in line with existing legislation. Staff also
warned against accumulating large amounts of nonconcessional debt. While such actions
could alleviate short-term financing constraints, they would make financing of the budget
over the medium term more difficult.

The authorities and staff agreed that while Kosovo’s financial system had

25.
The authorities underscored that they are improving a property cadastre with
support from the World Bank, especially in rural areas. One objective of this initiative is
to increase the use of collateral. Staff noted that reforms to speed up contract enforcement by
the courts were also needed, especially with respect to seizing collateral in case of loan
defaults.
26.
Staff emphasized that full institutional and operational independence of the
central bank is critical for preserving financial stability. In this context staff noted that
the appointment of a new central bank governor earlier this year was characterized by a clean
implementation of the nomination rules under the law.
27.
The authorities pointed to progress made in the area of financial supervision.
The superintendency of banks follows a risk-based supervision model under the framework
of Basel I, assessing banks according to CAMELS indicators (capital, asset quality,
management, earnings, liquidity, and risk sensitivity). For subsidiaries of foreign banks this
assessment is carried out jointly with home country supervisors.6 It contains at least one
comprehensive on-site inspection per bank each year as well as permanent off-site
surveillance. Significant advances are also being made in the area of stress-testing, with an
in-house stress-testing model being developed.
28.
Passage of the new banking law, envisaged for September, is expected to
strengthen the institutional framework for banks and microfinance institutions. The
draft law enhances governance standards, introduces tighter restrictions for lending to
bank-related parties, and allows for consolidated supervision of banking groups. It will also
ensure that the authorities have adequate tools for bank resolution. Staff recommended
enhancing the deposit insurance law such that funds of the Deposit Insurance Fund of
Kosovo can be used for purchase and assumption transactions. As regards microfinance
institutions, the authorities and staff agreed that the law should assign the CBK the
responsibility for licensing and require microfinance institutions to have a clearly defined
ownership structure. Microfinance institutions hold less than 5 percent of the financial
system’s assets, but play an important role in reaching parts of the population with limited
access to banking services.
29.
The authorities and staff agreed that a priority was to build the capacity to
provide emergency liquidity assistance to the banking system. At the conceptual level,
ELA was introduced in 2010 with the approval of the new central bank law. Going forward, a
memorandum of understanding between the government and the central bank is required to
establish a designated account of government deposits at the central bank whose resources
are earmarked for ELA.

The parent of the largest bank, ProCredit Kosovo, is in the process of applying for a bank license. Once this
has been granted it will be subject to supervision by BaFin.

14
IV. THE STAFF-MONITORED PROGRAM
30.
The authorities and staff reached understandings on a staff-monitored program
(SMP) until end-2011. The SMP is an informal agreement with staff to monitor the
implementation of the authorities’ economic program, and aims at establishing a track record
of strong performance that could lead to an IMF-supported program in 2012. It does not
entail endorsement by the IMF Executive Board and does not involve financial assistance by
the IMF. The SMP is guided by quantitative and structural benchmarks as described in the
attached Letter of Intent (LOI) and has two test dates, end-September and end-December
2011.
31.
The SMP’s primary objective is to take decisive steps towards restoring fiscal
sustainability and improving budget execution and monitoring. Key elements include:


Fiscal adjustment of ¾ percent of GDP in 2011, through a mix of excise increases and
restraint on current spending, notably the wage bill, which allows for bank balances
of above €300 million by the end of the year (LOI ¶¶11, 12);



A contingency reserve in case the privatization of PTK is delayed, by not-allocating
capital expenditures and transfers until a winner of the privatization bid is announced
(LOI ¶12);



In-depth fiscal impact assessments of the war veterans pension and benefits for
political prisoners prior to designing these benefits and fitting them into a sustainable
medium-term framework (LOI ¶13);



Introduction of an automatic adjustment clause into all new laws and amendments to
laws that create new benefit that explicitly allows cutting benefits in case there are
insufficient budgetary funds (LOI ¶15);



Commitment to a budget for 2012 that contains another ¾ of a percent in GDP of
fiscal adjustment, partly from the wage bill, and is agreed with IMF staff (LOI ¶15);



Enhanced program monitoring that is upgraded to the ministerial level (LOI ¶38).

The authorities’ fiscal program is complemented by structural reforms to strengthen tax
administration (LOI ¶¶21–25), public financial management (LOI ¶¶26–28), financial sector
policies (LOI ¶¶30–34), competitiveness (LOI ¶¶35, 36) and energy sector policies
(LOI ¶37).
32.
Risks to the SMP are considerable. As regards implementation risk, the
government’s determination to curtail spending and refrain from unfunded spending
commitments could again be tested by domestic political pressures. A key short-term
financing risk is a possible delay of the privatization of PTK, although the contingency
reserve built into the SMP should warrant that the government has sufficient liquid funds to
finance its operations.

15
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Kosovo has made major inroads in the past decade in building key social and
economic institutions, but progress is incomplete. Significant additional efforts are needed
to enhance competitiveness of the economy, strengthen fiscal sustainability and safeguard
financial stability.
34.
The short-term macroeconomic outlook is benign, even though there are
significant downside risks. Kosovo enjoyed robust economic growth in the 2000s and has
weathered the global financial crisis well, owing to limited integration into global financial
and goods markets. Going forward, domestic demand continues to be supported by
remittances and non-debt creating inflows, much of it financing construction activity. Risks
include both domestic policy missteps and a slowdown in advanced Europe, which could
curtail remittances and therefore domestic demand.
35.
Kosovo’s growth model needs reorientation. To date growth has relied on
exceptionally high transfers from abroad and FDI, fuelling construction and activity in the
services sector, but longer-term prospects for these flows are subdued as diaspora Kosovars
integrate more closely into their host countries. Going forward, the key challenge is fostering
the emergence of a tradable sector that could drive economic development and growth and
help reduce unemployment. Reforms are needed to upgrade public infrastructure, improve
the business climate, and maintain competitive wage levels.
36.
The unilateral adoption of the euro provides a strong monetary anchor and has
served the economy well, but it increases the demands on macroeconomic management.
In particular, the currency regime places a premium on disciplined fiscal policies,
competitive wage levels, and flexibility of the economy to adjust to external shocks.
Moreover, full-scale euroization implies that the government—rather than the central bank—
needs to provide a large part of the resources for emergency liquidity assistance to the
financial system.
37.
Kosovo benefits from low public debt and sizeable government cash buffers,
owing to a conservative fiscal policy for most of 2000s. Moreover, government expenditure
as a share of GDP is modest, owing in part to low spending on transfers. More generally,
Kosovo does not bear large burdens of long-term obligations to pensioners, veterans, or
creditors, in contrast to many countries in the region, an advantage that should be maintained.
38.
The switch to an expansionary fiscal stance since the late 2000s is unsustainable
and risks encountering financing constraints in the absence of fiscal adjustment.
Ambitious capital and social spending projects are increasingly financed from one-off
revenues or by drawing down cash buffers, as Kosovo’s revenue base has not kept pace with
the expansion in expenditure. In the short term, disciplined budget execution and financial
management is pivotal to safeguard sound public finances. Any future capital or social
spending initiatives should be carefully designed and costed, and accompanied by

16
compensating revenue and/or expenditure measures as needed to ensure the fiscal position
remains compatible with sustainability. The accumulation of large amounts of commercial
debt should be avoided. In the medium term a reorientation of fiscal priorities is needed,
which includes raising more revenue from direct taxes.
39.
While Kosovo’s banking system has developed in a sound manner, further
progress is impeded by limited legal capacity and incompletely defined property rights.
The central bank has made important advances in the area of financial supervision. Going
forward, a priority is to build the capacity to provide emergency liquidity assistance to the
banking system.
40.
The Staff-Monitored Program until end-2011 agreed between the authorities
and IMF staff is an opportunity to take decisive steps towards restoring fiscal
sustainability and reversing policies that caused the 2010 Stand-By Arrangement to go off
track Key components of the SMP are fiscal adjustment of ¾ of a percent of GDP, and
strengthened budgetary planning and execution. Steadfast and successful implementation is
vital to pave the way for a program endorsed by the IMF Executive Board in 2012.
41.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Kosovo be held on
the standard 12-month cycle.

17

Box 1. The Constitutional and Political Setting
In 1999 UN Security Council authorized the Secretary-General to establish an international
civil presence in Kosovo. The United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) was given
executive responsibilities under four “pillars:” police and justice, civil administration,
institution building, and reconstruction. As local capacities increased, UNMIK’s powers were
gradually transferred to the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government. UNMIK relinquished
remaining powers upon the entry into force of Kosovo’s constitution.
Following independence in 2008, a European Union rule of law mission (EULEX) was
deployed to Kosovo and an International Civilian Office (ICO) established. The principal task
of EULEX is to assist the judicial authorities and law enforcement agencies to establish
sustainable and accountable institutions and practices. The ICO assists in drafting legislation
and regulations on social and economic matters.
In 2010 the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion that Kosovo’s declaration
of independence did not violate international law. More than 70 countries have recognized
Kosovo thus far, among them all of Kosovo’s immediate neighbors except Serbia. In 2009
Kosovo joined the World Bank and the IMF, but it is not yet a member of the United Nations.
Hashim Thaçi, head of the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and a former political leader of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, has been Prime Minister since 2007. Until 2010 he led a
coalition government consisting mainly of the PDK and the Democratic League of Kosovo
(LDK). In October 2010, the LDK left the coalition, which triggered early elections in
December. These confirmed Thaçi as Prime Minister, with his parliamentary majority
depending on the support of several delegates representing ethnic minorities.

18

Box 2. Structural Reforms and International Technical Assistance
Kosovo has received far-reaching technical assistance (TA) from the international community.
In recent years, key areas and objectives have been (with lead TA providers in parentheses):
Public sector

Tax administration: improvements in tax collection by broadening the tax base and
enhancing collection efforts (IMF and USAID).

Public financial management: a debt law prescribes binding limits for public debt.
Amendments to the law on budgeting procedures enhance budget preparation and
execution (IMF and U.S. Treasury).

Fiscal decentralization: greater financial autonomy for municipalities (IMF and
USAID).

Civil service: a law on civil servants provides common rules and standards for public
employment (WB).
Financial sector

Central bank: strengthening financial supervision and regulation through a central
bank law, the implementation of emergency liquidity assistance and deposit insurance.
The central bank is also developing a stress testing model and is upgrading the
payment system (all IMF).

Financial system: a draft banking law is under preparation to enhance risk
management in banks (IMF). Revision of regulations for the insurance sector and
pensions (WB).

Cash and Debt Management: establishment of a framework for domestic borrowing
(IMF, US Treasury).

National Statistics System: Kosovo started participating in the Fund’s GDDS this year
(IMF).
Business environment

Infrastructure: construction of a highway connecting Pristina with Albania’s border
(WB)

Privatization: the airport is now run by a private company. Privatization of the post
and telecom operator and electricity distribution and generation are under preparation
(WB, USAID).

Labor law: the law sets rules to protect workers and employees (WB).

Cadastre for real estate, notably in rural areas (WB).
Going forward, priorities for IMF-supported technical assistance include:
Fiscal: tax policy; reassessment of the grants system for municipalities; the development of a
taxpayer compliance strategy.
Financial sector: drafting the law on banks and microfinance institutions; adapting the rules
and regulations governing activities of banks and microfinance institutions to this law;
banknote management.
Statistics: capacity building for balance of payments and national accounts data collection.

19

Box 3. The Structure of Kosovo’s Financial System
Kosovo’s financial system has
grown rapidly over the past
decade. Financial sector assets
reached about 73 percent of GDP by
end-2010, from 33 percent in 2003.
The system is dominated by banks.
Only two smaller banks are
domestically owned, while the three
largest foreign subsidiaries hold
about three quarters of banking sector
assets. Two of these foreign-owned
banks belong to banking groups
based in Austria and Slovenia, the
third (Kosovo’s largest) has as
majority shareholder a financial
holding based in Germany.

In spite of rapid growth, banks have managed to maintain a prudent funding structure. By end
2010, deposits, mostly from households, accounted for about 87 percent of banks’ non-equity
liabilities. Half of the deposits are long-term.
Private sector credit stood at 35 percent of GDP in 2010.
Reflecting the nascent state of the industrial sector, about
80 percent of loans were allocated to retail trade, other services,
and households. The international financial crisis had only
limited effects on the banking system, given banks’ low foreign
exposures.

Box 4. The 2010 Stand-By Arrangement
The Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) approved by the IMF Executive Board on July 21, 2010,
aimed at halting the deterioration in the government’s bank balances with the central bank that
had resulted from the shift to an expansionary fiscal stance, reflecting inter alia an increase in
public investments, especially the Highway 7 to Albania. The decline in bank balances put at
risk the central bank’s ability to provide emergency liquidity assistance to banks if needed.
The fiscal strategy supported by the SBA was built around restraint on current spending and
efforts to raise more revenues, so as to create space for capital spending while keeping bank
balances at prudent levels. Specifically, current expenditures were targeted to grow in line with
nominal GDP, while substantial receipts were meant to be secured from privatization and
budgetary grants from the World Bank and the European Commission. The program also
contained structural measures to support these objectives, such as improvements in tax
administration and budgeting procedures, reforms of the energy sector to reduce the need for
state subsidies, and an overhaul of the laws regulating activities of the central bank and
commercial banks.
The execution of the 2010 budget was broadly in line with the program, with quantitative
performance criteria met for end-August 2010, and all but one met for end-2010. The

Progress on structural reforms was uneven. Efforts to privatize the telecom company (PTK)
stalled, and steps to reform the energy sector were also delayed by political events.
The coalition crisis in October 2010 and subsequent parliamentary elections in December
prevented the completion of a review in 2010. Following the elections, the newly constituted
Assembly passed a 2011 budget that deviated in critical components from the strategy agreed
in the context of the SBA, casting the budget’s medium-term sustainability in doubt.

However, without the accumulation of arrears the end-December performance criteria on bank balances and
the primary fiscal balance would not have been met.

21
Box 5. External Competitiveness
While severe data limitations preclude a full quantitative assessment of Kosovo’s real exchange
rate, the large and persistent current account deficit—averaging 16 percent of GDP over the last
three years—and small export sector beg the question whether Kosovo’s real exchange rate is
overvalued.
Kosovo’s CPI-based real effective exchange rate
has depreciated by about 8 percent since 2002.
While this development seems to suggest a
moderate improvement in competitiveness, it is
largely exogenous as Kosovo’s CPI closely traces
import price developments.

While a unit-labor-cost real effective exchange

rate is not available, average nominal wages are
86
relatively low by regional standards. This said, in
84
the last two years, agricultural and manufacturing
2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010
wages have increased by 30 and 25 percent
respectively, although it is unclear whether this
reflects real wage dynamics or a statistical artifact—stricter controls by the tax administration may
have reduced under-reporting of wages. Moreover, scaling wages with a measure of
productivity—such as per-capita GDP—results in fairly unfavorable ratios compared to
neighboring countries. Thus, low wages arguably just reflect low productivity.

Structural weaknesses further affect Kosovo’s competitiveness negatively, including bottlenecks
in the transport and energy sectors and a difficult business environment. The World Bank’s Doing
Business Survey ranks Kosovo 119th out of 183 countries participating in the survey, the lowest in
the region. Particular low are rankings for investor protection, ease of dealing with construction
permits, and ease of starting a business. This said, Kosovo ranks in the upper quartile of countries
as regards ease of obtaining credit, taxes, and ease of closing a business.

Box 6. War-Related Benefits
Like in other countries in the region, parts of Kosovo’s population suffered from the consequences
of armed conflict. The resulting social burden was addressed by legislation adopted in 2000 and
2006 that provides for disability pensions to veterans, civilian victims of war, their families, and
surviving families. It also includes subsidies, including for health care, education, and housing. The
latest draft legislation regulating war-related benefits expands both benefits and eligibility.
The 2009 fiscal crisis in FBH—one of the two autonomous entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina—
provides a cautionary lesson for Kosovo. In FBH, war-related benefits doubled from 2006 to 2008,
and were a major contributor to the country’s fiscal crisis in 2009. War-related payments averaged
3 percent of GDP between 2002 and 2009 and made up about a third of total budget in 2009. Much
of the spending pressure stemmed from poorly targeted benefits.
While Kosovo’s conflict (1998–1999) involved far less casualties than the Bosnian war, ill-defined
eligibility criteria and increases of already generous benefits would be causes for concern for
medium term fiscal sustainability also in Kosovo.

Box 7. Fiscal Decentralization
Fiscal decentralization was shaped by the Ahtisaari proposal of 2007.8 Among other elements,
it included measures to decentralize government by creating new municipal competencies in
secondary health care and higher education, as well as financial matters, by devolving more
freedom to enact measures over revenue, expenditure, and issuing debt to municipalities.
In this context, the Law on Local Government Finance (drafted with IMF TA) has been
instrumental. The legislation established that the central government has to transfer 10 percent
of total central budget revenues (excluding dividends) to municipalities, in addition to specific
grants for health, education, and other issues. This annual general grant is allocated across
municipalities based on a formula that assigns weights to characteristics like the size of the
population, its ethnic composition (to protect minorities), or its location. In addition to grants
and revenue received from the central government municipalities have own source revenues
(OSRs) from property taxes, construction permits, licenses, and fees.

(Million euros)

Although the current system has served municipalities well, adjustments are needed. Central
government transfers doubled in nominal terms from 2008–2010, while municipalities’ own
source revenues stagnated, with a large stock of unspent own source revenues carried forward
to future years. This situation increases pressures on the central government budget and implies
a shift from direct taxes (collected by municipalities) to indirect taxes, such as VAT or excises.

1/ Data on private external debt unavailable.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in euro terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

ATTACHMENT I. LETTER OF INTENT – REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO

Mr. John Lipsky
Acting Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC, 20431
U.S.A.

Pristina, June 20, 2011

Dear Mr. Lipsky:
1.
Kosovo’s economy has performed strongly in 2010 and early 2011, supported by
remittances and non-debt creating capital inflows. However, significant external imbalances
persist. These reflect inter alia infrastructure bottlenecks, especially in the transport system
and energy sector, that continue to stifle productivity and competitiveness.
2.
We are making strong efforts to improve public infrastructure, while also addressing
pressing social issues. These efforts exert pressure on the public finances, however, which,
unless contained, would translate into a decline of the government’s bank balances with the
Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo (CBK) below desirable levels. Adequate bank
balances are needed not only to provide cash buffers for the Treasury, but also to safeguard
financial stability: in our fully euroized economy, the ability of the CBK to provide
emergency liquidity assistance requires a sufficient level of government deposits that is at the
disposal of the CBK.
3.
Against this background, the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the CBK
developed a comprehensive policy strategy in 2010 aimed at restoring fiscal sustainability
and safeguarding financial stability. Key pillars of this strategy are: (i) restraint on current
spending and raising revenues to improve fiscal sustainability; (ii) securing financing for our
large public investment program through expenditure reallocations, one-off revenues, and
privatization proceeds; (iii) bolstering bank balances to provide scope for emergency
liquidity assistance, if needed; and (iv) pursuing reforms to broaden the tax base, improve
public financial management, enhance the CBK’s independence, further strengthen and
modernize the banking system, and shore up the financial position of the energy sector.
4.
Based on our balance of payments needs, we requested that the IMF support our
program through a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in the amount equivalent to
SDR 92.656 million (157 percent of quota) for the period from July 1, 2010, through
December 31, 2011. The IMF Executive Board approved this program on July 21, 2010.
Performance was largely adequate in 2010, with all quantitative performance criteria met at
end-August 2010 and all but one criterion met at end-December 2010. Not met was the

42
structural benchmark on the privatization of the post and telecommunications company
(PTK) by end-December 2010.
5.
No review of our program could be concluded. Political developments led to early
elections at end-2010. Due to the timing of the formation of the new Government, the 2011
budget was approved in March 2011. Consultations with IMF staff regarding the new budget
advanced but could not be finalized, one issue being the substantial increase in the wage bill
inscribed into the budget. This increase was not in line with the program objectives under the
SBA.
6.
Importantly, we consider the wage increases one-off adjustments that are only
temporary deviations from our policy strategy. As a result, we request a Staff-Monitored
Program through the end of this year, with a view to paving the way to a program endorsed
by the IMF Executive Board in 2012. We believe that the policies set forth in this Letter are
sufficient to achieve the objectives of our economic program, but we will take any further
measures that may become necessary. We will consult with IMF staff on the adoption of
these measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in here. Further, we will
provide IMF staff with all information it requests on policy implementation and achievement
of program objectives. The understandings between us and IMF staff regarding benchmarks
and structural measures described in this letter are further specified in the attached Technical
Memorandum of Understanding.
7.
The government and the CBK authorize the IMF to publish this letter and the
associated Article IV staff report.
I. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK
8.
The growth outlook for 2011 is positive. Domestic demand is expected to remain
strong, fuelled by remittances, foreign direct investment—especially in construction—and an
expansionary fiscal stance, notably the public sector wage increases and the large capital
outlays for the highway R7. Credit growth is projected at 13 percent (y-o-y) for this year.
Overall we expect real GDP to grow by more than 5 percent in 2011.
9.
Inflation has increased due to the surge in imported food prices, but we expect it to
decelerate in the second half of the 2011 as the base effect disappears from the inflation data.
12-month CPI inflation (end-of-period) increased to above 10 percent in both March and
April. Prices for bread and edible oil prices have been the key drivers of this increase, while
regulated prices for electricity—mostly generated with domestic coal—have been a
mitigating factor. Going forward, inflation is projected to gradually return to single digits as
food prices stabilize. There are no firm indications of domestically generated price pressures
yet, but the evolution of private sector wages needs to be watched carefully. Possible tariff
increases by the electricity regulator in the context of the privatization of electricity
distribution could also trigger price pressures.

43
10.
The current account deficit is projected to widen substantially this year. While high
nickel prices are boosting exports, the export base is small, and buoyant domestic demand is
fueling imports of consumption goods and intermediate goods, notably for the highway
construction. The deficit is expected to be financed by FDI—in part relating to receipts from
the privatization of PTK now expected for this year—and other private non-debt creating
flows. In the medium term, the current account deficit is projected at about 15 percent of
GDP, which, in our view, can be financed sustainably by non-debt creating inflows.
II. FISCAL POLICY IN 2011
11.
The overarching objective fiscal policy in 2011 is to create space for large capital
spending needs by exercising restraint on current expenditures and by increasing revenue
collection. To this end, we are targeting a primary deficit of €226 million (4.8 percent of
GDP, quantitative benchmark) that we can finance without bank balances falling to
excessively low levels. To this end, measures of €35 million (0.7 percent of GDP) over and
above our original plans are needed that partially compensate for the impact of the wage and
transfer increases earlier this year.
12.

Specifically, we are pursuing the following objectives:



Revenue: tax revenues in 2011 are projected to increase by €164 million (18 percent)
relative to 2010, reflecting inflation, progress in the reform of tax administration and
customs, and additional measures on excises. Specifically, excise increases on
gambling licenses and imports of used cars will take effect by end-June, 2011. We
estimate these measures will yield additional revues of about €23 million (0.5 percent
of GDP) in 2011.



Expenditure: we will limit the annual increase in the wage bill to €74 million through
restraint on hiring and stronger control of the Ministry of Finance over the execution
of the wage bill for the rest of 2011. To this end, we will allocate a maximum of
€386 million to this year’s public sector wage bill (including MoUs), implying
savings of €10 million (0.2 percent of GDP) relative to the budget. We will also
contain non-highway capital spending at a maximum of €315 million, and limit
transfers and subsidies to €295 million (implying savings of €2 million. Transfers and
subsidies include capital transfers to state-owned enterprises). Further, we aim to
keep energy-related subsidies to publicly owned enterprises and net lending to
KEK—the publicly-owned energy company—at the budgeted levels of €27 million
and €45 million, respectively. We will also refrain from introducing new spending
initiatives in 2011. Overall, we will limit total primary expenditures to €1,487 million
this year (quantitative benchmark).



Financing: we will maintain a level of bank balances with the CBK of at least
€305 million by end-December 2011 (quantitative benchmark). While this is some
€50 million lower of what we targeted under the SBA, we believe that the level
suffices to both satisfy the Treasury’s short-term cash-flow requirements and to

44
enable the CBK to provide emergency liquidity assistance to the financial sector if
needed. The timely privatization of PTK is a key pillar of our financing strategy
(structural benchmark for end-December). We will refrain from issuing
non-concessional debt.


Contingencies. Should emergency financing needs arise during the course of the
year, we will—consistent with the law on public financial management and
accountability—seek offsetting cuts through further reductions in spending
allocations. Moreover, as a safeguard for the unlikely case that the privatization of
PTK falls behind schedule, we will leave €60 million in expenditures unallocated
until the winner of the auction for PTK has been announced. This contingency should
not be built against wages and salaries, however, nor against spending for the R7
highway, as under-execution on the highway project would likely give rise to costly
penalties.

13.
We are making several modifications to planned introductions or enhancements of
benefits to ensure consistency with a sustainable medium-term fiscal framework.


Pensions. We will continue to require proof of 15 years of contributions to the former
pay-as-you-go pension system as a precondition for receiving the supplementary
pension (currently €35 per month). We will also refrain from relaxing eligibility
criteria for pensions for families, disabled, and early retirees.



War related benefits.
(i) We will modify the draft law on war related benefits such that the introduction of a
general war veterans’ pension is relegated to a separate (follow-up) law. This
follow-up law will clearly define eligibility criteria and the nature of benefits. Prior to
consideration of the follow-up law by the cabinet an in-depth fiscal impact
assessment will be conducted that evaluates the law’s budgetary impact over a period
of at least 5 years and includes a thorough evaluation of the number of eligible
beneficiaries (structural benchmark for end-December). We will seek assistance from
the World Bank for this endeavor. The results of this assessment will be shared with
IMF staff.
(ii) We have dissolved the committee reviewing eligibility for all current categories of
war related benefits and fixed the number of beneficiaries at a maximum
corresponding to the level at end-May 2011, with the exception of applications that
have already been received at that date (prior action by June 15). Going forward, we
will review the register of war invalids and civilian invalids of war, which we expect
to result in a reduction in the number of beneficiaries.
(iii) The final versions of both the law of war related benefits and the follow-up law
on the war veteran pension will be shared with IMF staff prior to consideration by the
cabinet.



Benefits for former political prisoners.
(i) We have issued a sub-legal act on the ”Law on the Rights of Formerly Politically

45
Convicted and Persecuted Persons” that determines that the benefits payable under
this law shall only be paid from funds that have been specifically and explicitly
appropriated for this purpose under the then applicable budget law (prior action).
(ii) A newly established working group will clearly define benefits and eligibility
criteria related to former political prisoners, determine the number of eligible
recipients, and evaluate the law’s budgetary impact over a period of at least 5 years
(structural benchmark for end-December).
(iii) No further sub-legal acts relating to this law will be issued and no funds will be
appropriated to benefits related to this law before the budgetary impact assessment
has been completed and discussed with IMF staff. The results of the assessment will
serve as a basis for both further sub-legal acts related to the law and possible
amendments of the law that may become necessary.
14.
As a general principle, all new laws or amendments to laws that create benefits and
other transfers will grant only cash benefits. Moreover, there will be no link between the
level of these benefits and the level of the minimum wage. Further, all such laws will be
preceded by a through fiscal impact assessment that evaluates the budgetary impact over a
period of at least 5 years and, in case of new benefits, includes a thorough evaluation of the
number of eligible beneficiaries.
15.
To protect the integrity of the budget from unforeseen circumstances that may yield
fiscal strains, we will include a paragraph into all new benefit-creating laws and amendments
to benefit-creating laws that explicitly allows cutting benefits in case sufficient budgetary
funds are unavailable (continuous structural benchmark).
16.
We are moving to create a domestic market for government securities. A
computerized system for electronic debt auctions is being installed at the central bank. A trial
issuance will not take place before 2012. The system will allow banks to make bids on their
own account or on behalf of their clients. To minimize financing costs, we intend to set clear
rules in line with international best practices to prevent collusion among bidders.
III. FISCAL POLICY IN 2012 AND BEYOND
17.
Over the medium term, our fiscal policy is guided by the objectives of enhancing the
efficiency of public expenditures and achieving a sustainable fiscal stance consistent with
stabilizing public debt as a share of GDP well below the 40-percent threshold enshrined in
our public debt law. To this end, further structural fiscal adjustment will be required in the
years ahead.
18.
The budget passed by the Assembly for 2012 will contain additional fiscal tightening
of at least ¾ of a percent of GDP, based on realistic macro-forecast and prudent budgeting
(structural benchmark for end-December). As regards the composition of the budget and its
financing, we are guided by the following objectives:

46


Revenues: revenue measures will aim at reducing the size of the informal market and
improving the environment for private sector while simultaneously aiming at a
gradual shift away from border taxes to domestic taxes.



Current expenditures: To create space for the highway project in the budget, we will
continue to exercise restraint on current spending, with a particular focus on the wage
bill.



Capital expenditures: The R7 highway project will absorb considerable budgetary
resources in the years ahead. Swift completion is necessary to avoid the enactment of
cost escalation clauses in the contract. To this end, we have started procurement
procedures for an on-site consultant supervising highway works.



Financing: we plan on starting commercial borrowing in 2012, in a gradual process
of building a track record with investors. In this context, we are committed to
ensuring that the pension and savings trust of Kosovo (KPST) is not subject to undue
risk of exposure to a single borrower, including the government. With the successful
implementation of this staff-monitored program, we are confident that budgetary
grants and concessional loans from International Financial Institutions will resume in
2012 to help us close any remaining financing gap.

19.
Over the medium-term, our expenditure priorities include a highway to Macedonia
(R6), and the introduction of an employee/employer financed health care fund that may
require up-front funding from the government. We will go forward with these projects only
once we have identified and secured financing that is consistent with a sustainable fiscal
stance, for example one-off revenues and/or concessional borrowing. We will consult with
IMF and World Bank staff prior to moving ahead with these plans, and especially prior to
entering into contractual agreements.
20.
More generally, the scope of our envisaged expenditure projects combined with our
limited revenue base may require a reorientation of both revenue and expenditure priorities
and objectives.


As regards revenues, we intend to further improve the efficiency of our tax system,
especially in view of the low revenues generated from direct taxes. To this end, we
have requested technical assistance (TA) from the IMF that is expected to be
delivered in the third quarter of this year. We expect the TA mission to help us
identify revenue measures that avoid hurting the business environment while reducing
the size of the informal sector. Based on the findings of this mission, we will analyze
options to modify the structure of our tax system. Until then we will not introduce
changes in tax structure, notably as regards value-added tax rates.



As regards expenditures, we will seek IMF technical assistance on expenditure
rationalization, with a view to prioritizing projects, avoiding unfunded initiatives, and
realizing savings on projects with lower priority.

47
IV. STRUCTURAL FISCAL REFORMS
Tax Administration
21.
We will develop a taxpayer compliance strategy by end-September (structural
benchmark) that is aligned with the concept recommended by the February 2011 TA mission
on tax administration. The strategy will direct the Tax Administration of Kosovo’s (TAK)
efforts at mitigating compliance risks. Further, we will align operational plans for taxpayer
services, audit, enforced collection, and tax fraud investigations with the taxpayer
compliance strategy by end-December 2011.
22.
We plan to further mitigate compliance risks related to large taxpayers. To this end,
we will redesign the large taxpayer unit, in line with the recommendations of IMF TA.
23.
We have made significant progress with regard to cleansing the taxpayer register,
issuing fiscal numbers to taxpayers and solving document processing delays. We plan to
address the backlog of unprocessed returns and resolve the high percentage of non-filers. The
new tax fraud investigation unit will investigate and resolve serious tax fraud cases and
organized fraudulent activities.
24.
We plan to address the high outstanding tax arrears position. Total arrears excluding
fines, fees, penalties, interest and non-tax revenue as a percentage of total tax revenue stood
at 104 percent in 2010. We aim at bringing the level down to those typical in advanced
economies, i.e., 5 to 10 percent of tax revenue. Steps will also be taken to identify and write
off uncollectible debt through a transparent and accountable process.
25.
We completed the first stage of the upgrade of our core IT system (SIGTAS) in
October 2010. While this upgrade has mitigated some weaknesses in the system, a
replacement option will be needed in the medium term to implement the ‘fast track’
methodology recommended by a February 2011 IMF TA mission. We are developing a plan
by end-2011 to procure the replacement IT system.
Public Financial Management
26.
To improve our ability to monitor and avoid arrears, we will introduce a new module
in Free Balance, our accounting system, by September 2011 that records due payments,
including receipts of invoices. We took steps to ensure that budget organizations enter
expenditure commitments with accurate information about the due dates of payments to
improve cash flow planning at the Treasury and prevent pressures from building that could
result in arrears. Since end-April, the Treasury reports on a monthly basis unpaid invoices of
budgetary organizations within a 30-day period.
27.
We intend to strengthen the budgeting and execution of capital expenditures. A
Public Investment Committee was established in August 2010 to monitor capital spending

48
execution. In the 2012 budget, the Ministry of Finance will lower capital expenditure
allocations in case of significant under-execution compared to budgetary allocations in 2011.
28.
Once the data of our new census have been released, we plan to revise the current
grant system formula with the aim of reducing budgetary grants from the central government
to municipalities. To compensate for the municipalities’ revenue loss, we intend to increase
significantly the minimum rate of the property tax from its current low level of 0.05 percent
starting in 2012. We will also increase municipal charges on cars. Moreover, starting in 2012
we will introduce an annual inflation adjustment mechanism on motor vehicle taxes and
other fixed fees, rents, and charges. In this context, we will discuss fiscal implications of the
draft law of the City of Pristina with IMF staff prior to resubmitting it to the cabinet.
V. MONETARY AND FINANCIAL SECTOR POLICIES
29.
The banking sector, which is mostly foreign-owned, has remained well-capitalized,
liquid and profitable. Nonperforming loans have increased to 5.9 percent in March 2011 from
4.3 percent at end-2009, but are fully provisioned, and an aggregate capital adequacy ratio of
18 percent as of March 2011 suggests that banks have ample room to accommodate shocks to
credit quality.
30.
We are fully committed to the institutional and operational independence of the CBK,
as enshrined in the constitution and specified in the central bank law. In this context, the
appointment of a new central bank governor earlier this year was characterized by a clean
implementation of the nomination rules under the law.
31.
Financial supervision continues to strengthen. The superintendency of banks follows
a based-risk supervision model under the framework of Basel I based on CAMELS indicators
(capital, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and risk sensitivity) that are updated
annually, through a combination of on-site inspection and off-site analysis. For foreign
banks, the assessment is conducted jointly with home supervisors. For each bank, the
superintendency of banks conducts at least one comprehensive on-site inspection each year.
Significant progress has also been made in the area of stress-testing. With technical
assistance from the IMF, stress tests of credit, exchange rate and liquidity risk were
conducted in November 2010. Currently, an in-house stress-testing model is being
developed. In December 2010, the CBK published its first financial stability report. On a
related matter, Kosovo joined the GDDS system of the IMF as the 87th member in April
2011.
32.
Going forward, a priority is to make operational the CBK’s ability to provide
emergency liquidity assistance (ELA). At the conceptual level, ELA was introduced in 2010
with the approval of the new central bank law. By end-December 2011 a memorandum of
understanding (MoU) will be finalized between the government and the central bank that
establishes duties and responsibilities between competent authorities, based on the central
bank law and the budget law for 2012. It will also establish a designated account of

49
government deposits with the central bank whose resources are earmarked for ELA. In 2012,
the government intends to deposit an amount to be specified in this account. For the unlikely
case an emergency need arises in 2011, the government will take measures to ensure that the
CBK has adequate funding for ELA.
33.
A new draft banking law, developed in consultation with IMF staff, is under
discussion with stakeholders.


The law will strengthen governance standards for banks, including with respect to fit
and proper criteria for administrators and suitability requirements for significant
shareholders; include tighter restrictions on lending to bank-related parties; and allow
for consolidated supervision of banking groups. The law will also ensure that the
authorities have the proper tools for bank resolution, including the ability to conduct
purchase and assumption transactions.



The draft law will be expanded to strengthen rules for the operations of microfinance
institutions. Microfinance institutions hold only 5 percent of the assets of the banking
system, but play an important role in providing financial services to segments of the
population with limited access to banks. In recent months, problems have surfaced in
the largest microfinance institution that point to inadequate corporate governance.
The CBK has appointed an administrator, but a stronger legal framework for the
sector is also needed. The expanded draft law aims at (i) enhancing the CBK’s
authority with regard to licensing, regulating and supervising microfinance
institutions, (ii) requiring microfinance institutions to have a clearly defined
ownership and governance structure, and (iii) banning microfinance institutions from
taking deposits. We will request assistance from both the World Bank and the IMF
for this endeavor.



We intend to submit the banking law expanded by the provisions on microfinance
institutions to the Assembly by end-September. We will request IMF TA to revise
existing banking rules and regulations so as to bring them in line with the banking
law.

34.
A deposit insurance law (DIL) was adopted last November, with a view to speeding
up depositors’ access to their funds in case a bank is being resolved. To further strengthen the
law, we will amend the DIL such that the funds of the Deposit Insurance Fund of Kosovo
(DIFK) can be used for purchase and assumption transactions. Moreover, the DIFK is being
set up as an institution independent from the CBK and will be governed by a five-member
board and employ one full time employee.
VI. COMPETITIVENESS
35.
Maintaining competitive wage levels requires inter alia wage restraint in the public
sector and a level of the minimum wage that does not endanger job creation. As regards the
latter, the government intends to approve the proposal by the Socio-Economic Council only

50
to the extent that it includes an exemption to the minimum wage for younger workers.
Specifically, we are ready to accept a minimum monthly wage of no more than €130 for
workers below the age of35and of no more than €170 for the remaining workforce.
Moreover, we will revisit the maternity leave provisions in our Labor Law to preserve the
employability of women.
36.
We aim at significantly improving our ranking in the Doing Business survey of the
World Bank. To this end, a package of twelve laws to reduce the cost of setting up
businesses, unify business registries, and simplify the licensing system will be approved by
the Assembly before end-December.
VII. ENERGY SECTOR
37.
Billings and collections of the state electricity company (KEK) have improved.
Subsidies in 2010 amounted to only half of the 2009 level. KEK is committed to continue
combating electricity theft and collecting unpaid bills. Going forward, we plan to move
ahead with the privatization of the energy sector. Specifically:


A new regulation with a revamped formula for electricity pricing will be published by
end-June 2011. The government will determine the parameter values of this formula
such that, in the event of electricity imports, a substantial share of the cost will be
passed on to electricity tariffs and therefore consumers. This is critical to reduce
subsidies and avoid blackouts while partially smoothing the volatility of tariffs.



We intent to develop a plan to address overstaffing at KEK with a view to improving
the company’s cost structure.



The winner of the privatization of the distributor is expected to be announced before
end-October 2011, and ownership shares are expected to be transferred to the new
owner by end-December 2011.



We intend to issue the tender documents for privatization of KEK’s mining and
electricity generation operations before end-November 2011.
VIII. PROGRAM MONITORING

ATTACHMENT II. TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO
Definitions and Data Reporting Requirements under the 2011 Staff-Monitored
Program
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding sets out the understandings between
the Kosovo authorities and the IMF staff regarding the definition of quantitative benchmarks
and indicative targets, and reporting requirements for the Staff-Monitored Program (“SMP”)
requested in June 2011.
I. QUANTITATIVE BENCHMARKS AND INDICATIVE TARGETS
A. Coverage
2.
For the purpose of this memorandum, general government is composed of the
Executive, the Legislative, and Judiciary branches of the Government, its Municipalities, and
any other public authorities that receive direct budgetary appropriations. It excludes publicly
owned enterprises and socially owned enterprises.
3.
Quantitative Benchmarks and Indicative Targets. The quantitative benchmarks,
indicative targets, and their respective test dates are set in Table 1 of the Letter of Intent
(LOI).
B. Bank Balances of the General Government
4.
Bank balances are funds usable and readily available (i.e., liquid or marketable, and
free of any pledges or encumbrances), held and controlled by the general government for the
purposes of making payments and transfers. Bank balances include Undistributed Funds of
the Government of Kosovo plus funds specifically reserved for policy purposes but do not
include the balance of unspent Own Source Revenues (OSR) carried forward, or funds
encumbered or pledged as Donor Designated Funds and funds relative to onlending
operations. Bank balances do not include investments made and managed by an outside
Investment Manager assigned by the Minister pursuant to Kosovo’s Law on Public Financial
Management Article 7.1.(iii). Bank balances may be held in the form of gold, holdings of
foreign exchange and traveler’s checks, demand and short-term deposits at foreign banks,
domestic banks, and the Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo (CBK), long-term deposits
abroad that can be liquidated without penalty, and any holdings of investment-grade
securities held directly by the general government. Bank balances at December 31, 2010,
were € 244.112 million.

55
 The floor on the bank balance set in Table 1 will be raised by


the excess of budget grants and loans relative to program assumptions



the repayment of loans extended to public enterprises.

5.
Reporting requirements. A table on bank balances will be transmitted by the
Treasury with a maximum delay of five weeks after the end of each month. In addition, the
CBK will submit twice a month, with a delay of 1 day, the Report of Positions of Treasury
Accounts. Within 45 days after each test date, the CBK will submit to the IMF the
independent audit of the reconciliation of government accounts.
C. Primary Expenditures of the General Government
6.
Primary expenditures are measured on a cash basis cumulatively from the
beginning of the calendar year. Primary expenditures include current expenditures (wages
and salaries, goods and services, subsidies and transfers, reserves), capital expenditures, and
net lending. They do not include interest payments or receipts or expenditures designated by
donors financed with grants (“donor designated grants”). Net lending comprises loans
granted by the general government except that it does not include onlending such as funds
borrowed from KfW, which is instead included as a domestic financing item (“below the
line”). All expenditures and net lending financed with loans to be serviced by the general
government are in the program’s concept of expenditures and net lending, even if the cash
did not transit through the Treasury.
 The ceiling on primary expenditures set in Table 1 will be raised by the excess of project
grants and loans relative to program assumptions.
 The ceiling on primary expenditures set in Table 1 will be lowered by the shortfall of
project grants and loans relative to program assumptions..
7.
For the purposes of this memorandum, proceeds of privatizations will be understood
to mean all monies received by the government from the sale of a publicly owned company,
organization, or facility to a private company or companies, organization(s), or individual(s),
as well as any proceeds generated from the sale of government nonfinancial assets and from
the liquidation of the assets of the Privatization Agency of Kosovo (PAK). Proceeds of
privatizations are not part of revenues. Instead, these are recorded as a domestic financing
(Net acquisition of financial assets).
8.
Reporting requirements. Data on the monthly execution, budget appropriations, and
budget allocations of revenues and expenditures will be provided monthly no later than five
weeks after the end of each month, including (i) government domestic revenue detailing by
components direct taxes, indirect taxes, and nontax revenues; (ii) external budget support
grants; (iii) primary recurrent expenditure, (iv) domestic and external interest payments and
receipts, (v) capital expenditure detailing all those related to the construction of Route 7 and

56
including domestically and budget support financed capital expenditure and externally
project financed capital expenditure; (vi) the gross payment and gross accumulation of
domestic payments arrears; (vii) external loan receipts and principal payments; (viii) external
arrears payments and accumulation; (ix) bank and nonbank financing; (x) privatization and
receipts of the sales of nonfinancial assets; and (xi) any other revenue, expenditure, or
financing not included above.
D. Primary Fiscal Balance of the General Government
9.
Primary fiscal balance of the general government is defined as revenues and grants
minus primary expenditures cumulatively since the beginning of the calendar year. Revenues
do not include privatization receipts.
 The floor on the primary fiscal balance set in Table 1 will be lowered by the excess in
project loans relative to program assumptions.
 The floor on the primary fiscal balance set in Table 1 will be raised by


the shortfall in project loans relative to program assumptions



the excess in budget loans relative to program assumptions.
E. Contracting or Guaranteeing Nonconcessional Debt by the General Government

10.
Nonconcessional debt is defined as debt contracted or guaranteed by the general
government with a grant element of less than 35 percent. The grant element of a debt is the
difference between the present value (PV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a
percentage of the nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is
calculated by discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt. The
discount rates used for this purpose are the using currency-specific commercial interest
reference rates (CIRRs) published by the Development Assistance Committee of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). For debt with a maturity
of at least 15 years, the ten-year-average CIRR will be used to calculate the PV of debt and,
hence, its grant element. For debt with a maturity of less than 15 years, the six-month average
CIRR will be used. To both the ten-year and six-month averages, the same margins for differing
repayment periods as those used by the OECD need to be added (0.75 percent for repayment
periods of less than 15 years, 1 percent for 15 to 19 years, 1.15 percent for 20 to 29 years, and
1.25 percent for 30 years or more). The ceilings exclude purchases from the IMF, the sale of
the SDR holdings allocated to Kosovo, and the contracting of Partial Risk Guarantees with
the World Bank for the privatization of the energy sector. Debt rescheduling and debt
reorganization of debts contracted before the approval of the SMP are excluded from the
limits on nonconcessional debt. The definition of short-term nonconcessional debt excludes
normal short-term (less than one year) import-related financing. The quantitative benchmark
applies not only to debt as defined below but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed

57
for which value has not been received. The contracting or guaranteeing nonconcessional debt
by the general government will be assessed at each test date.
11.
The government of Kosovo will consult with Fund staff before contracting or
guaranteeing any new debts in circumstances where they are uncertain whether the
instrument in question is covered under the quantitative benchmark.
12.
Definition of debt. The definition of debt is set out in Executive Board Decision No.
12274-(00/85), Paragraph 9, as amended on August 31, 2009 (Decision No. 14416-(09/91)):
“(a) For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a
current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through
the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and
which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will
discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts
can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
“(i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the
basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future
(including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits)
and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized
loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay
interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as
repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);
“(ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to
defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are
delivered or services are provided; and
“(iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the
lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are
usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the
lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the
debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments
expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding those
payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
“(b) Under the definition of debt set out in this paragraph, arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a
contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an
obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery)
will not give rise to debt.”

58
13.
Reporting requirements. Details of all new debt taken or guaranteed, indicating
terms of debt and creditors, will be provided on a quarterly basis within five weeks of the end
of each quarter.
F. Domestic Payments Arrears
14.
A domestic payment obligation to suppliers or creditors is deemed to be in arrears if:
(a) goods and services have been received; (b) they have been certified to conform to the
order of the contract; and (c) the due-for-payment date has passed and the obligation has
remained unpaid for more than 60 days. The stock of arrears will be assessed at end-June
2011 and the accumulation of new domestic arrears will be assessed continuously. A
payment obligation is defined to be domestic if the creditor is resident in Kosovo.
15.
Reporting requirements. The Ministry of Finance will submit detailed tables of the
stocks of domestic arrears and of domestic payment obligation to suppliers or creditors not in
arrears as of end-September and end-December 2011. Moreover, it will submit a monthly
table with the stock of domestic payments arrears, including the accumulation (if any),
payment, rescheduling and write-off of domestic payments arrears during the month. The
data are to be provided within five weeks after the end of the month.
G. External Payments Arrears
16.
External arrears are defined as total external debt service obligations of the
government that have not been paid by the time they are due (after the expiration of the
relevant grace period). External arrears exclude external debt service obligations subject to
ongoing good faith negotiations of debt-rescheduling agreements. A debt service obligation
is defined to be external if the creditor is not resident in Kosovo.
17.
Reporting requirements. The Ministry of Finance will inform the Fund staff
immediately of any accumulation of external arrears. Data on (i) debt-service payments; and
(ii) external arrears accumulation and payments will be transmitted on a quarterly basis by
the Ministry of Finance within five weeks of the end of each quarter.
II. OTHER DATA REQUIREMENTS
18.
The monthly monetary statistics (including balance sheets and monetary surveys) of
the CBK, the consolidated commercial banks and revisions to historical data (if any) will be
transmitted on a monthly basis with a maximum delay of five weeks
19.
Data on exports and imports, including volume and prices and compiled by the
Statistical Office of Kosovo (SOK), will be transmitted on a quarterly basis within forty-five
days after the end of each quarter.

59
20.
A preliminary quarterly balance of payments, compiled by the CBK, will be
forwarded within three months after the end of each quarter.
21.
The table of Financial Soundness Indicators and the regulatory capital and liquidity
ratios of individual banks will be transmitted by the CBK to the IMF on a monthly basis
within six weeks after the end of each month.
22.
A monthly report on the number of employees will be transmitted to the IMF by the
Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance within two weeks after the end of each
month.

IX. Safeguards Assessments
The Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo (CBK) was subject to a safeguard assessment
with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement approved on July 21, 2010. The assessment of the

3
CBK, completed on November 4, 2010, found that key safeguards, concerning external audit
and financial reporting frameworks, are in place. Recent revisions to the CBK Law addressed
most safeguards concerns with the legal framework. Going forward, internal audit
independence requires strengthening through the transfer of incompatible control
responsibilities, and the expansion of IT audits. Operational controls have been established
over areas of relevance to safeguards, including accounting, banking operations and reserves
management. An MOU has been signed to protect the Fund disbursements for budget
support.
X. Exchange Arrangements
Kosovo does not issue a currency of its own, but uses the euro as legal means of payment.
Kosovo is not part of the euro area and the Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo is not
part of the European System of Central Banks. Kosovo is an Article XIV member and has
not yet accepted the obligations of Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement. Staff is
currently in the process of assessing whether Kosovo imposes exchange restrictions and/or
multiple currency practice subject to Fund jurisdiction.
XI. Previous Article IV Consultation
This is the first Article IV Consultation with Kosovo.
XII. Technical Assistance
Since 1999, the Fund has provided technical assistance and policy advice to UNMIK under
EBD/99/80 and, since September 2008, to Kosovo under EBD/08/95. Technical assistance
has centered on the Fund’s core competencies, notably in the areas of fiscal policy, the
banking and payments systems, and macroeconomic statistics. Assistance has also
contributed to developing key aspects of the legal and institutional framework needed for a
market economy. More recently, TA has been provided on the following issues:

III. KOSOVO—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision is adequate for surveillance and for program monitoring.
Performance criteria can be tested with accuracy. However, the statistical system still suffers
from considerable shortages of financial and human resources.
2.
The authorities are strengthening official statistics. A draft of the statistics law is
being considered by the Ministry of Public Administration. This will establish a legal
framework and determine fundamental principles for the organization, production and
publication of official statistics. The law states that official statistics should be reliable,
impartial and, in due time, should cover the administrative, demographic, economic, social,
health, education, agriculture development. Also, Kosovo joined the GDDS system of the
IMF as the 87th member in April 2011.
3.
Improvements have been made to the national accounts, but significant
weaknesses remain. The quality and timeliness of nominal and real GDP data based on the
expenditure approach has been improved. GDP data based on the production approach are
available, but publication lags are long. Kosovo should also seek to publish GDP on quarterly
basis.
4.
Labor market statistics are weak. Data on the labor force and wages are unreliable,
given the large share of the informal economy. A population census was held in April 2011.
Considerable work remains to be done to improve the sample coverage of the labor force
survey.
5.
Data on fiscal flows are reliable and are provided regularly. Monthly reports on
cash basis budget executions of central government and municipalities are provided five
weeks after the end of each month. However, budget classification is not consistent with
GFSM 2001 because: (i) data is on cash basis, not accrual; (ii) grants are classified as a
financing, instead of revenue; (iii) lending for policy purposes (similar to subsidies) is
included after calculating the primary balance; (iv) capital transfers should be included in
current expenditure instead of capital expenditure; (v) memoranda of understanding (MOU)
should be properly classified depending on their final purpose; (vi) annual budget documents
should specify both current and capital spending related to individual projects. Looking
forward, data on budget execution for municipalities, including grants received from the
central government as well as data on social assistance should be provided on a monthly
basis. Monitoring of domestic arrears should be strengthened.
6.
Monetary and financial statistics have been improved substantially. Data are
broadly consistent with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, 2000 (MFSM).
The data are available with a lag of six to eight weeks. However, given the relatively high
turnover of CBK staff, continued monitoring, training, and Fund technical assistance are
needed.

9
7.
External sector statistics have improved in recent years. The CBK provides
financial sector information to IFS and also provides quarterly balance of payments data.
With technical assistance from STA, the accuracy, periodicity, and timeliness of balance of
payments statistics have continued to improve. Nevertheless, external debt statistics have
incomplete coverage and are released with delays.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Kosovo
On July 6, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Kosovo.1
Background
Kosovo enjoyed robust economic growth in the 2000s and weathered the global
financial crisis well, owing to limited integration into global financial and goods markets.
The economy is expected to grow by more than 5 percent in 2011, up from 4 percent in
2010, supported by continued large remittances inflows from the Kosovar diaspora,
robust credit growth, especially to households, and higher public spending, including on
infrastructure projects. Inflation follows closely price developments for imported food and
gasoline, triggering deflation in 2009 and double-digit inflation in early 2011, but core
inflation has remained well-behaved. While credit growth has moderated, banks’
portfolio quality has deteriorated only modestly and profits have remained high. Large
capital buffers suggest banks—which are mostly foreign owned—have ample
shock-absorbing capacity.
While Kosovo pursued a conservative fiscal policy during most of the 2000s, since 2008
the government has moved to an increasingly expansionary stance, financing the
resulting deficits from accumulated savings, the sale of assets, and donor support. As a

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

result, the general government balance shifted from a surplus of more than 7 percent of
GDP in 2007 to a deficit of 2.6 percent in 2010. Capital spending has been the main
driver of this expansion. Last year, construction started on a highway connecting
Pristina with Albania’s border, with total costs estimated at more than 20 percent of
annual GDP spread over a period of 4 years. In 2011, the government increased public
sector wages and benefits for war invalids and their families by 30 to 50 percent.
An 18-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) was approved by the IMF Executive Board
on July 21, 2010. The program supported by the SBA was built around (i) restraint on
current spending, higher revenues and privatization receipts to contain the impact on the
investment program on the overall deficit, and (ii) bolstering the government’s deposits
with the Central Bank to build buffers for fiscal and financial contingencies. The 2011
budget adopted by the newly constituted Assembly deviated from the budget agreed in
the context of the SBA, notably the large public sector wage increases. As a result, no
review under the program could be completed.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the progress made by the Kosovar authorities in building
key social and economic institutions. Nevertheless, further efforts are necessary to
enhance competitiveness, ensure fiscal sustainability and safeguard financial stability.
Directors highlighted the need to reorient Kosovo’s growth model, especially to address
the uncertain prospects of remittances and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), which have
so far supported growth. Going forward, policies should focus on enhancing
competitiveness to foster the emergence of a tradable sector that can drive economic
development and self-sustained growth, and help reduce unemployment. To this end, it
will be critical to upgrade public infrastructure and education, improve the business
climate, and maintain competitive wage levels.
Directors noted that while the unilateral adoption of the euro provides a strong monetary
anchor, it also increases demands on macroeconomic management. A premium should
be placed on disciplined fiscal policies and flexibility to adjust to external shocks.
Directors noted that Kosovo’s shift to an expansionary fiscal stance since 2008 was
unsustainable. They stressed that improving fiscal management is essential to maintain
fiscal sustainability. For the near term, Directors urged disciplined budget execution and
public financial management. This should include prudent wage policies, and a careful
design and sequencing of social and capital spending initiatives, with thorough
assessments of the resulting fiscal costs and compensating savings measures as
needed. Over the medium term, it will be critical to reorient fiscal priorities, including by
raising more revenue from direct taxes.

3
Directors welcomed the progress on developing Kosovo’s financial system. They noted
that a strong institutional framework, especially improved legal capacity and defined
property rights, will be crucial to safeguard financial stability. Passage of the new
banking law will be an important step in this direction. Building the capacity to provide
emergency liquidity assistance to the banking system is also a priority and the
authorities should undertake measures to make this operational.
Directors welcomed the agreement reached on the staff-monitored program (SMP).
They underscored that steadfast implementation of policies under the SMP would allow
Kosovo to take decisive steps towards ensuring fiscal sustainability and pave the way
for a future Fund-supported program.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
