IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with St. Vincent and the
Grenadines
On July 13, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article
IV consultation1 with St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ recovery from the global financial crisis was hampered by a
series of natural disasters, sluggish global demand and slow implementation of key infrastructure
projects. Economic activity appears to have recovered in 2015—led by strong tourism inflows
and a rebound in construction—while inflation has trended down due to falling food and fuel
prices. Lower oil prices have also narrowed the current account deficit. The commercial banking
sector appears to remain solid, enabling a modest uptick in credit to the private sector that has
been supportive of economic recovery.
The new airport, now foreseen for completion in 2016, is expected to sustain the near-and
medium-term economic growth. Real GDP is projected to expand by 2.2 percent in 2016 and
reach
3.1 percent over the medium-term as tourist arrivals are boosted by greater airlift capacity and
construction expands tourism infrastructure. The current account deficit is expected to narrow
gradually, as tourism inflows increase. Additional imports to supply tourism services are
expected to be financed by foreign direct investment.
Public debt, at 74 percent of GDP at end-2015, has steadily increased since 2008, owing largely
to the impact of the global financial crisis, construction of the new international airport and
rehabilitation spending in response to three back to back natural disasters. The authorities have

committed to reducing public debt to the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union target of 60 percent
of GDP by 2030. They have made some progress towards consolidating the fiscal position since
2013, with a reduction of the primary deficit from 5 percent of GDP to an estimated 1.1 percent
of GDP in 2015. Despite the new tax policy measures provided in the 2016 budget and the
envisaged improvement in the primary balance, higher interest costs are expected to leave the
fiscal position unchanged from 2015.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the incipient economic recovery and improved external and fiscal
positions in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. They observed that the outlook is positive,
particularly with prospects for the entry in operations of the new international airport and the
development of geothermal energy, and risks are balanced. However, to bring public debt on a
downward trajectory and improve competitiveness to underpin strong medium-term growth,
Directors stressed the importance of strengthening the macroeconomic policy framework and
pursuing critical structural reforms.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to achieve the ECCU-wide public debt target of
60 percent of GDP by 2030, and underscored the importance of an ambitious yet credible
medium-term fiscal consolidation to meet the debt target and build some buffers against natural
disasters. In this regard, they took positive note of the authorities’ willingness to adopt additional
measures to support medium-term adjustment. They saw scope to further broaden the tax base,
including by streamlining tax expenditure; continue to restrain the wage bill; and improve the
sustainability of the public pension scheme and the national insurance service. They stressed that
structural fiscal reforms would also be crucial to support adjustment, and recommended
accelerating and sustaining revenue administration and public financial management reforms,
while limiting contingent liabilities from public-private partnerships.
Directors noted that St. Vincent and the Grenadines has relatively sound banks and leads the
region in the supervision of credit unions. They encouraged the authorities to continue to
strengthen supervision of the nonbank financial sector and monitor the offshore banking sector,
as well as continue to align the AML/CFT regime with international standards.
Directors highlighted the need to buttress competitiveness to leverage the growth-enhancing
impact of major infrastructure projects. Enhancing the business environment, lifting labor
productivity through skills upgrading and matching, ensuring access to credit for small
businesses, and further trade facilitation are among critical priorities to promote private

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 28, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. Growth is recovering after the setbacks from the end-2013 floods and sluggish
external demand post global financial crisis. While real GDP contracted by 0.2 percent in
2014, it is estimated to have grown by 1.6 percent in 2015, led by recovering tourism
inflows and rebounding construction. Public debt—74 percent of GDP at end-2015—has
steadily increased since 2008, owing largely to the impact of the global financial crisis,
construction of the new international airport, and rehabilitation spending in response to
three back-to-back natural disasters. Prime Minister Gonsalves’ new five-year electoral
mandate provides the opportunity to strengthen the macroeconomic policy framework,
notably to anchor strong growth, meet the authorities’ commitment to reduce public
debt to 60 percent of GDP by 2030, and embark upon much needed structural reforms.
Strategy: The 2016 Article IV consultation was focused on establishing a strong
macroeconomic framework to optimize the impact of large infrastructure projects,
improve competitiveness and boost sustainable growth.
Key policy recommendations:
 A more ambitious fiscal adjustment—beyond what is currently planned—is needed
to meet the authorities’ public debt target. Such adjustment should internalize potential
natural disasters to ensure the credibility of the fiscal framework.
 Measures could include a rationalization of tax incentives, restraining the wage bill
and improving the sustainability of the public pension scheme and the National
Insurance Service. Structural fiscal reforms to mobilize tax revenue and enhance public
spending efficiency will also be critical.
 Concerted efforts are needed to build on recent advances to strengthen the financial
sector, including its supervision.
 Improving the business environment, notably by upgrading human capital,
accelerating trade facilitation and containing electricity tariffs, will help boost the
economy’s productive potential and anchor strong and sustainable growth.

1.
The recovery from the global
financial crisis was hampered by a series of
natural disasters, sluggish global demand
and slow implementation of key
infrastructure projects. The rebounding US
growth and construction of the international
airport, launched in 2008, contributed to the
recovery of economic activity. However, there
were setbacks from the damages caused by
natural disasters in 2010, 2011 and at end2013. Moreover, the pace of execution of large
investment projects has been impacted by
capacity and financing constraints.

Sources: IMF staff estimates.

2.
The government is banking on completing game-changing projects, notably the
airport in 2016 and geothermal energy to boost growth over the medium-term. Beyond their
potentially sizeable growth impact, the authorities expect other benefits. In particular, the airport is
expected to yield revenue, while the geothermal project will likely contribute to stable electricity
prices and enhance St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ reputation as an ecological tourism destination.
3.
The authorities seek to strengthen the macroeconomic policy framework to optimize
the impact of these infrastructure projects on competitiveness and growth. In this context,
three key policy areas have been identified in the 2016 budget address. First, to effect a credible and
sustainable medium-term fiscal consolidation, the authorities plan to accelerate fiscal reforms,
notably in revenue administration and public financial management. Second, they plan to build on
ongoing efforts to continue reforming the financial sector and improve access to credit for
businesses; and third, they plan to embark upon structural reforms to improve the business
environment and build climate resilience.
4.
Prime Minister Gonsalves’ new electoral mandate provides a timely opportunity to
embark upon macroeconomic and structural reforms to anchor strong and sustainable
growth. The Prime Minister and his democratic socialist Unity Labour Party (ULP) won a fourth
consecutive five-year term in the December 2015 election.

Lower oil prices led to a
narrowing of the current account deficit. The deficit moderated from 29.6 percent of GDP in 2014
to 24.8 percent of GDP in 2015. Based on indicators through end-2015, imports contracted by over
8 percent (y-o-y) between 2015 and 2014, due to the value of oil imports dropping by 48 percent.
Non-oil imports increased by 3 percent.
7.
The commercial banking sector appears to remain solid, enabling a modest uptick in
credit to the private sector that has been supportive of economic recovery. Commercial banks’
financial soundness indicators remained relatively stable at end-2015. Banks’ performance improved

market share of credit unions, which had risen following the global financial crisis. Banks’
profitability, measured as return on assets (ROA), remains low, including with historically high excess
reserves since growth in private deposits has outpaced that of credit to the private sector.

RISING DEBT BUT NARROWING FISCAL DEFICIT

9.
The authorities have made some progress towards consolidating the fiscal position
since 2013, including by implementing past staff recommendation and lower capital outlays.
The primary deficit of the central government, excluding grants, improved from 5 percent of GDP in
2013 to an estimated 1.1 percent of GDP in 2015, beyond staff expectations presented in the 2014
staff report. This was achieved despite a decrease of tax revenue of ⅓ pp of GDP between 2014 and
2015, partly due to one-off income tax collections in 2014.

The improved fiscal position reflected
largely a sharp compression of
investment outlays owing to delays in
completing the airport and post-floods
rehabilitation. Capital spending was
executed at ⅓ of its budgeted figure for
2015, including due to shortfalls in
project grants, and capacity and
financing constraints.

This includes containing the wage bill through a hiring freeze and restraining the growth in
wages below that of nominal GDP—despite the wage increase of 2½ percent in 2015,
restraining transfers and subsidies, and mobilizing additional revenue by raising the customs
service charge on imports while expanding the legal capacity of revenue administration.
However, staff recommendations on increasing information sharing between the Inland Revenue

Only initial steps were taken to improve information sharing
and work on the Data Matching project.

• Increasing customs charges.

Increased from 4 to 5 percent in 2015.

• Rationalizing tax exemptions.

Streamlining of discretionary concessions is included in the
2016 budget.

Expenditure measures:
• Containing the wage bill by 0.4 percent of GDP by 2019 by
restraining employment growth
• Reducing transfers and subventions to public corporations by an
additional 0.5 percent of GDP

Granted a general wage increase of 2.5 percent at end-2015
and 1.5 percent in January 2016. Hiring freeze is expected to
be maintained.
Transfers and subsidies were somewhat restrained.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
The new airport, now foreseen for completion in 2016, is expected to sustain the nearand medium-term economic recovery.


Designed to accommodate larger jets, the airport’s envisaged impact on growth over the mediumterm is sizeable. 1 However, staff’s medium-term growth forecast remains cautious. Growth is
projected to increase to 2.2 percent in 2016, owing to a pickup in construction, and reach
3.1 percent over the medium-term, as tourist arrivals are boosted by greater airlift capacity and
construction expands tourism infrastructure.2



Meanwhile, structural measures are expected to improve agricultural productivity, boosting the
synergy between the hospitality and agriculture sectors, with locally grown food increasingly
meeting the needs of tourists and the local population. The buoyancy of the tourism, agriculture
and construction sectors will spur financial credit to the private sector, particularly if supported

1

The new airport will allow direct flights from the main tourism source markets; the US, the UK and Canada and its
overall construction cost is estimated at US$223 million or ⅓ of 2015 GDP. Its estimated growth impact was
presented in Box 3, country report no. 15/259, page 15.
2

This additional 0.9 percentage point of growth in real GDP is estimated to correspond to an additional influx of
stayover tourists by 2¼ percent, which is cautious given recent developments.

by structural reforms to improve access to information on borrowers and the resolution of
impaired assets.


The current account deficit is expected to narrow gradually, despite the projected slight recovery
of oil prices, as tourism inflows increase and food imports decrease. Additional imports to
supply tourism services are expected to be financed by FDI.



The geothermal energy project may potentially further raise long-term growth (Annex IV), and
position St. Vincent and the Grenadines as an environmentally friendly tourism destination.
However, medium-term growth projections abstract from the project.

11.
Risks to the outlook are balanced. Downside risks pertaining to natural disasters and a
deterioration of the terms of the PetroCaribe financing remain as stated during the 2014 Article IV
consultation. Risks of a sharp currency appreciation have increased, as have the risk of negative
spillovers from oil-exporting partner countries such as Canada and Trinidad and Tobago. Risks from
intensifying financing constraints could also emanate if the government does not adopt a credible
medium-term fiscal framework or if financial services are reduced due to “derisking” activities of
global and regional banks. Upside risks relate to the persistence of the recent lower energy prices
and the opening of the new international airport spurring substantial investments in the tourism
sector. Moreover, once geothermal energy enters in operations, significant savings from lower
electricity tariffs could contribute upside to growth, particularly if oil prices increase over the long
term.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize
in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant
to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30
and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the
authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate
that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

KEY POLICY ISSUES
Concerted policy actions will be needed on many fronts to anchor strong and sustainable growth.
Most importantly, a strong and credible macroeconomic framework will be needed to optimize
the impact of the large infrastructure projects, improve competitiveness and boost the economy’s
productive potential. Key elements include: (i) ambitious, yet credible medium-term fiscal
consolidation, (ii) reforms to buttress the financial sector and (iii) policies to improve the business
environment and build climate resilience.

A. Strengthening the Fiscal Framework
Near-Term Fiscal Framework
12.
Despite the new tax policy measures provided in the 2016 budget, staff projects that
higher interest expenses are expected to leave the fiscal position unchanged from 2015 (Box
1). The baseline projection is informed by the policy measures provided in the 2016 budget,
adjusted by staff projections for the tax revenue yields, execution of the capital budget according to
expected financing, and implementation of the wage bill based on attrition. Staff projects that
higher revenue and grants will contribute to both a higher primary balance and additional primary
current outlays for health, pensions and operating the international airport. Staff projects that the
overall fiscal deficit will be 2.1 percent of GDP in 2016 despite the improved primary balance, due to
a higher interest rate on a new bilateral loan and the cost of servicing the portion of PetroCaribe
financial flows previously omitted from official public debt statistics.3

The overall fiscal balances in 2015 and 2016 are fully comparable to one another. This is because the budget is on a
cash basis and, under the moratorium expiring at end-June 2016, no interest was paid on the portion of PetroCaribe
financial flows not previously included in public debt statistics.

The 2016 budget provides for additional revenue measures that broaden the tax base and raise
excise duties and fees. Staff projects that the revenue from these measures will contribute to
improving the primary balance while funding more current outlays, with higher interest costs
expected to absorb the primary savings.

Based on staff’s projected revenue and grants of 28.7 percent of GDP in 2016 (a gain of 0.8 pp of GDP
relative to 2015) and projected implementation of budget outlays, the primary balance is envisaged to
improve from 0.1 percent of GDP in 2015 to 0.4 percent of GDP in 2016, with the higher projected revenue
and grants mostly absorbed by additional primary current spending.
Staff projects the higher primary spending to be entirely directed to current outlays, including for the
scaled up operational needs of the new airport and the higher wage bill. In particular, 0.5 pp of GDP in

The projected gain in primary balance between 2015 and 2016 is envisaged to be fully absorbed by
higher interest expenses. The rise in interest costs is mainly driven by an increase in the cost of foreign
debt, notably a higher interest rate on a bilateral loan and the cost of servicing the additional PetroCaribe
debt.

More ambitious fiscal consolidation is needed over the medium-term to meet the
authorities’ public debt target of 60 percent of GDP by 2030.




The baseline scenario is projected to
result in the public debt overshooting the
target. The medium-term primary
surplus is projected to reach 1.6 percent
of GDP by 2019 and result in a debt to
GDP ratio of 71.3 percent of GDP in
2030. This reflects the projected full year
impact of current revenue measures, and
assumes continued expenditure restraint
and no more natural disasters.

Against this backdrop, the government would need to target a higher primary surplus
over the medium-term to meet its public debt target, especially given recurrent natural
disasters. A primary surplus reaching 3.3 percent of GDP by 2019 and sustained over the long-term
is deemed adequate to help the authorities achieve their public debt target in 2030, even if natural
disasters materialize. This would require well-specified tax and expenditure policy measures with
annual yield of about 1.7 percent of GDP beyond the projected yield from the government’s current
policies, including to provide 0.9 percent of GDP to address natural disasters.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES





A credible plan for medium-term fiscal consolidation is needed, anchored by well-specified
measures to further broaden the tax base and restrain expenditure (Annex VI). In particular, it
would be helpful to:
i.

Streamline ad hoc tax concessions and other tax incentives. This would boost tax revenue
by recovering currently foregone revenue and facilitating the revenue administration,
through a simplified application of the tax code and the tariff.4 While the foregone
revenue of discretionary customs duties concessions at end-2015 is estimated at 1.8
percent of GDP, the overall revenue foregone from all customs concessions is estimated
at 4.8 percent of GDP and the revenue loss from all tax incentives have been assessed
near 7 percent of GDP.

ii.

Continue to restrain the wage bill, particularly since real wages of public sector
employees have increased by 45 percent between 2000 and 2014, resulting in the
second highest public sector wages relative to productivity in the ECCU. This could be
achieved through attrition and containing future wage increases.

iii.

Improve the sustainability of the public service pension system and the National Insurance
Service. Expenditure on pensions and retirement benefits have grown from 2½ percent
of GDP in 2011 to 3 percent of GDP in 2015 and is expected to keep rising, since the five
pension systems of public servants are all non-contributory and unfunded. This risks
undermining the medium-term fiscal position, which can be addressed by implementing
parametric reforms among the options suggested by the actuarial analysis published in
2015.

If fiscal policy included financial defenses against natural disasters, this would help prevent
resulting increases in public debt to GDP (Annex V). Financing the rehabilitation, reconstruction
and immediate response to a natural disaster is particularly challenging when funding depends
on international partners if concessional funds are scarce. Natural disasters may contribute to
raise the public debt to GDP ratio, as the authorities may be pressured to either turn to more
expensive financing sources or delay reconstruction and postpone the growth recovery. Selfinsurance against the risk of natural disasters alleviates this dependency on external resources.

16.
Proactive implementation of structural reforms is also critical to support fiscal
consolidation. The National Economic Advisory Council, to be established by end-July, may be
helpful in monitoring progress in these reforms, particularly if their announcement includes the
government’s commitment to a timetable and key milestones for the completion of measurable
actions. Specifically:


Reforms in revenue administration need to be accelerated and sustained. Following the recent
appointment of the Comptroller of the Customs and Excises Department (CED), it is essential to

4

The VAT in St. Vincent and the Grenadines is markedly less efficient than in neighbor countries (Figure 3) which
suggests there is much scope for improving revenue by reforming the revenue administration.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

hire the staff needed to spearhead the reforms. To improve the cross-checking of tax returns by
the CED and the IRD and timely reception of compliance information, issuance of a single Tax
Identification Number (TIN) per taxpayer must be finalized without delay and upgrade of
information technology needs to continue.


The efficiency of public spending needs to be improved. Adopting the draft Procurement Bill
would be a key milestone. This requires clarifying its provisions to facilitate its application—
based on expertise already provided by the World Bank. Improving control over transfers to
public entities starts with enforcing requirements for their timely financial reporting. To prevent
the accumulation of new budgetary arrears, it is critical to strengthen the Ministry of Finance’s
capacities in internal audit, financial management information systems and cash management.
An accountability framework for public sector employees would also eventually need to be in
place to provide traction for these reforms.

Adopting a legal framework for Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), would help limit
their contingent fiscal liabilities. Several PPPs are currently envisaged or under way, including the
geothermal, marina, and agriculture projects.5 There is a risk that negotiations with private partners

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

culminate in direct and implicit guarantees leading to eventual budgetary liabilities, with negative
impact on fiscal balances. The government can set overall limits on accumulated PPP liabilities by
establishing a codified enunciation of PPP principles providing safeguards against possible
contingent liabilities—including on-lending to PPP partners combined with undue sharing of risk.
This may strengthen the government’s negotiation position with private partners.

B. Buttressing Financial Sector Supervision
18.
The modest expansion of bank credit has been coupled with some tightening of
regulatory lending requirements. The current pace of overall credit expansion remains moderate
by historical standards, with credit to the private sector having increased from 52.6 percent of GDP
in 2014 to 54.3 percent of GDP in 2015. While continued monitoring by the regulatory authority will
be needed, banks have been required to apply tighter standards. These include the ECCB regulation,
effective since March 2015, lowering the lending limit on an unsecured loan from 100 to 50 percent
of the borrower’s salary. Moreover, the new ECCB regulation on appraisal and valuation has
introduced a minimum of two criteria for collateral appraisals, such as the market appraised value
and the typically used replacement cost method. Banks have also tightened conditions on mortgage
loans for members of the diaspora. Nonetheless, banks’ competition for good loans has intensified,
lowering rates and fees and prompting the extension of maturities and credit limits in some banks.
Full implementation of the new insolvency law should help curtail NPLs.
19.
Further strict monitoring of non-bank financial institutions will support financial
stability in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the regional leader in non-bank supervision. The
Financial Services Authority (FSA) has continued to strengthen the supervision of the non-bank
financial sector by formalizing a risk based supervisory framework, which is operational and should
be published once technical impediments are addressed. Moreover, the FSA expects draft
regulations, including on governance, to be formally approved by end-2016.


The authorities have strengthened supervision of credit unions, which feature prominently in the
local economy, with a loan portfolio representing 68 percent of their total assets at end-June
2015 and a 21 percent share in total assets of the financial sector in 2015. Since end-2013, they
have gained many small borrowers from banks, including for consumer loans, and increased
their total share of the market for bank and non-bank loans. Credit unions’ lending terms are
softer than those of banks and they are not as proactive in repossessing nonperforming assets.
The FSA is appropriately continuing to strengthen supervision, improve governance, and closely
monitor and address developments in these institutions, including efforts to recover debt and
reduce operating costs and NPLs.



The authorities have issued binding prudential guidelines for the insurance sector, which is
relatively stable. These guidelines address the governance and compliance relative to statutory
deposits and insurance funds. They also aim to lower concentration of risks by promoting
portfolio diversification. To mitigate the transmission of shocks caused by financial
interconnectedness, a swift adoption and entry in operation of the regionally harmonized

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

insurance law is needed. The law would provide for the establishment of an ECCU common
insurance and pension market under the supervision of a single regional independent regulator.


The offshore banking sector is subject to frequent on-site inspections. The FSA has completed its
reporting framework for risk-weighted capital and is working with offshore banks to have it fully
implemented along with increasing their capital.

20.
De-risking has increased the cost of maintaining correspondent banking relationships,
with no significant impact on domestic activity. Complying with de-risking requirements has
increased the cost for local financial institutions of maintaining correspondent relationships with
foreign banks. While some foreign banks have discontinued banking relationships that could be
clearly identified as third party transactions, this has impacted mostly the off-shore sector. The
domestic commercial banking sector did curtail some of its money services agency business, but this
impacted only very small traders and some remittance flows. To mitigate reputational risks for the
national financial system, the FSA is currently strengthening the AML/CFT in line with international
standards and introducing improvements in the data-entry management of the offshore sector.
Furthermore, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) software has been fully implemented
at the IRD and the authorities plan to start sharing information after signing the OECD multilateral
tax convention on the automatic exchange of information in August 2016.

Promote human capital and align labor costs with competitiveness gains. St. Vincent and the
Grenadines’ hiring costs relative to worker productivity are among the highest in the region
(Annex II), reflecting the cumulative increases in salary for public sector employees and its
influence on private sector compensation. To lift labor productivity, the newly established
Hospitality Institute—once fully operational— can help upgrade the work force’s skills to match
business requirements. Furthermore, future extension of training to maritime tourism activities
would be beneficial, particularly since St. Vincent and the Grenadines is particularly well-suited
for yachting, with higher value-added than cruise tourism. Finally, the tourism industry is
improving its operations to meet the government’s new minimum standards, aiming for full
compliance by end-2017. Enforcement will be critical in that regard. These measures aim to

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

support the recovery of St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ tourism nearer pre-crisis levels (Figure
2).


Facilitate the private sector’s access to affordable credit and predictable electricity tariffs.
Introducing the new insolvency law6 in 2014 helped improve St. Vincent’s Doing Business
ranking. 7 To address remaining areas of concern, the authorities plan to appoint an Office of
Private Sector Development. Access to affordable credit by small businesses remains a priority.
To reduce credit risk and improve accessibility, progress in credit facilitation through the
formation of a credit bureau—as part of a CARICOM initiative—is needed. Concerning access to
electricity, geothermal energy is expected to reduce the variability in electricity tariffs over the
long-run.



Accelerate the adoption of trade facilitation measures. Structural inadequacies and administrative
efficiencies of the Kingstown Port and the Customs and Excises Department need to be
addressed to meet the targets established by the authorities in the implementation of
ASYCUDA, including to reduce the maximum clearance time, and accelerate initiatives to
strengthen the links between ASYCUDA and the Port Authority. In particular, this would involve
sharing information in a single manifest, merging the information needed by the Port in real
time and producing automated receipts.

22.
There are signs that the real effective exchange rate (REER) is overvalued. Most
estimates of misalignment of the real exchange rate point to an overvaluation (Annex II). These
estimates remain highly uncertain, however, since balance of payment statistics are currently being
revised throughout the ECCU. Following improvements in the ECCB’s survey to gather data, exports
of travel services appear to have been underreported to date, suggesting that the current account
balances may be stronger than currently reported.
23.
Since climate change presents unique challenges, the policy agenda to improve
climate resilience would benefit from faster implementation. St. Vincent and the Grenadines’
preparedness for hurricanes has improved, as have building codes, roads’ designs and housing
stocks. The authorities’ comprehensive disaster management approach, developed with multilateral
partners, is being reviewed by Cabinet. It includes the legal and regulatory framework supporting
upgrades in the physical infrastructure, building codes, and the data for land management. It needs
to be adopted and enacted without delay. Floods reconstruction capital spending also needs to be
prioritized among budgetary outlays.

6

St. Vincent and the Grenadines made resolving insolvency easier by introducing provisions for a rehabilitation
procedure to facilitate the continuation of the debtor’s business during insolvency proceedings and allow creditors
greater participation in important decisions during the proceedings; and establishing a public office responsible for
the general administration of insolvency cases.

7

St. Vincent and the Grenadines ranks at the bottom of the list in the “Resolving Insolvency” subcomponent of the
Doing Business indicators for methodological reasons. Particularly, the country has no record of cases involving a
judicial reorganization, judicial liquidation or debt enforcement procedures which triggers a score of 0. However, the
Doing Business report highlights the new Law as a positive development.

Data provision is broadly adequate for key areas of surveillance, but needs
improvements. Limited availability of labor market indicators is being addressed by the Labor

surveys and including IIP statistics, are expected by end-2016. The authorities are also improving
fiscal statistics with the new chart of accounts, compliant with GFS 2014, in place since the 2016
budget was approved. Moreover, statistical coverage of the operations of state-owned enterprises is
weak, given their non-compliance with financial reporting requirements. The authorities should aim
to have more timely and updated information by end-2016.
25.
The 2016 updated safeguards assessment found that the Eastern Caribbean Central
Bank (ECCB) continues to maintain a governance framework that provides for independent
oversight. Transparency in financial reporting has been maintained and the external audit
mechanism is sound. However, the internal audit function only partially conforms to international
standards, with steps underway to address this weakness.

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
26.
The authorities agree that public debt must be reduced over the medium-term,
according to their commitment to the ECCU debt target. They expect the debt to GDP ratio to
decline with economic growth, the completion of the airport, and the end of the disaster-related
budgetary outlays. However, they agree on the need to adopt additional policies to support further
medium-term fiscal consolidation. They do not consider that the baseline scenario represents their
policy intent over the medium-term, since they are prepared to take additional measures in the
future to meet the public debt target of 60 percent of GDP by 2030. Concerning adding the
previously omitted proportion of the financing flows from PetroCaribe, the authorities note that
every project financed by these flows is reviewed and approved by the cabinet. They are discussing
with Venezuela the treatment of these financing resources going forward. Finally, they agree that
growing debt service obligations are a challenge for the budget’s cash flow and the provision of
public services.
27.
The authorities intend to effect medium-term fiscal consolidation mostly by
continuing to improve revenue administration and control expenditure. They note the Inland
Revenue Department (IRD)’s progress in collecting tax arrears and intend to further strengthen
collection enforcement through legislative, IT and organizational reforms, and introducing a code of
conduct for employees of the Customs and Excises Department. They agree that tax compliance
should be a prerequisite for obtaining government contracts and tax concessions. However, they
stress that some flexibility would be required to avoid repercussions on economic activity. They also
intend to continue rationalizing the system for granting customs duties concessions to reduce the
revenue loss. Regarding expenditure, the authorities noted the large budgetary resources assigned
to the wage bill and retirement benefits of civil servants. They intend to assess how to improve the
delivery of public services, including through training civil servants. Concerned about improving the
18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

sustainability of the public service pension system, they intend to consult stakeholders about its
reform path. While the authorities do intend to accelerate the reform of the public procurement
system, they note that it is already operating based on well-defined principles and rules overseen by
the central supply tenders’ board.
28.
The proposed fiscal buffers to address natural disaster are likely underestimated since
they are calibrated on historical average costs of damages. Given that the frequency and costs of
natural disasters have increased during the last decade, the authorities assess that small island
developing states do not have the fiscal capacity to fully self-insure against such disasters. Instead,
they expect to also benefit from mitigation and adaptation resources within the context of the
United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), which would be more substantial than
existing facilities to address natural disasters provided by multilateral institutions. The authorities
consider that SDG resources could help further bolster the resilience of St. Vincent and the
Grenadines to the harmful effects of natural disasters brought on by climate change. Concerning the
execution of the post-2013 flood reconstruction capital expenses, the authorities note that some
bottlenecks are due to capacity challenges for small contractors to comply with requirements by
multilateral fund providers. They also consider that these efforts are constrained by the scarcity of
government lands available for reconstruction.
29.
The authorities agree on establishing a codified enunciation of PPP principles to
provide safeguards against possible contingent liabilities. However, they caution against a “one
size fits all” approach and consider that each PPP needs to be treated as a specific case.
30.
The authorities agree on the benefit from the new insolvency law for the financial
system and support implementation of the regionally harmonized insurance law. They see a
swift adoption and entry in operation of the latter as critical for mitigating the transmission of
shocks caused by financial interconnectedness.
31.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines is an attractive destination for private investment and
will continue to improve in that regard. Labor costs and the delivery of building permits
compares favorably to the rest of the ECCU. Soft loans for agriculture offered under the
government’s Farmers’ Support Program, implemented in 2014, are contributing to the pickup of
the agribusiness sector, including its diversification towards high value-added crops. In order to
further improve the private sector’s access to credit, the authorities support the ECCU Monetary
Council initiative to set up a regional development bank that would lend exclusively to the private
sector. Furthermore, to further improve the business environment, the authorities intend to
computerize the search for property titles. Moreover, the entry in operations of the international
airport will open up new export and tourism source markets. Finally, the availability of geothermal
energy is expected to reduce the variability in electricity tariffs over the medium-term, hence
alleviating a critical cause of uncertainty for investors.

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Economic activity is picking up and is expected to be further sustained by the airport’s
entry in operations. Activity seems to have recovered in 2015, prompted by recovering
construction, and tourism inflows. The latter and lower oil prices—which also contributed to
maintaining low inflation—have narrowed the current account deficit in 2015. However, due to the
stronger US dollar since 2014, the relative competitiveness of St. Vincent and the Grenadines has
deteriorated in non-US and non-ECCU markets. The fiscal position improved due to buoyant tax
receipts from raising customs duties but also due to expenditure restraint partly imposed by
financing constraints. Growth is projected to further increase in 2016 and over the medium-term,
spurred by investment prompted by the new airport. This game-changing project is expected to
boost tourist arrivals and agriculture exports through expanded airlift capacity and direct routes to
main markets. Risks to this projection are balanced.
33.
A strong and detailed commitment by the authorities to reduce public debt through
fiscal consolidation is critical. Public debt rose after launching the international airport project,
during a challenging period of global economic financial crisis and damages caused by three natural
disasters. The authorities have committed to reducing the public debt from 80 percent of GDP at
end-January 2016 to 60 percent of GDP by 2030, according to the agreement among ECCU
countries. A firm commitment on reforms based on a defined timetable, measurable actions, and
quantitative targets would strengthen the credibility of the authorities’ fiscal consolidation plans.
34.
Additional revenue from the 2016 budget measures and expenditure restraint are
expected to improve the fiscal position over the medium-term. The measures broaden the tax
base and address harmful behaviors through higher excises and fees. Their expected revenue would
contribute to both higher primary current spending and a strengthened primary balance in 2016.
However, higher interest payments are projected to leave the overall fiscal position unchanged.
Nonetheless, the full year impact of the revenue measures and expenditure restraint over the
medium-term are projected to improve the overall fiscal position by 2019.
35.
More ambitious fiscal consolidation is needed to meet the authorities’ long-term
public debt target, and build adequate buffers against natural disasters. In particular, the
government needs to target a primary surplus of 3.3 percent of GDP over the medium-term to meet
its public debt commitment by 2030. This represents additional measures yielding 1.7 percent of
GDP beyond current plans, of which 0.9 percent of GDP is deemed appropriate to address recurrent
natural disasters. There is significant scope to mobilize additional revenue by further broadening the
tax base, including by streamlining tax incentives, which is expected to improve the primary balance
by 1.1 percent of GDP over the medium-term. Concerning expenditures, continued restraint of the
wage bill will be crucial, particularly since public sector employees have high real wages relative to
their productivity. The public pension scheme and the National Insurance Service (NIS) also need to
be more sustainable, with the 2015 actuarial study providing sound options for reform.

20

36.
Proactive implementation of structural reforms is critical to support fiscal
consolidation. Reforms in revenue administration and public financial management need to be
accelerated and sustained, with a public commitment to a timetable and key milestones. The
National Economic Advisory Council may be helpful in monitoring progress in these reforms, which
need to be spearheaded by leaders appointed without delay. For all these reforms to gain traction,
however, it would be helpful to implement an accountability framework for public sector employees.
37.
Limiting contingent fiscal liabilities from Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) is essential
to protect the gains expected from fiscal consolidation. The authorities are encouraged to
implement very soon a codified enunciation of PPP principles that provides safeguards against
possible large contingent liabilities. This would guide the government in setting overall limits on PPP
liabilities, strengthening its negotiating position with private partners.
38.
Accelerating structural reforms to buttress competitiveness is critical to leverage the
growth-enhancing impact of the airport and geothermal projects. Labor productivity needs to
be lifted by upgrading the work force’s skills and improving their matching with key sectors’ needs.
Furthermore, enforcement of minimum standards of quality in these industries is critical. Continuing
to secure access by small businesses to affordable credit remains highly desirable while vigilance is
needed to secure repayment. Finally, trade needs further facilitation, including by better integrating
the activities of the CED and the Port Authority.
39.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines has relatively sound banks and leads the region in the
supervision of credit unions, but continued monitoring of the financial system is necessary.
The new insolvency law introduced in 2014, and its regulations issued in 2015, is an important step
to support the resolution of NPLs and facilitate the extension of credit. Introducing credit bureaus
and registries to reduce credit risk, as a region-wide initiative, would be another key step. The
Financial Service Authority (FSA) is encouraged to continue strengthening the supervision of the
non-bank financial sector, including closely monitoring the offshore banking sector, particularly in
the context of complying with capital and AML/CFT requirements.
40.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place within the next 12
months.

Annex II. Competitiveness and External Sustainability Analysis
The external position of St. Vincent and the Grenadines in 2015 could be improved through policies
fostering gains in competitiveness. Reserves are assessed to be adequate and sufficient to absorb most
shocks. There are signs that the real effective exchange rate is overvalued. However, ongoing revisions
to balance of payment statistics confer significant uncertainty about the exchange rate assessment.
St. Vincent would benefit from containing labor costs in line with productivity gains. Real
wages have increased by 23 percent over the last 15 years, while productivity has only improved by
18 percent. Real wage increases have outpaced productivity gains every year since 2000. This has
resulted in St. Vincent being one of the ECCU countries with the highest hiring costs relative to
productivity levels, in the public sector (2nd place) and in the tourism industry (3rd place).1 Real wages
of public sector employees increased by 45 percent for the period 2000-2014, and while their
productivity more than doubled during the same time, their wages relative to their productivity are
among the worst in the ECCU region.

The real effective exchange rate (REER) has rapidly appreciated in the last 18 months. After a
significant appreciation in the run up to the global financial crisis, the REER returned gradually to
relatively stable and lower levels. However, an analysis of the CPI-based real effective exchange rate
confirms a loss of competitiveness vis-à-vis trade partners since the second half of 2014. This
appears mainly caused by the appreciation of the US dollar, to which the EC dollar is pegged. A
persistent strong EC dollar might erode competitiveness in the tourism sector.

2 The large current account deficits in St. Vincent are mostly generated by large inflows of FDI and grants that
increase imports. It is likely the deficit would be much smaller in the absence of these large inflows, as in 2000-01
(see Box 1 of the 2014 Article IV, Country Report 15/259). On average over the last decade, almost 80 percent of the
current account deficit has been financed by non-debt creating flows, notably FDI and capital grants. However, FDI is
not included in desk estimates or EBA as an explanatory variable.

75 percent, due to an extremely high overvaluation shown in the MB approach of 148 percent,
which staff believes is overstated because EBA-lite’s fit of the model for St. Vincent and the
Grenadines is poor. At the ECCU level, staff estimates indicate the real exchange rate is undervalued
by about 9 percent. It is important to note that the ECCB, with CARTAC support, is revising the
balance of payments for all the ECCU countries and preliminary numbers indicate that the current
account deficit for St. Vincent and the Grenadines would be about 5 percent of GDP lower using the
new methodology.5

5 The ECCB has improved the surveys used to collect information resulting in larger exports of travel services that
were before unreported.

Annex III. PetroCaribe Arrangement and Public Debt
St. Vincent and the Grenadines joined the PetroCaribe agreement since 2005. The structure of
the agreement in St. Vincent is as follows: the governments of Venezuela and St. Vincent and the
Grenadines created a joint venture company (PDVSVG) to import fuel (diesel and LPG) into
St. Vincent and operate as a wholesaler. In this company Venezuela has a 51 percent equity stake
and the government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines owns the other 49 percent. PDVSVG sells fuel
to VINLEC (the public energy generation company) and to Sol (a private retailer). From the fuel sales
PDVSVG pays upfront 40 to 60 percent of its oil imports to Venezuela, and the rest is lent to
PetroCaribe St. Vincent Ltd., a company 100 percent owned by the government of St. Vincent and
the Grenadines. PetroCaribe St. Vincent is then in charge of investing the proceeds from the sale of
fuels it receives from PDVSVG. These investments should then generate a sufficient return for
PetroCaribe St. Vincent to repay the loans back to PDVSVG, and to fund social assistance programs.1
Only part of PetroCaribe St. Vincent’s debt to Venezuela is fully accounted in the public sector
debt statistics. At end-January 2016 the total debt to Venezuela under the agreement stood at
EC$183.8 million, of which only EC$71 million is recorded as government debt, to fund the
construction of the international airport. This suggest that the public sector debt should be about
5.3 percent of GDP (EC$112 million) higher to reflect the full debt to Venezuela. This includes EC$90
million that has been provided to the government in the form of soft loans and grants for a host of
social assistance programs and investments which have been reviewed by the cabinet.
In 2015 the government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines requested and obtained a one year
moratorium of payments to Venezuela. The request was made due to financing constraints
arising from the December 2013 floods. Under this moratorium PetroCaribe St. Vincent was allowed
to stop debt service and also to retain the cash portion (i.e. the upfront payment) of the oil imports
in 2015. The moratorium was extended at end-2015 until June 2016 at which time the debt service
to Venezuela will resume.
Financing from PetroCaribe to the government in 2016 will be significantly lower. With lower
oil prices it is expected that available financing from PetroCaribe St. Vincent to the government will
be less than half of what it was in 2015. PetroCaribe St. Vincent has limited liquid assets (EC$4.8
million) and most of its assets are tied in concessional long-term loans to the airport and the
government.
____________
If the oil price is above US$40 per barrel, Venezuela finances 60 percent of oil imports with a 25 year loan (2 years
grace period) at an interest rate of 1 percent, if the price falls below US$40 then Venezuela finances only 40 percent
of the oil imports with a 15 year loan (2 years grace period) at an interest rate of 2 percent.

Annex IV. The Geothermal Energy Project
The government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines plans to build a 10-15 MW geothermal
plant using the geothermal reservoir at the La Soufrière volcano. Construction of the plant is
expected to begin in 2016 and be completed by 2018 although it might be extended up to 2021. It
is estimated that the plant could generate about 60 percent of the country’s energy needs; and
combined with the currently installed hydro generation capacity, renewable energy would account
for almost 80 percent of St. Vincent’s energy demand.
The project is a public private partnership (PPP) with Emera Caribbean and Reykjavik
Geothermal.1 The required investment is estimated to be around US$82 million (10.5 percent of
2016 GDP), of which the government will inject US$8.2 million (1 percent of GDP) for a 25 percent
equity stake. The government financing is expected to come from a US$15 million concessional loan
(20 year maturity with 5 years of grace period and a 2 percent interest rate) from the International
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD), and a US$5.5
million grant from the UK government. Additionally, the government is exploring obtaining risk
capital from the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) under a facility developed by the InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB), where the grant can be converted to a loan if the project is
successful. The government plans to on lend to the project any financing it obtains above its equity
contribution. It also plans to relinquish future royalties for the use of the geothermal resource by the
private partners, with their amount converted into additional government equity.
The government and its partners have finalized their business plan, which is being reviewed
by the Clinton Foundation, the TA provider. Details of the plan remain undisclosed. A key point in
the negotiations would be the price at which the project would sell its energy to VINLEC (the state
owned producer and distributor of electricity). To bridge the gap between the tariff proposed by the
private partners and the one expected by the government, the risk premium demanded by the
private sector partners would need to decrease. This would require more concessional financing and
a higher equity participation by the government.
Depending on the medium-term price of oil, significant savings can potentially be achieved
by switching from fossil fuels to geothermal energy generation (Arnold McIntyre et al., 2016.
"Caribbean Energy; Macro-Related Challenges," IMF Working Papers 16/53, International Monetary
Fund.). McIntyre et al estimate that a 10 MW geothermal plant investment in St. Vincent
(US$92 million estimated investment) would need to reduce operating expenses by 19 percent (with
respect to the 2012-15 average) for the investment to pay for itself over a 20 year horizon. These
estimates are consistent with average future oil prices of about US$67 per barrel over the next 20
years, but if lower oil prices persist for a long period, the savings from switching to geothermal
energy generation will decline. It is estimated that between 2012 and 2015 the average operating

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

expense of VINLEC was US$0.26 per kWh2. Hence, St. Vincent could experience reductions in energy
generation costs from switching to geothermal generation.
In addition to lowering energy prices for consumers the government expects to save on oil
imports, by about US$13 million (out of US$21-US$22 million in oil imports for energy generation
in 2014). The government is counting on its lower oil bill to reduce its current account deficit and
increase its international reserves holdings; however, the repatriation of profits by its private
partners will counterbalance this effect in the current account, while the outflows to service the
project’s debt will also temper the gains on international reserves. Furthermore, the authorities’
estimates are based on oil prices considerably higher than the ones expected over the mediumterm.

Annex V. Debt Sustainability Analysis1
In the absence of remedial measures, the risk of public debt distress has risen to high,
even when abstracting from natural disasters and their additional fiscal burden, and
other downside risks, which are not included in the baseline scenario. To better ensure a
downward public debt path even in case of natural disasters, it is recommended to
proactively adopt measures for fiscal consolidation and actively build a fiscal buffer to
mitigate unexpected fiscal imbalances resulting from adverse shocks.

A. Background
St. Vincent’s risk of public debt distress has increased to high under the baseline scenario
where the authorities adopt no further fiscal measures. Between 2008 and 2015, total public
debt has risen from 57 to 73.4 percent of GDP, including to fund the construction of the new airport

2018, total public debt is projected to decline—
provided that the authorities do not take any additional fiscal measures to the ones already in
place—to 71.3 percent of GDP by 2030, which is the year when ECCU countries have committed to

Most public debt is financed by external concessional financing, with the share of the central
government rising until 2015. Public debt reached 73.4 percent of GDP in 2015, of which 43.2
percent of GDP as external debt, and 30.1 percent of GDP as domestic debt. Central government
obligations have been rising until 2015, and amounting to 90 percent the public external debt. In
contrast, other public sector external debt has been declining in recent years. Most external debt is
in multilateral and bilateral debt—the Caribbean Development Bank and Venezuela’s ALBA Bank
being the main creditors—with commercial external debt representing just 4 percent of the
obligations.

While the latest available data shows that most of the debt is protected from exchange rate
risk, interest rate risk is more of a concern. In 2014, 40 percent of the external debt had been
contracted at variable rates, which would be susceptible to a re-adjustment after an increase in US
interest rates.

B. Baseline Policy Scenario
Under this scenario, the authorities adhere to
their policies adopted to date without taking
any additional measure. The medium-term
primary fiscal surplus of the public sector is
projected to be 1.5 percent of GDP. The output
gap is expected to close by 2021, with real GDP
growth approaching 2.9 percent in the long run.
Inflation, which has been historically low in St.
Vincent, is expected to remain low in the
medium term. The resulting public debt
trajectory would decline to 71.3 percent of GDP,
well above from 60 percent of GDP by 2030, the
common ECCU target.

1 Assumes that natural disasters occur at 5-year intervals, lowering GDP
growth in the first year and causing a 3-year primary balance deterioration
associated to fiscal costs.

C. Introducing Natural Disasters
The occurrence of a natural disaster is modeled as an additional stress test. The average natural
disaster in St. Vincent and the Grenadines causes 5.5 percent of GDP in damages. A disaster of this
magnitude would typically result in a drop in GDP growth of about 2 percentage points the year of
the disaster, which accelerates by 0.5 percentage points the year after the disaster (boosted by
reconstruction). Based on the past distribution of damages between the public and the private
sectors, it is assumed that the government would cover 4 percent of GDP of the damages, and this
additional fiscal expenditure is assumed to be spread over 3 years (2 percent of GDP in the first year,
1.2 percent of GDP in the second year and 0.8 percent of GDP in the third year). Additionally,
revenues are assumed to be reduced by the fall in economic activity. Our representation of natural
disasters considers a sequence of recurrent negative shocks (every 5 years) starting in 2017 which
coincides with the second year of additional fiscal adjustments.
In the case of recurring natural disasters, the baseline policy scenario results in an increasing
public debt trajectory which ends at 86 percent of GDP in 2030. This growing debt also enhances
its vulnerability to simultaneous shocks of another nature.
The annual contribution towards an amount that would adequately cover the fiscal cost of
natural disasters is calibrated to the historical record for natural disasters in St. Vincent and
the Grenadines. Based on these records, staff estimates2 that St. Vincent and the Grenadines would
need to improve its primary fiscal balance by an additional 0.9 percent of GDP each year to
adequately buffer a natural disaster. This is based on EM-DAT data showing that, between 1970 and
2014, St. Vincent experienced 10 natural disasters (3 floods and 7 storms) which caused a total of
2

(forthcoming IMF Working Paper).

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

55.3 percent of GDP in damages. Hence, on average, the country lost 1.2 percent of GDP annually
from 1970 to 2014. Furthermore, the damage and loss assessments from the most recent disasters
(hurricane Tomas in 2010, April floods in 2011, and December floods in 2013) show that the fiscal
burden associated to the damages represents 73 percent of the total.

D. Active Policy Scenario
This scenario considers proactive fiscal measures to reach the ECCU-wide public debt target
by 2030, including with building buffers to mitigate the fiscal impact of potential natural
disasters. The key difference between the active and baseline policy scenarios is the budgetary
savings of 1.7 percent of GDP of which 0.9 percent of GDP assigned each year to eventually address
the fiscal cost of natural disasters. Under the active policy scenario, in the absence of natural
disasters, public debt is projected to decline steadily to 60 percent of GDP by 2025. However, when
a recurrent natural disaster occurs, the debt still follows a downward trajectory but declines more
slowly, reaching 60 percent of GDP by 2030.
Fiscal measures supporting the active policy scenario aim to restrain expenditure and enhance
tax revenue. These measures range from limiting wage bill increases, including by intensifying
attrition, to tax policy changes such as raising the customs charge and curbing ad hoc exemptions.
They also feature accelerating measures to improve revenue administration and public financial
management. While revenue administration measures have strong potential to increase the yield of
the VAT, income and profit taxes, and customs duties, these gains are not reflected in the fiscal
projections. Similarly, although reforms in public financial management are envisaged to yield
budgetary savings by improving the efficiency of public outlays, these savings are not reflected in
the fiscal projections. The expenditure and tax policy measures are envisaged to contribute to a
medium-term primary surplus of the public sector of 3.2 percent of GDP, 1.7 percent of GDP in
budgetary savings added to the medium-term primary surplus of the public sector of 1.5 percent of
GDP under the baseline policy scenario.3

E. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
The projected improvement in the current account balance over the medium-term is
projected to place external debt on a downward trajectory. While external debt represents
43.2 percent of GDP in 2015, staff projects that it would narrow to less than 16 percent of GDP by
2030. This is driven by improvements in the current account balance caused by imports declining at
a faster pace than exports, and transfers mirroring the GDP growth rate. While external debt is
expected to decline over time, it remains vulnerable to potential adverse shocks. Under the scenario
with key variables held at historical levels, external debt would be on an upward trajectory, although
this is not considered a likely outturn.

3
This corresponds to a primary surplus of the central government of 1.6 percent of GDP under the current policies
baseline scenario and a primary surplus of 3.3 percent of GDP under the active policy scenario.

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

Annex VI. Measures for Fiscal Consolidation
The authorities correctly consider that reforming the revenue administration provides
considerable scope to enhance tax revenue, currently only adequate to cover current primary
outlays (Figure 3). Guided by CARTAC recommendations, the authorities intend to develop the
capacity of the Customs and Excises Department (CED) to clear imports arriving at the new airport.
They also aim to improve the physical infrastructure of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) and
reform its procedures. They seek to strengthen the monitoring of tax compliance by harmonizing tax
identification numbers with identifiers from other registries, and improving communication between
the CED and IRD, and the National Insurance Scheme. Moreover, enforcement capacities should be
buttressed, and penalties should be increased and extended. Finally, the functionality of the IRD’s
appeals mechanism needs to be perfected. While these measures should raise the yield of income
and sales taxes, including the productivity of the VAT (as measured by the ratio of VAT revenue to
GDP divided by the VAT standard rate), currently low by regional standards (Figure 3), they are not
reflected into the revenue projections.
Efficiency gains are needed in public expenditure, through improvements in public financial
management. CARTAC is also supporting the authorities in this area. Tightening expenditure
controls requires staffing the internal audit unit at the Ministry of Finance, upgrading the financial
management information systems and setting up a cash management system unit at the Treasury,
including to prevent the accumulation of new arrears. The predictability and control of transfers to
public entities would benefit from tightening the oversight of public enterprises and strengthening
their reporting requirements and sanctions regime, along with extending monitoring to the National
Insurance Scheme (NIS) and the Kingstown Town Board (KTB). Developing a more proactive liquidity
management strategy would improve predictability in funds availability. The Draft Procurement Bill,
currently under revision following the World Bank’s suggestions, aims to upgrade the
competitiveness and efficiency of procurement procedures. The Public Sector Investment Plan (PSIP)
is being improved by a more systematic analysis of projects and their impact on recurring costs. The
authorities expect that these elements will be published in the macro fiscal documents underpinning
the 2017 budget. While these measures should contribute to budgetary savings while enhancing the
efficiency of public spending, they are not reflected into expenditure projections.
Reforms in tax and expenditure policy, politically more difficult to implement, would provide
tangible support to the fiscal consolidation.


56

The authorities are considering curtailing discretionary tax and customs concessions, with
the latter reportedly amounting to nearly 1.8 percent of GDP at end- 2015. While this policy
action would be beneficial, including because it would facilitate revenue administration
procedures, there is also scope for deeper reforms. In particular, a thorough review of
concessions granted through special legislation (mainly for large and upscale tourism projects
and the airport’s development) with a publication of their budgetary costs (foregone revenue of
Customs concessions is currently estimated at 3.8 percent of GDP) would be very helpful.



An important pillar of any fiscal consolidation is to contain the wage bill, which is
relatively high in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, even by regional standards (Country
Report No. 14/360, paragraph 15). The experience of smaller states has confirmed that
successful and sustained episodes of large fiscal consolidation have relied on curbing the wage
bill as a key component of their strategy.1 While this can be effected for a few years by a simple
wage and hiring freeze, a more durable, if lengthy, solution is to reform the civil service. This
would include retrenching certain positions and re-deploying staff towards new positions. While
the authorities have previously attempted a first step towards civil service reform— instituting a
performance management system—without success, this may be a more viable option once the
private sector recovers and offers additional employment opportunities.



Improving the sustainability of the public pension scheme and the National Insurance
Service would be a key element of the fiscal consolidation. Expenditure on pensions and
retirement benefits have grown from 2½ percent of GDP in 2011 to 3 percent of GDP in 2015
and is expected to keep rising, since the five pension schemes of public servants are all noncontributory and unfunded. This risks undermining the medium-term fiscal position, which can
be addressed by implementing parametric reforms among the options suggested by the
actuarial analysis published in 2015.

Exchange Rate Assessment: St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a member of the Eastern
Caribbean Currency Union, which has a common central bank (the Eastern Caribbean Central
Bank) and currency (the Eastern Caribbean dollar). Since July 1976, the Eastern Caribbean dollar

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar. The exchange rate
arrangement is classified as a currency board. St. Vincent and the Grenadines has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund's safeguards policy, the Eastern Caribbean Central
Bank (ECCB) is subject to a full safeguards assessment on a four-year cycle. An update
assessment was completed in April 2016 and found that the ECCB has maintained generally
strong controls over its key operations. External audit and financial reporting practices remain
sound. The ECCB financial statements are compliant with International Financial Reporting
Standards and are published on a timely basis. The internal audit function needs to be reformed
to align it with leading international practices and oversight could be further strengthened by
enhancing the financial expertise of the audit committee.
Article IV consultation: St. Vincent and the Grenadines is currently on a 12-month cycle. The
last Article IV consultation was concluded on February 8, 2015 by the Executive Board; the
relevant document is Country Report 15/259.
Technical Assistance: Several missions from the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre
(CARTAC), the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD), the Supporting Economic Management in the
Caribbean (SEMCAR), the Fiscal Management in the Caribbean Programme (FMCP) and the Legal
Department (LEG) have visited St. Vincent and the Grenadines since the beginning of 2006 to
assist the authorities.

In the area of public finance, CARTAC/LEG assisted with the introduction of the VAT and
excise taxes at all different stages. In CY 2011/2012, CARTAC delivered technical assistance to
review the revenue performance of the Value Added Tax and recommended measures to
enhance and safeguard VAT revenues. FAD provided technical assistance to reform and
modernize the Inland Revenue and the Customs and Excise departments. CARTAC also
supported a capacity building program in audit and assisted with the development of the Inland
Revenue Department’s (IRD) revised function-based organizational structure that resulted in a
full integration of VAT administration into the mainstream IRD. In Customs, CARTAC focused on
modernizing operations by strengthening risk management and post clearance (PCA) programs.
More recently, it trained 22 officers and advised on customs procedures to prepare for the
opening of the Argyle International Airport. In 2013/2014, progress was made in tax and customs
administration as the authorities started to implement some of the CARTAC recommendations. In
2016, CARTAC TA is being provided on reorganizing the IRD along functional lines, with the
management of taxpayers by segment and a clear separation of roles and responsibilities
between operations and HQ functions. IT support is also being provided to improve the
functionality of SIGTAS. FAD also provided advice on selected tax policy issues. Concerning
budgetary execution, CARTAC assisted to monitor the central government’s fiscal performance
relative to its annual budget targets. A workshop for Permanent Secretaries on strategic
budgeting reforms together with general public finance training has also been delivered. FAD

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

also offered advice on expenditure rationalization. In 2011/2012 SEMCAR assisted the authorities
in introducing a performance orientation in the budget of three ministries, reviewed the treasury
and modernized the budget execution process. In addition, the FMCP assisted in implementing
the new GFS-compliant chart of accounts in the FY2016 budget, adopting Cash Basis IPSAS and
developing a strategy to liquidate the expenditure arrears and prevent the occurrence of new
arrears. Some progress has also been made in the program budgeting framework after the
CARTAC mission, and the new 2015 Budget was set to be a pilot, with the objective to fully
implement program budgeting at the time of preparation of the 2017 budget. A medium-term
debt management strategy (MTDS) has been developed by the authorities and will be published
in 2016, based on the outcome of a joint IMF/World Bank mission (in collaboration with the
ECCB). An update to the strategy is expected to be published later in 2016, following a recent
mission by CARTAC.
 CARTAC has provided technical assistance in statistics to develop export and import prices,
national accounts, and balance of payments statistics. Furthermore, work on constructing
expenditure based GDP has been completed and the new data is expected to be published in
2016.
 On the financial front CARTAC provided technical assistance to review and upgrade the
International Insurance Act, and to develop regulations for Credit Unions. CARTAC also
provided technical assistance in conducting off-site and on-site examinations on banks in
international financial services industry. Progress in supervision of non-bank financial
institutions has advanced with the legislation for the Single Regulatory Unit (SRU) passed by
Parliament and its establishment already completed.
FSAP: A joint IMF/World Bank team performed an assessment of the financial sector of the
member states of the ECCU, in two missions—September 1–19 and October 20–31, 2003. The
missions assisted the authorities in assessing the development needs and opportunities for the
financial sector, identifying potential vulnerabilities of financial institutions and markets to
macroeconomic shocks, as well as assessing risks to macroeconomic stability from weaknesses in
the financial sector. The Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) was discussed by the
Executive Board on May 5, 2004, and subsequently published on the IMF’s external website,
including the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on Banking Supervision.
AML/CFT: With support from LEG, the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) conducted
an on-site assessment of the AML/CFT regime of St. Vincent and the Grenadines in 2009, and
published the detailed mutual evaluation report in 2010. The country was placed under CFATF’s
enhanced follow-up process in 2013, owing to outstanding shortcomings in its AML/CFT regime.
The enactment of the Anti-Terrorist Financing Proliferation Act in 2015 had a positive impact on
several FATF recommendations. However, since compliance with several other recommendations
is still outstanding and dependent on legislative amendments to the AML/CFT framework, the
CFATF retained the country under its enhanced follow-up and required the authorities to report
back to the Plenary in June 2016.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of February, 2016)
World Bank Group OECS Regional Partnership Strategy: On November 13, 2014, the Board of
the Executive Directors of the World Bank Group has endorsed the new OECS Regional
Partnership Strategy ((RPS) which will cover the period FY15-19. The high-level objective of the
new RPS is to contribute to lay the foundations for sustainable inclusive growth, in line with the
OECS governments’ priorities. In order to achieve this goal, the program is planned to be
organized around three main areas of engagement. Under the first one, the WBG is planning to
support “competitiveness”. Growth and job creation in the private sector will be supported both
horizontally – by improving the business environment– and vertically – by focusing on specific
sectors with a high potential to generate inclusive sustainable growth (particularly tourism,
agribusiness and their respective linkages). The second area of engagement is “public sector
modernization”, with particular focus on public financial management (PFM) and institutional
capacity, including for statistics and public private partnerships (PPPs), to better leverage private
investment in infrastructure and service provision. The third area is “resilience”, with the objective
to address both social vulnerabilities (in education, health and social protection), and exposure to
natural disasters.
Constrained in general by the small size of investments in the OECS, the IFC and MIGA will
contribute to the RPS objectives through selective investment support, depending on
opportunities. The IFC will focus on crisis response; job creation and inclusive growth; innovation,
competitiveness, and integration; and climate change. MIGA faces limited opportunities for
engagement because of the small market size of the OECS countries.
The RPS is grounded in a holistic approach to tackling the long-standing issues of low
growth and debt sustainability in the Caribbean: the Comprehensive Debt Framework,
developed in 2010 by the Bank at the request of the Heads of Government of CARICOM
countries. Structured around four pillars, the Comprehensive Debt Framework (CDF) is designed
to address the interdependent structural causes of high debt and low growth in small island
states by (i) promoting private-sector led growth, (ii) strengthening fiscal management, (iii)
building resilience to natural disasters, and (iv) improving debt management. Governments of
the OECS recognize the multifaceted nature of the challenges they face and understand that
improvements in competitiveness, reduction in sovereign debt levels, fiscal adjustments to
ensure macro sustainability, and enhanced sustainability and resilience to shocks are interrelated
aspects that are critical to resume and sustain inclusive growth. As a result, they have used the
CDF to frame their own reform strategies and activities.
The indicative IBRD lending program for the six OECS countries is expected to be around
US$120 million, or up to a maximum of US$20 million for each OECS country for the period of
the RPS (FY15-19), subject to country and program performance, IBRD’s lending capacity, and
exposure management parameters. In addition to the IBRD envelope, four OECS countries
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

(Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) can also count on an IDA
national allocation. The IDA17 (FY15-17) allocation for the OECS is equal to SDR61.3 million, an
increase of around 22 percent over the IDA16 OECS allocation (SDR50.3 million). With regard to
St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the national IDA-17 allocation is equal to SDR 14.8 million (about
USD 20.7 million).
World Bank Group engagement
Projects
The World Bank Group has currently two lending operations active in the country,
The Caribbean Regional Communication Infrastructure Project (CARCIP) – Phase 1, was
approved by the WB Board in May 2012 with Grenada (US$10 million IDA), St. Lucia (US$6million
IDA) and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (US$6 million IDA) as participating countries. The
objective of the CARCIP Phase I is to increase access to regional broadband networks and
advance the development of an ICT-enabled services industry in the Caribbean Region. The
program is structured along two main components: (i) Regional connectivity infrastructure,
aimed at increasing access and affordability of broadband communications networks in the
region and within countries. This will primarily be achieved through implementation of national
broadband infrastructure networks and a new submarine cable connecting SVG and Grenada
under PPP arrangements. By pooling the procurement regionally and structuring as a PPP, the
countries are expected to gain significant savings and attract interest from top notch operators
compared with proceeding in isolation; (ii) ICT-led innovation, aimed at leveraging the regional
broadband infrastructure to contribute to the development of the regional and national IT/ITenabled services (ITES) industry and job creation through business incubation/acceleration
services and IT/ITES skills trainings.
The World Bank team is currently discussing with the Government a possible restructuring of the
project to address some operational issues (e.g. review of cost estimates; review of indicators to
make them more realistic) and make sure to achieve meaningful results by the closing date.
The OECS Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project was approved in June 2011. St. Vincent and
the Grenadines will receive a total of US$20.92 million, including a US$10.92 million zero-interest
credit from IDA repayable in 35 years with a 10-year grace period; a US$7 million grant from the
Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR); and a US$3 million zero-interest loan from the PPCR
repayable in 40 years with a 10-year grace period. The project aims to create understanding of
the vulnerability of key structures and increase resilience of critical public infrastructure, which
will complement the work and goals of the PPCR. Component 1 will implement a broad spectrum
of interventions aimed at building resilience in public buildings and infrastructure. Component 2
will support regional efforts in the Eastern Caribbean to build capacity to conduct assessment of
natural risks and integrate such knowledge into policy- and decision-making for development
investments, disaster risk mitigation, climate change adaptation, and disaster response planning
across sectors. Component 3 will re-categorize financing or provide additional financing to cover
early recovery and rehabilitation costs following an adverse natural event, and subject to a

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

Government’s declaration of emergency in accordance with national law and the submission of a
recovery action plan satisfactory to the Association. Component 4 will strengthen and develop
the institutional capacity for project management and implementation. An Additional Financing
(AF) operation of US$40.6 million was approved for St. Vincent and the Grenadines in May 2014,
increasing the Project envelope from US$20.92 million to US $61.52 million and extending the
closing date to December 31, 2018. The additional funds will scale up project activities and cover
a cost overrun, the AF would: (i) support emergency recovery and construction activities; (ii)
enhance development impact; (iii) increase the number of beneficiaries, including women; (iv)
meet an unanticipated financing gap in the Parent Project; (v) replenish the Emergency Response
Component; and (vi) allocate strengthen project management and implementation support
capacity. About 50 percent of project proceeds would be used to support the Government of
St. Vincent’s emergency recovery efforts.
Economic and Sector Work
The Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF)
The Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF) is a multi-stakeholder platform designed to identify,
prioritize and implement a set of activities to improve the growth enabling environment in the
Caribbean, while promoting participatory public policy making. It has so far engaged more than
2,500 representatives from business associations, civil society organizations, Government, private
sector, media, indigenous groups, and international development agencies on themes such as
Logistics and Connectivity; Investment Climate; and, Skills and Productivity.
Low growth, high unemployment, especially for youth and women, high debt ratios (eight of the
top twelve most indebted countries in the world are in Caribbean), high incidence of crime, and,
growing vulnerability to external shocks characterize the region. In the wake of the global
financial crisis, the high debt/low growth challenge has become even more acute.
A number of Caribbean countries reached out to international donors to find an innovative
approach to the growth challenge in the region. A suggestion was made to launch a genuinely
participatory growth initiative. Following consultations and some preparatory work, the program
started in mid-2012 with a regional launch event in Jamaica. The process is supported and
facilitated by the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Caribbean
Development Bank, Compete Caribbean and the European Union.
Key Outcomes
Positive outcomes are tangible: twelve countries formally joined the process by establishing their
national CGF chapter and have completed the first phase of national dialogue. This effort has led
to the prioritization of concrete and actionable activities and draft action plans are now available,
with details on each activity’ implementation plan (e.g., accountabilities, milestones, timeline,
funding). The results of each country’s dialogue were presented at three regional forum in The
Bahamas in June 2013, in St. Kitts and Nevis in 2014, and in St. Lucia in June 2015. This allowed

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

national stakeholders from government, private sector and civil society to compare notes on
each other’s’ priorities and exchange ideas on solutions to each identified challenges with
technical specialists and peers. Each government involved in the CGF also committed to followup on implementation of the reform agenda, to report back periodically on progress (every 4-5
months) and to enable independent monitoring of the reforms by private sector and civil society
representatives.
The Bank has completed a series of analytical products relating to public expenditure, fiscal and
debt sustainability, growth and competitiveness, the financial sector, public sector management
and social protection. The ongoing dissemination of these reports represents a key instrument
for policy dialogue with the OECS governments, including St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
In the context of the Support of Economic Management for the Caribbean (SEMCAR) program, a
team is working with the authorities on an Action Plan for Customs improvements and has
assessed the system by using the Customs Assessment Trade Toolkit (CATT). The CATT
assessment measures 120 high level indicators which are combined and aggregated into seven
intuitive dimensions: Process orientation, Strategic thinking, Transparency, Control, Efficiency,
Effectiveness and Facilitation. The distinctive feature of the CATT is that it is evidence base
framed by a set of international best practices which are compared against the practice that
currently is used.
The Bank’s program in St. Vincent and the Grenadines is further supported by a comprehensive
series of completed, ongoing and planned analytical and advisory activities, including the
following: “Towards a New Agenda for Growth” – OECS growth and competitiveness study
(2005); An OECS Skills Enhancement Policy Note (2006); a Caribbean Air Transport Report (2006);
a regional study on Crime, Violence, and Development: Trends, Costs, and Policy Options in the
Caribbean (2007); an OECS Private Sector Financing Study (2008); the OECS Tourism Backward
Linkages Study (2008); the report titled “Caribbean – Accelerating Trade Integration: Policy
Options for Sustained Growth, Job Creation and Poverty Reduction” (2009); a study on the Nurse
Labor & Education Markets in the English-Speaking CARICOM: Issues and Options for Reform
(2009); and Caribbean Regional Electricity Supply Options: Toward Greater Security, Renewable
and Resilience (2011).

RELATIONS WITH THE CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK (CDB)
(As of May 23, 2016)
The strategic objectives of CDB’s country assistance strategy for St. Vincent and the Grenadines
(2014-18), are to (i) accelerate and sustain inclusive economic growth; (ii) promote human and
social development; and (iii) enhance environmental sustainability and disaster risk management.
The related assistance program entails financing commitments of up to US$86.7 million inclusive
of $21 million from Special Funds Resources (SFR), and the remaining $65.7 from the Bank’s
Ordinary Capital Resources to help GOSVG implement selected components of its National
Economic and Social Development Plan (NESDP), 2013-2025. The SDF facility, in addition to
providing grants, offers loans with longer maturities and grace periods as well as lower rates of
interest than financing sourced from the Bank’s ordinary operations.
Since the start of 2016, the Bank has approved loans and grants to GOSVG for 3 major projects.
An amount of US$7.4 million was approved in March 2016 from the SFR to assist GOSVG to
expand the supply of skilled and employable labor with regionally acceptable certification. The
skills-enhancing project provides for policy and institutional reforms of the Technical and
Vocational Education and Training (TVET) system to improve its responsiveness as a vehicle for
workforce development, the enhancement of the learning environment and teacher/instructor
training, as well vocational training targeted at out-of-school and “at risk” unemployed youth
and adults.
SVG is exposed to high levels of risk to meteorological and geophysical hazards, which have
significant negative impacts on SVG’s economic and fiscal stability. These natural hazards are
being exacerbated by the adverse impacts of climate variability and climate change, which place
increased stress on water availability, coastal protection investments, food security, national
infrastructure and livelihoods, especially of the poor and vulnerable groups in SVG.
In March 2016, CDB approved a loan of US$11.2 million to GOSVG to finance a project to reduce
the vulnerability of certain communities to extreme rainfall and other climate change impacts
through: (a) the upgrade of roads, bridges and river defences; (b) slope stabilization; (c)
enhancement of the national early warning system (NEWS); and (d) monitoring and evaluation
(M&E). Since 2010, GOSVG has received financing of up to US$34.2 million from CDB for disaster
risk reduction, which includes financing for a flood risk reduction study on eight windward
watersheds.
To address the climate change challenges and achieve sustainable development, mitigation
measures are being addressed by CDB through increased focus on the energy sector. Options
such as climate resilience and low carbon energy are key elements being considered in the
transformation process of the energy sector. SVG is heavily dependent on imported petroleum

products to meet its energy requirements. Electricity production on all of the islands is entirely
diesel-based, except for the main island of St. Vincent where 80% of the electricity is produced
by diesel generators and the remaining 20% by small hydropower plants. As volcanic islands
with an active volcano, La Soufrière, in the north of the main island, St. Vincent is expected to
have excellent geothermal potential. CDB approved, in May 2016, grants to the St. Vincent
Geothermal Company Limited (SVGCL), a joint venture established between GOSVG and St.
Vincent Geothermal Holdings Limited, of (i) four million Pounds to contribute to the capital of
SVGCL, and (ii) USD9.5 million to assist SVGCL in financing exploratory drilling to assess the
geothermal resource in the La Soufrière region in northern St. Vincent for electricity production.
Once the adequacy of the geothermal resources is proven and independently certified, the
contingently recoverable grant of US$9.5 million converts to a loan to SVGCL.
Cumulative loans approved by CDB to St Vincent since 1970 stands at US$296 million of which
US$242 million is disbursed. Total loans outstanding amounts to US$132.1 million.
The disbursement of loans to St Vincent during 2015 and 2016 are tied to project financing for
the South Leeward Highway road upgrade; the rehabilitation and reconstruction of critical
infrastructure damaged by Hurricane Tomas in 2010; and technical and vocational educational
development.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 14, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance with some key data shortcomings

in national accounts and balance of payments statistics.
National Accounts: A new rebased GDP by economic activity series (using 2006 as the base
year instead of 1990) was released in January 2011 with assistance from CARTAC. The new
series improved coverage, data sources, and methodology. Subsequent technical assistance
missions undertaken over 2011 to 2014 have assisted in developing the GDP by expenditure
estimates that are expected to be released in 2016. The latest mission undertaken in
October 2015 assisted with improvements to the GDP by economic activity estimation
methodology. Advice was also provided to improve the GDP by expenditure estimates;
develop quarterly GDP estimates; compile supply and use tables; and to rebase the GDP. A
medium-term action plan to improve and expand the national accounts aggregates has been
developed. It will be necessary to increase the staffing and other resources of the CSO in order
to implement the action plan. In addition, improvements are needed on data used to monitor
labor markets.
Price Statistics: A new CPI index series (with January 2010 as the base) was introduced in June
2011 with assistance from CARTAC. The new index introduced updated methods and
procedures used for compiling the CPI in accordance with international standards and enables
comparisons among the ECCU member states. The new index uses a Household Budget and
Expenditure Survey (HBES) that took place in 2008, replacing the old HBES conducted in 1996,
to construct an updated CPI basket. As part of the CARTAC’s assistance with the new CPI index
it helped link the 2001 based to the 2010-based CPI series.
Government Finance Statistics: Due to delays in reporting capital expenditures by some
ministries, monthly revenue and expenditure data for the central government are provided to
the International Monetary Fund with some lag. Discrepancies exist between the fiscal and
monetary accounts, between above and below the line for budget data, and between
financing and debt data. The financial reports of public enterprises are not timely, with about a
two-year lag.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monthly monetary statistics are compiled and reported to the
Fund by the ECCB, based on standardized report forms (SRF) for the central bank (SRF 1SR)
and for other depository corporations (SRF 2SR), since July 2006. In April 2007, a data ROSC
mission assessed the monetary statistics with reference to the GDDS and the Data Quality
Assessment Framework (DQAF, July 2003). It indicated that the institutional coverage of other
depository corporations is incomplete, as data for mortgage companies, finance companies,
building societies, and credit unions—all of which accept deposits—are excluded. Also,
accrued interest is not incorporated in the value of the interest-bearing assets and liabilities,
and valuation adjustments are included in other liabilities. In addition, source data for the
commercial banks do not provide the disaggregation recommended by the Monetary and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

Financial Statistics Manual and Compilation Guide. Close coordination between the ECCB and
the single regulatory unit (which supervises financial corporations other than those licensed
under the Banking Act) is crucial. The ECCB is currently working on implementing a new
reporting system for commercial banks that is envisaged to address the recommendations
made by the April 2007 data ROSC mission. It is expected that the new reporting system would
be implemented in 2016-17.
Financial Soundness Indicators (FSI): Although the ECCB compiles, for internal use, a core set of

financial soundness indicators (banking system) for national member states, including St.
Vincent, and the ECCU region as a group, hardly any of this information is disseminated on a
regular basis in official statistical publications or on the ECCB’s website. A limited set of core
FSI indicators for the ECCU banking sector is expected to be published in the inaugural version
of the Regional Financial Stability Report, slated for release by the CCMF at the end of the first
quarter of 2016. CARTAC plans to undertake a TA Mission on financial soundness and macroprudential indicators at the ECCB in November 2016 with a view to helping that Institution reorganize its processes to prepare and publish core financial soundness for the banking system
on a sustainable basis.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments data are compiled and disseminated by the

ECCB on an annual basis. The ECCB released preliminary summary estimates of 2014 balance
of payments and—for the first time—international investment position statistics following the
latest international standard methodology (BPM6) for the eight ECCU member territories in
January 2016. The ECCB plans to publish comprehensive balance of payments data in October
2016. The estimates benefited from CARTAC TA to develop and administer new surveys, and
train data compilers and survey respondents. Given the lack of detail of 2014 data, more work
is needed to review the recent revisions and identify balance of payments components that
need further improvement. Methodological soundness, coverage, and classification need to be
improved. Further work has been identified to: i) improve timeliness of annual data
dissemination (the most current data reported to STA pertains to 2013); and ii) review and
produce, as far back as reasonably possible, time series that are consistent with BPM6
methodological changes. Data periodicity should also be improved. Actions will have to be
undertaken in conjunction with the ECCB, which coordinates the compilation of the external
sector statistics for all its member countries.
The Ministry of Finance maintains a database on public and publicly-guaranteed external loans
that provides detailed and current information on disbursements, debt service, and debt
stocks. The Treasury maintains the data on bonds placed abroad. Data from the two databases
as well as information on payments by creditor (actual and scheduled) need to be further
consolidated to produce timely debt stock data.
II. Data Standards and Quality

St. Vincent and the Grenadines has been participating in the General Data Dissemination
System since September 2000 and currently participates in its successor initiative, the e-GDDS.
The 2007 regional data ROSC provides an assessment on the ECCB’s monetary statistics. No
data ROSC is available for other sectors.
