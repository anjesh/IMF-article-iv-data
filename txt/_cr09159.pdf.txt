EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The discussions focused on the prospective impact of the global crisis and the appropriate
policy response, especially in light of Jordan’s external and fiscal vulnerabilities.
Background
Jordan’s macroeconomic performance was generally favorable in 2008. Real GDP growth was
strong for most of the year, and inflation, which had climbed sharply due to the surge in world
fuel and food prices, subsequently came down quickly as world prices softened. Economic
activity is expected to slow significantly in 2009, reflecting the much weaker global and
regional outlook. Managing the prospective slowdown while guarding against vulnerabilities—
especially the still-large current account deficit—is the key near-term challenge.
Authorities’ views
The authorities plan to increase capital spending substantially in 2009 to support activity.
Lower subsidies—on account of lower world food prices and the removal of fuel subsidies
last year—will allow some reduction in the overall fiscal deficit, despite a cyclical weakening
in revenue and lower grants. Additional stimulus is not planned at this stage and will be
undertaken only if additional concessional financing is forthcoming.
While taking steps to ensure confidence and liquidity in the interbank market, the central
bank allowed the differential against dollar interest rates to widen in order to guard against
any deterioration in the balance of payments. With reserves continuing to build, inflation
falling sharply, and bank credit sluggish, cautious monetary easing is being undertaken.
Although bank soundness indicators remain favorable, the authorities are taking pre-emptive
measures to guard against risks. Banking supervision is being enhanced and banks are being
encouraged to build capital buffers, in line with FSAP Update recommendations.
Staff recommendations
The 2009 fiscal stance strikes a reasonable balance between reducing vulnerabilities and
supporting domestic activity. Further fiscal stimulus would carry significant risks. If
undertaken, it should be temporary, well-targeted, and presented within a credible mediumterm fiscal consolidation framework.
The peg remains appropriate for Jordan. As long as the balance of payments position remains
broadly stable, there may be scope for a further modest cut in policy interest rates.
Intensified banking supervision is warranted in the current environment. Steps taken by the
Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) are welcome. In view of the uncertainty surrounding the depth
and duration of the global crisis, intensified contingency planning to deal with worst-case
situations is advisable.

I. BACKGROUND
A. Overview
1.
Jordan has experienced impressive macroeconomic performance in recent years,
underpinned by its strong trade links with the region and the rest of the world. Annual real
GDP growth averaged 6 percent since the start of the decade, supported by the
implementation of sound policies and wide-ranging structural reforms. As a result, per capita
GDP almost doubled from 1999 to 2008. Inflation remained generally low, and efforts to
tighten fiscal policy facilitated a substantial decline in public debt. Although the external
deficit widened, sizable FDI inflows enabled a steady and sizable increase in foreign
reserves.

2.
Over the coming year, economic activity is expected to slow significantly,
reflecting the weaker global and regional outlook. Although limited integration with
global financial markets has buffered Jordan from recent turmoil, the key near-term policy
challenge is to manage the impact of the global economic slowdown while mitigating risks
related to fiscal and external vulnerabilities. Accordingly, the discussions focused on:
•

the very limited room for fiscal policy stimulus, especially in light of Jordan’s stillhigh public debt and sizable current account deficit;

•

the scope for cautious monetary policy easing to support activity;

•

appropriate steps to guard against risks in the banking sector; and

•

structural reforms to support medium-term fiscal adjustment and growth potential.

5
B. Recent Developments
3.

Jordan’s macroeconomic performance was generally favorable in 2008.

•

Real GDP growth averaged 5.6 percent during the year, only slightly slower than
the 2007 pace (Table 1 and Figure 1). However, preliminary data indicate a slowdown
to 4 percent (y-o-y) in the fourth quarter, mainly due to weaker activity in the
construction, finance, and trade sectors.

•

Sharply lower world fuel and food
prices since late 2008 brought
inflation down. After rising
to 20 percent y-o-y in September,
mainly on account of the previous
surge in commodity prices,
headline inflation moderated to
1½ percent (y-o-y) by
February 2009, and core inflation
eased to below 4 percent.

•

Lower commodity prices also helped narrow the current account deficit to 12 percent
of GDP in 2008 (from 17¾ percent in 2007 and 19 percent in 2008H1). Imports
slowed sharply in the latter part of the year as prices fell, while tourism receipts
remained strong, and mining exports were buoyed by continued high prices. Higher
grants also contributed to reducing the external deficit (Table 2 and Figure 2).

•

FDI financed about three quarters of the external deficit, with the remainder largely
coming from positive errors and omissions. The authorities believe that a significant
part of the errors and omissions (estimated at 7 percent of GDP in 2008) may be
related to current inflows, particularly remittances from Iraqi migrants and overseas
Jordanians. Part may also represent unrecorded re-exports to Iraq.

•

Official foreign exchange reserves rose to $7.7 billion by end-2008 (equivalent to
about 6 months of imports), more than reversing a decline earlier in the year related to
the buyback of nonconcessional Paris Club debt. 1 Reserves edged down during
October–November but have increased steadily since mid-December (to $8.5 billion
at end-March). The real effective exchange rate appreciated by 6 percent in 2008 due
to the wider inflation differential against trading partners and strengthening of the
U.S. dollar—to which the dinar is pegged—against other currencies.

1

The $2.1 billion buyback was financed by a land sale (about $500 million) and with balances—mainly
privatization proceeds—held in the government’s accounts (about $1.6 billion). The latter was reflected in a
drawdown of foreign reserves held by the CBJ.

6
4.

However, Jordan’s money and financial markets have weakened since mid-2008.

•

Bank deposits edged down slightly in October but subsequently recovered (Figure 3
and Tables 3 and 4). The share of dinar deposits has continued to increase, reflecting
the interest rate differential. Bank credit has also slowed sharply in recent months and
has been essentially flat since December. The share of credit to construction and real
estate edged down in 2008Q4.

•

The stock market has corrected
since its June 2008 peak,
although its performance
between end-2007 and end2009Q1 (25 percent decline)
remains better than many other
markets in the region. While
quantitative indicators are not
available, news reports suggest
that property prices in certain
market segments have softened.

The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) took pre-emptive steps to maintain
confidence and support the domestic money market following the onset of global
turbulence.
•

In October, the CBJ announced a full guarantee of all bank deposits until end-2009. 2
Operations to soak up liquidity were also scaled back. As a result, banks’ excess
reserves have increased sharply in recent months.

•

In late November, policy interest rates were cut by 50 bps. The reserve requirement
was also reduced by 100 bps to 9 percent, partly reversing a 200 bps increase earlier
in the year. The deeper cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, however, resulted in a
widening of the interest rate differential against the dollar to 400 bps by year-end.
With reserves continuing to build, headline inflation moderating rapidly, and bank
credit decelerating, the CBJ cut rates by a further 50 bps in mid-March 2009 and
announced that the reserve requirement would be reduced by another 100 bps from
end-April.

High fuel and food prices for much of 2008, and softening domestic revenues,
put pressure on the fiscal position.
•

•

The deficit excluding grants reached
11.2 percent of GDP, against
8.9 percent in 2007 (Tables 5 and 6
and Figure 4). The outcome could
have been much worse had it not
been for the bold decision in
early 2008 to remove fuel subsidies
and institute an automatic price
adjustment mechanism that fully
passed through changes in world
prices.

However, higher grants contained the overall deficit at 6.1 percent of GDP. Rapid
nominal GDP growth, together with the Paris Club debt buyback in early 2008,
resulted in a substantial reduction in total public debt to around 60 percent of GDP at
end-2008 (from 70 percent of GDP at end-2007).

7.
Banking sector profitability and soundness indicators have so far remained
favorable. Banks’ liquidity ratios are high and funding is predominantly from deposits.
Notwithstanding a moderate decline in the banking system’s capital adequacy ratio in 2008
due to implementation of Basle II standards (especially the incorporation of operational risk),
it remains well above the 12 percent requirement (Table 7), although there is significant
variation across banks. Stress tests conducted by the recent FSAP Update mission indicate
limited exposure to interest rate, liquidity, interbank contagion, and other market risks.
However, the tests also identify vulnerability to credit and concentration risks. In particular,
the real estate, construction, and foreign trade sectors are vulnerable to weaker activity, and
banks with substantial exposures abroad are likely to be adversely affected by the slowdown
in advanced economies.

Progress on structural reforms continued over the past year. Public financial
management continues to be strengthened via improved budget classification and
implementation of a Chart of Accounts, preparations for the government financial
management information system (GFMIS), and implementation of the first phase of the
Treasury Single Account.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Outlook
9.
Economic activity is expected to slow substantially in 2009. Real GDP growth is
projected to slow to 3 percent, in line with the weaker global and regional outlook (Box 1).
Average inflation will continue to decline to 4 percent, reflecting lower world food and fuel
prices. Exports are projected to decline, though the impact on the current account will be
more than offset by lower imports (on account of lower oil and food prices as well as weaker
activity). As a result, the current account deficit is projected to narrow to about 11 percent of
GDP.

Box 1. Regional Linkages
Jordan has strong links with the region—especially the GCC countries—through
trade, tourism, remittances, grants, and capital flows.
This is reflected in the strong correlation between Jordan’s real GDP growth and
output growth in GCC countries, especially output of the non-oil sector, which
accounts for the bulk of remittances and exports to/from Jordan. In 2009, non-oil
growth is projected to slow significantly in GCC countries. This will, in turn, affect
growth prospects in countries with which they have strong economic links, such as
Jordan.

Over the medium term, growth is expected to pick up as the global recovery sets in,
eventually rising to about 5½ percent. Inflation is projected to ease further to 2 percent, roughly
equal to the average over the past decade and in line with projected inflation in major trading
partners. The current account deficit should narrow to about 9½ percent of GDP, mainly due to
further capacity expansion that will increase mining exports. The medium-term fiscal outlook
assumes that capital spending relative to GDP will gradually ease back toward its average level
in recent years and taxes will recover moderately as cyclical conditions improve. Thus, the
fiscal deficit excluding grants will narrow

11.
Key risks to the outlook relate to financing the current account deficit, which is
projected to remain sizable. Adverse external shocks could widen the current account deficit
substantially. Exports, tourism, remittances, and/or grants receipts could weaken more
sharply, especially if the global and/or regional downturn proves deeper than currently
expected. The sharp tightening of the liquidity situation that has taken place in the GCC
countries, which have accounted for a large share of FDI and portfolio inflows in recent
years, may reduce capital flows into Jordan more than presently envisaged. A deeper
economic slowdown in Jordan could push up unemployment and weaken asset prices as well
as the quality of banks’ loan portfolios. The authorities agreed that a slowdown of the
domestic economy is inevitable, but they were confident that the situation would remain
manageable. They noted that the sharp declines in world fuel and food prices, which
represent a large terms of trade gain for Jordan, would support domestic demand and
therefore imply significant upside risk to the staff’s macroeconomic projections.

11
B. Fiscal Policy
12.
The fiscal stance in 2009 seeks to keep the deficit in check while providing some
stimulus to the economy. The deficit excluding grants is projected to narrow by almost
1½ percent of GDP. Lower world commodity prices and the authorities’ plan to remove barley

fiscal and external vulnerabilities.
13.
The authorities intend to proceed cautiously in response to calls for increased
spending. They recognize that the already high public debt ratio and fiscal deficit imply
limited room for further stimulus. Any additional spending, which is not envisaged at this
stage, would be undertaken only if additional grants and/or concessional loans are
forthcoming. They also emphasized that, in such circumstances, measures would be taken to
ensure that the spending is well targeted and temporary, and they would put forward a
credible plan for consolidating the public finances over the medium term.
14.
The authorities remain committed to further reducing public debt and fiscal
vulnerabilities over the medium term. Staff cautioned that even without additional
spending this year and in the absence of tightening measures, pubic debt would exceed
the legislative ceiling for 2011 of 60 percent of GDP. Indeed, a reduction of the deficit by
over 1 percent of GDP a year would be needed to keep the debt ratio on a downward
trajectory. The authorities acknowledged the need for fiscal adjustment and indicated that
they intend to significantly reduce the deficit over the medium term. They agreed that in view
of the relatively high revenue ratio, it should concentrate on the expenditure side. In this
context, they noted that the public sector reform strategy, which could include pension and

civil service reforms, would support medium-term fiscal consolidation. They will also
consider income tax reform to enhance the efficiency of the tax system.
15.
Ongoing fiscal structural reforms will support the needed fiscal adjustment by
raising the efficiency of expenditures and financial control. The authorities noted that
the 2009 budget had been prepared within a medium-term framework and that resultsoriented budgeting had been introduced in 2008. They also pointed to their ongoing efforts to
strengthen the public financial management system, in particular their aim to extend
coverage of the Treasury Single Account to government accounts in commercial banks and
begin rolling out the GFMIS at six pilot sites from mid-2009.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
16.
Monetary policy remains geared to maintaining confidence in the exchange rate
peg and adequate liquidity in the domestic money market. The authorities noted that the
interbank market had tightened following the onset of global financial turbulence, and the
measures taken by the CBJ had succeeded in restoring liquidity quickly. At the same time,
the CBJ had taken a cautious approach to following the U.S. interest rate cuts, allowing the
interest differential to widen in order to avoid pressure on the balance of payments. In the
event, confidence in the peg—reflected in continued switching from dollar to dinar
deposits—and an improving current account position had helped strengthen the overall
balance of payments, which in turn allowed the CBJ to cut rates in March. The authorities
indicated that the timing of any future cuts would continue to depend on developments in
inflation, bank credit, and the balance of payments. Once bank credit growth normalizes, the
CBJ stands ready to tighten liquidity by resuming issuance of certificates of deposit (CDs).
Recapitalization of the CBJ will be considered over the medium term to strengthen its
balance sheet. The authorities emphasized that profit and loss considerations would continue
not to have any bearing on the conduct of monetary policy.
17.
The authorities concurred with the staff’s assessment that the real exchange rate
of the dinar is broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 2). They observed that the peg had
been critical in maintaining confidence in the Jordanian economy during a period of major
turmoil in global markets. They noted that the current account had already narrowed
substantially in response to lower world fuel and food prices, and they expected considerable
further narrowing in 2009 with the full-year impact of the lower prices. They also noted that
a significant part of the errors and omissions in the balance of payments could represent
unrecorded current inflows, and that transactions related to transient Iraqi migrants may have
caused the current account deficit to widen temporarily. Thus, the “underlying” current
account deficit is likely narrower than the recorded deficit.

Staff estimates suggest that the real exchange rate of the dinar is broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals.
Averages of estimates from alternative
methodologies1—based both on the
“underlying” current account2 in 2008 and
its projected level over the medium term—
range from small overvaluation to modest
undervaluation. However, the wide range
of estimates across the various approaches
underscores their imprecision and suggests
caution in drawing definitive policy
prescriptions.

1/ Measures the adjustment needed to eliminate the gap between an estimated current account "norm"—obtained from
applying CGER cross-country panel regression coefficients to Jordanian data—and the projected "underlying" medium-term
current account balance for Jordan.
2/ Provides an estimate of the adjustment needed to stabilize Jordan's net foreign assets (NFA) to GDP ratio at its end2007 level (-128 percent of GDP), using CBJ data for NFA. If NFA data are instead taken from the Lane/Milesi-Ferretti
cross-country database (NFA equal to -61 percent of GDP), the resulting estimate is -2.7 percent with 2013 fundamentals
and +7.2 percent with 2008 fundamentals.
3/ Estimates the deviation between the actual and the "equilibrium" REERs. The latter is obtained by applying coefficients
from the CGER cross-country panel regression to Jordanian data.

_____________________________

For a description of the methodology underlying these updated estimates of exchange rate misalignment
and the “underlying” current account, see Chapters I and II, respectively, of the Selected Issues paper for
the 2008 Article IV Consultation (IMF Country Report No. 08/291). Chapter II also provides empirical
analysis of export and import trends, which remains valid in light of developments over the past year.

The estimated “underlying” deficit excludes transient factors related to the conflict in Iraq (1–4 percent of
GDP in 2008) and temporary terms of terms movements related to high commodity prices in 2008 (about
2 percent of GDP). Thus, the underlying deficit in 2008 is estimated at about 6–9 percent points of GDP,
significantly narrower than the actual level. Chapter II of the Selected Issues paper for the 2008 Article IV
Consultation (IMF Country Report No. 08/291) contains details on the calculation of the underlying deficit
for 2007.

D. Financial Sector Policies
18.
Jordanian banks’ financial indicators have so far not been affected significantly
by the global financial turmoil. The authorities noted that the banking system’s liquidity
position is comfortable and the average capitalization ratio remains high. They indicated that
all banks are in compliance with capital adequacy requirements and are comfortably meeting
liquidity requirements. So far there has been very limited impact on credit quality, with the
nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio edging up only slightly (from 4.1 percent at end-2007 to
4.2 percent at end-2008). While they acknowledged that a further deterioration in loan
quality is possible as economic activity slows and property prices soften, they noted that
banks are monitoring exposures closely and repricing credits and/or cutting credit lines to
customers facing increased risks, especially in the real estate and foreign trade sectors. The
authorities were of the view that the banks’ portfolio rebalancing process may be nearing
completion, and they were hopeful that credit growth would normalize in coming months.
19.
The authorities are nevertheless taking extensive preemptive steps to guard
against risks, broadly in line with FSAP Update recommendations (Box 3). Banks are being
encouraged to build capital buffers, both by increased profit retention and through capital
injections by shareholders. Global consolidated supervision is being enhanced, including
through increased contacts with foreign supervisory agencies and on-site supervisory visits to
foreign subsidiaries of domestic banks. An early warning system for monitoring risks,
especially credit risk, is now operational. The CBJ’s supervisory function is also being
enhanced with the recruitment of 12 additional banking supervision staff. A new on-site
supervisory manual is in the final stages of preparation, and CBJ guidelines on stress testing
are soon to be issued to banks. An automated data collection system—to enhance off-site
monitoring capacity—is to be introduced in the next few months. In addition, implementation
of the Basle II framework is proceeding in line with expectations, and the FSAP Update
found that nearly all supervision principles are largely compliant or better with the Basle
Core Principles.
Box 3. FSAP Financial Stability Recommendations
Short Term

Encourage banks near regulatory minimum to increase capital.
Enhance global consolidated supervision.
Strengthen contingency planning framework to deal with stress in the
banking system.
Enhance early warning system.
Strengthen the staffing of the supervisory department of the CBJ.

Medium Term

Recapitalize central bank.
Adopt bank resolution framework by developing explicit exit procedures
for dealing with unsound banks.
Enhance stress testing capacity of the CBJ and commercial banks.

15
E. Other Issues
20.
Structural reforms in other areas are proceeding. A new Public-Private
Partnerships (PPP) law is being drafted to enhance the regulatory framework and attract
private financing for PPP projects. Building on the liberalization of petroleum product prices,
plans to fully liberalize the petroleum sector over the medium term are moving forward. As a
next step, a new logistics company responsible for fuel storage is expected to be established
in 2009. The authorities are also considering reforming the National Aid Fund (NAF) to
improve targeted assistance to the poor. Reforms of the social security system that aim to
enhance the actuarial soundness of the pension system are also being discussed.
21.
The authorities are working toward meeting the remaining requirements for
Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) subscription. New surveys have been
designed to improve the compilation and timeliness of wages and earnings data. Efforts are
also being made to align the coverage of budget revenues and expenditures with government
financing flows, but staff noted that expedited progress is needed to reduce the still-high
statistical discrepancy in the fiscal accounts. The authorities indicated that additional
technical assistance from the Fund, possibly through the Middle East Technical Assistance
Center (METAC), may be helpful.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
22.
Jordan’s macroeconomic policies should remain focused on guarding against
external and fiscal vulnerabilities, especially in light of the adverse global economic
outlook. Limited integration with global financial markets has buffered Jordan from recent
turmoil. At the same time, strong economic links with the region and rest of the world, which
have underpinned robust growth in recent years, imply that the global economic downturn
will affect the domestic economy.
23.
The projected fiscal stance for 2009 strikes a reasonable balance between
reducing vulnerabilities and supporting domestic activity. The widening of the deficit in
relation to the budget should be seen as moderate stimulus that will help support activity
without unduly exacerbating macroeconomic imbalances.
24.
Further fiscal stimulus—beyond that contained in the baseline outlook—would
carry significant risks. Since Jordan is a highly open economy, a large share of any
additional spending would be associated with increased imports. This would dampen the
stimulative impact on domestic activity and, at the same time, widen the external deficit and
associated vulnerabilities. Moreover, with capital spending already set to increase sharply,
the efficiency of an even larger increase would be difficult to maintain. If further stimulus is
nevertheless undertaken, it will be critical to ensure that additional spending is temporary and
carefully targeted. In such circumstances, announcement of a credible plan to reduce the
fiscal deficit over the medium term will be needed to maintain confidence in the
sustainability of fiscal policy and the external position.

16
25.
Once cyclical conditions improve, significant tightening of fiscal policy is needed
to reduce public debt and the associated fiscal and external vulnerabilities. Given the
already high revenue ratio, the adjustment should concentrate on the expenditure side.
Reducing the overall deficit by about 1 percentage point of GDP a year is an appropriate
objective, which can be achieved by limiting the growth of recurrent spending—especially
wages and pensions—supported by much-needed pension and civil service reforms. This will
also help narrow the external deficit and free up domestic financing to support private sector
growth. If additional fiscal stimulus is undertaken in 2009, the necessary medium-term fiscal
adjustment will be correspondingly larger.
26.
Moderate monetary policy easing is now appropriate. Pre-emptive steps taken by
the CBJ in recent months have supported the domestic money market. Confidence in the
banking system and the peg has kept the balance of payments position strong at a time of
unusual turbulence in global financial markets. As long as reserves remain broadly stable and
inflation remains in check, there may be room for further modest easing of the monetary
stance to soften the impact of the global slowdown on the domestic economy. Close
monitoring of the CBJ’s key external and financial early warning indicators will be
necessary, with a view to tightening liquidity conditions quickly if signs of balance of
payments pressure emerge.
27.
The exchange rate peg, which has provided stability in the challenging global
environment, remains an appropriate nominal anchor. The staff’s analysis of the real
exchange rate suggests that the dinar remains broadly aligned with medium-term
fundamentals. The risk of external instability from the capital account is mitigated by the fact
that external debt is comprised almost entirely of public sector obligations to official
creditors and that reserves are comfortable in relation to short-term liabilities, although the
sharp increase in errors and omissions in the first half of 2008 is a concern.
28.
Even though banking sector soundness indicators remain generally favorable,
the weaker global environment poses significant risks. The CBJ has taken a number of
welcome measures to ensure banking soundness and stability, including by nudging banks to
increase their capital and enhancing its own early warning systems. Encouragingly, banks
have been repricing credits, closely monitoring exposures, and building capital buffers to
reflect the heightened risks in their portfolios.
29.
Intensified banking supervision is warranted in the current environment. The
FSAP Update identified a number of areas that would strengthen the financial system. These
include strengthening capital adequacy of banks close to the regulatory minimum, enhancing
consolidated supervision, developing the contingency planning framework, and—over the
medium term—recapitalizing the CBJ. The staff welcomes the measures taken by the CBJ to
enhance banking supervision, banks’ capital buffers, and its own early warning systems. In
view of the turbulent global conditions, it is advisable to intensify contingency planning to
deal with worst-case situations, including delineation of responsibilities and coordination
between the CBJ, the Ministry of Finance, and the Deposit Insurance Corporation.

17
30.
Continued progress in public sector structural reforms will enhance longer-term
macroeconomic performance. Top priority should be accorded to completing ongoing
reforms in the public financial management area, especially implementing fully the treasury
single account, improving budget classification and control, rolling out the GFMIS, and
continuing to strengthen the medium-term framework for budget formulation and
preparation. Continued efforts to enhance public debt management, which is being supported
by Fund technical assistance, are welcome.
31.
Expeditious progress is needed to resolve data issues. Priority should be given to
the remaining requirements for SDDS subscription: improving the compilation and coverage
of wages and earnings data, and aligning the coverage of budget revenues and expenditures
with government financing flows. The latter is particularly important, including for
macroeconomic analysis and formulating fiscal policy. Progress is needed in identifying any
gaps in the coverage of balance of payments statistics that could explain the sharp increase in
errors and omissions in 2008. A better understanding of these flows is critical for policy
making. Further improvements in the quality of quarterly production-based national accounts
statistics as well as the frequency and timeliness of expenditure-based national accounts data
would also aid policy formulation, as would compilation of property price data.
32.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard
12-month cycle.

GDP at market prices (JD millions) 7/

Sources: Jordanian authorities; and Fund staff projections.
1/ Based on existing commitments, authorities' plans, and staff estimates.
2/ 2005 data include JD 58.5 million of spending carried out in 2004, but paid in 2005.
3/ Includes some current expenditure, such as maintenance and wage-related spending.
4/ The discrepancy is accounted for in part by the inclusion of non-budgetary accounts in the domestic financing data. Efforts are underway to improve the
coverage of budgetary financing data and its alignment with above-the-line transactions in the context of the authorities working toward SDDS subscription.
5/ In 2008, foreign financing includes repayment of Paris Club debt, partly financed through domestic financing (drawdown of the privatization account).
6/ Domestic debt is net of government deposits with the banking system.
7/ The 2009 budget ratios to GDP are based on staff's GDP estimates.

Appendix I. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
In the absence of fiscal consolidation measures, Jordan’s public debt is expected to rise
steadily to around 65 percent of GDP in 2014. 1 The debt ratio dropped by 10 percentage
points in 2008, thanks to rapid nominal GDP growth and the Paris Club debt buyback. Based
on the 2009 budget and assuming largely unchanged policies thereafter, the debt ratio is
projected to increase by about one percentage point per year over the medium term.
The debt outlook remains vulnerable to adverse shocks. Standard bound tests reveal the
following (Figure A.1):
•

Because almost one half of the debt is foreign currency denominated, a 30 percent
real exchange rate depreciation would increase the debt-to-GDP ratio by around
11 percentage points relative to the baseline in 2009 and the ratio would exceed
70 percent over the projection period.

•

A contingent liabilities shock—an increase in the debt ratio by 10 percent of GDP
in 2009—would cause the debt path to remain about 9 percentage points above the
baseline throughout the projection period.

•

Even under smaller shocks—individual one-half standard deviation shocks to real
growth, interest rates, and the primary balance and a combined one-fourth standard
deviation shock—the debt-to-GDP ratios would exceed 70 percent by the end of the
projection period.

Public debt sustainability and containing these vulnerabilities is contingent on
appropriate adjustment policies. Under the baseline outlook, the average primary deficit
(including grants) slightly exceeds 3 percent of GDP in 2009–14. In contrast,
•

holding the primary deficit constant at 3.4 percent of GDP (its 2008 level) over 2009–
14 would keep the debt ratio somewhat above the baseline scenario by 2014;

•

fiscal adjustment of one percentage point per year (relative to the baseline) would
stabilize the debt ratio around 60 percent; and

•

the debt ratio would decline (approaching 40 percent by 2014) if key assumptions are
held at their historical averages, reflecting that the primary deficit (including grants)
was, on average, in balance during 1999–2008.

1

Public debt is defined as government and government-guaranteed debt. The domestic component is net of
government deposits with the banking system, including privatization proceeds.

1/ Public debt is defined as central government and government guaranteed debt. The domestic component is net of government deposits with the banking system.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 1/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 1/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium- and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

Appendix II. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Jordan’s external debt is relatively low but remains vulnerable to adverse shocks. The
external debt ratio declined sharply to 25 percent of GDP following the $2.1 billion buyback
of Paris club debt and is expected to fall under 20 percent by 2011. The projections are based
on the current outlook for commodity prices—particularly for food and fuel—and
expectations that Jordan will continue to pursue cautious external borrowing policies, relying
predominantly on concessional sources of external financing from multilateral and regional
development banks.
The envisaged debt path is nonetheless sensitive to assumptions regarding current
account flows and the outlook for private capital flows:
•

The standard bound tests reveal that external debt sustainability is most vulnerable to
developments in the current account position. If the actual current account were
one-half standard deviation worse than currently assumed, the debt ratio would edge
up slightly throughout the projection period.

•

An important source of risk is a sharper slowdown in current account inflows and FDI
if the global/regional downturn proves deeper than currently expected. An impact of
such a slowdown is illustrated in an alternative scenario that envisages a 20 percent
decline in 2009–10 in remittances and tourism flows, as well as FDI, relative to the
baseline. 1 Under this scenario, the debt ratio deteriorates to slightly above 30 percent
by end-2010.

•

Bound tests show that the debt-to-GDP ratio is robust to shocks in the external
interest rate or GDP growth. A sharp depreciation would lead to an immediate
deterioration in the debt ratio but would not have a major adverse impact over time
because of the relatively low stock of projected external debt.

1

The total impact of the shock is likely overstated, since imports are assumed to be unaffected by the decline in
inflows.

VII. Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the CBJ
was subject to a full assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), which was
approved on July 3, 2002 and expired on July 2, 2004. The assessment was completed on
June 27, 2003 and concluded that the CBJ has made progress in strengthening its safeguards,
as recommended in the previous assessment of May 2001. The assessment proposed a set of
measures, the majority of which have been implemented.

VIII. Exchange System: The Jordanian dinar is fully convertible and is officially pegged to
the SDR. In practice, the authorities have pegged its exchange rate to the U.S. dollar since
October 1995 at JD 1 = $1.41044. Jordan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,
3, and 4 in 1995 and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions.
IX. Article IV Consultation: The 2008 Article IV consultation was concluded by the
Executive Board on May 19, 2008. Two Financial Sector Assessment Program missions
visited Jordan in August and September 2003, and the Financial System Stability Assessment
(FSSA) was published in January 2004. The Ex Post Assessment (EPA) of Jordan’s LongerTerm Program Engagement was published in November 2005.

Annex II. Jordan: World Bank Group Strategy and Operations
1.
As of December 31, 2008, Jordan had received 72 World Bank (Bank) loans,
2 guarantees, and 15 IDA credits totaling $2,405 million net of cancellations and
terminations. Of the $2,405 million, $2,195 million have been disbursed to date. All the
credits and 65 of the loans have been fully disbursed. There are seven active projects in the
Bank’s portfolio for a total of $303.5 million. Overall performance of the portfolio is good,
both from the perspective of implementation and development impact. This reflects the
generally good project implementation capacity of Jordanian institutions, Jordan’s strong
ownership of the program, and the quality of the dialogue between the Bank and the
government of Jordan.
2.
The Joint World Bank-IFC country assistance strategy (CAS) for 2006–10, endorsed
by the Bank’s Executive Board in May 2006, is aligned with the government priorities, as
expressed in particular in the Ten-year National Agenda, of poverty alleviation and the
creation of higher productivity jobs, while assisting the country in its transition through the
medium-term economic shocks. This CAS sets out a four-year program organized in four
cross-sectoral clusters:
•
•
•
•

strengthening the investment environment and building human resources for valueadded, skill-intensive, and knowledge-based economy;
supporting local development through increased access to services and economic
opportunities;
reforming social assistance and expanding inclusion; and
restructuring public expenditures and supporting public sector reform.

3.
The first two clusters tackle issues related to private investment and job creation,
respectively, at the macro and local levels. The third cluster deals with programs to support
those who cannot achieve sufficient welfare by themselves. The last cluster is focused on
strengthening the public administration’s ability to design and implement development
polices, including improvements in the government budget, as the main tools of public
policy. Important cross-cutting issues, such as gender and the environment, will be
mainstreamed into the clusters. Various sectoral concerns, such as water and energy, will be
integrated in these programmatic clusters through thematic approach. The CAS mix among
possible policy lending, investment lending, and analytical services reflects the emerging
needs with respect to short-term financial challenges and longer-term institutional
developments, with a lending ceiling of up to US$540 million over four years.

6
4.
Since the CAS discussions, the Bank has approved five investment loans and one
supplemental loan for a total commitment amount of US$146 million, focusing on assisting
Jordan achieve a regionally balanced and equitable growth including access to services,
employment opportunities, and private investments outside Amman; enhancing social
protection; and reforming the vocational and training sector. The Bank has also approved a
partial risk guarantee for the Amman East 370 MW power plant for US$45 million. Two
additional investment projects focusing on education and higher education reform (for
about US$45–85 million) and a partial risk guarantee (for about US$47 million) are
scheduled to be presented to the Board this fiscal year. Jordan has sought Bank support to
develop overall policy frameworks and serve as a catalyst for additional financing.
5.
The Government of Jordan (GoJ) has sought programmatic assistance from the Bank
to accompany the reforms (many underpinned by diagnostic work) during the
implementation phase. During the remaining CAS period, the Bank will continue to provide
programmatic support in key areas, including public expenditure management, social
insurance, poverty monitoring, and energy sector reform.
6.
World Bank Group support to private sector development will continue to focus
on improving the investment environment, public private partnership, partial risk
guarantees for major projects (envisaged to attract private sector participation and to
provide a better financial package for critical projects in water and energy), and, in the case
of the IFC, direct investment. In FY08, IFC committed its largest investment program in
Jordan—US$243 million in 8 projects—increasing the total committed portfolio to US$253
million. The IFC is playing a key role in supporting most of the strategic projects in Jordan.
The GoJ has brought a number of key infrastructure projects to the market for private
participation. The IFC is well positioned to support and mobilize financing to a number of
these projects in transportation, water, power, and ports. The IFC’s advisory activities in
Jordan intend to fill the gaps and address critical areas for private sector development, such
as improving the investment climate.
7.
The Bank and IMF continue to collaborate efforts in supporting the authorities in the
following areas:

Annex III. Jordan: Statistical Issues
1.
Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes. However, staff’s analysis would
be facilitated by improvements in the coverage of fiscal, external, and national accounts
statistics.
2.
Jordan has participated in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
September 2000. GDDS metadata were last updated in May/June 2007. An update to the data
module for the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was posted in
February 2004. Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) assessment missions visited
Amman in late 2006 and July 2007 to assist with preparations for SDDS subscription.
3.
Real sector. During the past few years, progress has been made toward enhancing the
quality of national accounts statistics. Continued improvement requires a strong commitment
and allocation of additional resources. Additional efforts are needed to improve quarterly
estimates of the national accounts from the production approach and the annual estimates
from the expenditure approach, as well as the coverage of informal activities. Also,
discrepancies between the industrial production index and the gross value added estimates for
the manufacturing sector need to be addressed. New surveys have been implemented to
improve the compilation and timeliness of wages and earnings data.
4.
Both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI) are
considered of good quality. The CPI—rebased and updated with 2006 weights starting from
January 2009—covers all main urban centers and cities at the governorate level. The PPI has
been compiled since 2000; weights are derived from the 1999 Survey of Industry at the 4digit level, and within each industry, weights are based on the 1999 Economic Establishment
Census.
5.
Government finance. In July 2007, an STA mission undertook a review of the
metadata needed for subscription to the SDDS and assisted in the compilation of financing
data on the central government and general government operations. The mission found that
government finance statistics for the budgetary central government cover only those
transactions of the budgetary central government that are channeled through the treasury
account and exclude all other transactions of the government ministries such as grants and
loans, earmarked taxes, and privatization receipts. In addition, social security and
extrabudgetary agencies are not included in the fiscal accounts. Improvements in the
coverage and dissemination of government finance statistics will be needed ahead of SDDS
subscription, including:
•

dissemination of data on central and general government operations with SDDSprescribed coverage, periodicity, and timeliness in accordance with the classification
and sectorization systems recommended by the GFSM 2001;

9
•

enhanced procedures for the verification of internal and intersectoral consistency of
the stock and flow data that serve as a source for compiling government finance
statistics; and

•

strengthening government financing data by instrument and residency consistent with
SDDS requirements.

6.
Monetary statistics. Monetary data for the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) and the
commercial banks are reported and published on a monthly basis. At present, consistency
checks between government finance statistics and monetary statistics are not conducted.
However, the CBJ informed the 2003 data ROSC Update mission that the CBJ Research
Department, which is responsible for the collection and compilation of the monetary
statistics, proposed the establishment of an interagency group to monitor the intersectoral
consistency of macroeconomic statistics. Timeliness of reporting monetary data for
publication in International Financial Statistics is satisfactory. However, little progress has
been achieved so far in implementing the Standardized Report Forms for reporting monetary
data to the Fund.
7.
Balance of payments (BOP) statistics. The CBJ has adopted the methodology of the
fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) for the compilation of the BOP
statistics and the international investment position (IIP), and has disseminated data in the
BPM5 format. The implementation of surveys in the area of services is important for further
improving the quality of the BOP statistics. Moreover, the CBJ has started compiling and
disseminating the reserves template on the CBJ’s website. The IIP data for 2004–05
incorporates the results of the Department of Statistics foreign direct investment survey
released in May 2007. However, the recent sharp increase in errors and omissions points to
potentially serious issues in the BOP statistics and needs to be addressed.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with Jordan
On May 4, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2009 Article IV consultation with Jordan. 1
Background
Jordan’s macroeconomic performance was generally favorable in 2008. Real GDP growth
averaged 5.6 percent, only slightly slower than the 2007 pace. Sharply lower world fuel and
food prices brought inflation down. After rising to 20 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in September,
mainly because of the previous surge in commodity prices, headline inflation fell sharply to
1½ percent (y-o-y) by February 2009. Lower commodity prices also helped narrow the current
account deficit to an estimated 12 percent of GDP in 2008 (from almost 18 percent in 2007).
FDI financed about three-quarters of the external deficit, with the remainder largely coming from
positive errors and omissions. Official foreign exchange reserves rose to $7.7 billion by end2008 (equivalent to about 6 months of imports).
However, Jordan’s money and financial markets have weakened since mid-2008. Bank deposits
edged down slightly in October but subsequently recovered, with the share of dinar deposits
continuing to increase. Bank credit has also slowed sharply in recent months. The stock market
has corrected since its June peak, although its performance between the end of 2007 and the
end of the first quarter of 2009 (25 percent decline) was better than many other markets in the
region
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) took pre-emptive steps to maintain confidence and support
the domestic money market following the onset of global turbulence. In October, the CBJ
announced a full guarantee of all bank deposits until end-2009. Operations to soak up liquidity
were also scaled back, and banks’ excess reserves increased sharply. In late November, policy
interest rates were cut by 50 bps and the reserve requirement by 100 bps. The deeper cuts by
the U.S. Federal Reserve, however, resulted in a widening of the interest rate differential
against the dollar—to which the dinar is pegged. With reserves continuing to build, headline
inflation moderating rapidly, and bank credit decelerating, the CBJ cut rates by a further 50 bps
in mid-March 2009 and announced that the reserve requirement would be reduced by another
100 bps from end-April.
High fuel and food prices and softening domestic revenues put pressure on the fiscal position
in 2008. The deficit excluding grants reached 11.2 percent of GDP, against 8.9 percent in 2007.
The outcome could have been much worse—with record world oil prices for much of the year—
had it not been for the bold decision in early 2008 to remove fuel subsidies and institute an
automatic price adjustment mechanism. Higher grants contained the overall deficit to
6.1 percent of GDP. Rapid nominal GDP growth, together with the Paris Club debt buyback in
early 2008, resulted in a substantial reduction in total public debt to around 60 percent of GDP
at end-2008 (from 70 percent of GDP at end-2007).
Banking sector profitability and soundness indicators have so far remained favorable. Banks’
liquidity ratios are high and funding is predominantly from deposits. Capitalization is healthy,
with the moderate decline in the capital adequacy ratio in 2008 owing mainly to the
implementation of Basle II standards, especially the incorporation of operational risk. Stress
tests conducted for the Financial Stability Assessment Program (FSAP) Update indicate limited
exposure to interest rate, liquidity, interbank contagion, and other market risks. However, the
tests also identify vulnerability to credit and concentration risks.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that sound macroeconomic management has enhanced Jordan’s
resilience to the global crisis. Growth continues to be robust, international reserves have
strengthened, and the banking sector remains healthy and profitable. Going forward, Directors
emphasized that, in light of the economy’s close ties with the region and reliance on external
financing, near-term policies should remain focused on guarding against vulnerabilities, while
progress in structural reforms should be expedited to strengthen economic fundamentals and
enhance competitiveness. They encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant if the slowdown in
growth is deeper than anticipated.
Directors agreed that the fiscal stance for 2009 strikes a reasonable balance between reducing
vulnerabilities and supporting domestic activity. They stressed the need to resist spending
pressures and to adjust capital spending plans should grants fall below expectations. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to reduce public debt further to meet the legislative
requirement by 2011. This will require a credible plan to consolidate public finances over the

3
medium term, supplemented with the public sector reform strategy, to maintain confidence in
the sustainability of fiscal policy and the external position.
Directors recommended attaching top priority to completing the reform of public financial
management, especially implementing fully the treasury single account, improving budget
classification and control, and further strengthening the medium-term framework for budget
formulation and preparation. Directors welcomed efforts to enhance public debt management,
which is being supported by Fund technical assistance.
Directors welcomed pre-emptive steps taken by the CBJ in recent months. They saw room for a
further cautious easing of monetary policy to support the domestic economy, as long as
reserves remain stable. However, external and financial indicators should be closely monitored,
with a view to tightening liquidity conditions quickly if signs of balance of payments pressure
emerge. At the same time, efforts should continue to develop the domestic money market and
strengthen the CBJ’s capacity to manage liquidity.
Directors agreed that the exchange rate peg, which has provided stability in the challenging
global environment, remains an appropriate nominal anchor. They noted the staff’s
assessments that there is no clear evidence of real exchange rate misalignment, and that the
risk of external instability from the capital account is mitigated by comfortable international
reserves.
Directors commended the authorities for taking prompt action in response to the FSAP Update.
They considered that the weaker environment underlines the importance of enhancing
consolidated supervision, increasing capital adequacy of banks, and developing contingency
plans. Directors stressed that recapitalizing the CBJ remains an important medium-term
objective.
Directors called on the authorities to expedite progress toward meeting the remaining
requirements for the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) subscription, particularly
aligning the coverage of budget revenues and expenditures with government financing flows.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Jordan
May 4, 2009
1.
Underpinned by sound macroeconomic policies and strong trade links, Jordan’s economy
witnessed remarkable economic performance over the prolonged period of time. Intensified
implementation of wide-ranging structural reforms for over a decade has also enhanced the
investment climate and helped position Jordan as an attractive private capital destination.
Sizeable inflows and vigorous domestic investment have steered the economy to unprecedented
GDP growth averaging 6½ percent from 2001 to 2007. At the same time, inflation has been
generally subdued, public debt is on a declining trend, and reserves are steadily accumulating.
The economy’s robust performance and its resilience in weathering various external shocks and
geopolitical tensions in recent years, has placed it in a strong position to face the ongoing global
economic recession.
Recent performance and outlook
2.
Robust growth continued for most of 2008 and, in spite of a sharp slowdown in the fourth
quarter, still generated an impressive 5.6 percent growth for the year as a whole. After peaking in
September 2008 at 20 percent year-on-year, inflation has since dropped down to only 1 percent
in February 2009 with the decline in world food and fuel prices and the continued pursuit of
prudent policies. These factors facilitated a substantial narrowing in the current account to
12 percent of GDP in 2008 as imports shrank, while tourism receipts increased by nearly
27 percent and mining export demand as well as prices remained buoyant. The current account
deficit is likely smaller than reported due to sizeable unrecorded remittance flows and re-exports,
currently reflected in errors and omissions in the balance of payments amounting to about
7 percent of GDP. Notwithstanding an outflow of over $2 billion to buy-back Paris Club
nonconcessional debt, official foreign exchange reserves increased to the equivalent of about 6
months of imports by end-2008 and have since continued to accumulate at a steady pace.
3.
Although Jordan is not exposed directly to the ongoing financial crisis, domestic financial
markets softened since mid-2008. While the stock market index declined from its peak in
mid-2008, it remains less affected than many other stock markets in the region. Bank credit
growth also slowed overall as banks sought to reduce their exposure to the construction and real
estate sectors. However, attesting to the effectiveness of supportive monetary policy actions,
bank deposits have continued to edge up and the share of dinar deposits is increasing. Banks rely
primarily on domestic deposits for their funding, and as discussed further below, banks had
adequate liquidity and capital buffers to weather the downturn in domestic and global economic
activity.
4.
The authorities consider a growth slowdown to be inevitable, in line with the weakening
global and regional activity. However, they see upside risks to staff’s projected 3 percent growth
rate in 2009. Strong links with regional economies may adversely affect inflows in the near term
as Jordan’s economy is tied closely to the GCC countries as the primary source of inflows from
remittances, tourism, grants, foreign direct investment, other capital flows, and exports albeit to
a lesser extent. Nevertheless, these strong links will cushion the export and growth impact on
Jordan since the non-oil sector of GCC countries will be experiencing a considerably more
modest slowdown than the average for the global economy. Combined with lower food and fuel

2
prices, the external deficit is projected to narrow on the expectation of lower import costs, and
inflation to remain subdued. The authorities believe the positive terms of trade shifts would help
prop up domestic demand, providing upside risks to staff’s projection.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
5.
To safeguard the domestic money market from potential spillovers from the ongoing
financial turmoil, the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) has promptly undertaken appropriate
response measures during the past two quarters. Consistent with the peg to the U.S. dollar, the
CBJ had previously raised its policy rates in tandem with the tightening cycle of U.S. interest
rates. Since November 2008, however, policy interest rates have been cut in several steps by a
total of 150 basis points and reserve requirements brought down by 300 basis points.
Notwithstanding these cuts, the interest rate differential with the U.S. has widened since
early 2008, which has enhanced the attractiveness of domestic currency denominated assets and
supported further reserve accumulation. The previous bank deposit guarantee of JD 10,000 per
account was extended to a full guarantee of all bank deposits with effect until end-2009. These
measures helped alleviate temporary liquidity pressures that emerged in the interbank market.
6.
The recent actions are consistent with the overall monetary policy aim of supporting the
exchange rate peg. The dinar’s peg to the U.S. dollar has served Jordan well and is a key
contributor to financial stability. As domestic inflation temporarily soared relative to trading
partners and the dollar strengthened in 2008, the real effective exchange rate appreciated by
6 percent. The most recent decline in inflation suggests that this appreciation has already been
reversed. The authorities concurred with staff’s technical assessment that the real effective
exchange rate is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals, while noting the inherent
imprecision of these estimates and the fact that the “underlying” current account deficit is likely
narrower than the recorded deficit.
Fiscal Policies
7.
The authorities’ remain resolutely committed to fiscal consolidation and debt reduction.
Consistent with this goal, the 2008 budget sought to contain the overall deficit including grants
to 4½ percent of GDP, by aiming to raise revenue by about 12 percent in nominal terms and to
eliminate fuel subsidies that had amounted to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2007, while providing for a
sizeable increase in capital spending. A number of factors prevented achievement of this target,
pushing the overall deficit to about 6 percent of GDP. A bold subsidy reform was undertaken in
early 2008 to eliminate fuel subsidies and revert to full pass-through of world oil prices through
an automatic price adjustment mechanism. Without this decision, undertaken in early 2008, the
subsidy bill would have swelled and the fiscal outcome would have been considerably worse.
However, the cost of food subsidies was higher than expected due to high food prices for much
of 2008. Moreover, with the weakening economy in the latter part of 2008, sales tax, customs,
and non-tax revenue receipts were considerably weaker than expected. To contain the deficit, the
authorities limited capital spending to a much lower level than had been budgeted.
8.
The 2009 budget provides for a modest fiscal stimulus while adhering to the fiscal
consolidation objective. The budget targets a reduction in the deficit excluding grants by
1½ percent of GDP and aims to increase capital spending by about 2¼ percent of GDP. Last

3
year’s subsidy reforms have provided fiscal space of about 2 percent of GDP but revenue growth
may be constrained as the economy slows. Recognizing the limited room for fiscal stimulus, the
authorities intend to resist spending pressures and to adjust capital spending plans should grants
fall below expectations, or the cyclical weakening in sales and customs revenue to persist.

Reducing public debt and strengthening public finances remain key priorities. The recent
public debt law sets a ceiling of public debt to GDP of 60 percent by 2011. The aforementioned
debt-buy-back operation reduced net public debt to GDP from 70 percent to 60 percent. The
authorities agree that meeting the legislative requirement by 2011 requires a reduction of the
deficit from its present level by over 1 percent of GDP a year, and that given the relatively high
revenue ratio, the bulk of adjustment must come from the expenditure side. The public sector
reform strategy aims to support this goal, as would ongoing efforts to enhance financial control
and improve the efficiency of expenditures. In addition, to strengthen public financial
management, the authorities are implementing a Treasury Single Account, improving budget
classification, and preparing for a financial management information system.
Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA)

The authorities welcomed staff’s Update to the 2003 FSAP and considered its findings
broadly reassuring. Jordan’s banking system is profitable and well capitalized, and it is in a
strong position to face any potential impact on credit quality from deteriorating global economic
conditions, should those arise. Banks maintain capital ratios well above the regulatory minimum
12 percent ratio, and stress tests have shown them to be broadly robust to interest rate and
exchange rate risk and to a substantial increase in nonperforming loans. Notwithstanding these
strengths, the CBJ remains vigilant in monitoring bank performance and calling for additional
safeguards. For example, to protect against potential credit quality deterioration stemming from
large borrowers or other severe increase in nonperforming loans, the CBJ has recently urged
banks to bolster their capital buffers.

Supervision has been considerably strengthened in recent years. This is reflected in the
high degree of compliance with Basel Core Principles (BCP). Staffing resources have been
augmented in the supervisory functional units and CBJ officials have commenced on-site
supervisory visits to foreign subsidiaries of large banks, consistent with staff’s advice related to
minimizing cross-border risks through consolidated bank supervision. To enhance supervision of
the insurance sector, the Insurance Commission (IC) has been actively issuing regulations and
instructions covering a wide range of domains (including investments, internal control,
reinsurance and consumer protection). The IC is also implementing a new risk-based supervision
framework and a draft law aims to strengthen risk management.

Financial deepening has been an important contributor to recent growth. Financial
intermediation is relatively deep and stock market capitalization is relatively high, and the
insurance market is growing. Nevertheless, the authorities see scope for further developing the
financial sector and expect access to finance will be enhanced with the planned decrease in the
credit registry’s loan threshold following the rollout of the automated data collection system.

On behalf of the authorities, I would like to thank staff for their dedicated work on Jordan
and candid advice. The authorities value the constructive engagement of staff and management
with Jordan. They appreciate the analysis provided by the Article IV staff team as well as the
team of staff and experts who worked on the FSAP Update and those who have been providing
helpful technical assistance from headquarters and through the Middle East Technical Assistance
Center (METAC).
