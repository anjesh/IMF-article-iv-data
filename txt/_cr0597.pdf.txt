Directors commended Namibia’s record of macroeconomic stability but urged
corrective measures to reduce the fiscal deficit, particularly with respect to personnel
expenditure and subsidies to public enterprises. They observed that although prudent
fiscal and monetary policies had provided strong support for the exchange rate peg
over the years, the authorities should aim for a gradual buildup of reserves. Directors
called for increasing attention to addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic and removing
structural impediments to growth so as to bring about a reduction in poverty and
unemployment.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Notwithstanding Namibia's good record of macroeconomic stability, per-capita growth
has lagged behind that of other countries in the region and has been insufficient to
generate a sustained reduction in poverty and unemployment. Real GDP growth
accelerated to an estimated 4¼ percent in 2004, after averaging about 3 percent during the
preceding five years. Growth benefited from declining interest rates in the wake of falling
inflation following the appreciation of the Namibia dollar. Namibia's external current account
surplus is estimated to have risen further in 2004, to 5½ percent of GDP, to some extent
reflecting a strengthening of exports to the rand area; the Namibia dollar is pegged to the
rand. External debt remains low.
Namibia's long-term growth prospects are promising, provided that the authorities
implement structural reforms and their strategy to combat HIV/AIDS. To strengthen
private sector activity, structural reforms should include measures to privatize parastatals,
raise labor skills, improve access to finance and capital, and strengthen the flexibility of the
economy. Under these assumptions, growth could reach 4 percent over the medium term.
The authorities agreed with the importance of fiscal adjustment to sustaining growth
and supporting the exchange rate peg. The fiscal deficit more than doubled in 2003/04, to
7¾ percent of GDP, reflecting mainly tax administration problems and a collapse in mining
taxes. The fiscal deficit is projected to fall to 2 percent of GDP in 2004/05, as tax
administration problems are being addressed, SACU receipts experience a one-time windfall,
and non-priority spending is being curtailed. The authorities reiterated their commitment to
reduce their public debt ratio over the medium term to bring it close to their fiscal rule target
of 25 percent of GDP. While feasible, this is a daunting task in light of the sharp decline of
SACU receipts projected for the second half of the decade and the new spending pressures
related to the implementation of the HIV/AIDS strategy. As a first step in this direction, the
authorities decided to forego a supplementary budget for this fiscal year, for the first time
since independence.
The decline in international reserves reflects the continued capital outflows by
Namibian pension funds and insurance companies seeking the broader investment
opportunities in South Africa’s financial markets. The authorities are trying to strengthen
domestic financial markets to contain such outflows but are also considering a tightening of
domestic asset requirements. While strengthening domestic financial markets may be
promising in lowering Namibia's net exports of capital, domestic interest rates have also a
key role to play, by avoiding a negative interest rate differential vis-à-vis the anchor
currency.

I. INTRODUCTION AND KEY ISSUES
1.
Namibia has enjoyed enviable macroeconomic stability since independence.
Underpinned by a credible exchange rate peg and generally prudent fiscal policies, a market
economy has been established, with a sophisticated physical infrastructure. A stable political
and legal environment has been conducive to private sector activity.
2.
Economic growth, however, has been insufficient to generate a reduction in
unemployment and poverty. Namibia’s per-capita growth performance lags behind that of
other countries in the region. The income distribution is highly skewed, reflecting an uneven
land distribution and the existence of

Recent fiscal policy slippages and the erosion of international reserves have left Namibia
more vulnerable to external shocks.
3.
Against this background, the mission discussed policies to enhance Namibia’s
growth potential and safeguard macroeconomic stability. The focus was on: (i) the need
to address the structural impediments to growth so as to generate stronger private sector
activity and employment, mainly outside mining and agriculture; (ii) the medium-term fiscal
policy stance; (iii) the impact of HIV/AIDS on growth and fiscal policy; (iv) the
sustainability of the exchange rate peg; and (v) the authorities’ efforts to combat inequality
and poverty.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

4.
Economic activity strengthened in
2003 and 2004, following two lackluster
years (Table 1). Real GDP growth
accelerated by 1¼ percentage points to
3¾ percent in 2003 and a projected 4¼ percent
in 2004.1 Growth has been broad-based and

driven by investment and private consumption, bolstered by declining interest rates which
benefited especially retail and construction activity. However, manufacturing, agriculture,
and fishing have recently been hurt by the strength of the Namibia dollar which appreciated
in tandem with the South African rand (to which it is pegged).
5.
Inflation has fallen rapidly, in line with the appreciating currency and a drop in
food prices. Year-on-year inflation declined from around 13 percent in early 2003 to
5 percent in November 2004.
6.
The external current account has
remained in surplus (Table 2). Strong services,
income, and transfer receipts have offset a
widening trade deficit arising from buoyant
import growth. Exports have performed well
overall and benefited from the 2003 opening of a
large textile company. Mining exports, after
slumping in 2003, recovered in 2004 as a result of
rising world demand, the coming online of a new
zinc mine, and an expansion of offshore diamond
mining.

to adjust, including through layoffs. At the same time, Namibia has successfully expanded its
exports to the rand area. In addition, diamond exports have benefited from strong world
demand countering the declining profitability of the sector emanating from the appreciation.

slightly above the benchmark of 1.0 at end-2002. External debt amounted to 17½ percent of
GDP at end-2003, well below levels in other sub-Saharan countries.3
9.
The new 2002 Southern African Customs Union (SACU) agreement came into
force in mid-2004. It will imply far-reaching changes for Namibia (Box 1).4

This partly reflects valuation effects, as reserves are largely held in US dollars and euros,
while around four-fifths of imports originate in South Africa.

The mission undertook a partial reconciliation of Namibian and South African IIP data for
2001 and 2002, but more recent reliable data are unavailable; see Appendix IV.

Box 1. The New SACU Agreement
The new SACU agreement replaces the 1969 treaty which had concentrated all policy-making
powers in South Africa. It provides for well-defined institutional structures and joint decisionmaking, allowing Namibia to participate in SACU’s policy setting and trade negotiation
framework.
The agreement retains the common revenue pool (CRP), which is complemented by a new
revenue-sharing formula (RSF) built on three components: (i) the customs component, shared
based on intra-SACU imports; (ii) the excise component, consisting of 85 percent of excise
collections and shared based on GDP; and (iii) the development component, distributing the
remaining excise collections based inversely on per-capita GDP.
The new RSF reduces net transfers from South Africa to other members and eliminates the
two-year lag between collections and allocations, making revenue forecasting more difficult.
Namibia is poised to lose revenue from the shift to the new RSF: after a windfall in 2004/05
due to the lagged RSF and transitional arrangements, Namibia’s SACU receipts are projected
to fall by 4 percent of GDP by 2009/10.
The new SACU agreement requires Namibia to enhance its capacity in various areas, such as
customs administration and statistical compilation.

10.
The fiscal deficit deteriorated sharply in 2003/04 to 7¾ percent of GDP, from
3½ percent of GDP a year earlier (Table 3).5

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Overview
13.
The discussions took place one month prior to presidential and parliamentary
elections. As expected, Mr. Pohamba, candidate of the ruling party (SWAPO), won the
presidential elections by a large margin and will succeed Mr. Nujoma who has been
president since independence. SWAPO maintains a strong majority in parliament. Namibia’s
general economic policy direction is not expected to change.
6

The authorities have enhanced audit capacity and addressed the IT problems that prevented
them from sending out tax assessments in 2003/04.

- 10 -

14.
The authorities have laid out their strategic development goals in Vision 2030
(Box 2). The mission considered the document an important vehicle to generate ownership
and momentum for future reforms, but pointed to the lack of specificity regarding possible
measures that could help achieve the ambitious long-term objectives.
Box 2. Vision 2030
“Namibia Vision 2030” is a long-term development planning framework that is to guide the policies
and implementation strategies under successive medium-term National Development Plans over the
coming years. The framework was developed through a participatory process, with technical advice
by UNDP. Its overarching economic objective is to transform Namibia into a diversified and
industrialized country, marked by a high standard of living for everybody. Real GDP growth is
targeted to accelerate steadily to 9½ percent by 2030. The plan aims at a substantial reduction of
income inequality—cutting in half Namibia’s Gini coefficient of 0.7 (1994)—and a marked decline in
unemployment.

15.
Namibia’s policies have generally been consistent with Fund advice over the
years. In particular, the authorities have adhered to a prudent fiscal policy stance prior to
2003/04 and implemented a variety of measures to strengthen the fiscal framework, such as
medium-term expenditure planning. However, they have not made much headway in
reducing the high wage bill and support to parastatals—both recurrent topics in Article IV
discussions. In addition, the authorities have been slow in tackling structural rigidities in the
labor market and enhancing skills, which have been underscored in previous discussions.
16.
The mission encouraged the authorities to consider possible benefits they could
derive from Fund technical assistance and standards and codes assessments. In
particular, the mission saw merit in Namibia receiving technical assistance in statistics and
tax policy and administration, which the authorities indicated they would consider. The
authorities also expressed their interest in a fiscal ROSC and an FSAP.
B. Economic Prospects
17.
The authorities expected growth to accelerate to 4 percent over the medium
term, which would be slightly above the average growth rate of 3.8 percent since
independence. This was predicated on strong world growth, increased trade integration, and
buoyant domestic demand in light of stable macroeconomic conditions and low interest rates.
The authorities expected growth to remain broad-based, bolstered by a strengthening in
manufacturing, tourism, and mining. Toward the end of the decade, growth could benefit
from the anticipated development of the Kudu gas field off Namibia’s coast.
18.
Achieving the authorities’ economic growth targets would require implementing
their HIV/AIDS strategy, complemented by the initiation of structural reforms and the

- 11 -

pursuit of prudent fiscal policies (Box 3 and Table 5).7 Now that the formulation of the
HIV/AIDS strategy has been completed and donor support been lined up, the authorities
intend to begin implementing the strategy in early 2005. Growth would also benefit from the
intended structural reforms—aimed at boosting private sector activity—and from the
authorities’ strong intention to pursue prudent fiscal policies, as outlined below. These steps
would be key to maintaining confidence in the peg and preventing a crowding out of the
private sector. Under these assumptions, growth could reach 4 percent over the medium term
(baseline scenario). By contrast, growth could average 1 percentage point less if the
authorities fall short of expectations in these areas (alternative scenario).
19.
Implementing this policy agenda could also be conducive to meeting the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). A national campaign to meet the MDGs was
launched in August 2003. The campaign was
Text Table 4. HIV/AIDS Prevalence in SACU Countries

will require greater effort and resources if
they are to be met by 2015, such as in the
areas of poverty reduction, education, and health (Tables 6 and 7).
20.
Some downside risks could adversely affect growth in the short run. In particular,
a further appreciation of the Namibia dollar, climatic factors, and rising oil prices could
worsen the trade balance and slow economic activity.8 An additional downside risk could
emerge if the recent move on expropriating land were to lead to social tensions and dampen
agricultural output (see Box 5 below).
21.
The external sustainability analysis does not point to any immediate concerns
about Namibia’s external position (Appendix IV). However, concerns emanating from
Namibia’s low international reserves are not captured by the template.

Box 3. HIV/AIDS and Medium-Term Growth
HIV/AIDS has taken a severe toll on Namibia. More than one-fifth of the population is currently
thought to be infected with HIV/AIDS. Adult life expectancy dropped from 67 years in 1991 to
45 years in 2002, child mortality has remained high, and 60,000 children have been orphaned so far.
The authorities’ strategy to combat HIV/AIDS (MTP III) appropriately identifies the pandemic as a
developmental issue. It calls for extensive prevention and treatment through improved access to
health care and some, although limited access to anti-retroviral therapy (see Box 4 on the fiscal costs
of MTP III).
A simple sources-of-growth model was used to gauge the impact of HIV/AIDS on growth. The model
suggests that implementing MTP III—with its estimated growth impact in line with similar estimates
from other country studies, such as Botswana—could reverse the declining contribution of human
capital to growth, assuming that the spread of the epidemic is halted. This is the assumption behind
the staff’s baseline scenario. The scenario also reflects a modest strengthening of the contribution of
TFP as a result of efforts to enhance skills, reform parastatals, promote SMEs, diversify exports, and
increase labor market flexibility. This enhanced business environment could help foster investment
and technology transfer from abroad, benefiting also from Namibia’s greater integration with the rest
of the world. Most of the impact of these reforms would only materialize in the long run.

C. Fiscal Policy
22.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to a prudent fiscal policy stance.
They concurred with the mission’s assessment that the need to accommodate spending to
combat HIV/AIDS and the decline in SACU receipts that would begin in 2005/06 warranted
a curtailment and reallocation of spending and, to some extent, consideration of revenueenhancing measures. However, they clarified that a political consensus has yet to develop to
be able to incorporate into their medium-term fiscal strategy reforms of the civil service and
parastatals and a consolidation of the generous tax incentives in export processing zones
(EPZ) and under other regimes.

- 13 -

23.
The mission supported the authorities’ intention to adhere to their fiscal rule
aimed at limiting public debt to 25 percent of GDP and acknowledged their willingness
to identify measures to achieve
Text Table 5. Overall Fiscal Balance in SACU Countries, 2000-03 1/

were primarily related to the volatility of mining taxes and unexpected tax administration
problems which are being addressed. The mission stressed that returning to the debt target
would take several years and, unless mining taxes were to recover, may be achieved only in
the next decade in light of Namibia’s medium-term fiscal challenges (Box 4). Nevertheless,
generating moderate primary surpluses of about 1 percent of GDP over the next few years
could put public debt on a clear downward path and bring the public debt target within
reach.9 The mission also discussed the fiscal sustainability template, which does not point to
any major vulnerabilities, provided that the authorities aim at respecting their fiscal rule
(Appendix V). The authorities expressed their appreciation for these illustrations, stating that
they would provide a useful basis for discussions with line ministries.
24.
The authorities concurred that most of the fiscal adjustment over the medium
term would need to come from the expenditure side. This would involve reductions in the
wage bill, subsidies to parastatals, and spending for goods and services. However, the
projected rapid and steep drop in SACU receipts, combined with pressing spending

Box 4. Medium-Term Fiscal Issues
Namibia faces significant fiscal pressures over the medium term. On the revenue side, SACU receipts
are projected to fall from 11½ percent of GDP in 2004/05 to 7½ percent of GDP by 2009/10. On the
expenditure side, the mission projects the budgetary costs of implementing the national HIV/AIDS
strategy—after identified donor support of ¾ percent of GDP—to rise to 1¾ percent of GDP by
2009/10, which is not yet reflected in the authorities’ medium-term expenditure framework.
Achieving the public debt target of 25 percent of
GDP would be a daunting, yet feasible task and
could take several years. At the same time,
business-as-usual policies would not be tenable, as
they would dramatically push up the public debt
ratio.

By contrast, the alternative scenario illustrates the debt dynamics emanating from inaction with
respect to the wage bill and subsidies, failure to implement any additional measures, and consequent
increases in interest rates. The public debt ratio would rise to more than twice the level targeted by the
fiscal rule.
The authorities acknowledged the need for additional revenue and expenditure measures to achieve
their fiscal objectives. Possible options discussed included: raising the VAT rate from 15 to 18
percent (yielding 1½ percent of GDP) to help finance HIV/AIDS spending; reviewing and
consolidating existing tax incentives; negotiating an increase in the SACU development component
from 15 percent to 25 percent under the RSF (yielding ½ percent of GDP); seeking additional donor
support for implementation of the HIV/AIDS strategy; accelerating civil service and public enterprise
reform; and issuing a Eurobond (with interest savings of 0.2 percent of GDP).

- 15 -

requirements, might call for partially offsetting measures on the revenue side as well. The
mission pointed to Namibia’s comparatively high tax revenue/GDP ratio, which may
preclude a significant reliance on revenue measures.10
25.
The authorities recognized the urgency of fiscal adjustment and decided to
forego a supplementary budget for 2004/05. They had considered submitting the
supplementary budget, with additional

spending requests from line ministries, to

practice. However, in light of the difficult
Defense
fiscal outlook, they agreed with the mission
on the need to take a broader view consistent
with their medium-term fiscal objectives.
The authorities decided to address some of
the spending needs using the small
contingency in the budget. Overall, the
mission concurred that the 2004/05 budget
targets remained feasible in light of the
strength of Namibia’s public expenditure management system and the efforts to improve tax
administration, provided that the authorities resist additional spending pressures.

26.
The costs and benefits of tax incentives were actively debated within the
government. While some counterparts stressed the importance of EPZs in attracting FDI and
generating employment, others pointed to the hitherto limited benefits and the associated
revenue loss. The mission stressed that international experience suggested that investors
considered political and economic stability and the availability of infrastructure and skilled
labor as more important factors in their decisions than tax incentives. The mission urged an
independent review of existing tax incentives and saw scope for consolidating them and
enhancing their transparency.
27.
The authorities intend to enhance their medium-term expenditure framework
with the gradual introduction of output-based program budgeting. The mission
considered this an important step to help improve the identification of budgetary priorities
and reorient spending toward areas conducive to long-term economic growth—especially
education, health (including for HIV/AIDS), and infrastructure investment. The authorities
also expected output-budgeting to enhance the quality of spending, especially in these key
areas.
28.
The authorities saw the civil service as an important employment vehicle in light
of widespread unemployment. They pointed to their efforts to contain wage increases, by
10

In 2003, the tax revenue/GDP ratio amounted to less than 18 percent of GDP in SubSaharan African countries and 24 percent of GDP in South Africa.

- 16 -

relying on three-year wage pacts and aiming at wage increases below the inflation rate. They
expected additional savings from a hiring freeze and reductions in overtime pay and travel
allowances, but would not consider a retrenchment program at this stage.
29.
The mission advocated a clear road map on civil service reform to support the
reorientation of spending. In the mission’s view, more determination was needed to bring
about a reduction in the wage bill, which ranked among the highest in Africa mainly as a
result of the size of the civil service.11 Some of the measures discussed included the
development of sector-specific staffing strategies, the introduction of a real-time monitoring
system of actual staffing levels, and the linking of staffing allocations with priorities
identified under output-budgeting. The mission supported the government’s strong
commitment to enhance performance management in the civil service.
30.
The authorities have yet to develop a strategy for the closure or divestiture of
parastatals. Their emphasis to date has been on the commercialization of public enterprises,
as a consensus in support of more far-reaching actions has not yet emerged. The authorities
were open to the possibility of divestiture but argued that it was not a panacea, pointing to
many failed cases in other countries. They stressed that some of the larger parastatals lacked
skilled managers and clear business plans and were saddled with debts, requiring sustained
reforms before such entities could be privatized. They also emphasized their commitment to
advancing the empowerment of previously disadvantaged Namibians in any future
privatization.
31.
In the mission’s view, attempts to date to commercialize parastatals have not
yielded satisfactory results. Key elements of the enabling legislation for the Central
Governance Agency (CGA), established two years ago to promote the commercialization and
divestiture of parastatals, are still missing, especially regarding the demarcation of
supervisory authority between the CGA and line ministries. In light of budgetary pressures,
the mission encouraged the authorities to pass the legislation quickly and urged that
sufficient authority be given to the CGA to enable it to perform its functions effectively.
D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
32.
The authorities firmly reiterated their commitment to the exchange rate peg. In
their view, the peg had served Namibia well in maintaining macroeconomic stability and
anchoring policymaking. They pointed to the robust current account surplus, the very close—
and rapidly increasing—trade and financial links with South Africa, the resilience of
diamond exports in light of strong world demand, and the role of the rand as legal tender in
Namibia. They saw the recent appreciation of the rand as related to factors within South
Africa and stressed that while the appreciation has caused hardship to some exporters, the
economy remained competitive overall.
11

See Selected Issues Paper, 1/28/05, www.imf.org, Chapter III.

- 17 -

33.
The mission concurred that the current exchange rate regime remained
appropriate. However, it pointed to the likely negative growth and employment implications
should the rand’s appreciation continue unabated. This would call for an acceleration of
structural reforms so as to induce productivity gains and enhance the flexibility of the
economy. The mission urged analysis of additional competitiveness indicators, such as unit
labor costs, which are not available at present.
34.
The authorities did not see the drain in international reserves as a sign of lack of
confidence. Rather, it reflected the insufficient investment opportunities for nonbank
financial institutions (NBFIs) in the Namibian financial markets. The resulting net export of
capital has been an issue throughout Namibia's post-independence period, but has become
more pronounced over time in line with the continued rapid growth of NBFIs.12 The
authorities’ focus was to use regulatory means and efforts to promote domestic financial
markets to safeguard reserves. They remained noncommittal regarding the mission’s
recommendation to avoid, as a minimum, a negative interest rate differential vis-à-vis South
Africa. The mission argued that the decline in reserves warranted a clear signal to contain
capital outflows and that from the perspective of the central bank the sustainability of the peg
should take precedence over efforts to support growth.
35.
The mission recommended a thorough analysis of the implications of the
proposed regulatory amendments aimed at curbing capital outflows by NBFIs. The
proposals included reducing the limit on investments in dual-listed companies—quoted in
Johannesburg and Windhoek—and requiring a minimum investment of 5 percent of assets in
unlisted Namibian companies. The mission cautioned that this might have unintended
consequences. The provision on dual-listed companies could lessen the importance of the
Namibia Stock Exchange (NSX) and run counter to efforts to promote domestic capital
markets. NBFIs may also find insufficient investment options of good quality in unlisted
Namibian companies. The authorities indicated that they would reassess the regulations once
comments from market participants were received.
36.
The mission suggested that the authorities consider alternative measures to
strengthen reserves in the short run, aside from raising interest rates. Possibilities
discussed included stepping up outright foreign exchange purchases, privatizing parastatals
to foreign investors, and obtaining a sovereign credit rating and tapping international capital
markets—in line with examples of other countries that have strengthened reserves through a
Eurobond issue.13 The authorities appreciated the discussion and indicated that they would
study these options.
12
13

See Selected Issues Paper, 1/28/05, www.imf.org, Chapter IV.

This could have other desirable effects, such as lowering interest rates by an estimated 500
basis points (the difference between the domestic interest rate of 13 percent and a possible
Eurobond rate of 8 percent), providing a benchmark for private debt, helping attract FDI, and
(continued…)

- 18 -

E. Financial Sector Policies
37.
Key indicators suggest that the resilience of the banking system, which is closely
intertwined with that of South Africa, has strengthened (Tables 8 and 9). Among other
things, all banks met the capital-adequacy ratio of 10 percent at end-2003, and the share of
non-performing loans in total loans has steadily declined. Competition in the banking system
has been limited though, and lack of access to financing and a standard 100 percent collateral
requirement have been a problem for SMEs. Microfinance remains in its infancy.
38.
The mission urged careful monitoring of financial sector vulnerabilities. The
declining interest rates appear to have fueled growth in consumer loans and mortgages. Some
market participants were concerned about the sustainability of the strong increase in housing
prices which has raised indebtedness among households.
39.
The BoN recently completed a self-assessment on compliance with the Basel
Core Principles (BCP) of Effective Banking Supervision. The BoN considered itself
compliant with 21 of the 25 BCP, but recognized weaknesses with respect to the country
risk, market risk, consolidated supervision, and risk management. The mission encouraged
the authorities to work toward full compliance, which could be assessed in the context of an
FSAP. Revisions to the Banking Institutions Act have been initiated; they would enhance the
powers of the BoN to deal with pyramid schemes and banks not respecting prudential
requirements.
40.
The preparation of AML/CFT legislation is underway. A Financial Intelligence
Bill approved by Cabinet assigns lead responsibility to the BoN to collect and analyze
financial intelligence, forward relevant information to law enforcement agencies, and
establish “Know Your Customer” rules. CFT legislation is at the drafting stage.
41.
The mission urged a further strengthening of the legal and regulatory
framework for NBFIs. In particular, adopting legislation to strengthen the effectiveness of
NAMFISA, the regulating agency established in 2002, should be a priority. The proposed
amendments would close regulatory loopholes and establish reporting and sanctions
procedures, bringing Namibia’s regulatory framework closer to South Africa’s where most
NBFIs invest their assets.
42.
The mission was concerned about the large equity exposure of Namibian pension
funds and insurance companies. The mission suggested introducing prudential investment
limits by type of assets, including specific limitations on the equity risk, in line with
international best practices. This should apply especially for defined benefit plans, such as
the government pension fund which has 60 percent of its assets invested in equity. The
authorities indicated that they would study the mission’s proposal.
anchoring a domestic rating system. However, technical preparations could be demanding,
and an exchange rate risk would arise.

- 19 -

43.
Some of the preconditions for the emergence of a domestic bond market are
developing. Several potential borrowers are ready to issue their instruments, and large future
investment projects, such as the Kudu gas field, may bring additional placements. The
mission recommended that the authorities seize the opportunity and support an industry
proposal of reporting bond transactions through the NSX. This could be the nucleus for the
development of a secondary market for bonds.
F. Structural Issues
44.
There was agreement that structural reforms were critical to promoting private
sector activity, generating employment, and addressing income inequality. In the
mission’s assessment, there is a need to step up, better coordinate and improve the targeting
of the various initiatives.
45.
The authorities acknowledged that the lack of skills was a major impediment to
private sector activity. The mission encouraged the authorities to focus in particular on
education. The authorities acknowledged that although Namibia was among the countries
with the highest education spending in Africa, the quality of such spending needed to be
improved to allow it to achieve the MDG goals. The mission pointed to potential benefits of
additional vocational training programs, and, referring to discussions with the private sector,
urged that their curricula meet the demands of the labor market. The authorities indicated
that an expansion of vocational training is being considered. The mission proposed that the
authorities consider a labor-intensive public works program—similar to the one in South
Africa—which could provide a useful vehicle for temporarily expanding job opportunities,
enhancing skills and empowering disadvantaged segments of the population.
46.
The recently adopted amendments to the 1992 Labor Act will make labor
markets less flexible and raise labor costs. Among other things, the amendments will
increase vacation leave from 18 to 24 days and restrict the use of temporary workers. On the
other hand, they ease arbitration procedures for dismissing employees. While the authorities
viewed the amendments as balanced, the mission underscored the importance of flexible
labor markets to allow enterprises to adjust so as to maintain their competitiveness.
47.
The authorities have created a variety of programs to assist SMEs. The programs
focus on improving access to finance through a credit lines and guarantee program and on
facilitating the acquisition of skills and technology. Notwithstanding some success stories,
there is evidence that the credit and guarantee ceilings are too low and institutional capacity
is insufficient to evaluate proposals. The authorities indicated that they intend to review the
existing policy. Additional SME programs encompass the provision of business sites,
assistance in the purchase of equipment, provision of equipment for rent, and support to
prepare business plans.
48.
In early 2004, the government initiated land acquisitions through expropriations
against compensation to accelerate the slow pace in redistributing land (Box 5). There is
widespread agreement among the government, the farmers unions, and donors on the need

- 20 -

for action, since the status quo is considered politically, socially, and economically
unsustainable. However, the uncertainty on the modalities surrounding the new policy has
raised concerns about possible repercussions on agricultural production and economic and
political stability. Anecdotal evidence points toward delays in investment and rising
difficulties in obtaining financing.
Box 5: Namibia’s Land Redistribution Policy
Since the mid-1990s, Namibia has relied on a “willing buyer, willing seller” program to address the
inequalities in land distribution stemming from the colonial era. The program is complemented by a
concessional affirmative action loan scheme for the purchase and modernization of farms.
The pace of implementation of the program has been slow. About 3 million hectares of the total
commercial farming land of 36 million hectares have been redistributed, leaving some 4,000 farmers
with about half of Namibia’s arable land, mainly in the south. The slow pace has been attributed to
cumbersome decision-making and bureaucratic procedures and the reluctance of farmers to sell their
land at prices acceptable to the government.
Land acquisition through expropriation is envisaged under the constitution “in the public interest”
subject to “just compensation”. About 20 farmers have so far received expropriation letters. While
some seem willing to sell, others have protested the expropriation and are expected to go to court.
The main criticism of the new policy is related to the lack of objective and transparent criteria to
identify underutilized land that could become subject to expropriation. The authorities felt that the
existing legal framework was sufficiently transparent and that recourse to the court system would
provide sufficient protection against arbitrary decisions. They also hoped that the new land tax would
help identify underutilized land. Nevertheless, they indicated that they would work with the farmers
unions and donors to allay their concerns.

G. Trade Policy
49.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to further trade liberalization,
driven in large part by Namibia’s WTO obligations. Along with other SACU members,
Namibia is engaged in bilateral trade negotiations with the United States, the EU, and
Mercosur. Jointly with its SADC partners, Namibia is aiming at creating a free trade area by
2008. Namibia’s simple average tariff has been reduced to 11.4 percent, compared with 24
percent a decade ago and the sub-Saharan average of 20 percent. The reduction has been
accompanied by a simplification in the tariff structure.
IV. DATA ISSUES
50.
The authorities have made significant progress in addressing data weaknesses
(Appendix III). Namibia is participating in the GDDS regional project for Anglophone
African countries. The mission recommended that the timeliness of fiscal data, the coverage
of the national accounts and the consumer price index, and the quality of balance of
payments and IIP data be improved, and labor surveys be conducted more frequently to allow
more informed policy-making.

- 21 -

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
51.
Namibia has enjoyed moderate growth and an enviable record of
macroeconomic stability since independence. During the period, the external current
account has consistently been in surplus, inflation has been reduced, and fiscal deficits were
generally well contained prior to the 2003/04 fiscal year. This has helped keep public and
external debt at low levels. However, while Namibia’s per-capita GDP is among the highest
in Africa, per-capita income growth has been slow, unemployment and poverty are
pervasive, and the income distribution is highly skewed.
52.
Namibia’s macroeconomic prospects are promising as long as the authorities
implement their HIV/AIDS strategy and address the structural impediments to growth.
While mining, agriculture, and fishing have driven growth in the past, raising Namibia’s
long-term growth potential and generating employment requires a larger contribution from
the manufacturing and services sectors, including tourism. Allowing the private sector to
flourish is the best vehicle to provide higher income and work to all Namibians. The
authorities can facilitate this process by strengthening the flexibility of the economy—
including with respect to the labor market—enhancing the availability of skilled labor,
promoting export diversification, and improving access to capital and finance. There are
many promising initiatives already in place in these areas, such as vocational training
programs and the availability of a credit and guarantee scheme for SMEs. However, there is a
need to expand and better coordinate these efforts and ensure that they are well-targeted and
meet the needs of the private sector. In addition, the recent amendments to the Labor Act
may raise the costs of doing business in Namibia.
53.
Namibia faces difficult fiscal challenges over the next few years. The sharp rise in
the fiscal deficit in 2003/04 has increased Namibia’s vulnerability to shocks. The projected
large decline of SACU receipts comes at an inopportune time as pressing spending needs
have to be accommodated, in particular to achieve the MDGs and implement the HIV/AIDS
strategy. Implementing this strategy, while costly, will be critical for containing the
pandemic and supporting growth.
54.
The authorities’ commitment to return to a path of fiscal consolidation in this
difficult environment is commendable. Their decision to forego a supplementary budget
for 2004/05 sets an appropriate signal as does their intention to place the public debt ratio on
a downward trajectory over the medium term. This requires the generation of moderate
primary surpluses. Given Namibia’s already high tax revenue/GDP ratio, the authorities have
little choice but to curtail nonessential current spending.
55.
To this end, clear roadmaps for civil service and public enterprise reform are
needed. Namibia’s wage bill and subsidies for parastatals account for almost half of all
spending, thereby crowding out other, more productive expenditure. Decisive action is
needed in these areas to allow for a reorientation of spending. Ongoing efforts to strengthen
medium-term expenditure planning and introduce output-budgeting should facilitate

- 22 -

identifying budgetary priorities and enhancing the quality of expenditure. This should
ultimately help strengthen Namibia’s long-term growth potential.
56.
In the same vein, the authorities should consider consolidating the existing tax
incentives. It appears doubtful whether these incentives serve their intended objective of
providing a cost-effective way to generate employment and stimulate growth. In light of the
conflicting views within the government, the staff recommends that an independent review
be undertaken, which would also assess the associated revenue loss and provide a basis for
an informed policy decision.
57.
The exchange rate peg to the rand has served Namibia well in providing a
credible anchor for policy-making and reducing inflation. As a small open economy,
Namibia reaps considerable benefits from its increasingly close ties with South Africa. The
appreciation of the Namibia dollar has heightened the need for an acceleration of structural
reforms so as to enhance the flexibility of the economy and unleash productivity gains.
58.
Namibia’s international reserves need to be strengthened. Most importantly, the
Bank of Namibia should avoid a negative interest rate differential, and, if need be, establish a
positive differential, vis-à-vis the anchor currency. The authorities' efforts to strengthen
domestic financial markets and create investment opportunities could also help contain
outflows of institutional investors. However, the proposed tightening of domestic asset
requirements for such investors may undermine these efforts and should be revisited.
59.
There are signs that Namibia’s banking system is strengthening. The recently
completed self-assessment of compliance with international banking supervision standards
forms a good basis for an independent outside assessment; in this context, the staff welcomes
the authorities’ interest in an FSAP. On the other hand, supervision of nonbank financial
institutions needs to be strengthened, notably in two areas: first, enabling legislation needs to
be approved expeditiously to make the regulatory agency fully effective; and second, the
large equity exposure of Namibian pension funds and insurance companies poses a risk that
needs to be addressed.
60.
Namibia’s commitment to trade liberalization is commendable. The new SACU
framework will provide Namibia with the opportunity to help shape trade negotiations and
policies. The staff welcomes the progress made in negotiating the free trade agreements with
key trade partners and lowering tariffs.
61.

It is proposed that Namibia remain on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

1/ This expenditure corresponds to commitments in the national HIV/AIDS strategy and is over and above any HIV/AIDS-related expenditure already
embedded in the budget.
2/ The "overall balance" reflects externally financed project spending (except for roads) that is not channeled through the state account. By contrast,
the "overall balance excluding extrabudgetary spending" excludes such spending and thus corresponds directly with the GRN concept.

APPENDIX II

Namibia: Relations with the World Bank Group
1.
Namibia joined the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in 1990. Currently, the Bank has no
IBRD loans to Namibia. With a GDP per capita of about US$2,000, Namibia is not eligible
for IDA assistance. The dialogue and knowledge development and sharing interventions in
Namibia are focused on five areas: (i) growth and poverty reduction; (ii) capacity building
for both public and private sectors; (iii) education sector; (iv) support for implementing
decentralization; and (v) support in environmental management and bio-conservation.
2.
In response to Government’s interest in obtaining Bank support for projects in these
areas, a Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) grant is being used to prepare
programs dealing with sub-national governments and service delivery through fiscal
decentralization. The Bank is also supporting the conduct of a public expenditure tracking
survey (PETS) through an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant. The PETS covers
the Ministries of Education and Health, and assesses the capacity of the institutions involved
in managing public spending in the two ministries.
3.
The Integrated Community-Based Ecosystem Management Project (ICEMA) is the
first Bank-financed operation in Namibia (a grant from the Global Environment Facility
(GEF)). Its goal is to promote community based integrated ecosystem management through
targeted activities that would improve rural livelihoods. Two other GEF projects will assist
the government in preparing the Namibia Coast Biodiversity project and promote
environmental sustainability through improved land use planning.
4.
The Bank is working with the Government to prepare a Country Economic
Memorandum that will address the issues identified in the Government’s key policy
documents. While there is no country assistance strategy (CAS) for Namibia at present, the
Bank is engaged in discussions with the Government on developing a framework for Bank
assistance to Namibia over the next few years. The framework would strengthen the
partnership between the Bank and Namibia and form the basis for collaboration in addressing
the key challenges of achieving sustainable growth, and reducing poverty and inequality.
5.
The Government has approached the Bank for assistance in designing a human
resources development strategy, in part to address its intention to establish a national center
for innovation, entrepreneurship and technology (CIET) in the rural north. In response, the
Bank has finalized an economic and sector work to support the decision-making process for
the proposal. Preliminary findings suggest the need for substantial reform of educational and
the training sector in Namibia. This analytical work will provide the basis for a possible
IBRD operation to support implementation of the education sector strategic plan. A donor
round table is being planned, indicatively in February 2005.

- 36 -

APPENDIX II

6.
The IFC portfolio in Namibia is US$16.2 million in 6 projects. The two main
projects are a fishery and an insurance company. Foreign Investment Advisory Services
(FIAS) is assisting Namibia in improving their investment climate. IFC has a loan
investment in the fishery project (Pescanova) including an approval in November 2002 of
US$7.9 million long-term financing to enhance the company’s ability to catch its full quota.
IFC also has an equity investment in Namibia’s first indigenous life insurance company
(Namibia Life) of US$1.6 million. During the last fiscal year IFC completed its investment
in the Pandu Ondangwa Hotel project ( the hotel is now operational) and the Namibia
Investment Bank transaction. It is currently negotiating the sale of its stake in Namlife to a
local Namibian group.
7.
MIGA is currently processing a project in the agribusiness sector, with a total
potential coverage of US$65 million. The project is expected to be executed in FY 05.

APPENDIX III

Namibia: Statistical Issues
1.
Some of the core data for surveillance–—exchange rate, international reserves,
reserve money, and interest rates–—are available on a monthly basis with reasonable
promptness. Although the reliability, quality, and coverage of these data are generally
satisfactory, recent changes to the monetary and financial statistics need to be clarified.
The core real sector data and the balance of payments and international investment
position data are reported on an annual frequency only. Namibia is participating in the
GDDS regional project for Anglophone African countries that is funded by the
Department for International Development (DfID) of the UK. The authorities have
prepared an initial set of metadata that include detailed plans for improvement over the
short and medium term; these were posted on the Fund’s DSBB on December 19, 2002.
These metadata were subsequently updated in February 2004.
Real sector
2.
The authorities do not report any real sector data to STA; data published in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS) are taken from publications of Namibia’s Central
Bureau of Statistics. The present consumer price index covers only the capital city of
Windhoek. Two STA missions in May/June and September 2002 provided technical
assistance to CBS in compiling a nationwide consumer price index. It is planned that the
new index will be published in early 2005, with historical indices starting in December
2001.
3.
Data on the labor market, including data on the labor force, employment, and wages
are not systematically collected, which impedes the analysis of labor market
developments. The last labor market survey published was conducted in 2000. A new
labor market survey was conducted in 2004, but the results have not yet been published.
Government finance
4.
After a long lag, the authorities resumed reporting of fiscal data to STA. Central
government budgetary data through 2002, in the GFSM 2001 format, were reported for
publication in the 2004 GFS Yearbook, and the same data are being published in IFS.
5.
Expenditure data of line ministries are not available in a timely manner after the
end of the fiscal year, and are also subject to frequent revisions. The system for
expenditure reporting to the Fund needs to be strengthened. Preliminary information on
the cash expenditures of ministries should be more quickly available; and exercises to
reconcile the above-the-line estimates with financing data should be conducted more
frequently.

- 38 -

APPENDIX III

Monetary accounts
6.
Following the introduction of an IFS page in 1994, reporting of monetary data was
timely and comprehensive until February 2004. As a result of TA received from the
Fund, the Bank of Namibia substantially revised its Monetary and Financial Accounts
data. Subsequently, there was a gap in IFS reporting for Namibia from March 2004
through October 2004. IFS reporting resumed in November 2004, but further clarification
on the mapping between the old and new data series is still needed. The new data series
are available beginning in April 2002.
Balance of payments
7.
Until 2001, Namibia reported balance of payments and international investment
position data on an annual frequency. Since then the Bank of Namibia has been reporting
quarterly balance of payments data with a lag of one quarter. However, the quarterly data
are subject to substantial revisions. The methodology underlying the Namibian balance of
payments is consistent with the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual
and is well documented. The Bank of Namibia received Fund technical assistance
focused on improving the compilation of the capital and financial transactions and
international investment position statistics.

Namibia: External Debt Sustainability
1.
Namibia’s total gross external debt stood at an estimated US$761 million, or about

about two-fifths of Namibia’s gross
external debt of all maturities. On the whole, South Africa accounted for more than fourfifths of total short-term external debt.
2.
The baseline scenario—consistent with the medium-term macroeconomic framework
(Table 6)—envisages a moderate build-up of gross external debt by about 5 percentage
points to 22½ percent of GDP in 2009.15 This increase reflects (i) a moderate decline in the
external current account surplus to about 4 percent of GDP; and (ii) the projected new
borrowing by the government and the private sector to fund various projects. On the financial
account, it is envisaged that the net outflows that have characterized Namibia’s external
transactions over the years will continue and, as a result, the country’s net external debt is
expected to remain negative.
3.
The simulations under the external sustainability framework indicate that Namibia’s
external debt is sustainable over the medium term and does not give rise to any immediate
14

External debt data are based on the International Investment Position (IIP). The mission
undertook a partial reconciliation of Namibian and South African IIP data for 2001 and 2002.
Large differences were observed in several categories, which the authorities will take up with
their South African counterparts. 2003 IIP data were only partially available.

15

External debt is estimated at 17½ percent of GDP at end-2003. The decline in the external
debt/GDP ratio relative to the previous year mainly reflects the appreciation of the Namibian
dollar against the U.S. dollar, which led to a sharp increase in nominal GDP in U.S. dollar
terms.

- 41 -

APPENDIX IV

concerns. Although the stress tests indicate a significantly higher debt accumulation
compared to the baseline, the levels appear manageable. The debt/GDP ratio rises to
62½ percent of GDP in the most extreme bound test which includes a decrease of the U.S
dollar GDP deflator by two standard deviations below its historical average. This scenario
implies a real depreciation of about 57 percent. However, as two-thirds of Namibia’s external
debt is rand-denominated at present, the bound test overstates the possible impact of a
depreciation.

APPENDIX V

Namibia: Fiscal Debt Sustainability
1.
Namibia’s public debt rose by 6 percentage points, to 31 percent of GDP, during the
2003/04 fiscal year. This strong increase followed three years during which public debt had
hovered around 25 percent of GDP, which is the debt level under the fiscal rule chosen by
the authorities.16 Namibia’s public debt is still moderate in comparison to other sub-Saharan
African countries.
2.
The authorities felt that breaking the fiscal rule undermined their policy credibility.
They were determined to maintain the rule to anchor their future fiscal policy making. Doing
so would be challenging in any environment, but it is especially difficult given the fiscal
pressures that Namibia will face over the medium term, including the decline in SACU
receipts and the need for increased HIV/AIDS spending. As described in greater detail in
Box 4, significant fiscal adjustment would be required simply to keep the public debt stock
under 30 percent of GDP by 2009/10, while a business-as-usual approach would result in a
public debt ratio that could quickly exceed 50 percent of GDP by the end of the decade.
3.
The mission complemented the fiscal scenarios presented in Box 4 with the standard
fiscal sustainability analysis, which was discussed with the authorities. The first panel of
Table 1 corresponds to the baseline scenario underlying the macroeconomic framework: after
rising modestly in the very short run, the public debt ratio would start to decline, dropping to
28¼ percent of GDP by the end of the decade in light of the generation of primary surpluses
and real interest rates that are surpassed by GDP growth. The interest-growth differential
implies that if the projections were extended, the public debt ratio would continue to decline,
even in the absence of a primary surplus. Alternatively, as shown in Table 1, it would be
possible to run a small primary deficit while stabilizing the public debt ratio at its 2009/10
level.
4.
Table 1 also illustrates some alternative scenarios to analyze the baseline public debt
profile under different assumptions. Scenario A1, for instance, shows that if one were to use
the historical performance of key variables as a guide to the future, public debt would be
expected to increase steadily, reaching 36 percent of GDP by the end of the period. The more
optimistic prediction in the baseline scenario hinges on primary deficits that are considerably
lower than their historical averages.
5.
The bound tests performed in Section B illustrate the vulnerability of the fiscal
position to economic shocks. Even if the Namibian authorities were fully successful in
effecting the ambitious fiscal adjustment underlying the baseline scenario, shocks to interest
16

It is important to note that these figures exclude publicly guaranteed debt, which accounted
for another 10 percent of GDP in 2003/04.

- 44 -

APPENDIX V

rates, growth, or the exchange rate could still occur, resulting in a higher public debt,
approaching 40 percent of GDP.
6.
For completeness, Table 2 presents the fiscal sustainability analysis based on the
alternative fiscal scenario in Box 4, assuming that the authorities undertake no adjustment
whatsoever. As described in Box 4, Namibia’s public debt stock would spiral out of control.
Primary deficits would be large and increase over time, with a concomitant increase in
interest rates. As a result, Namibia’s vulnerability to shocks would be magnified, as
illustrated in the stress tests, as public debt levels would quickly reach alarming levels.
7.
The Namibian authorities have recognized the importance of keeping their public
debt in check. While placing the public debt ratio on a downward trajectory is a daunting
task, failure to do so could quickly result in unsustainable public debt levels.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with
Namibia
On February 14, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Namibia.1
Background

Real GDP growth accelerated to an estimated 4¼ percent in 2004, after averaging about
3 percent during the preceding five years. Growth benefited from declining interest rates, as
the Bank of Namibia took advantage of declining inflationary pressures and reduced its key
policy rate in several steps from 12¾ percent in January 2003 to 7½ percent in July 2004.
In the process, the negative interest rate differential vis-à-vis the South African policy rate
was eliminated. During the period, inflation fell from around 13 percent to less than
5 percent. Namibia's per-capita growth has lagged behind that of other countries in the
region and has been insufficient to generate a sustained reduction in poverty.
The unemployment rate continues to exceed 30 percent, and more than one-fifth of the
population is infected with HIV/AIDS.
The fiscal deficit more than doubled in 2003/04, to 7¾ percent of GDP, representing a
deviation from Namibia’s traditionally good record of macroeconomic stability. As a result,
the public debt ratio increased by 6 percentage points, to 31 percent of GDP. The rise in the
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

fiscal deficit reflected mainly tax administration problems, a collapse in mining taxes, and a
higher wage bill. The fiscal deficit is projected to fall to 2 percent of GDP in 2004/05, as tax
administration problems are being addressed, customs union (SACU) receipts experience a
one-time windfall, and non-priority spending is being curtailed. The authorities reiterated
their commitment to reduce their public debt ratio over the medium term to bring it close to
their fiscal rule target of 25 percent of GDP, notwithstanding the sharp decline of SACU
receipts projected for the second half of the decade and the new spending pressures
related to the implementation of the HIV/AIDS strategy.
Namibia's external current account surplus is estimated to have risen further in 2004, to
5½ percent of GDP, to some extent reflecting a strengthening of exports to the rand area;
the Namibia dollar is pegged to the rand, which has appreciated considerably.
While external debt remains low, Namibia’s capital account has been marked by increasing
net outflows over the past few years, which has contributed to a decline in international
reserves. This reflected Namibian pension funds and insurance companies seeking broader
investment opportunities in South Africa’s financial markets.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for Namibia’s continued strong record of macroeconomic
stability, and welcomed the recent rise in GDP growth, decline in inflation, and strengthening of
the external current account surplus. At the same time, Directors noted that per capita income
growth has been slow, HIV/AIDS is taking a severe toll on the population, unemployment
remains high, and income distribution is highly skewed. In addition, the recent sharp widening of
the fiscal deficit has increased Namibia’s vulnerability to shocks.
Directors considered that Namibia’s prospects for sustaining the recent higher growth rates are
favorable, provided that the authorities press ahead with the implementation of their strategy to
combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic and of structural reforms to promote private sector activity.
It will also be important to continue to pursue prudent macroeconomic policies.
Several Directors also stressed the importance of creating private sector employment
opportunities.
Against the backdrop of the deterioration in the fiscal situation in 2003/04, Directors welcomed
the authorities’ commitment to return to a path of fiscal consolidation and place the public debt
ratio on a downward trajectory. They commended the authorities’ decision to forgo a
supplementary budget for the current fiscal year and to meet spending needs from the
contingency in the budget. Directors observed that the projected large decline in customs union
receipts and rising spending related to implementing the HIV/AIDS strategy and meeting the
Millennium Development Goals call for a determined effort to curtail nonessential expenditure in
the years ahead.
Directors accordingly saw ongoing efforts to strengthen expenditure planning and introduce
output-based budgeting as welcome initiatives to facilitate the identification of budgetary
priorities and enhance the quality of expenditure. They stressed that lasting progress in

-3containing expenditure will require firm action to reduce the wage bill and support for public
enterprises, which together account for nearly half of total spending. Recent measures, such as
the hiring freeze, are encouraging steps that need to be complemented by decisive action on
civil service and public enterprise reforms. Directors suggested that the authorities step up their
efforts to improve management of inefficient parastatals, and develop a privatization strategy.
Directors also encouraged the authorities to commission an independent review and consider
the consolidation of tax incentives aimed at attracting foreign investment. They welcomed the
authorities’ interest in a fiscal ROSC.
Directors observed that the peg of the Namibia dollar to the South African rand has served the
country well given Namibia’s close economic ties to South Africa. At the same time,
the implications for growth and employment prospects of possible further rand appreciation
underscore the importance of accelerating structural reforms to enhance the economy’s
productivity and flexibility.
Directors underscored the importance of ensuring that Namibia maintains an adequate level of
international reserves, including by avoiding a negative interest rate differential vis-à-vis the
anchor currency. They supported the authorities’ efforts to develop domestic financial markets,
which should provide more domestic investment opportunities to the rapidly growing pension
funds and insurance companies, and help contain investment outflows. In this context,
they called for reconsideration of the proposed regulatory amendments to tighten domestic
asset requirements.
Directors welcomed the indications that Namibia’s banking system is strengthening, but urged
careful monitoring of the surge in consumer lending. They welcomed the authorities’ request for
an FSAP, which will provide the opportunity to evaluate their recently completed selfassessment of compliance with international banking supervision standards and to analyze
other financial sector issues. Directors urged the authorities to move expeditiously in making the
supervisory agency for the nonbank financial sector fully operational, and to consider prudential
limits on the large equity exposure of pension funds and insurance companies. They welcomed
the progress made in drafting AML/CFT legislation.
Directors noted that broad-ranging structural reforms will be key to promoting private sector
activity, generating employment, and addressing income inequality. These are also the main
objectives of Namibia’s “Vision 2030” strategic development plan, and will require wellcoordinated and targeted efforts to enhance the quality of education, broaden skills
development through vocational training, strengthen the business environment (especially for
small- and medium-sized enterprises), and improve access to finance. Directors also
underscored the importance of enhancing labor market flexibility and ensuring that Namibia’s
labor costs remain competitive. They acknowledged the broad support among the government,
donors, and the farmers union for an acceleration of the government’s land redistribution
program. Going forward, it will be important to ensure that the new expropriation policy is
implemented based on transparent criteria, including to contain any negative repercussions on
production and investment.

-4Directors commended the authorities for their commitment to trade liberalization. The new
Southern African Customs Union agreement allows Namibia to participate in the custom union’s
policy setting and trade negotiation framework, but also requires enhanced capacity in various
areas, including customs administration and statistical compilation. In this context, Directors
encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to address data weaknesses building on the
significant progress achieved in recent years.

Statement by Peter Ngumbullu, Executive Director for Namibia
and John Steytler, Advisor to Executive Director
February 14, 2005
1.
The Namibian authorities appreciate the candid exchange of views during the 2004
Article IV Consultation discussions. They agree with the thrust of the staff assessment and
commend staff for the report, which reflects an open dialogue between staff and the
authorities, and gives a fair account of economic developments in Namibia and the
challenges ahead. The Namibian authorities also find the topics for the selected papers to be
well chosen, as they supplement ongoing work by the authorities in these areas.
Background
2.
Namibia has established an enviable record of macroeconomic stability since
attaining independence in 1990. This has largely been due to implementation of marketoriented policies, including a credible exchange rate peg, supported by prudent fiscal policies
and a stable political and legal environment. Over the period 1990-2004, the country
registered an average real GDP growth rate of about 4 percent, making it one of the fastest
growing economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Notwithstanding this accomplishment, the
country faces enormous developmental challenges, some of which are due to the legacy of
the apartheid regime, including high-income inequality, widespread poverty, a narrow
economic base, and recently the high incidence of HIV/AIDS.
3.
The authorities have responded effectively to these challenges and have made good
progress in the context of its medium-term development plans, and their strategy going
forward is sound. Building on the progress made, the country launched its long-term
development strategy, Vision 2030, which is a comprehensive development plan aimed at
transforming Namibia into a diversified and industrialized country, with a high standard of
living for all its citizens. The plan further aims at substantially reducing income inequality
and unemployment by 2030. The plan has been formulated in close collaboration and
consultation with all major stakeholders, including the private sector, labour unions, and civil
society and non-governmental organizations. There is, therefore, a strong degree of
ownership, which is crucial for its success.
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
4.
Namibia’s economic performance improved significantly in 2004. Real GDP growth
is estimated to have accelerated to over 4 percent and has been broad-based, driven by
private consumption and supported by declining interest rates. The average annual inflation
rate declined from 7.3 percent in 2003 to 3.9 percent in 2004, and the surplus on the external
current account is estimated to have increased as a ratio of GDP in 2004, while foreign debt
stock of the central government remained low. During fiscal year 2003/04, the fiscal deficit,
excluding extra-budgetary spending increased to 7.5 percent of GDP. This undesirable outturn was due to the weakening of the US dollar against other currencies that affected
corporate profits margins of the export oriented industries and subsequent tax contribution. In

-2addition, the authorities experienced temporary setbacks in computer systems that support
collection of VAT and income tax.
5.
Looking ahead, real GDP growth of up to 4 percent is expected for 2005, supported
by an increase in mining sector activities, inflation is expected to remain at the existing single
digit level, and the external current account is expected to remain in a comfortable surplus.
The fiscal position is expected to strengthen markedly during 2004/05, supported by
expenditure restraint measures such as freezing of civil service recruitments and traveling
related expenditure.
Fiscal Policy
6.
The overarching objective of fiscal policy remains fiscal sustainability aimed at
keeping inflation low and to sustain the peg exchange rate. The authorities do agree with staff
that most fiscal adjustment over the medium term would need to come from the expenditure
side, including through freezing of further increase of the wage bill in relation to GDP,
reduction of subsidies to parastatals, and spending on goods and services. In part due to
larger than expected SACU receipts, the Namibian authorities were able to significantly
reduce the budget deficit to 2.0 percent of GDP in 2004/05. In addition, the authorities have
implemented several measures to consolidate the fiscal position during fiscal year 2004/05
and in the medium term, including, the following:
(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

The authorities recognized the urgency of fiscal adjustment and decided not to
request for supplementary budget in 2004/05, the first time since
independence. Instead, any additional spending needs were addressed by
utilizing the contingency provision in the 2004/05 budget.
Measures to improve tax administration were implemented, including
employment of private audit companies to assist the Ministry of Finance to
improve audit capacity. The authorities will further explore measures to
broaden the tax base such as the integration of the informal sector into the
formal sector.
On expenditure outlays, more resources will be allocated for capital
expenditure aimed at enhancing economic growth, while trying to restrain
current expenditure, including freezing of civil service recruitment, as well as
reduction of travel related expenditure.
The Ministry of Finance agrees that tax incentives under the Export
Processing Zone (EPZ) regime, especially to mining companies might have
been rather generous. At the same time, they also believe that the EPZ regime
did enable Namibia to attract substantial foreign direct investment. In this
connection, the authorities have decided to establish a task force comprising
representatives of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Trade and Industry
and the Bank of Namibia to review Namibia’s incentives regime with a view
to streamlining and making it more efficient. The Namibian authorities also
agree that an overall stable environment, including political stability, strong
legal institutions, and protection of property rights, elements already well

-3-

(v)

entrenched in Namibia’s policy framework, are very important for attracting
foreign direct investment.
Finally, the authorities intend to enhance their medium-term expenditure
framework with the gradual introduction of output based program budgeting.

Monetary, Exchange Rate and Financial Sector Issues
7.
Monetary policy is anchored on Namibia’s exchange rate peg to the South African
Rand and membership in the Common Monetary Area (CMA). The primary long-term
objective of Namibia’s monetary policy is to achieve low and sustainable inflation. The
authorities believe that while the recent appreciation of the exchange rate has caused
hardship to some exporters, the economy remained competitive overall. Apart from the
inflationary expectations problem that is generally associated with a weak currency, there is
also the concern that to rely on a depreciating exchange rate for price competitiveness runs
the risk of sharp fluctuations in relative prices, and may only be beneficial in the very shortterm. The authorities therefore believe that for long-term prosperity the country will be better
off with exchange rate stability, and focusing on improvements of total factor productivity
for enhancing external competitiveness. In this connection, they recognize the need to
develop additional competitiveness indicators that will provide adequate guide to policy.
8.
While the authorities do not see drain in international reserves as an indication of lack
of confidence, they nevertheless remain concerned about the relatively low level of
international reserves, and are exploring ways to build more reserves. In this regard, they
welcome the exchange of views with staff on measures to strengthen reserves and will give
careful consideration to these suggestions, including obtaining a credit rating and tapping
international capital markets through the issuing of a Eurobond. The authorities would also
explore other options to bolster reserves such as syndicated borrowing in South Africa or
external markets and marketing Namibian public debt instruments in South Africa. They
believe that factors contributing to the low reserves level is the large outflow of capital,
supported by free flow of capital under the open capital regime under the CMA arrangement
as well as lack of investment opportunities in Namibia. The authorities have taken note of
staff’s advice on the recently proposed measures to stem capital outflow and will reassess the
proposed regulations after full consultations with market participants. They, however, believe
that the argument of interest rate differential between Namibia and South Africa cannot be
blamed for outflows and that hiking interest rate may put undue pressure on the State and
may stifle economic growth in Namibia.
9.
The banking industry is financially sound, solvent, profitable and liquid, with banks
maintaining prudential ratios in excess of statutory requirements, and low ratios of nonperforming loans. A recent self-assessment shows that the Bank of Namibia is compliant
with 21 of the 25 Basel Core Principles of Effective Banking Supervision. To further
strengthen the financial system the authorities have requested for a Bank/Fund Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). An anti-money laundering and CFT legislation is
expected to be tabled before Parliament for consideration and adoption in the near future.

-4Structural Issues
10.
The Namibian authorities agree with staff that structural reforms are critical to
promoting private sector development, generating employment and addressing the problem
of income inequality. In this regard, they recognize the need to strengthen and enhance
development of skills, which had been neglected under the apartheid regime, due to lack of
vocational training. Notwithstanding the fact that education spending exceeded 25 percent of
total spending every year since independence and is among the highest in sub-Saharan
Africa, the authorities continue to place this item as one of the highest priority in their
agenda. They have also implemented several programs to assist development of small and
medium size enterprises.
11.
Progress on the trade liberalization front has been significant and Namibia has one of
the most open and liberal trade regimes in sub-Saharan Africa, with a simple average tariff of
only 11.4 percent compared to the sub-Saharan average of 20 percent. Namibia is committed
towards further trade liberalization, and together with its SACU partners, it recently
concluded a PTA with MERCOSUR. In the mean time, they are engaged in free trade
discussions with the United States, the EU and EFTA. Free Trade under SADC is also
progressing well. In 2005, SACU partners are going to unilaterally open their markets for
non-SACU members of SADC. The authorities also welcome the US Africa Growth and
Opportunity Act, which has enabled them to establish a textile industry, and export textiles
and apparels into the US market.
12.
The Namibian government reaffirms its commitment to an orderly process in
implementing its land distribution program. It has emphasized that expropriation with “just”
compensation has become necessary to speed up the land distribution program, which has not
been very successful under the “willing buyer willing seller principle” and to free up land
that is currently under-utilized. There is a healthy dialogue between the authorities and all
stakeholders, and government will continue to make efforts to clarify its policy on this
matter. The authorities would like to thank the international community, in particular the
European Union and the German government for their support of the land redistribution
program.
Fight against HIV/AIDS
13.
The Namibian authorities are determined to take the challenge of the HIV/AIDS
pandemic head on. In this regard, the government has launched its third medium-term
National Strategic Plan (NSP) on HIV/AIDS, covering the period 2004-2009. The goal of
NSP is to reduce the incidence of HIV infection to below the epidemic threshold, by 2007.
The Namibian government recognizes that HIV/AIDS is also a developmental issue, which
requires a comprehensive approach in managing the pandemic. Accordingly, the NSP is built
around five core action areas: (i) prevention, (ii) treatment care and support services, (iii)
impact mitigation, (iv) provision of strengthened legal and ethical environment and (v)
integrated and coordinated program management.

-514.
Antiretroviral treatment has been introduced in 19 out of 35 public hospitals, while
3000 patients are receiving treatment under the government program. The treatment of
prevention of mother-to-child transmission has been rolled out to 25 public hospitals. The
authorities hope to be able to extend these services significantly to cover all public hospitals
by the end of 2005, with financial assistance from the Global Fund Grant, PEPFAR and
domestic resource mobilization. The authorities appreciate the assistance provided by
international community in their fight against this pandemic. Thanks to the authorities
determined efforts and assistance of the international community, there are currently
encouraging signs that the incidence rate of HIV/AIDS may have already begun to level off
in 2004, well before the target date of 2007.
Other Issues
15.
The Namibian authorities are committed to strengthening the statistical system, by
implementing the recommendations of the data module of the Report on Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC) concluded in 2001. A fair number of these recommendations
have already been implemented, and work is ongoing.
16.
In conclusion, we believe that the continued dialogue between the authorities and the
staff is fruitful. We want to reiterate the strong commitment of the authorities on the reforms
and in addressing the economic challenges ahead. In this regard, we trust that the Fund will
continue to be fully responsive in providing the technical assistance requested by the
authorities to strengthen their ability to implement the reform agenda.
