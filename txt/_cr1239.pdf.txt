STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 10, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context. A loss of confidence from domestic political and regional uncertainty has
brought an end to a four-year spell of impressive economic growth. Growth is
expected to fall to 1–2 percent in 2011 from 8 percent per year in 2007–10. The economy
could grow at 3–4 percent in 2012, but the outlook hinges on improvements in the
external environment. Downside risks are high, mainly from the uprising in Syria, further
escalation of which could have serious political and economic repercussions on Lebanon.
Navigating uncertainty and safeguarding macro stability. The challenging external
environment calls for strong domestic policies that instill confidence. The 2012 budget
should target a small primary surplus to assure markets that fiscal discipline will be
maintained. Embedding the budget in a medium-term agenda would facilitate
prioritization. There is also scope for making fiscal policy more equitable over time.
Investment in the electricity sector is welcome but should go in parallel with reforms
to improve its efficiency. Letting interest rates rise would make government T-bills
more attractive to banks and thus allow the treasury to reduce reliance on the Banque
du Liban (BdL).
Securing sustained inclusive growth and economic resilience. Faster, sustained, and
more inclusive growth in the medium term requires investment and reforms in
infrastructure as well as improvements in the business climate and the labor market.
Limiting wage increases to productivity gains would safeguard competitiveness. Fiscal
policy should be anchored in a sizeable reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio (one of the
highest in the world). The BdL’s income position needs strengthening. Bank regulation
and supervision should focus on early problem detection.

BACKDROP
1.

Lebanon’s economy lost momentum

in 2011 after four strong years. Increased
polarization of political parties since mid-2010,
the fall of the coalition government in January
2011, and prolonged talks over the make-up
of the new government until its formation in
June shook market confidence. Compounded
with the regional unrest, this led to an
economic downturn, adversely affecting fiscal
balances and financing conditions.

marked decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio since
2006 and the sizeable primary surplus in
2010—freed up room for an accommodative
fiscal stance in 2011 and allowed the
government to maintain favorable access to

4.

Rising risks call for strong domestic

policies. Lebanon is facing a difficult global,
regional, and domestic environment
simultaneously for the first time in over a
decade. Domestic policies should thus aim at
instilling confidence and tackling key policy
challenges—preserving macroeconomic
stability and paving the way for a more
resilient, dynamic, and inclusive economy.

Box 1. Policies Since the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Macroeconomic policies broadly followed
staff advice. The 2010 primary surplus
surpassed staff’s recommended target by
almost one percent of GDP. This reflected
lower-than-expected capital spending
because the budget was not passed (staff
supported an increase to address Lebanon’s
infrastructure deficit). To slow deposit inflows
and contain reserve accumulation, the
authorities gradually reduced interest rates in
2009–10 and kept them unchanged since mid2010, in line with staff advice. Starting in late
2010, domestic and external shocks affected
Lebanon’s economic performance, and the
context for staff advice on near-term policies
changed significantly.

Progress on structural reforms was mixed.
Cabinet approved a reform strategy for the
electricity sector, while parliament passed laws
on investments in the electricity sector and on
the development of capital markets. Banking
sector supervision has continued to improve and
some progress was made in modernizing tax
administration and reforming public financial
management, including by extending budget
coverage and enhancing transparency. Reforms
in other areas have though been slow (e.g., in
telecom and statistics) or even stalled (e.g., in
introducing a global income tax and
implementing a Treasury Single Account).

Box 2. Lebanon’s Interconnectedness
Lebanon is highly integrated with the world.
Exports of goods and services amount to about
60 percent of GDP and imports of goods and
services to 75 percent. Emigration has been
traditionally high, and the Lebanese diaspora is a
source of substantial remittances of about
15 percent of GDP. FDI and nonresident deposit
inflows each are estimated at 11 percent of GDP
on average over the last five years.

Current account links are strongest with Arab

for two-thirds of tourism and remittances inflows
and more than 40 percent of goods exports, with
the region’s oil exporters contributing most.
Among countries affected by the Arab Spring,

of goods exports and tourism, transit trade and
tourism through Syria from the GCC, Jordan, and
Turkey are reportedly more substantial. Exposure
to Europe stems primarily from exports of goods
(4½ percent of GDP), mainly sales of gold items to
Switzerland. Links to the U.S. and Australia have
increased in recent years, reflecting higher
remittances and tourism.
Financial links are mostly with MENA and
Europe. Staff estimates that almost 40 percent of
total bank deposits belong to nonresidents, a
significant share of which comes from Lebanese
living in MENA. Wholesale funding is limited and
mainly from BIS-reporting banks ($5.5 billion or
4 percent of bank assets). On the asset side, the
BdL and commercial banks hold three quarters of
their foreign assets in deposits with BIS banks,
reportedly most in Europe. Commercial banks
have subsidiaries/branches in or direct lending to
MENA, Europe, and Africa, but equity and loan
exposures remain moderate as a share of their
assets (see charts). The largest exposure in terms
of assets and loans is to Syria, with $7½ billion
assets in seven subsidiaries and $1½ billion in
direct loans from Lebanon. Exposure to peripheral
euro zone countries is small. Foreign banks in
Lebanon are small, though some hold minority
shares in Lebanese banks. Lebanese nonbanks
mostly rely on domestic funding and have limited
net claims on BIS banks ($5 billion). Most FDI
(90 percent) comes from Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, and the UAE.

POLICY THEME #1—NAVIGATING UNCERTAINTY AND
SAFEGUARDING MACRO STABILITY
The near-term challenge is to instill confidence and preserve macroeconomic stability in
the face of uncertainty and spending pressures. This requires above all a prudent 2012
budget. In addition, interest rates should be allowed to rise to reduce government reliance
on BdL financing.

A. The 2012 Budget—Supporting Confidence, Growth, and Equity
16.

The first draft of the 2012 budget is

being revised. The draft budget envisaged an
increase in primary expenditure by 4 percent
of GDP, largely for capital spending, including
investment in electricity generation capacity.
Revenue would increase by 1 percent of GDP,
reflecting a drop in nontax revenue and
substantial tax measures. The latter
include primarily an increase in the VAT rate
(to 12 from 10 percent), an increase in the
withholding tax on interest (to 8 from
5 percent), and a 3 percent fee on real estate
sales. Full implementation of the budget1
would have implied a primary deficit of
2 percent of GDP. The authorities noted
that the budget revision will incorporate
recently approved public wage increases by
keeping the deficit unchanged through further
revenue measures or lower expenditure.2 With

Though cabinet approved increases in wages and
allowances for both public and private sector
employees in late December, discussions are ongoing.
Under the approved scheme, the transportation
allowance would be subsumed into the basic wage

security contributions reduced accordingly. The overall

17.

Discussions focused on maintaining

fiscal discipline. Staff argued that
implementing the budget would interrupt a
decade-long record of primary surpluses and a
reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio since 2006.
This would send a negative signal to markets
at a time when public finances are increasingly
coming under scrutiny around the world and
thus risk jeopardizing macroeconomic stability.
With government already having difficulties in
placing local currency debt in the market in
2011, a more expansionary budget would also
exacerbate financing pressures. Staff
recommended that the budget should target a
small primary surplus, which would imply a
broadly neutral fiscal stance, and keep the
debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path. This

The medium-term challenge is to generate sustainable and inclusive growth while further
reducing existing vulnerabilities and preventing a build-up of new ones. This requires

labor market, reducing debt, strengthening the social safety net, and continuing to

1/ Or the latest year for which data are available.

Similar to other MENA countries, there is a
large difference (almost 50 percentage points)
between male and female labor force
participation rates. But unlike most of these
countries, Lebanon has only a small gender gap
in unemployment (of 2 percentage points).
The economy’s capacity to generate quality
jobs appears weak. From 1998 to 2009, output
grew by about 4 percent on average per year.
Employment though remained broadly
unchanged and concentrated in low
productivity sectors. Informal employment
appears to have increased, with now more than
one third of those employed allegedly in the

informal sector. Informal employment relies to
a large extent on foreign workers, and
remittance outflows are now about twice their
size in the early 2000s.
Skill mismatches, labor market rigidities, and
high reservation wages cause market
inefficiencies. The labor force is highly
educated and many work abroad at some point
in their career. But there appears to be a skill
mismatch as companies identify labor skills as a
major constraint to business. Employers also
identify labor regulations, including the design
of the end-of-service indemnity, as an
impediment to employment. With the recently
approved wage increase, the minimum wage
would be among the highest in the region
though, when adjusting for costs of living,
broadly in line with the regional average. Lastly,
high remittances and education costs
contribute to voluntary unemployment by
keeping reservation wages high.

Export indicators so far do not indicate
competitiveness issues. Lebanon’s trade
deficit—about 32 percent of GDP per year
during 2006–10—is fairly sustainably financed
by tourism and remittances inflows. Goods
export volumes are estimated to have grown
at an average of 17 percent per year during
2006–10 and tourism receipts at 19 percent.
Though the share of exports of both goods and
services globally has grown steadily since 2000,
there was some leveling off in 2010.

Lebanon’s exchange rate appears to be
modestly overvalued. The macroeconomic
balance and the external sustainability
approaches point to a modest overvaluation in
the range of 11–17 percent, while the
equilibrium real exchange rate approach
suggests a slight overvaluation of about
3 percent. The variation in the results likely
reflects methodological differences and limited
data availability.

Box 5. Readiness for Basel III
Lebanon is well placed to implement
Basel III. The BCC has developed an action
plan focused on strengthening corporate
governance; harmonizing definitions,
classifications and methodologies for
calculating various metrics; adopting forwardlooking provisioning; and improving
information management systems and further
stress testing.
Most banks will meet Basel III capital
requirements by 2012. The few that will

branches) are required to conform by

The BCC is revising liquidity definitions to
align them with Basel III. Banks are currently
required to place 15 percent of term and
25 percent of demand deposits in domestic
currency with the BdL. For foreign currency
deposits, banks have to place 15 percent
with the BdL and to maintain a further
10 percent in liquid assets. In practice, banks
typically hold substantially more through
excess reserves with the BdL and liquid
deposits with foreign banks. The funding
ratio is quite stable as banks do not rely on
wholesale funding. While most deposits are

deposits thanks to a proven loyal depositor
base.

financing must be reduced. The BdL’s
purchases of T-bills to cover shortfalls in
demand were appropriate in the aftermath of
the government crisis in January to maintain
stability. With the situation now stabilized,
interest rates on T-bills with maturities of less
than 7 years should rise to allow the treasury
to finance itself from the market. Parliamentary

government’s high foreign-currency debt and
currency mismatch on the balance sheets of

have lost some competitiveness, which it
should regain through productivity-enhancing
reforms to ensure that the peg and current
account are sustainable. The recently approved
wage increases could pose additional
problems for competitiveness, and, in this
context, future wage increases beyond
productivity gains would be
counterproductive.
44.

A fiscal consolidation strategy

should further cut the debt ratio. It should
aim at generating sizeable primary surpluses
while creating space for permanently higher
levels of social and capital spending. This could
be achieved by a combination of equitable and
efficient tax measures, expenditure
rationalization, most importantly by reducing
the transfers to the electricity company, as well
as improvements in tax administration and

The BdL’s balance sheet should be

increase gradually in line with a projected
increase in global interest rates. Under this

slightly above 130 percent throughout the
medium term.

Reform scenario. The scenario builds on
structural reforms to increase medium-term
growth and fiscal consolidation to reduce
government debt, which in turn would boost
confidence and lead to lower spreads for
Lebanon. A combination of revenue and
expenditure measures would increase the
primary surplus, while creating fiscal space for
higher investment and targeted social
spending. Revenue measures would include
introducing a comprehensive capital gains tax
(yield of 0.3 percent of GDP); increasing
selected excises (0.6 percent of GDP) and the
VAT rate to 15 percent (1.1 percent of GDP);
and broadening the VAT and income tax
bases. Expenditure measures would include
reforming the electricity sector to allow a
gradual increase in tariffs to cost recovery
and thus a reduction in transfers to the
loss-making electricity company by more than
two thirds over the medium term. Under this
scenario, debt would decline to 97 percent of
GDP by 2020 (Figure 1, panel 6).

1/ Includes all debt contracted by the Treasury on behalf of the central government and public agencies other than the Banque du Liban; accrued interest; and Banque du Liban lending to the Electricite du Liban.
Excludes possible government arrears to the private sector.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

Annex 2. Lebanon: External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Lebanon’s external debt is expected to
remain among the highest in the world. The
external debt-to-GDP is estimated at
161 percent in 2010, down from 199 percent in
2006, reflecting mostly rapid nominal GDP
growth. About 80 percent of external debt
consists of short-term nonresident deposits in
the banking sector. Medium-term projections
reflect persistent (though narrowing) current
account deficits projected through 2016.
Under the baseline scenario, external debt is
expected to increase to 178 percent of GDP by
2016, largely reflecting the impact of an
expected increase in nominal interest rates (in
line with global projections) and continuous
inflows of nonresident deposits.
Several factors mitigate the extent of
underlying vulnerabilities from the high
debt ratio.

While almost all nonresident deposits
are short-term, they are largely owned
by the Lebanese diaspora. These
deposits have proven to behave like
long-term deposits and demonstrated
resilience during past stress episodes.
Nonresident deposits comprise about
85 percent of gross financing needs
over the medium term.


42

Due to lack of information on maturity,
all external nondeposit liabilities of
banks and the full amount of external
debt of nonbanks are treated as
short-term debt in this exercise. This
implies a substantial upward bias in
estimates of gross annual financing
needs and short-term external debt.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Standard bound tests suggest high
sensitivity of the debt dynamics to
exchange rate, growth, current account
balance, and interest rate shocks. Debt
dynamics are most sensitive to exchange rate
shocks. A one-time real depreciation of
30 percent in the exchange rate in 2012 would
raise, on impact, the debt level to 244 percent
of GDP, which would rise further to
273 percent of GDP by 2016 (Figure 1, panel
6). This underscores the importance of the
exchange rate peg as a linchpin of
macroeconomic and financial stability in
Lebanon. In addition, a permanent shock of a
½ standard deviation from past distribution,
relative to the baseline, applied to the


Interest rate would raise the debt ratio
to 183 percent of GDP by 2016 (Figure
1, panel 2);



Growth rate would raise the debt ratio
to 191 percent of GDP by 2016 (Figure
1, panel 3); and



Noninterest current account balance
would raise the debt ratio to
194 percent of GDP by 2016 (Figure 1,
panel 4).

A combined permanent shock of a ¼ standard
deviation from past distribution, relative to the
baseline, applied to the interest rate, growth
rate, and noninterest current account balance
would raise the debt ratio to 195 percent of
GDP by 2016 (Figure 1, panel 5).

Safeguards Assessment
Pursuant to Fund policy, the Banque du Liban
(BdL) was subject to a full safeguards assessment
in conjunction with the first EPCA. The 2008
safeguards assessment report proposed several
specific measures for enhancing the BdL’s
financial reporting, audit and control procedures,
and recommended an update of the central bank
law. An update safeguards assessment was
completed in August 2009 in the context of the
second EPCA. The update noted progress in
enhancing procedures for reserve management
and external audit, but recommended further
actions to strengthen financial reporting
transparency, oversight, central bank legislation,
and internal audit.

Nonfinancial Relations
Exchange Arrangement
Lebanon has accepted the obligations of Article
VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 in 1993 and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. The exchange
arrangement, which maintains a de-facto peg to
the U.S. dollar, is classified as stabilized. Since
October 1999, the BdL has intervened to keep the
pound around a mid-point parity of LL 1,507.5 per
$1, with a bid-ask spread of LL+/-6.5.
Last Article IV Consultation
The 2010 Article IV Consultation was concluded by
the Executive Board on July 30, 2010. At the time,
Directors welcomed Lebanon’s strong economic and
financial performance during the global recession.
They underscored the need to address the high
government debt and implement growth-enhancing
structural reforms and called for continued vigilance
to prevent the build-up of new vulnerabilities.
Financial Sector Assessment Program
Lebanon participated in the Financial Sector
Assessment Program in 1999, and the related
report was presented to the Executive Board at
the time of the 1999 Article IV consultation
(FO/DIS/99/113). A Financial System Stability
Assessment update was conducted in 2001, and
the related report presented to the Executive
Board at the time of the 2001 Article IV
consultation (SM/01/281).
Resident Representative Office
The IMF Resident Representative Office in
Lebanon was opened in January 2008 and closed
in August 2011. Mr. Edward Gardner held the
position of Resident Representative from January
2008 to March 2009, followed by Mr. Eric Mottu
from September 2009 to August 2011. The Fund

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

maintains a local office which is headed by
Ms. Najla Nakhle and hosted by the Middle East
Technical Assistance Center (METAC).
Technical Assistance (TA)
Fiscal area—The Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD)
has provided advice on introducing the VAT,
reforming customs tariffs and income taxes,
strengthening tax and customs administration,
and improving expenditure policy and public
expenditure management. A fiscal ROSC was
published in May 2005. During 2005–07, TA
focused on (i) consolidating fiscal accounts;
(ii) improving liquidity management;
(iii) identifying fiscal reform priorities;
(iv) reforming subsidies and restoring gasoline
excises; and (v) improving the budget preparation
and execution processes. During 2008–09, FAD,
including through METAC, provided targeted
follow-up support to ongoing initiatives in both
tax administration and public financial
management (PFM) (e.g., tax audit program,
treasury single account and cash management).
During 2010–11, FAD provided assistance on tax
policy options and reform priorities in tax
administration and PFM, while METAC continued
to provide TA on tax and customs administration,
including on compliance management in the
banking sector and merging the VAT and income
tax directorates.
Financial area—The Monetary and Capital
Markets Department (MCM) has provided TA
mainly on the payment and settlement systems
and vulnerability indicators. The related missions
undertook an assessment of compliance with
Core Principles for Systemically Important
Payment Systems and advised on developing
systems to improve the efficiency and liquidity
management of public sector payments and
receipts. MCM also advised on developing

sector based on prudential data. During 2010–11,
METAC provided training on consolidated
supervision and assessing banks’ business and
strategic plans, and continued assistance in
developing an EWS.
Statistical area—The Statistics Department
has provided TA in national accounts, price and
balance of payments statistics. Several missions
on the consumer price index (CPI) were undertaken in
2007 through METAC, and a new monthly
country-wide CPI was launched in March 2008. TA in
building capacity for national accounts statistics and
economic surveys was provided through the resident
advisor in real sector statistics. METAC provided in
2008 assistance on balance of payments and
international investment position statistics, and more
recently, recommendations on improving work
processes in the Statistics and Economic Research
Department of the BdL. During 2010–11, TA focused
on (i) assessing the work processes at the BdL;
(ii) developing a producer price index; (iii) discussing
plans to move the compilation of national accounts
statistics from the Prime Minister’s office to
the Central Administration of Statistics; and
(iv) improving balance of payments/international

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX II. LEBANON—WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
1.
The Lebanon teams of the Fund and
the World Bank met to discuss macrocritical
structural reforms and to coordinate their
work in 2012.2 The teams agreed that
Lebanon’s main medium-term macroeconomic
challenges are to secure sustained inclusive
growth and economic resilience and to reduce
the very high government debt-to-GDP ratio.
To meet these challenges, Lebanon needs to
implement long-delayed structural reforms,
achieve fiscal consolidation over a number of
years, reform the tax system by making it more
equitable, strengthen the delivery of social
services and the social safety net, and continue
to protect the financial sector from excessive
risks.

and institutional framework. Electricity
sector reform is macrocritical because the
large budgetary transfers to the sector
(4½ percent of GDP in 2011) undermine
fiscal sustainability, and insufficient and
unreliable electricity supply weighs on
growth, social development and the
budget of households and businesses,
which are forced to pay for expensive
alternatives.


Telecommunications sector reform:
Reduce costs and enhance the quality and
scope of telecom services by making
necessary investments and implementing
the regulatory framework needed for
increased private sector involvement (until
now limited mostly to internet service
provision). Telecommunications sector
reform is macrocritical because (i) the
sector generates large revenue for the
government (about 3½ percent of GDP in
2011); (ii) improvements in the sector can
lift the country’s growth potential;
(iii) reducing the prices in the sector would
be beneficial to households and
enterprises; and (iv) proceeds from
licensing and/or privatization could be
used to repay part of the government
debt.



Tax reform: Move toward an equitable tax
system by broadening tax bases and
increasing tax rates on capital gains and
excisable products. Tax policy reforms
should be accompanied by reforms to
restructure and modernize revenue
administration and enhance compliance.
Tax reform is macrocritical because the tax
burden on wages is currently very high and

Based on this shared assessment, the
teams identified eight structural reform
areas as macrocritical, in view of their central
role in achieving fiscal consolidation and
sustained growth:

Electricity sector reform: Reduce
budgetary transfers to the electricity
provider by (i) reducing the cost of
production, including through reducing
systems losses and reliance on expensive
fuel oil; (ii) increasing revenue collection;
(iii) enhancing electricity supply by making
necessary investments; and (iv) gradually
adjusting tariffs toward cost recovery
levels, possibly in conjunction with
transfers to poor households. These
measures should be accompanied by a
comprehensive reform of the regulatory

a more equitable income distribution and
tax system as well as a more effective and
transparent revenue administration are
needed for inclusive growth.


Public financial management (PFM)
reform: Lebanon’s PFM is
compartmentalized and not very effective.
Key elements of a reform are:
(i) establishing a macrofiscal unit in the
Ministry of Finance; (ii) completing the
coverage of the Treasury Single Account;
(iii) strengthening expenditure
programming, budget preparation, aid and
debt management, and coordination with
the Central Bank; and (iv) strengthening
accounting, payment and auditing
functions, including by introducing a
Government Financial Management
Information System. These reforms are
macrocritical because they will help create
fiscal space needed for fiscal consolidation
and for higher public investment and
targeted social spending. They will also
help establish an accountability framework
for government and allow stakeholders in
the economy to monitor
developments. Potential plans to enter into
public-private partnerships (PPPs) could
help address infrastructure bottlenecks,
but a sound institutional and legal
framework must be put in place to control
fiscal risks and maximize benefits.
Social services and safety net reform:
Delivery of social services in Lebanon and
the social safety net are weak. The
following reforms would help: (i) health:
rationalizing health spending and
expanding health insurance coverage;
(ii) education: improving the quality of
public education including strengthening
higher education and vocational training;

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

(iii) pension systems: strengthening
financial sustainability and administration
of the National Social Security Fund,
reforming the end-of-service indemnity,
and ultimately creating a new pension
system for private sector workers; and
(iv) social safety nets: improving targeting
to the most needy. These reforms are
macrocritical because they will increase the
efficiency of public spending, and also
because better health and education
services, stronger pensions systems and a
more effective social safety are needed to
enhance the productivity of the workforce
and strengthen growth prospects, reduce
inequalities, and generate political support
for the needed fiscal consolidation.


Investment climate reform: Lebanon’s
corporate sector is held back by the high
costs of doing business. High costs arise
mainly from weaknesses in governance,
power supply, regulatory systems, and
weak contract enforcement. Wide-ranging
reforms are needed to address these
issues. They are macrocritical because a
more conducive investment climate is
needed to increase growth.



Financial sector stability assessment:
Given the very large financial sector and
the high dollarization, financial sector
stability is key for macroeconomic stability.
Assessing financial system stability is
macrocritical because it will help the
authorities identify potential threats to it
and provide suggestions for addressing
them.



Reform of the statistical system:
Lebanon’s statistical system suffers from
fragmentation and has limited capacity to
provide timely and reliable data.

Strengthening the statistical authorities is
macrocritical because timely and reliable
data are needed to monitor economic and
social developments and to enable
evidence-based decision making.



Tax reform: The Fund will provide
technical assistance (TA) on the
implementation of the capital gain tax. It
could also provide further support to
integrating the direct and indirect tax
departments at the Ministry of Finance.
The Bank will build on tax work available
from the Fund to perform analytical work
on the growth and welfare impact of fiscal
policy options.



Public financial management reform:
The Bank is providing TA on budget
preparation and execution, debt
management and aid coordination
through the Emergency Fiscal
Management project (EFMIS). The project
also includes macro-fiscal projections and
capacity building activities covering all four
fields of TA mentioned above. If requested,
the Fund would provide TA (via METAC) on
(i) the preparation of an explicit PFM
reform strategy that would build the
technical reforms into a coordinated
program of procedural improvements and
capacity building actions; and (ii) the
assessment of the new draft Budget
System Law, which is expected to replace
the current Public Accounting Law. The
Fund and the Bank will work jointly to
assist in establishing a sound framework
for PPPs, if requested by the authorities.
The Fund would assist in building capacity
for assessing and containing fiscal risks,
while the Bank would lead in setting up a
mechanism for competitive bidding
procedures and incentive-based
regulation.



Social services and safety net reform:
The Bank will continue its analytical work in
the area of social safety nets and provide a
prioritized list of policy recommendations.



Electricity sector reform: The Bank will
continue to elaborate reform options and
discuss them with the authorities. In this
context, the Bank will draw on the recently
completed “Electricity Strategic Plan”
prepared by the Ministry of Energy to
focus its support on priority measures to
be taken by the government. The Country
Partnership Strategy of the Bank provides
for technical and possibly financial support
to the electricity sector to assist the
government in implementing its strategic
plan.
Telecommunications sector reform: The
Bank will support the Government’s
objective to structure the
telecommunications sector in a way that
introduces competition, improves capacity
and quality of services, and reduces cost to
consumers. The Bank Group will continue
the dialogue accompanying the
implementation of the telecommunication
sector strategy. An Institutional
Development Fund Grant has been
mobilized to finance capacity building in
the Telecommunications Regulatory
Authority. In addition, IFC Advisory and
Investment products could be leveraged to
the extent the private sector becomes part
of the government’s strategy for telecom
reform. The Fund will lead work on
taxation and broader implications of the
sector reform on the budget.

Investment climate reform: The Bank has
completed the update of its survey-based
investment climate assessment in March
2010. This update includes a list of policy
recommendations. A national workshop
sponsored by the Prime Minister held in
June 2010 shared the results of the survey
and discussed an action plan for the
government to address the main binding
constraints to private sector development.
Working groups led by the Prime
Minister’s office are working on policy
measures to improve the business
environment.
Financial sector stability assessment: The
Fund will continue to provide TA on the
development of an EWS. If requested, it
will assist the Banking Control Commission
in enhancing the supervisory skills and
capacities of its supervisors through a
series of seminars and workshops. It could
also assist in strengthening bank
supervisory and regulatory frameworks.
The Bank and the Fund will continue to
encourage the authorities to undertake a
Financial System Stability Assessment
given the systemic importance of the
banking sector (the last update was done
in 2001). The update would provide a
prioritized list of recommendations for
addressing any threats to financial sector
stability.
Reform of the statistical system: The
Bank is completing a household survey
with the Central Administration of Statistics
for the purpose of the National Poverty

ANNEX III. LEBANON—STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of January 6, 2012)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings. In particular, there are weaknesses in the
compilation of data on national accounts, the labor market, general government and the other
nonfinancial public sector, and balance of payments. There are no national data on wages and real
estate activity and prices. In addition, data on poverty and income distribution are patchy,
impairing social policy formulation. Raising the statistical capacity in Lebanon to those of other
upper middle income countries requires a firm commitment and high-level support from the
government, including the allocation of sufficient resources and provision of a clear legal mandate
to the Central Administration of Statistics (CAS).
National accounts: The national accounts data are weak. Only annual data are publicly available,
currently until 2009. National accounts statistics are still being produced by a team in the Prime
Minister’s office with some bilateral support, using mostly administrative data sources and
compilation methods that do not conform to best practices. The launch of comprehensive
economic surveys and the transfer of national accounts statistics compilation to CAS have been
repeatedly delayed, with the transfer now being planned for the 2011 accounts. The Statistics
Department (STA) has been assisting CAS in building capacity to produce national accounts
estimates based on a sound methodology and a comprehensive data collection program. Work is
underway to incorporate the 2004 economic survey data into the national accounts estimates.
Price statistics: Since May 2008, CAS compiles and disseminates a monthly Consumer Price Index
(CPI) following internationally accepted methodology. The CPI covers all areas in Lebanon and
is disseminated within three weeks after the end of the reference month. Staff has adopted the
new CAS index as the primary CPI for Lebanon since 2009 after previously using a private
sector-produced index based on prices collected from Beirut and its suburbs. There is a need to
address remaining shortcomings in the CAS index, including delays in the survey of some prices
(e.g., housing), and to develop regular and timely statistics on producer prices, wages, and real
estate prices. A METAC mission in 2010 produced a plan to develop a monthly producer price
index to be compiled and released on a quarterly basis.
Government finance statistics: The dissemination of central government finance statistics has
improved markedly in recent years. However, the coverage of government finance statistics is not
comprehensive. Published monthly data on the central government budgetary accounts do not
cover items such as certain transfers, financing data, foreign-financed capital expenditure, and
arrears. Certain (treasury) spending is only identified ex-post, and presented in an economic
classification with a lag. This said, these items are provided to the MCD country team in the
context of surveillance activities. Government finance statistics are on a cash basis for revenue
data, with a modified cash basis for budgetary expenditure data, corresponding to the issuance of
payment orders.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LEBANON

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary statistics are adequate. At the same time,
sectoralization of institutional units and classification of financial instruments in the data reported
to STA fall short of what is needed for the compilation of Standardized Report Forms. Reflecting in
part restrictions imposed by domestic legislation, the Banque du Liban (BdL) does not publish
externally audited financial statements, and its reporting practices are not yet fully compliant with
the International Financial Reporting Standards. The lack of a reliable classification of deposits by
residency complicates the balance of payments analysis.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments (BoP) statistics are weak. There are deficiencies in the
current account (unrecorded exports, uncertainty with respect to the estimates of private sector
services, workers’ remittances, and investment income), the capital account (grants), and the
financial account (foreign direct investment, equity investment in the nonbank private sector, and
corporate borrowing abroad). There has been no progress in the implementation of a Foreign
Direct Investment survey. The forms and the reporting requirements for banks and nonbanks were
amended in January 2010 to include a more comprehensive and detailed breakdown of BoP
components. The lack of effective inter-agency cooperation and staff constraints at both the BdL
and CAS are among the main factors impeding progress.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination
System since January 2003. Metadata and the
plans for improving the real and fiscal statistics
need to be updated.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA
Lebanon currently reports annual data based on GFSM 2001 to be published in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook, but the data suffer from weaknesses, mainly limited coverage. The
reporting of monetary data to STA is irregular, though the MCD country team receives them on a
timely basis. In September 2011, the BdL started submitting to STA core Financial Soundness
Indicators data and metadata; data for 2011 have been posted on the IMF website.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Lebanon
On January 23, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Lebanon. 1
Background
Lebanon’s economy lost momentum after four years of impressive economic growth. The fall of
the coalition government in January 2011, and prolonged talks over the make-up of the new
government until its formation in June, shook market confidence. Compounded with the regional
unrest, this led to an economic downturn. Growth is expected to drop to 1–2 percent in 2011
from 8 percent on average during 2007–10, with real estate, tourism, retail and wholesale
trade—key drivers of recent high growth—having been hit hard. Headline inflation averaged
5 percent in 2011, though core inflation remained moderate. Real Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) could grow at 3–4 percent in 2012 but this hinges on strong domestic policies and an
improved regional environment. Downside risks are large, mostly because of the uprising in
Syria, further escalation of which could have serious political and economic repercussions on
Lebanon. Lebanon is also facing risks related to the worsening outlook in Europe, primarily
through second-round effects.
The authorities have so far managed the downturn skillfully, using buffers built up during the
upswing. The Banque du Liban (BdL) relied on its large foreign reserves to intervene forcefully
when the Lebanese pound came under pressure from deposit outflows and currency
conversions in January 2011. Despite these interventions, gross foreign reserves increased to
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

$32 billion by end-November 2011 as the BdL issued foreign currency Certificates of Deposit
and banks placed large foreign currency excess reserves with the BdL. The improved fiscal
position—thanks to the marked decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio since 2006 and the sizeable
primary surplus in 2010—freed up room for an accommodative fiscal stance in 2011. Tax
revenue dropped in 2011, reflecting the downturn and a reduction in the fuel excise. Overall
revenue though should increase slightly as a share of GDP because of the transfer of
telecommunications revenues to the budget. With primary spending up, the primary surplus is
expected to fall to about one percent of GDP from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2010. The government
continues to have favorable access to the foreign currency debt market, but the BdL covered
shortfalls in demand for domestic T-bills.
The banking sector has accumulated buffers but is facing an increasingly challenging
environment. Thanks to prudent management and conservative regulation, banks report capital
above the regulatory minimum, high liquidity buffers, low levels of nonperforming loans and
stable profits. However, the recent expansion abroad exposes banks to heightened risks from
the regional turmoil. Deposit inflows resumed in March following outflows and currency
conversions after the fall of the government in January 2011, and are growing at an annualized
rate of 9 percent. With pound deposits picking up recently, deposit dollarization is on a
downward trend though still above its end-2010 level. Sovereign and Credit Default Swaps
(CDS) spreads have risen broadly in line with emerging market averages.
The economy became more resilient in recent years thanks to a marked reduction in the
government debt-to-GDP ratio and a build-up of large foreign reserves. Still, government debt at
134 percent of GDP at end-October 2011 remains among the highest in the world and gives rise
to large recurrent financing needs. The large banking sector funds itself from short-term
deposits to roll over its large exposure to the sovereign, exposing itself to a maturity mismatch.
Continued nonresident deposit inflows are also needed to finance persistent and large current
account deficits. At the same time, the ongoing unrest in the region brought to fore the need to
address the important issues of unemployment and social inequality.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that domestic political uncertainty and regional unrest eroded market
confidence in 2011, bringing an end to Lebanon’s four-year spell of impressive economic
growth. They commended the authorities for skillfully managing the downturn using buffers built
during the upswing.
Looking ahead, Directors noted that downside risks are high due to the uprising in Syria, the
uncertain outlook for the region, and the financial crisis in Europe. Also, underlying
vulnerabilities remain large, especially those stemming from the high government debt and the
continuing current account deficit. Against this background, Directors agreed that near-term
policies should aim at instilling confidence and preserving macroeconomic stability. Over the
medium term, the main challenge is to generate sustained and inclusive growth while reducing
vulnerabilities.

3
Directors underscored the need to maintain fiscal discipline in 2012 and beyond. They
suggested that contingency measures be incorporated in the 2012 budget in case downside
risks materialize. Directors supported the authorities’ intention to embed the 2012 budget into a
medium-term agenda so as to facilitate prioritization. They agreed that the medium-term fiscal
strategy should target a significant reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio, while creating space for
higher social and capital spending and making fiscal policy more equitable. This will require
effective implementation of revenue administration and tax measures, tighter expenditure
controls and better targeted social spending, and expenditure rationalization with improved
public financial management.
Directors noted that the government needs to reduce its reliance on central bank financing and
to finance itself fully from the market. To this end, they supported greater but prudent use of
foreign currency borrowing by the government in the near term. Directors also noted that
increasing interest rates on T-bills with maturities of less than 7 years would make them more
attractive to banks. Some Directors, however, cautioned about the fiscal and economic impact
of higher interest rates.
Directors agreed that the currency peg is central to the financial stability of Lebanon’s highly
dollarized economy, and should be backed by strengthening competitiveness. They cautioned
that wage increases beyond productivity gains could pose problems for competitiveness.
Directors also underscored the need for a medium-term plan to improve the central bank’s
balance sheet.
Directors noted that the banking sector has accumulated buffers, and that banking indicators
appear to be sound. Nevertheless, large cross-border exposures and an increasingly
challenging domestic and regional environment have heightened banking risks. Directors
recommended continued vigilance, and welcomed plans to further strengthen bank regulation
and supervision, including cross-border supervision, and to implement Basel III regulations.
They encouraged the authorities to focus on early problem detection through enhanced
stress-testing and improved loan classification and provisioning, and to continue strengthening
the regime against money laundering and terrorism financing.
Directors recommended that the authorities implement a medium-term strategy that aims at
sustained, broad-based growth and employment generation. This would require launching
long-delayed reforms to develop the infrastructure, improve the business climate, and remove
labor market inefficiencies. In this regard, Directors welcomed the planned investment in the
electricity sector, but stressed that reforms should proceed in parallel to reduce the large
budgetary transfers to the sector.
Directors urged the authorities to move decisively to improve Lebanon’s statistical system.

Statement by Mr. Shaalan on Lebanon
Executive Board Meeting
January 23, 2012
On behalf of the Lebanese authorities, I would like to thank staff for the valuable policy
discussions during the 2011 Article IV Consultation. The authorities also wish to express
their appreciation for the continued provision of effective technical assistance.
Recent Developments and Outlook
The Lebanese economy lost momentum in 2011 amidst difficult domestic and regional
conditions. GDP growth is expected to fall to 1–2 percent in 2011 from 8 percent on average
over the preceding four years. This deterioration could have been much more pronounced
given negative spillovers from developments in the region, particularly Syria, with whom
political and economic links are very close. However, the prudent policies that have been
followed over a number of years, which led to the build-up of fiscal and foreign reserve
buffers, provided the authorities with the policy space needed to support the economy and
limit adverse impacts.
The authorities remain fully committed to policies that ensure macroeconomic stability while
addressing infrastructure bottlenecks and improving social conditions. This would help to
pave the way for higher, sustainable, and inclusive growth. The authorities are well aware of
the risks facing the economy. These pertain mainly to the difficult regional environment, as
well as to the large gross public financing requirements related to the high public debt ratio.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
The draft budget for 2012 aims at balancing essential spending needs with stability goals.
The authorities view the relaxation of the budget as temporary and needed to meet pressing
infrastructure and social needs. The budget envisages a significant increase in capital
spending, notably in needed electricity production. It also provides for an increase in public
wages and allowances, which has been approved by the Cabinet in December but whose
magnitude and modalities are still under discussion. The authorities are cognizant of the need
to finance the envisaged increase in current spending with recurrent revenues or permanent
savings elsewhere. Substantial tax measures are planned, which include an increase in the
VAT rate, an increase in the withholding tax on interest and the introduction of a fee on real
estate sales. The authorities remain fully committed to fiscal consolidation and debt reduction
in the medium term.
Further progress has been made in the area of budgetary reforms, notably with the ongoing
modernization of revenue administration and public financial management, as well as work
on embedding fiscal priorities in a medium-term fiscal framework.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
Monetary policy has helped to bolster confidence in the Lebanese financial system, with the
exchange rate peg providing a firm anchor for financial stability. Despite intervention by the
Banque du Liban (BdL) in support of the Lebanese pound, holding interest rates stable in the
midst of strong regional and domestic uncertainty has helped maintain market confidence
over the past year. The authorities are fully aware of the costs for the BdL’s balance sheet
and foreign reserves. Nonetheless, while they are keen to reduce the Treasury’s reliance on
the BdL, they do not concur with staff’s recommendation to raise interest rates on Treasury
bills with maturities of less than 7 years. In the current turbulent times, confidence is
paramount, and the authorities are concerned that raising interest rates would risk
undermining depositor confidence. Moreover, the recent pick-up in Lebanese pound deposit
inflows is expected to increase demand for Treasury bills. The reduction in the government’s
financing needs in 2012, as well as the potential parliamentary approval for new foreign
currency borrowing, is also expected to reduce reliance on BdL financing.
Banking Sector
Effective banking regulation and supervision, coupled with conservative bank funding, asset
structures, and management, have allowed the banking sector to build buffers. Lebanese
banks report capital above the regulatory minimum, high liquidity buffers, low levels of
nonperforming loans and stable profits. Lebanese banks are well-placed to implement Basel
III and work in this direction is ongoing. The authorities intend to introduce supervisory
colleges to strengthen the oversight of cross-border activities of the largest banks. This would
include annual group audits and assessing risks, capital, and liquidity within the group. Work
on enhancing the framework on anti-money laundering and combating the financing of
terrorism is also ongoing.
Structural Reforms
Economic and social reforms, particularly in the electricity, water, telecommunications and
social protection sectors, rank high on the authorities’ agenda. These reforms are essential for
sustainable and inclusive growth, as well as improved competitiveness. To accelerate the
design and implementation of their reform agenda, the authorities are cooperating with the
World Bank in specific areas. These comprise (i) creating a competitive business
environment, (ii) improving basic infrastructure services, (iii) ensuring a quality public
education system, (iv) creating an expanded, sustainable and inclusive social protection
system—including social safety nets, pensions, health insurance, and other forms of income
protection for the most vulnerable—and (v) public finance management reform.
