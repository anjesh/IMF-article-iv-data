Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation and
Request for a Stand-By Arrangement
Prepared by the African Department
(in consultation with other departments)
Approved by Thomas Krueger (AFR) and Philip Gerson (SPR)
October 31, 2008
Missions: Victoria, January 17–30, July 26-August 4, and September 5-19, and at headquarters
October 9-15, 2008. Staff met with President Michel, Minister of Finance Faure, Minister of
National Development Dugasse, Governor of the Central Bank of Seychelles Chang Leng,
other senior government officials, and representatives of the private sector, civil society, and
the diplomatic community.
January mission: Mr. Funke (head), Mr. Koehler, Ms. Medina Cas (all AFR), and Mr. Zeuner
(PDR). Mr. Murray (Executive Director) and Ms. Tracey Lane (World Bank) participated in
some of the policy discussions. July mission: Mr. Mathieu (head), Ms. Medina Cas (all AFR),
Mr. Nielsen (PDR) and Mr. Duggan (OED). September mission: Mr. Mathieu (head),
Ms. Deléchat, Ms. Medina Cas, Mr. Fernandez (all AFR), Mr. Atoyan (PDR), Mr. Baban
(LEG), Ms. Polan, Mr. Bartholomew (both MCM). Mr. Rogers, Senior Resident
Representative in Nairobi, Mr. Plant (AFR), Mr. Blitzer (MCM), and Mr. Duggan (OED)
participated in part of the meetings.
At the last Article IV consultation, (for 2006 on March 23, 2007), Directors encouraged the
authorities to implement more thorough reforms, in order to reduce vulnerabilities decisively
and enhance growth prospects and competitiveness. They observed that exchange market
liberalization could set the stage for the elimination of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions that are subject to Fund approval under
Article VIII, and they looked forward to further progress in this area.
The authorities are requesting a two-year SBA with access at 200 percent of quota
(SDR 17.6 million), frontloaded with an initial disbursement of 70 percent of quota to cover
remaining financing needs for 2008, available upon approval of the arrangement. The program
aims at restoring macroeconomic stability through (i) a fundamental liberalization of the
exchange regime supported by a reform of the monetary policy framework; (ii) a significant
and sustained fiscal tightening complemented by a comprehensive debt restructuring; and
(iii) reinforced governance and a reduced role of the state in the economy.
Seychelles accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4. The de facto
exchange regime was a peg to a single currency until a managed float was announced on
October 31, effective November 3, 2008, at which time the remaining restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions subject to Fund
jurisdiction under Article VIII were eliminated.
A safeguards assessment mission was conducted in September 2008. It found high risks in all
areas of the central bank (CBS) safeguards assessment framework, including significant
weaknesses in financial reporting that were not identified by the external auditor and internal
control vulnerabilities. The authorities agreed to implement remedial measures, including the
rapid hiring of new external auditors, and steps to be monitored under the program.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Seychelles is in the midst of an acute balance of payments and public debt crisis, which
jeopardizes its high living standards and economic development. Large macroeconomic
imbalances and vulnerabilities resulting from longstanding unsustainable macroeconomic
policies, combined with recent external shocks, culminated in mid 2008 with the nearexhaustion of foreign reserves and missed payments on public debt obligations. Growth is
declining and inflation has risen sharply. The pegged exchange rate that was incompatible
with fundamentals, together with a complex system of exchange restrictions and controls, has
resulted in economic dislocation, a parallel exchange market, and pervasive dollarization.
The authorities have requested Fund assistance in support of a comprehensive reform
strategy. Acknowledging that past piecemeal reform efforts have been insufficient to address
imbalances and vulnerabilities, the authorities have begun implementing a package of major
macroeconomic and structural reforms, including:
•
A fundamental liberalization of the exchange regime, involving the elimination of all
exchange restrictions and a float of the rupee;
•
A significant and sustained tightening of fiscal policy backed by a reduction in public
employment and the replacement of indirect subsidies by a targeted social safety net;
•
A reform of the monetary policy framework to focus on liquidity management based
on indirect instruments; and
•
A reduction in the role of the state in the economy to boost private sector
development, through further privatization, enhanced fiscal governance, and a review
of the tax regime.
However, to put public debt on a sustainable path, the reform effortnotwithstanding
its strengthwill need to be complemented by a comprehensive public debt
restructuring involving asubstantial reduction in the debt service burden consistent
with the long-term ability to pay .
The reforms are heavily frontloaded, with the bulk of the fiscal adjustment and other
key measures implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008. The turnaround in the primary
fiscal balance from 2007 is about 8 percent of GDP in 2008, with sustained primary surpluses
of about 6½ percent through 2011. Fiscal reforms also include the removal of tax
exemptions, a strengthening of tax administration and of public financial management.
A comprehensive structural reform effort is needed to sustain growth and
competitiveness over the medium-term. Together with Fund staff, the World Bank, and
other partners, the authorities intend to elaborate a well-articulated medium-term structural
reform agenda in 2009 and have indicated their intention to seek later support for these
reforms under a successor EFF arrangement.
In view of the strength of the proposed policies, staff recommends approval of the
authorities’ request for Fund support of their reform efforts through a two-year SBA in
the amount of SDR 17.6 million (200 percent of quota).

5
I. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Seychelles is in the midst of an acute balance of payments and public debt crisis,
which jeopardizes its high living standards and economic development. Expansionary
fiscal and monetary policies have been incompatible with the maintenance of the pegged
exchange rate for some years and despite step devaluations in 2006-07. A system of complex
exchange controls and restrictions were progressively introduced and foreign exchange
shortages ensued. The parallel exchange market flourished (the parallel market premium was
over 50 percent) and dollarization rose. Competitiveness and growth deteriorated as the real
effective exchange rate exchange became increasingly overvalued (Figure 1).
2.
The authorities introduced a number of reforms starting in 2003 with a fiscal
adjustment and a gradual liberalization of the economy. In October 2006, they issued a
US$200 million Eurobond and began a sizable depreciation of the rupee over the next twelve
months. In 2007, the authorities launched the medium-term development plan “Seychelles
Strategy 2017”, aiming at a doubling of nominal per-capita income in ten years and a
reduction of public debt to 60 percent of GDP. In late 2007 they issued a private placement
note for €54.7 million and a US$30 million supplement to the Eurobond to pay for the
clearance of the backlog of unremitted profits by foreign investors.
3.
However, the gradual and piecemeal reform effort has been insufficient to
address longstanding macroeconomic imbalances. The fuel and food price shocks and the
global economic slowdown exacerbated existing vulnerabilities (Table 1):
•

Foreign exchange shortages─disrupting manufacturing output─and less buoyant
tourism growth are expected to lead to a sharp decline in real GDP growth in 2008,
to 3.1 percent from an average of about 7.5 percent of GDP in 2005-07.

•

Inflation has risen rapidly, in part as a result of the 2006-07 nominal depreciation of
the rupee, up to 37.5 percent (year-on-year) at end-August 2008, compared to 5.2 percent in August 2007, and virtually zero in 2005-06.

•

The external current account deficit is projected to widen in 2008, from 23 percent of
GDP in 2007 to almost 29 percent, due to lower growth in tourism receipts, the
petroleum an food price shock, and higher costs of transportation services. As of midOctober official reserves had fallen to about US$14 million, and the balance of
payments is increasingly financed by external arrears accumulation (Table 2).

4.
In light of these developments, in 2008 the authorities began to tighten fiscal and
monetary policy:
•

The 2008 budget has been implemented broadly as approved, and further tightened in
October, implying a substantial correction (Table 3). Compared to a 2.3 percent
deficit in 2007, the primary surplus is now projected at 5.6 percent of GDP in 2008
(excluding a 1.5 percent of GDP transfer of valuation gains from the central bank).

6
•

In June 2008, the Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) raised reserve requirements
significantly. However, the local asset ratio (LAR─met only by holding domestic
treasury securities) was reduced, offsetting in part the increase in reserve
requirements. Broad money growth remained high at end-September 2008
(20.4 percent, year-on-year) (Table 4).

5.
At almost 151 percent of GDP, public debt is unsustainable. External public debt
represents some 98 percent of GDP (US$808 million), of which some US$313 million is
arrears, mostly to Paris Club creditors and on the privately placed amortizing notes that the
authorities stopped servicing in July 2008 (Tables 5 and 6). There is a small amount of
arrears (US$2.2 million) to multilateral creditors. In October 2008, facing near exhaustion of
international reserves, the authorities announced that they would not be able to make a
coupon payment on the US$230 million of Eurobond, and indicated that they would
approach creditors to seek an agreement on a comprehensive debt restructuring. Standard and
Poor’s has downgraded Seychelles to SD (selective default).
6.
Commercial banks are adequately capitalized and have long net open positions
in foreign exchange, but are vulnerable to interest rate and credit default risk. As of
end-June 2008, banking industry assets totaled about SR 8.8 billion (113 percent of GDP).
Domestic lending accounted for only about 25 percent of assets with most funds invested
abroad (34 percent), and in domestic government securities (24 percent). Bank regulatory
capital, measured on the most stringent capitalization measure—capital net of all provisions
for loan loss and intangibles—stood at 5.6 percent of net assets─40 basis points short of
being considered well capitalized. However, banks’ large exposure to government securities
makes them highly vulnerable to declines in the values of those investments. Whereas
industry capital as of June 30, 2008, covered about 22 percent of holdings of government
securities, three banks had coverage of only 11-14 percent (Table 7).

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Overview
7.
A strong political consensus in favor of a coherent reform effort emerged in mid2008. Previous Article IV consultation discussions have highlighted Seychelles’ significant
vulnerabilities, including from an overvalued exchange rate, and recommended a
comprehensive reform effort but at the time the authorities favored a more gradual approach.
President Michel’s popular mandate, support from the ruling party’s electoral base and a
broad-based realization that the current policies are unsustainable have given the government
the needed support to break with the past.
8.
Program discussions focused on a package of policies aiming at restoring
internal and external stability, with strong ownership on the part of the authorities. In
particular, the authorities are committed to implementing far-reaching reforms to resolve the
longstanding macroeconomic imbalances, address an overvalued exchange rate, and place
public debt on a sustainable path. The key elements of the program are the following:
•

Achieve full convertibility of the Seychelles rupee and introduce a floating exchange
rate regime. The removal of all exchange restrictions and introduction of a marketbased float of the rupee will play a key role in the improvement of external
competitiveness and reduction in macroeconomic imbalances.

•

Sustain a significant fiscal tightening to address the macroeconomic imbalances,
underpin competitiveness gains and put public debt on a sustainable path.

•

Reform monetary policy to focus on liquidity management with market-based
instruments. A floating exchange rate regime places increased emphasis on monetary
policy to achieve price stability. At the same time, maintaining financial system
stability in the aftermath of the reforms will require enhanced bank supervision.

•

Reduce the role of the state in the economy and improve the business environment.
Steps to boost private sector investment and growth include privatization, the
strengthening of monitoring and oversight of public entities; and enhancing
transparency and governance.

9.
However, these fundamental policy reforms are not sufficient in themselves to
put Seychelles’ public debt on a sustainable footing. Paris Club creditors have informally
indicated their willingness to considering treatment of Seychelles’ debt under the Evian
approach. The authorities are working on a debt restructuring strategy which would be
consistent with Fund’s lending into arrears policy, with focus on information transparency,
intercreditor equity, and dialogue with all creditor groups. A large cash flow relief on
external public debt service is needed in 2009-11. Regarding domestic debt, largely held by
the domestic banking system and CBS, there is limited margin to absorb a nominal haircut.

9
B. Macroeconomic Framework
10.
The medium-term macroeconomic framework is based on full implementation of
the policies envisaged under the program (Text Table 1).
•

The global downturn and tight macroeconomic policies will lead to a contraction of
GDP in 2009, by about 0.5 percent. A recovery is projected to emerge thereafter with
average real GDP growth of about 5 percent from 2011, under the impulse of rising
foreign investment in tourism following the lifting of exchange restrictions and other
bottlenecks.

•

The rupee depreciation following the float is expected to lead in the short-run to
higher inflation, which would peak in the second quarter of 2009 and gradually
decline to 22 percent at end-2009. The REER would depreciate on average in 2009,
followed by a small appreciation.

•

Together with a temporary decline in FDI-related imports, the rupee depreciation is
projected to significantly improve the non-interest current account deficit in 2009 to
16.4 percent, from 26.6 percent in 2008. The non-interest current account deficit
should widen moderately over the medium term, as rising tourism earnings are offset
by higher tourism- and FDI- related imports and greater profit and dividend
repatriation. The program envisages relatively rapid accumulation of official foreign
reserves, albeit from a very low base of 0.5 weeks of imports in 2008 to 10.4 weeks
by 2011 (Table 8).

•

Without a debt restructuring, total public debt would increase to 161 percent of GDP
in 2009 and remain at unsustainably high levels over the medium term. Domestic
debt would be expected to decline through a combination of fiscal restraint and the
impact of negative real rates in 2008, especially on long term securities with fixed
coupons. With extremely limited debt servicing capacity for 2009-11 and
unsustainable public debt levels, a comprehensive official and private debt
restructuring is needed to close financing gaps and put medium-term debt on a
sustainable path (Section C and DSA supplement).

•

Downside risks to the outlook have risen. The main upside risks would come from
faster declines in world food and fuel prices, which would contribute to lower
projected inflation and reduce the current account deficit. However, uncertainty about
the monetary transmission mechanism and weak instruments could hamper CBS’
control of inflation. Furthermore, a global slowdown will dampen growth and widen
the current account deficit through lower tourism receipts and FDI growth. FDI
projections are based on conservative assumptions about implementation of the
existing pipeline of projects, mostly hotels. Tight credit conditions in advanced and
emerging economies may affect FDI financing and delay implementation. However,
due to the high import content of FDI (85 percent) and assumptions about profit
repatriation, FDI’s balance of payments impact is modest.

The CBS transferred SR 175 million (2.2 percent of GDP) in profit to the government in March 2008. Of this amount SR 118.7 million (1.5 percent of GDP)
percent of GDP) was revaluation gains. Given this correction, the primary surplus would be 5.6 percent of GDP in 2008.

C. Exchange Regime Reform and Exchange Rate Policy
11.
Staff and the authorities agreed that a fundamental liberalization of the
exchange regime and the rate-determination mechanism are critical to restore
credibility in the rupee and eliminate the parallel market (MEFP ¶14-15). Staff’s analysis
suggests that, as of mid-2008, the exchange rate remained significantly overvalued,
notwithstanding the 2006-07 step devaluations (Box 1 and Figure 3). Indications are that the
parallel exchange rate has remained fairly stable at a premium above the official rate (about
55 percent lately), but dollarization has been rising rapidly in recent years (Figure 2). Staff is
of the view that given the lack of credibility in the peg, the near-exhaustion of external
reserves, a significant parallel market, a managed float of the rupee was the only alternative,
at least in the short-term. This does not prejudge what the appropriate long-run exchange rate
regime for Seychelles would be. Various options, including full dollarization or euroization,
or a currency board, have their merits for a small open economy such as Seychelles and will
be carefully assessed once the economy has stabilized. A large step devaluation did not
appear feasible given the difficulty of assessing the magnitude of adjustment needed and the
CBS’very limited ability to defend the new rate.

The authorities indicated a strong determination to removing all exchange
restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII and other exchange
measures, in a clear break with past policies. In particular, requirements to surrender
foreign exchange earnings and to pay for certain transactions and taxes in foreign exchange
were repealed on October 31, effective November 3. With the elimination of these measures,
the exchange system is free of restrictions on both current and capital transactions.
Remaining restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII have disappeared.
13.
The authorities are committed to limit their interventions in the foreign
exchange market to smoothing excessive volatility, preserving orderly market
conditions and supporting the reserve accumulation objective. With technical assistance
from the Fund, the authorities have established a platform at the CBS for interbank foreign
exchange trading. Initially, trading will be supported by a manual book-entry system, with
the view to moving to a real-time gross settlement system over the coming year. In parallel,
supervision of commercial banks’ risk management and FX trading practices will be
strengthened, to ensure that they promptly establish internal rules based on international best
practices. To stimulate competition in the foreign exchange market new foreign exchange
bureaus will be licensed.
14.
The authorities are aware of the risks associated with a large exchange rate
depreciation and are ready to take necessary supporting measures. Maintaining an
appropriately tight monetary and, particularly, fiscal policies will be key to anchor the move
to a floating regime. A remaining overhang of unrepatriated profits and dividends by foreign
firms, subsequent to the late-2007 clearing, may put pressure on the exchange rate initially.
Given the initial low level of official reserves, vulnerabilities to further unfavorable external
developments would remain high for some time.

Box 1. Seychelles: External Stability and Exchange Rate Assessment
In spite of some competitiveness gains stemming from the 2006-07 step devaluations of the fixed exchange
rate, most indicators continue to point to a significant overvaluation of the real effective exchange rate
(REER) in mid-2008. By end-June 2008, the REER had depreciated by about 38 percent since its peak in January
2003. However, the current account deficit widened markedly from 2007, external arrears have grown rapidly,

The 2008 underlying current account deficit (21.1 percent of GDP) excludes the net impact of the peak in food

Competitiveness indicators paint a more mixed picture but overall indicate that a combination of exchange
rate adjustment and structural improvement in the business environment would be needed (see Figure 3).

D. Restoring Public Debt Sustainability
Fiscal Policy
15.
A sustained fiscal tightening is critical to anchor a floating exchange rate and to
place public debt on a sustainable path. After a large adjustment in 2008, primary
surpluses of 6.5 percent of GDP on average are programmed in 2009-11.1 The authorities’
fiscal strategy rests on a combination of expenditure restraint, revenue enhancement,
strengthened public financial management, and public sector reform, including further
privatization of public enterprises (MEFP ¶18). The World Bank is conducting a Public
Expenditure Review with the objective of helping the authorities raise the efficiency of
health and education spending, as well as prepare an agenda for civil service, social security,
and public enterprise

commitment to tighten the fiscal stance (Text Table 2).
16.
The 2009 budget will aim at a primary surplus achieved through savings on
transfers and subsidies, a decline in the wage bill, and a rise in tax revenues. The impact
of the exchange rate depreciation is expected to be only moderately positive on the budget
given the high share of imports in spending. Fiscal adjustment is somewhat back loaded in
2009 owing to the frontloading of the contingency for potential recapitalization needs for the
public financial institutions, the seasonality of revenue collections, and staffing redundancy
payments in the first quarter.2 Expenditure measures focus on:
•

The replacement of indirect product subsidies by a targeted, modernized social safety
net is an essential part of the authorities’ strategy to mitigate the negative social

This fiscal path is in line with the experience of large fiscal adjustments in small states where the fiscal effort

impact of the policy reforms, and should produce net budgetary savings in 2009
(MEFP ¶20).
•

Implementation of a voluntary and involuntary departure scheme is expected to
reduce the number of public sector employees by 12.5 percent by end 2008. Together
with moderate wage increases, this should lead to a significant reduction of the wage
bill (MEFP ¶23).

17.
On the revenue side, staff welcomed the authorities’ strategy of moving toward a
simplified and harmonized tax system, while strengthening revenue administration. As
a first step, some tax exemptions have been removed, and discretionary powers to grant
exemptions have been eliminated. In spite of adjustments for inflation (MEFP ¶19), overall
non-tax revenue is projected to decline in 2009 and 2010 because of lower dividend
payments from public enterprises and a decline in the statutory transfer from the central
bank.3 Importantly, the authorities are committed to a fundamental review of the tax regime
with IMF technical assistance.
Toward A Comprehensive Debt Restructuring Strategy
18.
The authorities, assisted by financial and legal advisors, are elaborating a
comprehensive debt restructuring strategy to put public debt back on a sustainable
path.
•

The fiscal effort envisaged under the program aims at a significant reduction in the
stock of domestic debt, the value of which is being eroded by negative real interest
rates in 2008, especially on the long-term maturities with fixed coupons. Given the
domestic banks’ exposure to government securities (almost 45 percent of assets) and
vulnerability to higher default risk under the program, staff and the authorities agreed
that banks would not be in a position to take a further significant haircut on
government securities.

•

Public debt is projected to remain unsustainable over the medium-term in the absence
of debt restructuring, even assuming full implementation of all program reforms
(Table 9 and Supplement 1). Seychelles’ debt is among the highest in the world and
far higher than in other small states (Figure 4). The restructuring strategy is
predicated on securing significant cash flow relief in the short to medium-term and a
debt burden consistent with long-term payments capacity. The authorities have
already engaged in preliminary consultations with Paris Club creditors, who have
indicated a willingness to consider Seychelles’ debt under the Evian approach. Debt
reconciliation efforts are under way, and debt stock data may well be revised. A
census of commercial debt holders has been launched, but the wide dispersion of

16
holdings and the current financial market turmoil may lengthen the identification
process and negotiations with commercial creditors. Discussions with commercial
and other official creditors are planned to begin in November 2008.

19.
The staff’s preliminary debt sustainability analysis (DSA, Supplement 1) clearly
shows that public debt is unsustainable. Under a baseline scenario assuming new
borrowing on commercial terms to refinance arrears and close financing gaps, external debt
reaches 165 percent of GDP by 2018. Bounds tests clearly show that it is also highly
vulnerable to all standard shocks.
20.
Given the magnitude of Seychelles’ debt burden, a comprehensive debt
restructuring involving a substantial reduction in the debt service burden consistent
with Seychelles' long-term ability to pay will be needed to restore debt sustainability.
Moreover, staff’s preliminary analysis suggests that even with a sharp present value
reduction of the public debt burden, Seychelles is likely to remain highly vulnerable to a
wide variety of shocks for an extended period of time. Staff believes that there are reasonable
expectations that a restructuring of the public debt consistent with Seychelles’ payments
capacity is possible. Staff expects to present a more comprehensive sustainability analysis on
the basis of an updated medium-term outlook, at the time of the first program and financing
review.
21.
The authorities are committed to strengthening public debt management (MEFP
¶17). A new Public Debt Law will define a legal framework for debt management and
operations will be strengthened with IMF technical assistance. Debt and recording systems
need to be enhanced, together with the public financial management framework, to ensure
that no new external or domestic arrears are accumulated. The Public Debt Management
Committee will closely monitor parastatal borrowing. Priority areas for technical assistance
include communication and coordination between various bodies responsible for public debt,
reporting and auditing, improving operational risk procedures (data records and audits,
operational manuals), and managing contingent liabilities (such as guarantees on parastatal
debt).
E. Reforming Monetary Policy and Maintaining Financial Sector Stability
Monetary Policy Framework
22.
The CBS attaches priority to reforming monetary policy, a key element to
securing price stability and supporting a successful move to a floating regime. The
ability of the central bank to contain monetary expansion has been limited to date, reflecting
the pegged exchange rate regime, fiscal dominance and─until recently─the absence of
indirect instruments of monetary control. In preparing for the float of the rupee, the
authorities have established weekly auctions for short-term commercial bank deposits at the
CBS and for 91-day Treasury bills. Banks are actively participating in the market and the
beginnings of a yield curve are emerging (Text Table 3). Higher market-determined interest
rates will be crucial to limit the extent of exchange rate overshooting, following the move to
a floating regime. As part of the reform, the CBS is committed to regularly communicate
policy changes and implementation to the market (MEFP ¶27-28)

The monetary program is based on a quarterly reserve money target. Staff
considers that a monetary aggregate target is the most viable nominal anchor for Seychelles
(as compared to an interest rate or inflation target) due to the low level of financial market
development and very recent liberalization of interest rates. However, the stability of the
money multipliers is likely to be affected by the exchange regime switch, as indicated by the
2006-07 devaluation episode (Figure 5) and staff will closely monitor developments.

24.
The program envisages that the velocity of circulation will rise initially as will
the money multiplier, implying the need to maintain very tight reign on reserves money
in the period around the float of the currency. As confidence in the new regime, with the
support of tight fiscal policy and likely much higher market-based interest rates, there will be
room for some recovery in liquidity growth and credit to the economy. A key challenge to
the conduct of monetary policy, particularly at the onset of the float, will be uncertainty
about the monetary transmission mechanism, and a considerable amount of “learning by
doing” will be needed. In particular, close cooperation between Treasury and the CBS is
essential for improving liquidity management.

19
25.
Staff agreed with the authorities that the continuation of the substantial IMF
technical assistance to the CBS would be necessary to support the reform effort. In
particular, staff strongly supports the authorities’ request for a long-term monetary advisor to
help them deal with the transition from a fixed to floating exchange rate regime. Fund
technical assistance will also be necessary to support other key reform areas, including
establishing and automating the interbank market for securities, bank deposits and foreign
exchange; introducing a reserve money monetary framework; strengthening bank
supervision; and reinforcing CBS governance and transparency in light of the
recommendations from the September 2008 safeguards assessment mission.
26.
The authorities are committed to addressing the high risk areas identified by the
recent safeguards assessment mission. The authorities have recently issued a tender for
new external auditors to begin with the 2008 accounts in compliance with international audit
standards. The Ministry of Finance and CBS will sign by end-December 2008 a
memorandum of understanding strengthening and formalizing the terms and conditions under
which the CBS transacts on behalf of government. A revision of the CBS act to strengthen
governance and accountability will be implemented with Fund technical assistance and is a
condition for completion of the first program review (MEFP ¶30).
Financial Sector Stability
27.
The large changes to monetary and exchange policies pose a significant
adjustment challenge in the short term for the financial system. Staff discussed various
measures that the authorities could implement to mitigate the risk for the stability of the
financial system during the transition. Based on financial analysis and stress testing, the
major risk confronting banks comes from expected increases in default rates on bank loans
(Figure 6 and Box 2). Banks are well positioned for first round effects of changes in interest
rates (as their loans are effectively variable rate) and exchange rate depreciation (due to their
large net open positions). Both of these changes, however, will impact some borrowers’
ability to service their loans and lead to higher default rates. Estimating the impact of both
FX depreciation and heightened interest rates is problematic. One way to judge the risk,
however, is to calculate the coverage bank capital after first round effects can withstand
second round effects. After adjusting bank capital for credit risk, the possible consequences
of higher interest rates and the exchange rate leave banks with capital coverage of 27 to
34 percent of their loan portfolio. Distribution of this risk is fairly even. Banks also have
some interest rate risk from their holdings of government bonds, although one third of these
are due to mature within one year.
28.
The program includes contingencies to cushion for the impact of increased
default risk on bank capitalization. In addition to CBS liquidity support, the 2009 budget
includes a specific contingency for the potential recapitalization needs of government-owned
financial institutions. It is important to note that the CBS does not have experience handling
bank failure and MCM TA on supervisory intervention and failed bank resolution has not yet
been delivered.

20
29.
Global financial turbulence may also directly affect the five foreign-owned banks
in Seychelles, through the impact on their parents. Staff encouraged the CBS to closely
coordinate analysis of potential recapitalization costs with the Ministry of Finance.

Box 2. Seychelles: Financial Sector Vulnerabilities and Stress-Testing Results
Stress testing of interest rate increases and rupee depreciation reveals that, while banks are
presently sound, their capitalization may be significantly strained.
First round effects stemming from a depreciation are expected to be positive. Because banks
have long net open positions in foreign currencies, ceteris paribus, a depreciation of the
exchange rate against those currencies improves net capitalization.

Higher interest rates could have negative first and second round effects.
As banks in Seychelles have the capacity to re-price domestic loans as fast as their liabilities, it
is assumed banks can maintain their net interest margins and largely be unaffected from the
first round direct effects of changes in interest rates. The banks cannot re-price all of their
domestic investments, however. For example, treasury bonds have fixed coupons and the stateowned savings bank has some term loans whose rates are fixed. Stress tests show that one bank
would become under-capitalized if treasury bonds were marked-to-market (though not required
in Seychelles). Nevertheless, five of the banks would suffer income losses during a high
interest rate period until their bonds mature (28 percent of the banks’ aggregate bond portfolio
was to mature within one year as of June 30, 2008).
An additional risk comes from second round effects. Banks would achieve maintenance of their
interest margins by increasing interest rates on their customers’ loans, and default rates on
those loans should be expected to increase. As the relationship between default rates and higher
interest rates cannot be forecast accurately with available data, the tolerance of bank capital to
loan losses is calculated.
Altogether, with a 50 percent depreciation, bank industry capital (unadjusted for interest rate
first round shocks) can absorb a 27 percent loss to their loan portfolio before industry capital
were to be exhausted—34 percent with a 125 percent depreciation.
Some government-owned financial institutions would be vulnerable to foreign exchange risks
and to second-round effects of higher interest rates on loan defaults. If loan losses grow to 20
percent of June 2008 loan balances, only one institution is projected to require recapitalization,
with the fiscal cost amounting to about SR 82 million (1 percent of GDP). If loan losses rose to
40 percent, all four government-owned institutions would require recapitalization or resolution,
and the total cost could reach about SR 333 million (4 percent of GDP).

22
F. Structural Reforms
30.
Structural reforms under the SBA-supported program would focus on key areas
to support macroeconomic stabilization. The authorities are also committed to working
with staff and other development partners to develop a more comprehensive structural reform
program that would be implemented over the medium term. Once this work is finalized, the
authorities intend to request a longer-term engagement with the Fund under the Extended
Fund Facility.
Enhancing Fiscal Governance and Transparency
31.
Strengthening the public financial management system is a key priority of the
authorities, and is essential to support and facilitate the fiscal consolidation. The
authorities are committed to implementing the key recommendations of a recent review of
public financial management by an IMF technical assistance mission (MEFP ¶22), including
by strengthening budget preparation, execution, accounting and reporting. Key measures
include:
•

Preparing a medium-term macroeconomic framework aimed at achieving fiscal
sustainability to help frame annual budgets;

•

Including the social security fund and the pension fund in all fiscal analysis and in
presentations, and integrating the current and capital budget process;

•

Setting detailed expenditure ceilings for each ministry and authority and
distinguishing between base-line and new expenditures in budget submissions;

•

Establishing a cash management system and a single treasury account; and

•

Strengthening financial management, reporting and auditing in line ministries.

32.
A fundamental review of tax policy and revenue administration is needed to
eliminate distortions to economic activity and discourage evasion. The current system,
characterized by differentiated and high overall business tax rates, with significant
exemptions, should be harmonized and the base broadened to enhance fairness and improve
compliance. The authorities have requested IMF technical assistance to conduct a
comprehensive diagnostic tax policy and revenue administration review. The review is also
expected to assist with strengthening tax auditing capacity (MEFP ¶24-25).
33.
The authorities are committed to providing a clear, rules-based and transparent
regulatory framework for domestic and foreign investment, and to improving
governance and accountability.

23
•

The authorities are revamping the framework for FDI to provide a more transparent
and level playing field to new investors. 4 The approval of new projects will require
Ministry of Finance vetting and the ability of line ministries to grant tax incentives
will be removed. As a first step, provisions for the granting of new discretionary
exemptions in the trade and business tax acts have been repealed (MEFP ¶32).

•

The authorities are in the process of strengthening the legal framework to enhance
governance and accountability. A Public Officers Ethics Act was adopted in August
2008, which requires full financial disclosure by November 2008 and prohibits
conflicts of interest. A Public Procurement Act will be passed by December 2008,
which will enhance the transparency of bidding procedures (MEFP ¶33).

Reducing the Role of the State in the Economy
34.
The authorities are committed to gradually reduce the size of the public sector,
through civil service reform and further privatization. The public sector in Seychelles is
large even by small-state standards (about 40 percent of total employment), and government
involvement in economic activity is crowding out the private sector. With the World Bank’s
assistance, the government’s public service reform aims at avoiding duplication of functions,
outsourcing to the private sector, and reducing public employment. As of end-2007, public
enterprises represented a net drain on the budget of 2.8 percent of GDP, and government
guarantees on parastatal loans amounted to 5.2 percent of GDP as of mid-2008. The
authorities highlighted their commitment to privatizing a number of public enterprises in
2009 in the trade sector and to avoid retaining minority stakes in these enterprises (MEFP
¶26).
III. DATA ISSUES
35.
Though Seychelles statistics are generally adequate for surveillance, key
macroeconomic statistics need to be improved. In particular, weaknesses in deflator
estimates and foreign trade statistics limit their usefulness for surveillance, economic
analysis, and policy formulation. The country participates in the GDDS and is one of two
pilot countries in AFR for the GFSM 2001 framework for compiling fiscal data. The
authorities are reviewing national accounts data, and are have recently revised up nominal
GDP by some 20 percent, mainly due to improved coverage. The authorities are strongly
encouraged to continue their efforts to improve national statistics and will request technical
assistance from the Fund.

IV. PROGRAM DESIGN, FINANCING AND RISKS
A. Program Design and Monitoring
36.
Quarterly quantitative performance criteria would be set on net international
reserves (NIR), reserve money, and the fiscal primary balance (MEFP Table 1). There
would be a symmetric adjustor on NIR for deviations from projected program financing, and
the usual interdiction on the accumulation of external and domestic arrears. The program
would include a non-zero limit on external borrowing from official creditors for program
financing purposes, and zero sub-ceilings on short-term external borrowing and commercial
external borrowing, respectively.
37.
Access under the two-year SBA is proposed at SDR 17.6 million (200 percent of
quota), with 70 percent of quota disbursed upon approval of the arrangement (Table 9).
This frontloading of access is a reflection of the front-loaded nature of the reform program
and is in consideration of the low level of official reserves as the authorities launch the
fundamental liberalization of the exchange regime and float the currency.
38.
Structural conditionality focuses on macro-critical measures to strengthen fiscal
and CBS governance (MEFP Table 2). Important measures have already been implemented.
These include the upfront fiscal adjustment and fiscal reforms to eliminate subsidies and
reduce exemptions, the liberalization of the exchange regime, and the reform of the monetary
policy framework. The structural performance criterion reflects the authorities’ commitment
to bolstering tax administration on the fiscal adjustment effort, and they have already
announced the measure in the press. The program includes initial steps to address important
weaknesses at the CBS identified by the safeguards assessment conducted in September
2008. The program also includes a requirement for the CBS’s new external auditor to
confirm NIR and reserve money data at each program test date. The first program review will
focus on key areas for program success including a full work plan to address all safeguards
areas (MEFP, ¶ 38).
B. Program Financing
39.
Timely financial support from multilateral and official creditors is critical for
the success of the program as residual financing gaps are significant. The program is
fully financed for 2008. For 2009, the external nonproject financing requirement is expected
to be closed by disbursements from the Fund under the prospective SBA (30 percent of
quota; SDR 2.64 million), from other multilateral creditors such as the World Bank and the
AfDB (US$15 million), and from public debt relief (US$85 million) (Table 10). Financing
assurances reviews will be completed at the time of program reviews (MEFP ¶37).
40.
The proposed program is consistent with the Fund’s arrears policy. Staff have
approached the Paris Club creditors seeking financing assurances aimed at addressing both
liquidity and sustainability issues of Seychelles’ debt under the Evian approach. The
authorities have engaged in discussions with multilateral creditors and plan to clear arrears to

25
those creditors during the program period. The authorities are committed to engaging in
collaborative discussions with private creditors with a view to reaching agreement through an
open and transparent dialogue based on the principle of inter-creditor equity. Staff believes
that there are reasonable expectations that a restructuring of the public debt consistent with
Seychelles’ payments capacity is possible. A census of external commercial creditors has
been launched but the wide dispersion of individual holdings and recent financial market
turmoil may lengthen the identification process and negotiations with commercial creditors.
Staff understands that contacts with commercial creditors are planned in November 2008
(MEFP ¶16).
41.
Indicators of Fund credit suggest Seychelles should not have difficulty meeting
its obligations to the Fund under the proposed arrangement. Seychelles has no
outstanding liabilities to the Fund. Under the proposed two year SBA in an amount of 200
percent of quota, outstanding Fund credit would peak in 2010 at 2.5 percent of exports, or
about 18 percent of projected official reserves (Table 11). Prospective obligations to the Fund
would peak in 2013 at a moderate 0.8 percent of exports or 3.3 percent of projected reserves.
However, a more difficult global economic and financial environment, as well as a more
protracted negotiation process with commercial creditors are major risks to Seychelles
capacity to service its prospective obligations to the Fund
C. Risks
42.
The main risks to the program relate to the external environment, banking
sector vulnerabilities, external financing availability, adjustment fatigue, and
implementation capacity constraints. The global economic slowdown could be worse than
anticipated, with adverse effects on tourism and growth. The impact of the policy change on
commercial banks may be more severe than anticipated and require greater recapitalization.
External financing availability may prove more difficult to mobilize than anticipated, and
global financial turbulences may increase the risk of protracted discussions with private
creditors, and thus compromise program financing. The move to a float will impose a heavy
burden on the CBS and its administrative capacity. The social and political consensus for
reform may wane under the severity of the adjustment, and pressures for fiscal and monetary
relaxation emerge. The staff believes that the authorities are strongly committed to
implementing the program, as demonstrated by the upfront measures already taken, in line
with the understandings and are willing to take additional measures to ensure program
success. In light of these risks, staff proposes quarterly program and financing assurance
reviews.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
The staff welcomes the Seychelles authorities’ commitment to implement a farreaching reform program to address the macroeconomic imbalances that have built-up
over the past decades. Piecemeal reform efforts in recent years have proved insufficient to
address deep-seated distortions and reduce vulnerabilities. However, since mid-2008 a strong
political consensus in favor of a coherent and reform effort has emerged. Of particular

26
importance is the fundamental liberalization of the exchange regime and floating of the
rupee, which addresses longstanding concerns raised during previous consultations and is a
key to program success. The main pillars of the authorities’ program consist of a significant
and sustained fiscal tightening; a reform of the monetary framework; and a reduction of the
role of the state in the economy. This effort will need to be supported by a comprehensive
restructuring of the public debt, which even with the domestic reform efforts would remain
unsustainable.
44.
Staff commends the authorities’ decision to implement a fundamental
liberalization of the exchange regime and allow the rupee to float. The maintenance of a
significantly overvalued exchange rate for several years, aggravated by extensive exchange
restrictions and distortionary regulations, severely constrained the economy. The early
removal of these distortions represents a sea-change for Seychelles and was urgently needed
to restore credibility in the rupee and unify the exchange rates. A market-determined
exchange rate regime in a small open economy poses challenges, especially as the exit from
the peg occurs at a time of crisis and official reserves are virtually exhausted, but there is
little alternative at this juncture and the program includes provisions to contain the risks. The
frontloading of access under the program is a key component of efforts to raise the likelihood
of success.
45.
The authorities’ program includes a significant tightening of fiscal policy, which
will need to sustain substantial primary surpluses over the medium term. The public
sector employment retrenchment exercise, together with the replacement of indirect product
subsidies by a targeted social safety net and removal of tax exemptions, are important policy
reforms. The strong fiscal policy reforms already adopted or soon to be implemented form a
convincing foundation for the proposed fiscal path, which is key to program success.
46.
A major strengthening of the monetary policy framework is underway, notably
in the CBS’s ability to manage liquidity through indirect market-based monetary
intervention. A flexible exchange rate regime places increased emphasis on monetary policy
to achieve price stability. Staff encourages the authorities to maintain their efforts to tighten
liquidity significantly and raise interest rates to positive real levels. Allowing domestic
interest rates to rise to market determined levels is especially important in the effort to
contain any potential overshooting in the nominal exchange rate, given the very limited
ability to intervene in the foreign exchange market, should conditions warrant. There is a
need for closer collaboration between the CBS and Ministry of Finance to improve liquidity
forecasting and management. Importantly, the program includes steps to contain the risks to
the financial system by bolstering banking supervision and a fiscal provision for potential
recapitalization needs by state-owned financial institutions.
47.
The debt sustainability analysis clearly indicates that Seychelles’ public debt is
unsustainable. The authorities have taken credible first steps in the process of elaborating
and implementing a comprehensive public debt restructuring effort. Staff supports the
authorities’ intention to seek negotiations with external creditors on a restructuring aimed at

27
reestablishing public debt sustainability, consistent with Seychelles’ long-term payment
capacity. In this regard, a substantial reduction in the debt service burden consistent with
Seychelles' long-term ability to pay is clearly needed. Staff believe that the authorities’ are in
compliance with the Fund’s policy on lending into arrears, based on their good faith efforts to
engage with their external creditors and commitment to clear the small amount of arrears to
multilateral institutions.
48.
A sustained reform effort, including a major structural component, is needed
over the medium term. Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to elaborate, with the
support of staff and other development partners, a well-articulated medium-term structural
reform agenda.
49.
The program also includes several important measures to bolster public sector
governance and transparency. The authorities’ decision to publish the program documents
and staff report—a first for Seychelles is welcome. The authorities have already initiated
actions to address areas identified in the safeguards assessment . While data provided to the
Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance and program monitoring, staff notes the
commitment to address weaknesses in quality and timeliness of key macroeconomic data to
improve their usefulness for policy formulation, with technical assistance from the Fund.
50.
The staff believes that the comprehensive and frontloaded nature of the reform
program merits a frontloading of access under the arrangement. Also, given the low
level of reserves at the time major policy changes are implemented, staff considers
frontloaded access key to ensure the success of major policy changes. While there are
significant risks to the program, including from a severe global downturn, the early and
important policy reforms the authorities have already undertaken are indicative of their
strong ownership of the reform effort.
51.
The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held in accordance
with the provisions of the Decision No. 12794 of July 15, 2002 on consultation cycles.

APPENDIX
SEYCHELLES: LETTER OF INTENT
October 31, 2008
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
The government of Seychelles is determined to decisively address Seychelles’
balance of payments and external debt crisis. Achievements in promoting high living
standards and social development are in jeopardy. In 2006, the government initiated an
economic reform program, but the global slowdown and sharp food and fuel price increases
of 2007-08, have brought longstanding vulnerabilities to a head. In particular, pervasive
foreign exchange restrictions and an overvalued pegged exchange rate are no longer tenable.
These factors have led to acute foreign exchange shortages, an active parallel market, a sharp
rise in inflation to over 30 percent, a depletion of our external reserves and external arrears
accumulation. Following missed payments in July and October 2008 on our external
commercial debt obligations Seychelles’ external rating was downgraded to SD (selective
default).
2.
We are seeking the support of the International Monetary Fund and the
international community more broadly for a strong and comprehensive program aimed
at restoring external and internal economic balances. The program is described in the
attached memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) for 2008-09. This effort
includes the removal of foreign exchange restrictions, a floating of the rupee, a significant
fiscal and monetary tightening and the implementation of structural reforms to spur
competitiveness and growth. At the same time, we have adopted a targeted social safety net
that will help protect the most vulnerable segments of our population. We are preparing to
initiate discussions with our external creditors with a view to reaching agreement on a
restructuring of our external debt to close financing gaps and to restore public debt
sustainability. In support of these important objectives, the Government of Seychelles hereby
requests a two-year Stand-by arrangement in an amount of SDR 17.6 million (200 percent of
quota).
3.
We believe that the economic imbalances and dislocation we are experiencing
reflect the need for a broad-based reform of the public sector and economic policies,
which will require several years to implement with the sustained support of our
partners. These reforms would entail, inter alia, a comprehensive review of the tax system
and strengthening of tax administration, the downsizing of public sector employment, and
reducing the role of the state in the economy, including further privatization of public

41
enterprises. In this light, we will work with the IMF on developing a comprehensive
structural reform program that would be implemented over the medium term. Once this work
is finalized, we intend to request a longer-term engagement with the Fund under the
Extended Fund Facility.
4.
We believe that the economic and financial policies set forth in the MEFP are
sufficient to ensure that the objectives of the 2008-09 program will be met. If needed, we
stand ready to take any further measures that may prove necessary to meet our objectives.
We will consult with the Managing Director on the adoption of such measures in advance of
revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on
such consultations. The Seychelles authorities will provide the Managing Director with all
the information he may request in order to monitor program implementation and achieve
program objectives on schedule.
5.
The quarterly quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for end2008 and 2009 are shown in Table 1. The structural performance criterion and benchmarks
are shown in Table 2. The completion of the first review under the program will be based,
inter alia, on meeting the performance criteria and structural benchmarks at end-December
2008. The first review will focus on progress in: the reform of the exchange regime; the use
of market-based monetary policy; normalizing relations with external creditors;
strengthening tax administration and public expenditure management; the preparation of a
fundamental review of tax policy; strengthening the CBS act and operations to address areas
identified by the safeguards assessment; and a 2009 budget consistent with program
objectives.
6.
In line with our commitment to transparency, we hereby authorize the IMF to
publish this letter, the MEFP, the technical memorandum of understanding and the
staff report. We will simultaneously publish these documents in Seychelles.
Sincerely yours,

/s/
James Alix Michel
President
Republic of Seychelles

ATTACHMENT I
SEYCHELLES: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2008-09
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Over the past two decades Seychelles has successfully promoted high living
standards and social development. In Africa, Seychelles has the second highest GDP per
capita, is one of six upper-middle-income countries, and leads in human development. It is
ranked 50th on the 2007 United Nations Development Program Human Development Index,
a level comparable to many OECD countries.
2.
Since the mid-1990s these achievements have been put increasingly at risk due to
persistent macroeconomic imbalances, external shocks and long-standing structural
problems. Large fiscal and parastatal deficits have led to rising external and domestic debt
and a widening current account deficit. The state’s dominance in the economy has further
restrained the development of the private sector.
3.
Recognizing these challenges, in 2003 we began a reform and modernization
effort (the Macro-Economic Reform Program─MERP), which entailed a large fiscal
adjustment and tax reform, as well as a gradual liberalization of the economy. By early 2007,
achievements included a sizable depreciation of the rupee, partial exchange regime
liberalization and the replacement of collateralized debt with part of the proceeds of a
Eurobond issue. In March 2007, we announced our “Seychelles Strategy 2017”, a broadbased 10-year reform strategy which aims at a doubling of nominal per-capita income in ten
years and a reduction of public debt from 145 percent of GDP to 60 percent.
4.
However, the pace of reform has been too gradual, piecemeal in nature, and
insufficient to address the magnitude of the macroeconomic imbalances, so
vulnerabilities remained high. The maintenance of a pegged exchange rate, which was not
compatible with fiscal and monetary policy, together with pervasive foreign exchange
restrictions has led to an overvaluation of the Seychelles rupee, a growing parallel market,
and persistent foreign exchange shortages. This in turn has increasingly hampered
competitiveness and economic growth. In 2007 we transformed a backlog of rupee deposits
(totaling about 15 percent of 2007 GDP) awaiting conversion for transfer abroad into public
external debt. In 2007-08, the global oil and food price shock hit the Seychelles economy
particularly hard given its dependence on basic imports, with inflation rising sharply to
38 percent (year-on-year) by August 2008. Notwithstanding gradual adjustment of the
exchange rate from 5 to 8 rupees to the US dollar between October 2006 and October 2007,
the currency remained overvalued, exchange shortages persisted, and official external
reserves were virtually exhausted. These imbalances came to a head in July 2008 when we
missed a payment due on a privately-placed external debt issue. In October 2008, we were

43
unable to make a coupon payment on our outstanding Eurobond. Standard and Poor’s has
downgraded Seychelles to SD (selective default).
5.
The current situation calls both for immediate measures to remove the
distortions in the foreign exchange market and restore external and fiscal sustainability,
as well as comprehensive structural reforms to sustain growth and competitiveness. We
have already taken measures in advance of commencing an IMF-supported program and have
started laying the groundwork for future reforms. We will float the Seychelles rupee and
have removed all exchange restrictions in order to restore confidence in our domestic
currency. The change in exchange regime will be supported by a further significant
tightening of fiscal and monetary policies, and we are putting in place a comprehensive debt
restructuring strategy aimed at closing financing gaps and restoring debt sustainability. We
are also preparing a comprehensive medium-term structural reform program that will remove
existing distortions and obstacles to private sector development.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
6.
Growth in 2008 has slowed considerably, under the combined impact of the
global slowdown, the oil and food price shocks, and foreign exchange shortages. Real
GDP growth is projected to be about 3.1 percent in 2008, down from 7.3 percent in 2007.
While construction is still booming, manufacturing activities are sharply declining and
growth in a key indicator of tourism activity (visitors nights) has fallen to about 4.5 percent
since early 2008 (year to date), from 16.6 percent for the same period in 2007. Inflation has
accelerated sharply since mid-2007, driven by a weaker rupee, price liberalization, and the
surge in international oil and food prices.
7.
The 2008 budget has been implemented broadly as approved, delivering on the
government’s commitment to a significant tightening. The primary surplus is projected at
5.6 percent of GDP in 2008 (excluding a 1.5 percent of GDP transfer of valuation gains from
the Central Bank) compared to a 2.3 percent deficit in 2007). More frequent adjustments
toward cost-recovery levels for water and electricity prices are reducing government
subsidies to the public utility company, and petroleum product prices are now adjusted
monthly to reflect international prices. Despite inflationary pressures, primary spending has
also been contained due to low public sector wage rises and tighter spending controls.
Increased tax on fuel and a new import levy on automobiles have more than made up for a
shortfall on goods and services tax (GST) due to the elimination of GST on 13 basic food
items and cooking gas (LPG).
8.
The central bank (CBS) raised reserve requirements in response to rising
inflation. The reserve requirement on domestic currency deposits was increased from 5 to
13 percent as of June 1, 2008 and the same reserve requirement was introduced on foreign
currency deposits in September. However, the local asset ratio (LAR─met only by holding
domestic treasury obligations) was reduced from 65 to 50 percent, offsetting the increase in

44
reserve requirements. Following the decision to remove excess reserves as part of the LAR
computation, the LAR was reduced from 50 to 45 percent on September 15, 2008.
9.
Based on mid-2008 data, commercial banks are adequately capitalized and have
long net open positions in foreign exchange, but are vulnerable to interest rate and
associated default risk. As of June 30, banking industry assets totaled about SR 8.8 billion
(113 percent of GDP). Domestic lending accounted for only about 25 percent of assets with
most funds invested abroad (34 percent), and domestic government securities accounted for
24 percent. Bank regulatory capital, measured on the most stringent capitalization measure—
net tangible capitalization (i.e., capital net of all provisions for loan loss and intangibles)—
stood at 5.6 percent of net assets─40 basis points short of being considered well capitalized.
However, banks’ large position in treasury securities makes them vulnerable to declines in
the values of those investments. Whereas industry capital as of June 30, 2008 covered about
22 percent of bank holdings of government securities, three banks had coverage of only 1114 percent.
10.
The external current account deficit is projected to reach 29 percent of GDP in
2008. The cost of transportation services imports is projected to increase by about
37 percent, while tourism earnings are being affected by the global slowdown, resulting in a
significant deterioration of the services balance. The merchandise trade balance is, however,
expected to improve somewhat, as the higher fuel and food import bill is largely offset by
strong tuna exports and petroleum re-exports. As of end September official reserves had
fallen to about US$15 million, and the balance of payments is increasingly financed by
external arrears accumulation.
11.
At 151 percent of GDP (2008 figures), public debt is unsustainable. External
public debt represents about two-thirds of the total (97.8 percent of GDP), of which 81
percent of GDP is in arrears. We have a small amount of arrears (US$2.2 million at end-June
2008) to multilateral creditors. We have hired highly qualified financial and legal advisors to
assist us in preparing a comprehensive debt strategy and engaging in good-faith discussions
with our creditors.
III. ECONOMIC PROGRAM FOR 2008–09
12.
The objectives of our reform program are to promote macroeconomic stability
and sustainable growth by:
•

Achieving full convertibility of the Seychelles rupee and introducing a marketdetermined exchange rate regime;

•

Placing public debt on a sustainable path by implementing a comprehensive debt
restructuring strategy, coupled with further tightening of fiscal and monetary policy,
while preserving financial sector stability; and

45
•

Reducing the role of the state in economic activity and enhancing the growthgenerating capacity of the private sector by creating conditions conducive private
investment.

13.
The macroeconomic framework for the program period (2008-10) and the
medium-term is:

•

The program assumes a contraction in GDP in 2009 of about 0.5 percent, in part
reflecting the recent deterioration of global economic conditions. A progressive
recovery is projected in 2010 and beyond with average real GDP growth of about
5 percent, under the impulse of rising foreign investment in tourism following the
lifting of exchange restrictions and other bottlenecks, which have hampered
investment and growth.

•

The real effective exchange rate is expected to depreciate sharply in late 2008, with
small and gradual real appreciation thereafter.

•

Reflecting pass-through of the anticipated exchange rate depreciation, inflation
would peak in the second quarter of 2009 at about 41 percent and gradually decline to
22 percent at end-2009.

•

The current account balance is projected to improve significantly in 2009, to a
deficit of about 21 percent of GDP, and to remain at about that level through the
medium term. Merchandise imports are expected to decline sharply (by about
10 percent in US dollar terms) in 2009 under the impact of the devaluation and a
decline in FDI-related imports, before a gradual recovery broadly compatible with
GDP growth in 2010 and beyond. The growth of goods exports is expected to be
moderate at about 4 percent in 2009. Over the medium-term services exports, largely

46
tourism, are expected to grow more strongly under the impulse of rising direct foreign
investment, improved competitiveness, and the elimination of exchange restrictions.
•

In the absence of external debt restructuring, public sector debt would increase
to 169 percent of GDP in 2009, and remain at unsustainably high levels over the
medium-term. Domestic debt would decline through a combination of fiscal restraint
and negative real interest rates, particularly on long-term bonds. Debt servicing
capacity is extremely limited in 2009-11 and highly dependent on the availability of
program lending from multilaterals.
A. Exchange Regime and Exchange Rate Policy

14.
We intend to reform fundamentally the exchange rate regime with a view to
eliminate foreign exchange shortages, restore confidence in the Seychelles rupee as legal
tender and enhance external competitiveness. In particular we are committed to removing
all exchange restrictions and allowing the exchange rate of the rupee to be marketdetermined.
15.
We believe that the current exchange rate peg is no longer viable, owing to the
very low level of official foreign exchange reserves, limited external financing options,
and large external debt obligations. We have taken the necessary preparatory steps to
ensure that the exit from the peg is as orderly as possible (below). The following preparations
have been completed as of end-October 2008.
•

Amend the Central Bank (CBS) Act to repeal CBS determination of the exchange
rate.

•

Repeal Foreign Earnings (Regulations) Act, under which the extensive exchange
controls were imposed.

•

Remove requirements to pay in foreign exchange.

•

Revoke requirements under the Exchange Control Act that (i) persons who are not
authorized dealers must conduct foreign currency transactions (i.e., buying, selling,
lending, or borrowing gold and foreign currency) with authorized dealers; (ii) persons
authorized to buy foreign currency in the course of their business must sell such
foreign currency to financial institutions (i.e., banks and exchange bureaus).

•

Amend the Financial Institutions Act to authorize a new class of foreign exchange
bureaus that may operate in accounts in addition to notes, coins, and travelers’
cheques.

47
In addition:
•

We will prepare and submit to the National Assembly a modernized, simplified and
transparent foreign exchange act by end-June 2009.

•

With technical assistance from the IMF, we are establishing a platform at the Central
Bank for interbank foreign exchange (FX) trading. While an augmented real-time
gross settlement system should be introduced over the coming year, a manual bookentry system at the CBS will be used in the short term.

•

We are reforming our monetary policy framework in order to conduct monetary
policy based on reserve money targeting. Weekly auctions for 91-day treasury bills,
and the establishment of a weekly auction for a central bank deposit facility
(established in mid September) have already allowed for more efficient liquidity
management and market-determined interest rates. The higher market-determined
domestic interest rates observed in the run-up to the float will help contain possible
exchange rate overshooting.

•

We are working closely with commercial banks to ensure that they promptly establish
internal rules for FX trading and risk management based on international best
practices.
B. Debt Restructuring Strategy

16.
The success of our adjustment and reform program requires external financial
support, including a restructuring of our external debt. We are committed to sustaining a
strong fiscal effort over the medium term. However, no plausible fiscal adjustment can
deliver─on its own─funds sufficient to close our near term financing gaps and return our
future debt service payments to sustainable levels. On September 30, 2008, we publicly
announced that we would seek to restructure about US$800 million of external debt, and
requested the support of our creditors. With the assistance of our legal and financial advisors,
we are committed to developing a comprehensive debt restructuring strategy, consistent with
the Fund’s lending into arrears policy, with particular focus on information transparency,
intercreditor equity, and dialogue with all creditor groups. We will seek a restructuring of our
external liabilities aimed at restoring public debt sustainability, and consistent with our
ability to pay. Immediate and sizable cash flow relief in the short- to medium-term, sustained
reduction of our debt service burden, and significant balance of payments support from our
international partners, will be necessary. With regard to domestic debt, we will need to assure
the stability of our banking system which has a large portion of its assets in government debt.
We have approached multilateral creditors with whom we have arrears seeking agreement on
an arrears clearance strategy.
17.
Strengthening public debt management forms an integral part of our adjustment
strategy. We will submit to the National Assembly a Public Debt Law, defining a legal
framework for public debt management, and specifying the roles and responsibilities of the
bodies engaged in contracting and managing public debt by end-December 2008. As agreed
with IMF staff, we will formulate a medium-term public debt strategy, aimed at achieving an

48
optimal trade-off between cost and risk of public debt and consistent with long-run debt
sustainability. We will increase transparency of public debt management by publishing
quarterly and annual reports on the implementation of the debt strategy. We also plan to
strengthen the rules governing provision of government guarantees and start charging
guarantee fees. We would welcome technical assistance in these areas from the IMF’s
Monetary and Capital Markets Department. As part of our strategy, we also commit to refrain
from contracting or guaranteeing new loans outside of the limits set-out in the program,
including project financing, and we will not accumulate new arrears to external or domestic
creditors.
C. Fiscal Policy
18.
The further consolidation of public finances is central to the program. We are
committed to implementing a large and sustained fiscal adjustment that will help both anchor
the move to a floating exchange rate regime and allow for a gradual reduction in public debt.
Primary surpluses of about 6.5 percent of GDP will be maintained in 2009-10, easing
gradually over the medium term. These objectives will be achieved through a combination of
expenditure restraint, including the elimination of subsidies and a reduction of the wage bill
in real terms (from about 9.1 percent of GDP in 2008 to 6.4 percent of GDP in 2010) as part
of our plan to reduce the size of the public sector, tax policy measures including the removal
of exemptions, strengthened tax administration and public financial management, public
sector reform, and further privatization of public enterprises.
Fiscal measures
19.
We are committed to taking urgent measures to reinforce fiscal revenue. We will
apply the goods and services tax (GST) to all locally-manufactured and imported goods,
except for 13 basic food items, and remove discretionary powers to grant exemptions. The
following revenue measures will be introduced in the fourth quarter of 2008 according to the
schedule below:
Action
Raise and harmonize taxes on locally-produced and imported cigarettes
to SR500 per 200 cigarettes.
Introduce 10 percent withholding tax on interest income for residents.
Extend GST to all telecom companies.
Announce the introduction of the GST of 15 percent on residential rental
income, effective January 1, 2009.
Announce the removal of the exemption on interest income by
companies (Tax Act) effective January 1, 2009.
Reintroduce GST on locally produced soft drinks.
Raise GST on tourism services from 7 percent to 10 percent.
Raise specific taxes/excise tax rates for both locally manufactured and
imported alcohol to adjust for inflation.

20.
We are committed to replacing costly and inefficient direct and indirect product
subsidies with a well-targeted social safety net. Over the past 20 years, the Seychelles’
government has provided a generous and broad-based social safety net. Now, as the economy
undergoes structural reforms to restore competitiveness, we are in the process of finalizing a
review of the welfare system. The primary aim of this review is to adopt a multi-dimensional
approach to the question of welfare support. This approach will aim at protecting the most
vulnerable segments of our population that have been hard hit by the rise in inflation,
particularly increased food prices. But the new safety net will go beyond monetary transfers,
which in some instances can be a disincentive for people to seek employment: while
providing assistance in a quick and effective way (applicants will receive a response within
3 days), it will also establish a means-testing system, and include an explicit exit strategy.
The agency responsible for implementing the new welfare legislation will be operational by
November 1, 2008, and will be funded out of the budget. The specific subsidies being
eliminated include:
Action
Abolish fishermen fuel subsidy coupons.
Eliminate indirect universal product subsidies and replace with a
targeted social safety net by enacting the Welfare Agency Act.
Eliminate SR90 per month electricity rebate for households.
Raise and maintain Seychelles Public Transportation Company (SPTC)
bus fare at operating cost-recovery levels.
Eliminate implicit and explicit subsidies for Agro Industries,
Hatcheries, Seychelles Trading Company (STC), and Coevity Prawns.
Eliminate LPG subsidy by the state oil company (SEPEC) (about SR3
per kg.).

21.
These changes are additional to the expenditure measures that have already
been taken, including the implementation in 2008 of a hiring freeze for the public sector; the
establishment of a public enterprise monitoring unit in the Ministry of Finance to reinforce
parastatal performance monitoring, reporting, better assess quasi-fiscal risks, and the
enforcement of a full cost recovery policy in the provision of public utilities.

50
Fiscal structural reforms
22.
Strengthening the public financial management framework and the budgetary
process should underpin and facilitate fiscal consolidation. We will strengthen the budget
formulation and execution process to ensure that resources can be allocated and used
efficiently and that established spending limits are respected. In particular, an IMF mission
recently conducted a public financial management review, and we commit ourselves to
implementing its recommendations. In particular, we are reviewing options for expenditure
rationalization as suggested in the report, including outsourcing non-core activities (see
below), and plan to strengthen the budget preparation, implementation and monitoring
processes, including through the preparation of a consistent medium-term macroeconomic
framework.
23.
A high-level government task force, headed by the Minister of Finance, is laying
the groundwork for major public service reform. The task force is conducting a
comprehensive review of the range of services provided by the government, with a view to
eliminating duplication and to outsourcing services that can be provided more efficiently by
the private sector. We believe public sector employment has become bloated and given
continued strong demand for labor from the private sector, there is considerable scope for
public sector employment rationalization. We intend to reduce the number of government
employees by 12.5 percent in 2009 through a voluntary and involuntary departure scheme. A
separation package is expected to provide sufficient time and means for former public
employees to be retrained and employed in the private sector. A voluntary scheme will be
conducted in October/November 2008, which would be followed by involuntary
redundancies in the event that the voluntary scheme does not achieve the targeted
employment reductions, with the departures scheduled to take place by January 1, 2009.
24.
We are convinced that a fundamental review of the tax system is urgently
needed. The current system has many differentiated rates of tax, high overall tax rates for
businesses, and a significant number of exemptions, particularly for foreign investors. Our
objective is to have a simple, fair, and equitable system, featuring low, harmonized rates and
a broader tax base, which will reduce incentives for evasion. Such a fundamental review
needs to be well prepared, and we have requested technical assistance from the IMF’s fiscal
affairs department.
25.
Strengthened tax administration and improved governance are key in enhancing
confidence that the tax system is fair and equitable. As an immediate step the Seychelles
Revenue Commission has launched tax audits of the 20 largest enterprises (by turnover), in
the tourism, banking, construction, and fishing sectors, to be completed by end-June 2009.
We are also strengthening tax administration and reinforcing efforts to recover unpaid taxes.
We have requested technical assistance on tax administration from the IMF’s fiscal affairs
department.

51
26.
We are actively pursuing the further privatization of public enterprises, with a
view to encouraging private sector activity. Parastatals are costly to the budget due to
extensive direct and indirect subsidies, and some are involved in activities that can be more
efficiently provided by the private sector. Our privatization program will continue over the
next year with the divestiture of the Seychelles Savings Bank, the Agro Industries, the
Animal Feed Factory and the Coetivy Prawn Farm. Going forward we intend to avoid
retaining minority stakes in the firms we privatize. In March 2008 we created a government
agency (Societé Seychelloise d’Investissement; SSI ) to strengthen the monitoring of firms in
which the government has a significant stake. In addition to the tax audits of the largest
firms, the SSI will commission management audits of firms with large state holdings,
including of the tuna cannery plant.
D. Monetary Policy
27.
Monetary policy will play an important role in seeking to establish price
stability, with greater emphasis on liquidity management. The CBS will rely more
actively on market-based monetary policy instruments to achieve price stability following the
shift to a flexible exchange rate. The exchange rate anchor will be replaced by a reserve
money target, and indirect, market-based monetary policy instruments are being developed to
allow the CBS to manage liquidity actively. As part of the new monetary policy, domestic
interest rates have already increased and are likely to rise further, especially in the period
around the floating of the rupee. The introduction of facilities for trading T-bills, foreign
exchange and deposits at the central bank will promote more efficient liquidity management
by commercial banks and support the development of an active inter-bank market. The new
framework will create a healthier financial environment by improving efficiency and
competition in the financial sector. The CBS and the government are committed to providing
a regular and predictable supply of instruments over a range of maturities to facilitate market
development and the establishment of a market-based yield curve.
28.
The CBS is committed to eliminating distortions in the financial market over the
program period. Burdensome financial regulations underpinning the current system of
administrative monetary policy instruments will be streamlined and gradually phased out. In
particular:
•

The LAR will be phased out over the program period as conditions permit, in
consultation with IMF staff, so as to promote lending to the private sector. It will be
replaced by a supervisory liquidity requirement for prudential purposes, and financial
supervision will be strengthened.

•

Statutory commercial bank reserves will be remunerated at 0.25% per annum.
However, excess reserves are no longer remunerated and no longer form part of the
LAR.

•

The CBS introduced weekly auctions for a liquidity deposit facility on September 22,
2008. Initially, deposits will be auctioned for 7, 14 and 28 days in amounts which will
be determined by liquidity sterilization objectives.

52
•

The CBS is also providing a facility for the trading of government securities at market
rates of discount. Weekly auctions of 91-day T-bills started October 3, 2008.

29.
The CBS continues to need international support to build capacity for policy
monitoring and implementation. We have benefited from IMF technical assistance in
central banking, foreign exchange markets and banking supervision. We welcome expert
visits from the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Market Department to continue to assist us in:
establishing an interbank market in foreign exchange, government securities, and bank
deposits with the CBS; initiating automation of this market; introducing a monetary
framework based on reserve money targeting; and reinforcing banking supervision.
Furthermore, we have requested a long-term monetary advisor to help us deal with the
transition from a fixed to floating exchange rate regime.
30.
The CBS is committed to addressing areas identified by the IMF safeguards
assessment mission of September 2008. We have already invited international audit firms
to tender for the external audit of the 2008 accounts. For the 2008 and future audits, we also
commit to appointing only international audit firms with recognized experience in central
bank audits. The 2008 audit requirements will be further formalized by developing a
Supplementary Statement of Work, specifying, inter alia: (i) an audit partner with recognized
experience in central bank audits, (ii) full compliance with International Standards on
Auditing, and (iii) that quarterly audits of key monetary data, as specified in the TMU, will
be conducted in addition to the financial statements audit. The data will be submitted to the
IMF in conformity with the program quarterly quantitative performance criteria throughout
the program period, beginning with December 2008 data. With IMF assistance, we also
intend to strengthen the governance and transparency aspects of the CBS Act and CBS
operations in 2008-2009, in line with the recommendations of the safeguards assessment and
previous IMF recommendations in 2008-09. As a first step, we will address the current lack
of formal procedures for CBS’s transactions on behalf of government, in particular:
Action
Approve a memorandum of understanding, under Article 34 of the CBS act,
formalizing the operational terms and conditions under which the CBS acts
as agent for the government.

Timing
End-December 2008

E. Financial Sector Stability
31.
We are fully aware that the envisaged changes in the exchange rate regime and
monetary policy framework will, against the background of global financial turbulence,
pose challenges to the stability of the financial sector in the short run. Based on tighter
credit quality standards, and given that mid-2008 data showed strong net open positions in
foreign currencies, a depreciation of the Seychelles rupee would improve the capital position
of most banks. However, these foreign exchange positions can change quickly and we will
closely monitor them. Another concern is the impact of higher interest rates on default rates

53
by borrowers. Government-owned financial institutions would also be affected both by
exchange rate as well as interest rate risk.
32.
We are committed to carefully monitoring the impact of the exchange rate
regime change on banks and non-banks’ balance sheet, and to taking all measures
necessary to maintain the stability and soundness of the financial system. In this light,
the government has provisioned a contingency in the 2009 budget to cover for potential
losses and recapitalization needs of the state-owned financial institutions. A reassessment of
the strategic role of public non-bank financial institutions will also be undertaken, and we are
seeking technical assistance to create a specialized oversight function at the Ministry of
Finance and advise on options available to the government.
F. Transparency and Good Governance
33.
Private investment is a key component of our country’s sustained economic
growth over the medium-term, and we shall take the necessary steps to ensure that all
potential investors are treated with equity and with the highest level of transparency.
This will entail the revamping of the process by which new direct investment is attracted to
remove discretionary incentives and ensure a level playing field. The authority for approving
new projects will be centralized at the Ministry of Finance, with the final approval resting
with the cabinet. We will ensure that the investment code is uniformly applied, and that all
discretionary ministerial exemptions are removed.
34.
We are committed to enforce the highest standards of transparency and
accountability in the public and private sectors. In August 2008 we adopted the Public
Officers Ethics Act, which provides for a code of conduct and ethics for civil servants,
requiring financial declarations and prohibiting conflicts of interest. The Public Procurement
Act, modeled on the COMESA standard, will be passed by December 2008. The objective of
the act is to standardize procurement procedures within the government by modernizing and
harmonizing regulations and procedures. Transparency, competitiveness, and efficiency will
be enhanced as tender procedures will ensure competitive bidding through strict and uniform
requirements regarding minimum number of bidders and public disclosure of all bids. In July
2008, we amended the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Act to establish a Financial
Intelligence Unit with powers of investigation and sanction, and to strengthen the proper
enforcement of AML regulations by enabling the Supreme Court to order civil proceedings
for the preservation and disposal of proceeds of criminal conduct under the Act.
G. Statistical Issues
35.
In spite of significant improvements, we recognize that there remain deficiencies
in key macroeconomic data – especially deflator estimates, and foreign trade statistics,
which limit their usefulness for surveillance, economic analysis, and policy formulation. The
government will further strive to improve the quality, periodicity, and timeliness of
macroeconomic statistics. The government will request technical assistance in these areas

54
from the Statistics Department of the Fund. We will also strive to implement the GFS
classification in order to present our fiscal accounts in the IMF format for easier budget
monitoring and reporting.
H. Program financing
36.
For 2008, the program is financed, after disbursement of US$1.6 million in financial
assistance from the European Union and of the first tranche of the prospective SBA of
70 percent of quota (SDR 6.16 million) from the IMF. For 2009, the external nonproject
financing requirement is expected to be covered by disbursements from the IMF under the
prospective SBA (30 percent of quota; SDR 2.64 million; US$3.85 million), from
multilateral creditors (US$15 million) and from external debt relief (US$85million).
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING
37.
The SBA will be monitored by quarterly program and financing assurances
reviews. The quarterly quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for end-2008
and 2009 are shown in Table 1. The structural benchmarks and performance criterion for the
first review are shown in Table 2. The non zero ceilings on the contracting or guaranteeing of
external debt are to allow for nomal public project finance and program support from
multilateral institutions exclusively.
38.
The completion of the first review under the program will be based on meeting
the quantitative performance criteria at end-December 2008. It will focus on progress in:
the reform of the exchange regime; the use of market-based monetary policy, normalizing
relations with external creditors; the preparation of a fundamental review of tax policy; the
strengthening of tax administration and public expenditure management; strengthening the
CBS act and operations to address areas identified by the safeguards assessment; and a 2009
budget consistent with program objectives. The first program and financing assurances
review under the Stand-by arrangement is scheduled to be completed in early April 2009, and
the second program and financing assurances review should be completed in early July 2009.
The attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) defines the quantitative
performance criteria, indicative targets and adjusters under the program. Seychelles will
avoid introducing new exchange restrictions, multiple currency practices, or bilateral
payments agreements in contradiction with Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement
and imposing any import restrictions for balance of payments reasons. The authorities stand
ready to adopt any additional measures, in consultation with Fund staff, which may become
necessary to ensure program success.

ATTACHMENT II
SEYCHELLES: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding presents the definitions of variables
included in the quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets set out in the
memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP), the key assumptions, and the
reporting requirements of the Government and the Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) needed
to adequately monitor economic and financial developments. The quantitative performance
criteria and indicative targets, and the structural performance criterion and benchmarks for
2008-09 are listed in Tables 1 and 2 of the MEFP, respectively.
I. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Net International Reserves of the CBS (floor)
Definition
2.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the CBS are defined for program monitoring
purposes as reserve assets of the CBS, minus reserve liabilities of the CBS (including
liabilities to the IMF). Reserve assets of the CBS are claims on nonresidents that are readily
available (i.e., liquid and marketable and free of any pledges or encumberments and
excluding project balances held in CBS accounts), controlled by the CBS, and held for the
purpose of intervening in foreign exchange markets. They include holdings of SDRs,
holdings of foreign exchange, demand and short-term deposits at foreign banks abroad,
fixed-term deposits abroad that can be liquidated without penalty, and any holdings of
investment-grade securities. Reserve liabilities of the CBS comprise liabilities to
nonresidents contracted by the CBS, any net off-balance-sheet position of the CBS (futures,
forwards, swaps, or options) with either residents or nonresidents, including those to the
IMF.

Calculation method
3.
For program monitoring purposes, reserves assets and liabilities at each test date,
must be converted into U.S. dollars using the end of period exchange rates assumed in the
program.
Monitoring and reporting
4.
At each program test date, the quarterly net international reserves data submitted by
the CBS to the IMF will be audited by the CBS external auditors in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing, to ensure conformity with the program definition and
calculation methods. Reports should be submitted to the CBS, with a copy to the IMF, no
later than two months after each test date.
Adjusters
5.
The floor on the CBS’s NIR will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount by
which the new external balance of payments financing exceeds (falls short of) the amounts
assumed in the program (MEFP Table 1). The floors will also be adjusted upwards
(downwards) by the amount that external debt service payments fall short (exceed) the
amounts assumed in the program.
B. Reserve Money (Ceiling)
Definition
6.
Reserve money is equivalent to currency issued and deposits held by financial
institutions at the central bank (bank reserves). Evaluation of performance of reserve money
with respect to the program ceiling will take account of any changes in regulations affecting
the level of banks’ required reserves.
Monitoring and reporting
7.
For each program test date, the quarterly reserve money data submitted by the CBS to
the IMF will be audited by the CBS’ external auditors in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing, to ensure conformity with the program definition. Reports should be
submitted to the CBS, with a copy to the IMF, no later than two months after each test date.
Adjusters
8.
The reserve money target would be lowered (raised) for any reduction (increase) in
the reserve requirements from those assumed in the program. A change in the reserve
requirement coefficient will change the reserve money (RM) ceilings according to the
following formula:

59
∆RM = ∆rD*DD0 + ∆rF*DF0,

where: DD0 denotes the level of domestic currency deposits and DF0 denotes the level of
foreign currency deposits to which the reserve requirements for domestic currency and
foreign currency deposits, respectively, apply during the period immediately preceding the
date when the new reserve regulation becomes effective; ∆rD and ∆rF denote the change in
the reserve requirement coefficient for domestic currency and foreign currency deposits,
respectively.
C. Primary balance of the consolidated government (cumulative floor)
9.
The consolidated government primary balance from above the line on a commitment
basis is defined as total consolidated government and social security fund revenues
(excluding privatization and long-term lease income receipts) less all noninterest (primary)
expenditures of the government and social security fund.
Adjusters
10.
The floor on the primary surplus of the consolidated government will be adjusted
upwards by the cumulative amount of the contingency for recapitalizing the state-controlled
financial institutions which is not used for that purpose. Any amounts spent for the
recapitalizing of the state-controlled financial institutions in excess of programmed
contingency will need to be funded within the program limit on the primary balance.
D. Public External Debt (ceiling)
11.
The ceiling applies to the contracting or guaranteeing of new external liabilities by
the public sector (including the central government, the CBS, and all public agencies and
parastatals for operations that are not directly linked to commercial activities). The ceiling
does not apply to the use of Fund resources, operations related to external debt restructuring;
normal import related credits; purchases of treasury securities by non-residents; or
borrowing by parastatals in the conduct of normal commercial operations. The non zero
ceilings on the contracting or guaranteeing of external debt are to allow for nomal public
project finance and program support from multilateral institutions exclusively. Debt shall be
valued in U.S. dollars at program exchange rates.
•

A zero subceiling on short-term external debt applies continuously to the contracting
or guaranteeing of short-term external debt by the public sector, with an original
maturity of up to and including one year. .

12.
For the purpose of this performance criterion, the term “debt” has the meaning set
forth in point No. 9 of the Executive Board’s Guidelines on Performance Criteria with
Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85)). Debt is understood to mean a current,
non contingent liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of
value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to
make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some
future points in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities

60
incurred under the contract. The ceiling on contracting official and officially guaranteed
external debt includes all form of debt, including:
(i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans, and buyers credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are
equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds,
and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as
repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);
(ii) suppliers credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments
until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and,
(iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right
to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total
expected service life of the property, while the leasor retains title to the property. The debt is
the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made
during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair,
or maintenance of the property.
Arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment
under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt.
E. External arrears of the public sector
13.
The non-accumulation of arrears to external creditors will be a continuous
performance criterion under the program. External payments arrears for program monitoring
purposes are defined as the amount of external debt service due and not paid within the
contractually agreed period, including contractual and late interest. Arrears resulting from the
nonpayment of debt service for which a clearance framework has been agreed or a
rescheduling agreement is sought are excluded from this definition.
F. Budget expenditure arrears
14.
The non-accumulation of budget expenditure arrears will be a continuous performance
criterion under the program. Budget expenditure arrears are defined as the sum of (1) any
invoice that has been received by a spending agency from a supplier of goods, services, and
capital goods delivered and verified, and for which payment has not been made within the
contractually agreed period, or in the absence of a grace period, within 30 days; (2) unpaid
wages, pensions, or transfers, pending for longer than 30 days to domestic or foreign
residents, irrespective of the currency denomination of the debt.
II. DATA AND INFORMATION
15.
The Seychelles authorities (government and CBS) will provide Fund staff with the
following data and information according to the schedule provided.

61
The CBS will report
Weekly (within one week from the end of the period):
• Net international reserves
• The CBS balance sheet.
• Contracts of any new external loan agreements entered into by the CBS.
• The daily average exchange rate of the Seychelles rupee for the previous five days
(in Seychelles rupees per U.S. dollar) as posted by the CBS and a table on the number
and size of daily transactions in the market.
• The foreign exchange cash flow.
• The results of the liquidity deposit auctions, primary treasury bill auctions, and secondary
auctions.
Monthly (within 4 weeks from the end of the month):
• Monthly balance sheet of the CBS.
• The monetary survey.
• Financial soundness indicators.
• Structure of interest rates.
• Stock of government securities in circulation by holder (banks and nonbanks) and by
original maturity.
The Ministry of Finance will report
Weekly (within one week from the end of the period):
• Notification of payments coming due on external debt, which were not made (increase in
arrears).
Monthly (within 4 weeks from the end of the month):
• Consolidated government operations on a commitment basis and cash basis in the IMFsupported program format.
• The detailed revenues and expenditures of the central government and social security
fund.
• Monthly accounts of the public non-bank financial institutions.
• Monthly treasury report.
• Stock and flow of external debt by creditor.
• Statement on budget expenditure and external debt service arrears. Data on the clearance
of arrears will distinguish between domestic and external obligations and between those
referring to scheduled interest payments, scheduled principal repayments, and
commercial and other current transactions.
• The contracts of any new external loan agreements entered into by the government and
parastatals.
16.
The government and CBS will consult with Fund staff on all economic and financial
measures that would have an impact on program implementation, and will provide any
additional relevant information as requested by Fund staff.

APPENDIX II
SEYCHELLES: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) confirms that Seychelles’ public debt is
unsustainable. The analysis argues that this remains the case even if a strong and sustained
fiscal adjustment is implemented. A comprehensive public debt restructuring is critical for
restoring debt sustainability. Nevertheless, Seychelles is likely to remain highly vulnerable to
a wide variety of shocks for an extended period of time. Against this background,
engagement in constructive good-faith discussions with all external creditors is critical.
Structure of Public Debt and Recent Developments
1.
Seychelles’s public and publicly
guaranteed (PPG) debt burden is among the
highest in the world.5 As of end-August 2008,
the PPG debt stock is estimated at 151 percent of
GDP (Table 1). External public sector debt is 94
percent of GDP (54 percent of total public debt)
and is largely held by commercial and official
bilateral creditors (see text chart).6 Domestic
public debt outstanding accounts for about 57
percent of GDP (38 percent of total public debt),
predominantly held by the domestic commercial
banking sector and the Central Bank of
Seychelles (CBS).

2.
The currency composition of
Seychelles’ public debt has changed considerably over the last few years. Since 2006, the
share of external debt has been rapidly rising—increasing from 38 percent in 2006 to 62
percent of total public debt in August-2008—adding to severe sensitivity of debt ratios to
fluctuation in the exchange rate.

5

For the purpose of this DSA, public sector is defined as non-financial public sector and includes debt
contracted by non-financial parastatals. The stock data and service projections are preliminary as the data have
not yet been reconcilled with creditors.

6

Staff understands that there is some collateralized commercial external debt.

63
3.
The maturity structure
(residual basis) of the domestic
public debt is skewed toward
shorter maturities. More than half of
domestic debt is due to mature over
the course of the next two years. Thus,
rollover risks may be significant in the
near term.

recovery rating of “4”, indicating expectation of an average recovery of 30-50 percent on
defaulted debt.7
7

This downgrade was triggered by the Ministry of Finance’s announcement of its intention to miss a coupon
payment falling due on October 3, 2008.

64
Macroeconomic Assumptions
The debt sustainability analysis is based on the following medium- and long-term
macroeconomic assumptions, which are consistent with the framework presented in the staff
report:
•

Against the background of strong fiscal effort and the significant exchange rate
adjustment accompanying floating the exchange rate, the near-term economic growth
is projected to be subdued, with real GDP shrinking by about 0.5 percent in 2009.
Economic growth is expected to recover relatively fast, however, supported by the
foreign direct investment in tourism (see below). Annual real GDP growth is assumed
to be around 5 percent in the long term, broadly consistent with Seychelles’ long-term
historical average.

•

Reflecting the pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation, inflation would peak in
2009 at about 34 percent but, supported by tighter fiscal and monetary stance, would
gradually decline to its long-term level of about 3 percent by 2012.

•

Notwithstanding a US$3.4 billion pipeline of approved foreign-financed projects in
tourism, net FDI inflows in the medium-term are projected to decline significantly,
with 2009 inflows falling by about 30 percent in absolute terms (a drop of about
4 percent of GDP) relative to its 2008 level. FDI inflows are expected to recover
gradually over the medium term on account of the improved business environment
following the elimination of exchange restrictions (i.e., elimination of impediments to
profits repatriation), recouping its recent levels by 2012-13. 8 This path reflects an
assumption that going forward investors will face elevated cost of financing projects
in Seychelles due to the country’s higher risk premium and, more generally, higher
cost and availability of capital on account of tight world-wide credit conditions and
greater risk aversion. The long-term FDI-to-GDP ratio is assumed to stabilize at about
30 percent of GDP.

•

Under the impulse of foreign direct investment, tourism earnings are projected to
grow by 9 percent per annum in the long run. However, some moderation of tourism
receipts is expected in the near term on account of slower world-wide economic
growth.

•

The non-interest external current account deficit is projected to improve from
26.7 percent of GDP in 2008 to 16.4 percent of GDP in 2009, mostly reflecting a
significant import compression (a drop of about 10 percent) following liberalization

8

FDI inflows are relatively neutral for the balance of payments as foreign-financed investments have import
content of 85-90 percent and result in outflows in the form of repatriated profits. As a result, the debt
sustainability outlook is not very sensitive about the specific assumption on FDI inflows.

65
of the exchange rate regime. Over the longer term, however, the non-interest external
current account deficit is projected to widen moderately to an average of about
18.5 percent of GDP, as rising tourism earnings are offset by higher tourism- and
FDI-related imports and mounting repatriation abroad of investors’ profits and
dividends.
•

On the fiscal front, projections assume a large and frontloaded fiscal tightening. The
primary balance improves by 9.4 percentage points of GDP in 2008 and the primary
surplus remains over 6 percent of GDP in 2009-11. The fiscal stance relaxes with the
primary surplus gradually declining from 5.2 percent of GDP in 2012 to 3.6 percent
in 2018. Government revenues are projected to average 35.5 percent of GDP in 200918, while primary expenditures are projected to decline from 37.5 percent of GDP in
2007 to an average of about 32 percent of GDP in 2016-18.

•

Debt sustainability analysis assumes no restructuring of the domestic public debt due
to risks it may pose to Seychelles banking system.9 However, a period of negative (or
low positive) real interest rates on long term government fixed coupon bond in 200810 significantly erodes domestic debt as inflation is high and domestic interest rates
are relatively low. Substantial privatization and long-term lease income in 2008-09
reduce domestic debt, though this factor diminishes over time. In addition to the
aforementioned primary surpluses, healthy real GDP growth from 2010 also aids debt
reduction.

•

The foreign reserves target of at least three months of prospective imports is assumed
to be reached by 2015.

Non-Restructuring Scenario
6.
The scenario is built on the assumption that external financing gaps are closed
by new external borrowing (Table 3).10 All external arrears are assumed to be cleared
through refinancing. With a caveat of the significant uncertainty about specific terms of new
external commercial borrowing of a highly indebted country with large payment arrears, we
assume that Seychelles could borrow at LIBOR plus 800 basis points with 10 year maturity
and one year grace period.11 While in principle a case could be made that Seychelles may
currently face an even tougher terms with steeper risk premium, the analysis of this section is
9

See staff report for a detailed assessment of banking sector’s capacity to absorb domestic debt restructuring.

10

An alternative way to think about this scenario is to treat it as if Seychelles was getting cash flow relief from
its creditors that comes in the form of a flow refinancing of its financing gaps and arrears.
11

The assumed risk premium is designed to mimic the average 2008 EMBI spreads on sovereign external debt
of other highly indebted countries with significant vulnerabilities, for which trading of debt securities is more
active.

66
quite illuminating and should be viewed as a lower (optimistic) bound of the country’s debt
sustainability outlook.
7.
The new borrowing scenario shows that the level of public debt would remain
unsustainable (Table 2a, Figure 1a). Over the course of the next ten years, the debt-to-GDP
ratio is projected to rise to over 183 percent of GDP, a level clearly inconsistent with public
debt sustainability. Furthermore, the bound tests highlight that the evolution of public debt is
extremely sensitive to the underlying assumptions, with even moderate shocks triggering
even more problematic dynamics.
8.
Correspondingly, external debt ratios rise sharply in 2009 to 128 percent of GDP
due to the impact of the exchange rate depreciation and continue growing throughout
the projection periods (Table 2b, Figure 1b). External debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to
continue rising to 165 percent of GDP in 2018, leaving the economy highly vulnerable to a
wide spectrum of shocks: even modest shocks to current account deficit and, importantly,
nominal interest rate puts external debt indicators on the even more explosive path.
9.
Given the magnitude of Seychelles’ public debt burden, a comprehensive debt
restructuring involving creditors accepting significant concessions is required to
restore public debt sustainability. Moreover, the staff analysis suggests that even with a
sharp reduction in the debt service burden consistent with the long-term ability to pay,
Seychelles is likely to remain highly vulnerable to a wide variety of shocks for an extended
period of time.

Key Macroeconomic and Fiscal Assumptions

Real interest rate is at baseline plus one-half standard deviations
Real GDP growth is at baseline minus two standard deviation
Primary balance is at baseline minus one standard deviation
Combination of B1-B3 using one-quarter standard deviation shocks
One time 15 percent additional real depreciation in 2009 9/
10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2009

1/ Public sector covers non-finacial public sector and the IMF loan to the CBS. Debt is on a gross basis. External and domestic financing gaps are assumed to be closed by additional borrowing.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

B3. Non-interest current account is at baseline minus one standard deviations
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using 1/4 standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 15 percent of additional real depreciation in 2009

1/ External financing gaps and arrears are assumed to be closed by external borrowing at LIBOR plus 800bps, with 10 year maturity and one year grace period.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.

VII. Implementation of HIPC Initiative: Not applicable
VIII. Safeguards Assessments:
The Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) has not previously been subject to a
safeguards assessment. The assessment conducted in connection with the prospective
stand-by arrangement is now substantially complete and included a staff visit to the
CBS in September/October 2008. Staff found high risks in all areas of the CBS’
safeguards framework. The authorities agreed to implement remedial measures,
including steps to be monitored under the program.

3
IX. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
On October 9, 2006, the Central Bank revised the composition of the basket of
currencies that determines the value of the Seychelles rupee. The new basket is
composed of three currencies (instead of previously six): the euro (59.1 percent), the
pound sterling (30.2 percent), and the U.S. dollar (10.7 percent). With the revision of
the basket, the appreciation limit of US$ 1 = SR5.50, which was introduced on July 1,
2003, was removed. From October 2006 to October 2007, the rupee was gradually
devalued to SR/US$8, and has been kept at this level since then.
Seychelles has maintained a number of restrictions on current international
transactions subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII Sections 2, 3, and 4,
including a restriction on the transfer of profits and dividends, and a foreign exchange
allocation mechanism. Exchange market liberalization will set the stage for the
elimination of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII.
X. Article IV Consultations:
Seychelles is currently on a 12-month consultation cycle. The 2006 Article IV
consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on March 27, 2007.

III. SEYCHELLES: RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP
(As of October 2008)
The African Development Bank Group commenced operations with the Republic of
Seychelles in 1978 and has since approved 19 operations comprising 15 projects, one study
and three lines of credit for the country. Cumulative approvals as of October 2008 (there
were no approvals between 2001 and 2006 when the country was under sanctions) amounted
to UA 84.87 million,1 of which 73 percent was from the African Development Bank (ADB),
14 percent from the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), and the remaining 13 percent from the
African Development Fund (ADF) (Table 1). Reflecting government priorities, most of the
operations were in the social sector (46 percent). This was followed by the financial sector
(16 percent), agricultural sector (15 percent), transportation (13 percent), water supply and
sanitation (10 percent) and industrial sector (1 percent). Before sanctions were imposed,
about 76.8 percent of the total commitments on all approved loans had been disbursed and
the balance of 23.2 percent was cancelled after sanctions were applied.
The country was under sanctions with the African Development Bank Group since February
16, 2000 due to the arrears situation. On October 6, 2006 the Seychelles authorities made a
payment of US$ 40 million as a first installment towards the clearance of its arrears owed to
the African Development Bank Group and paid the balance of US$ 6.75 million on
November 14, 2006. The African Development Bank Group consequently lifted all sanctions
and started discussions on possible reengagement with the country. Unfortunately, progress
was limited because from the second half of 2007 the country occasionally experienced
difficulties in meeting its obligations and intermittently slipped back into arrears. Seychelles
is now current on its obligations and an agreement has been reached with the government for
a joint ADB-World Bank reengagement strategy.
In the interim, the African Development Bank Group has been focusing on the possibilities
for the country to access grant resources, such as those available under the African Water
Facility and the Middle Income Countries’ (MIC) Technical Assistance Fund. Under the
African Water Facility, a grant amounting to € 955,000 was signed in May 2008 to finance
the preparation of the Water Development Plan aimed at improved water management and
governance, and identifying priority investment projects for funding, in order to meet
Seychelles’ water needs up to 2030. The study is expected to be completed by December
2009. In addition, two proposals that the Government has submitted for consideration under
the MIC Technical Assistance Fund are being processed. One request for a grant amounting
to UA 600,000 aims mainly to support human resource development, training and capacity
building as well as the establishment of the Seychelles University Foundation. The other
request is for a grant amounting to US$ 500,000 to finance studies for a Submarine Cable
System to link Seychelles to East Africa.

IV. SEYCHELLES: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision has some shortcomings, but it is broadly adequate for surveillance. The
country is participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and government
finance statistics modules of the Anglophone Africa project funded by the U.K. Department
for International Development (DFID). The country has participated in the GDDS since
December 2006. Despite recent efforts to improve statistical capacity, the country will likely
require sustained technical assistance and additional resources for statistical development
over the medium term in order to significantly improve the quality of economic statistics.
Real sector statistics
National accounts data are prepared on a calendar-year basis with 1986 serving as the base
year for constant price measures. In February 2008, the National Statistics Bureau published
new provisional national accounts estimates for 2004-2007 with 2006 as the base year. The
overall level of GDP was revised up by 25 percent in current prices due to improved
coverage and methodology. Further revisions are planned for late 2008 or early 2009. There
are considerable delays in compiling and disseminating volume measures of GDP.
Tourism statistics are compiled on a weekly and monthly basis. Production indicators are
compiled quarterly, and both are reported to the IMF in a timely manner.
Data on average earnings and employment by sector are collected on a quarterly basis by the
National Statistics Bureau, but there are no data on unit labor costs. The central bank
publishes a monthly estimate of the unemployment rate.
The consumer price index (CPI) utilizes expenditure weights derived from the household
budget survey of May 2006-July 2007. The base period is July 2007. Prices are collected on
or around the 15th of every month.
Government finance statistics
Government finance statistics are recorded on a cash basis broadly consistent with the
Government Finance Statistics Manual (1986). The authorities have participated in a GFS
pilot study that presented government finance statistics in the GFSM 2001 analytic
framework and are currently participating in a DFID financed technical assistance project.
The project – as follow-up to the pilot study – aims at improving the cash-based statistics for
operational and reporting purposes while also laying the foundations for the implementation
of accrual-based measures of fiscal performance and extending the institutional coverage to
include nonfinancial public corporations.
Annual data on consolidated central government transactions are reported for publication in
the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). The authorities have recently prepared

11
cash data on central government budgetary operations for publication in the IFS using the
GFSM 2001 Statement of Sources and Uses of Cash.
Monetary and financial statistics
Monetary data are reported regularly to STA for publication in the IFS. The analytical
framework underlying the compilation of monetary statistics is generally sound. An
integrated monetary database has been developed and is fully operational using the
standardized report forms (SRF) for reporting monetary data to the Fund. The SRF-based
monetary data have been published in the IFS Supplement since its March 2007 issue.
External sector statistics
The authorities have made substantial progress in adopting the methodology of the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. Trade data are reported on a quarterly basis, but
with some delay. Balance of payments data are reported to the Statistics and African
Departments generally nine months after the reference period, but provisional estimates are
provided to missions seven months after the reference period.
The quality of balance of payments data is impaired by the operations of the foreign
exchange parallel market, which divert transactions away from the banking system and into
the informal sector. Since the hiring of financial advisors, considerable progress has been
made recently in collecting and updating data on public sector external debt and debt-service
and external payments arrears.

The national assembly approved laws to remove all controls on foreign exchange and
market float of the rupee on October 31. On the first trading day (November 3), the
rupee depreciated by about 37 percent against the U.S. dollar, in line with
expectations. Exchange rates were highly variable during the first week, but there
were no major runs on the

Indirect product subsidies were eliminated, and the National Assembly approved the
creation of the agency on welfare, responsible to implement a targeted social safety
net. The safety net is essential to the authorities’ strategy to mitigate the impact of the
reforms on the population. The President also announced a graduated public sector
wage increase that is below the rate of inflation and a series of programmed revenue
measures.

•

The Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) announced that domestic price stability will be
the policy objective of the central bank. The nascent interbank market for deposits at
the central bank and for treasury bills has begun and interest rates are rising (Table 1).
Interest rates will need to rise further in coming weeks to positive real levels to
support the new policy framework. A new CBS Governor, a former Fund staff
member, was appointed on November 1 after the incumbent resigned. As the
safeguards mission recommended, the CBS has tendered for an external audit that
meets international audit standards and expects to finalize contract discussions
shortly.

Program financing assurances have been received from Paris Club creditors for
the Stand-By Arrangement. In view of Seychelles’ unsustainable debt situation, and in
accordance with the principles of the Evian approach, creditors also confirmed their
commitment to consider a debt stock reduction at some appropriate time in the future.
3.
The authorities are beginning discussions with other creditors. The authorities
and their financial advisors will commence a round of meetings with private creditors in
Europe and the Middle East in the week of November 17, 2008. They have also begun
discussions with non-Paris Club official creditors.

Real sector developments suggest a deceleration in tourism. While tourism spending
for the first six months was up 39 percent over the same period in 2007, in the third
quarter, it was down by 37 percent compared to 2007.

•

Inflation eased in September to 34.2 percent as energy prices declined.

•

Data through end-September reveal a better fiscal outturn than projected. The nine
month primary surplus was 5.8 percent of GDP compared to a projected 5.3 percent,
largely because tax revenues were higher than expected.

•

Monetary indicators are in line with the program. Reserve money growth has been
contained, and foreign reserves are above the end-2008 performance criterion floor.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 18, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Seychelles
On November 14, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Seychelles. 1
Background
Seychelles is in the midst of an acute balance of payments and public debt crisis, which
jeopardizes its high living standards and economic development. Despite step devaluations in
2006-07, the exchange rate has not been consistent with economic fundamentals for some
years. Competitiveness has been undermined by expansionary fiscal and monetary policies
inconsistent with the maintenance of the pegged exchange rate regime. External debt rose to
unsustainable levels, complex exchange controls and restrictions were progressively introduced
and foreign exchange shortages ensued. A parallel foreign exchange market flourished and
dollarization rose.
Reform efforts since 2003 have brought about some fiscal adjustment, trade reform and partial
economic liberalization, but have been insufficient to address longstanding macroeconomic
imbalances and vulnerabilities. In mid-2008, facing the near exhaustion of official foreign
reserves, the authorities missed a payment on a privately-placed external debt issue in July and
on a Eurobond payment in October. Standard and Poor’s has downgraded Seychelles to SD
(selective default).

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The oil and food price shocks, together with the global slowdown, have exacerbated
vulnerabilities. GDP growth, which has been strong since 2005 on account of high hotel-related
foreign direct investment (FDI) and tourism receipts, is projected to sharply decline in 2008 due
to foreign exchange shortages and less buoyant tourism growth. Inflation has risen rapidly
following the increase in world food and fuel prices and the 2006-07 devaluations. The external
current account deficit is projected to widen due to lower growth in tourism receipts, the
petroleum and food price shock, and higher costs of transportation services. As of mid-October,
official reserves had fallen to very low levels and the balance of payments is increasingly
financed by external arrears accumulation. In light of these developments, in 2008 the
authorities began to tighten fiscal and monetary policy.
The authorities have requested Fund assistance in support of a comprehensive reform strategy
aimed at restoring internal and external balances. The reforms include a fundamental
liberalization of the exchange regime, involving the elimination of all exchange restrictions and a
float of the rupee; a significant and sustained tightening of fiscal policy backed by a reduction in
public employment and the replacement of indirect subsidies with a targeted social safety net; a
reform of the monetary policy framework to focus on liquidity management based on indirect
instruments; and a reduction in the role of the state in the economy to boost private sector
development, through further privatization, enhanced fiscal governance, and a review of the tax
regime.
Although the authorities’ proposed fiscal adjustment is heavily frontloaded and sustained over
several years, a comprehensive debt restructuring involving a substantial reduction in the debt
service burden consistent with Seychelles’ long-term ability to pay will be needed to place public
debt on a sustainable path. At almost 151 percent of GDP, public debt is unsustainable.
External public debt represents some 95 percent of GDP (US$808 million), of which over 40
percent is arrears, mostly to Paris Club creditors and on the private placement. There is a small
amount of arrears to multilateral creditors. Following the missed payments on commercial
obligations, the authorities announced that they had hired qualified financial and legal advisors
and that they would approach creditors to seek an agreement on a comprehensive debt
restructuring, consistent with their ability to pay.
Executive Board Assessment
Seychelles faces a severe economic crisis—characterized by large fiscal and balance of
payments imbalances built up over several years, an unsustainable public debt burden,
mounting arrears, and dwindling foreign reserves—which has been exacerbated by the global
economic turmoil. Executive Directors accordingly welcomed the authorities’ determination to
undertake far-reaching economic reforms aimed at putting the economy back on the track of
sustainable economic growth and development. This reform effort merits the support of the
international community, including through comprehensive public debt restructuring.
Directors commended the authorities’ upfront liberalization of the exchange regime and the float
of the rupee. The removal of extensive exchange restrictions and discretionary regulations as
part of the reform program is essential to restore credibility of the currency and unify the parallel
and official exchange rates. Several Directors emphasized that, at this juncture, there is little

3
alternative to a floating market-determined exchange rate regime, especially as official reserves
are largely depleted. However, further reflection will be required on the best long-run monetary
policy framework and exchange rate regime for Seychelles.
Directors saw the significant tightening of fiscal policy in 2008 as a crucial element of
macroeconomic stabilization, and welcomed the accompanying provision of targeted support for
the most vulnerable groups. Key to program success will be the implementation of strong fiscal
policy reforms needed to maintain sizable primary surpluses over the medium term. These
include introduction of a targeted social safety net to replace indirect product subsidies and tax
exemptions and continuation of the public sector employment retrenchment exercise.
The public debt of Seychelles is unsustainable, even with the significant fiscal adjustment
envisaged. Directors welcomed the authorities’ good faith efforts to work with official bilateral
and commercial creditors on a debt restructuring strategy aimed at reestablishing public debt
sustainability consistent with Seychelles’ long-term payment capacity, based on the principles of
transparency, inter-creditor equity, and open dialogue with all creditor groups. They underlined
the importance of steps to strengthen public debt management. Directors looked forward to a
more comprehensive Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) to be provided at the time of the first
review of the stand-by arrangement as well as to regular updates on financing assurances and
safeguards.
Directors welcomed the major strengthening of the monetary policy framework under way,
notably in enhancing the ability of the Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) to manage liquidity
through indirect market-based monetary intervention. This will require closer collaboration
between the CBS and Ministry of Finance to improve liquidity forecasting and management.
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to strengthen financial sector supervision, and noted
that the budget includes a provision for the potential recapitalization needs of the sector.
Directors commended the authorities for taking several important measures to bolster public
sector governance and transparency, and encouraged the authorities to address all areas of
concern identified in the safeguards assessment. Steps to address weaknesses in data quality
and timeliness with technical assistance from the Fund will also be important.
Directors recognized that a comprehensive and sustained structural reform effort will be needed
to underpin economic growth and competitiveness over the medium term, and welcomed the
authorities’ intention to articulate such a medium-term structural reform agenda in 2009 with
input from the Fund, the World Bank, and other partners.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Approves US$26 Million Stand-By Arrangement
for Seychelles
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a two-year
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) to support Seychelles’ bold economic reform effort, with total
access equivalent to SDR 17.6 million (about US$26.1 million). An amount equivalent to
SDR 6.16 million (about US$9.13 million) will be made available immediately. The balance
will be disbursed in seven quarterly installments over the next two years, subject to the
Executive Board’s reviews of performance under the arrangement.
Following the Executive Board's discussion on the Seychelles, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chairman, made the following statement:
“The Seychelles authorities are to be commended for their strong commitment to, and good
start in, implementing a far-reaching reform program to address the macroeconomic
imbalances that have built up over the past decades.
“The authorities’ fundamental liberalization of the exchange regime, involving the
elimination of all exchange restrictions and a float of the rupee, is a critical reform step to
address the underlying causes of the balance of payments crisis. The availability of foreign
exchange at a market-determined price should, in due time, facilitate a rebound of economic
activity. In the near term, however, activity is likely to be subdued due to both the necessary
domestic adjustment effort as well as the worsening international outlook.
“The authorities’ reform program includes a marked tightening of fiscal policy, but leaves
significant room for targeted social programs. Strong fiscal policy reforms, including the
removal of tax exemptions and strengthening of public financial management, need to be
sustained in order to secure substantial primary surpluses over the medium term. The public
sector employment retrenchment exercise, together with the replacement of indirect product
subsidies by a targeted social safety net, are important reform components.
“Even with the significant fiscal tightening envisaged, Seychelles’ public debt would remain
unsustainable. Good faith negotiations with official bilateral and commercial external

2

creditors are critical in order to secure a debt restructuring aimed at reestablishing public debt
sustainability, consistent with Seychelles’ long-term payment capacity.
“The Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) has strengthened its ability to manage liquidity,
through the introduction of indirect market-based instruments. The program includes
measures to contain the risks to the financial system by bolstering supervision and a fiscal
provision for potential recapitalization needs by state-owned financial institutions.
“The comprehensive and bold nature of the authorities’ reform program merits the support of
the international community. While there are risks to the program, including from a global
downturn, the early and important policy reforms the authorities have already undertaken are
indicative of their strong ownership of the reform effort,” Mr. Kato said.

3

ANNEX
Background and Program Summary
Seychelles is in the midst of an acute balance of payments and public debt crisis, which
jeopardizes the population’s living standard and the country’s economic development.
Large macroeconomic imbalances and vulnerabilities resulting from longstanding
unsustainable macroeconomic policies, combined with recent external shocks, culminated in
mid-2008 with the near-exhaustion of foreign reserves and missed payments on public debt
obligations. Growth is declining and inflation has risen sharply. The exchange rate was
pegged at a level incompatible with fundamentals. In combination with a complex system of
exchange restrictions and controls this resulted in economic dislocation, a parallel exchange
market, and pervasive dollarization of the domestic economy.
The authorities have requested Fund assistance in support of a comprehensive reform
program. Acknowledging that past reform efforts have been insufficient to address
imbalances and vulnerabilities, the authorities have begun implementing a package of major
macroeconomic and structural reforms, including:
•

A fundamental liberalization of the exchange regime, involving the elimination of all
exchange restrictions and a float of the rupee was introduced in early November;

•

A significant and sustained tightening of fiscal policy backed by a reduction in public
employment and the replacement of indirect subsidies by a targeted social safety net;

•

A reform of the monetary policy framework to focus on liquidity management based
on indirect instruments; and

•

A reduction in the role of the state in the economy to boost private sector
development, through further privatization, enhanced fiscal governance, and a review
of the tax regime.

However, to close external financing gaps and put public debt on a sustainable path, these
strong reform efforts will need to be complemented by a comprehensive public debt
restructuring, involving a substantial reduction in public debt service obligations over the
long term to levels consistent with the country’s payments capacity.
The reforms are heavily frontloaded, with the bulk of the fiscal adjustment and other key
measures implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008. The projected turnaround in the primary
fiscal balance from 2007 amounts to about 8 percent of GDP in 2008, with sustained annual
primary surpluses of about 6½ percent through 2011. Fiscal reforms also include the removal
of tax exemptions, a strengthening of tax administration and public financial management.

Statement by Christopher Legg, Executive Director for Seychelles
and Simon Duggan, Advisor to Executive Director
November 14, 2008

Background
Following independence in 1976, Seychelles pursued a development model centered
around the creation of a social welfare state that successfully raised standards of health,
education and housing to amongst the best in Africa. While successful in raising social
capital and per capita income, this development model became financially unsustainable,
with achievements in social development increasingly funded through the accumulation of
public debt at commercial rates.
In 2003 the Government embarked on a reform and modernization effort (the
Macro-Economic Reform Program) that promoted Seychelles’ transition toward a
market-based economy, and in 2007 launched a strategy (Seychelles Strategy 2017) for
doubling nominal per capita income and achieving a substantial reduction in public
sector debt. By early 2008 achievements included: a large fiscal adjustment; the removal of
most universal subsidies; privatization of many state-owned enterprises; and a substantial
reduction in the pegged exchange rate (from 5.5 to 8 rupees to the US dollar over a 12-month
period). These reforms had some success, with economic growth averaging above 7 per cent
from 2005 to 2007. The pace of reform was not sufficient, however, to address the
magnitude of Seychelles’ macroeconomic imbalances, so vulnerabilities remained high.
In the midst of this transition, Seychelles has been hit very hard by the food and fuel
crisis and global slowdown, exposing economic fragilities and placing enormous
pressure on Seychelles’ external position. Inflation has risen to over 35 per cent, foreign
exchange shortages intensified and economic growth slowed abruptly. As a percentage of
GDP, Seychelles’ current account deficit has doubled from 14 per cent in 2006 to a projected
29 per cent in 2008, driven by higher global food and fuel prices and lower tourism earnings
due to the slowdown in Europe. Seychelles’ overall balance of payments position has
deteriorated from a small surplus in 2007 to a substantial deficit in 2008, funded through a
reduction in foreign exchange reserves and increased arrears to both official and commercial
creditors. Seychelles’ debt and balance of payments crisis came to a head in July 2008 when
the Government missed a payment due on a privately-placed external debt issue, and in
October 2008 when the Government was unable to make a coupon payment on a Eurobond,
prompting Standard and Poor’s to downgrade Seychelles to SD (Selective Default).
Seychelles’ Minister of Finance, Mr. Danny Faure, wrote to the Managing Director at
the end of June 2008 requesting an IMF-supported program. The support provided by
Fund staff since that time on the design of Seychelles’ economic reform program has been
outstanding. Following open and constructive dialogue with Fund staff, Seychelles is now
seeking a two-year Stand-By Arrangement to support a comprehensive reform program
directed at achieving macroeconomic and sustainable private sector led growth.

2
Economic Reform Program
The key pillars of the Government’s economic reform program are: full liberalisation of the
exchange regime; a significant tightening of fiscal policy; tighter monetary policy under a
new market-based operating framework; the replacement of universal subsidies with a
targeted social safety net; and a smaller and more efficient public service. The Government
has substantively put these reforms in place - a tangible demonstration of their resolve – and
is committed to taking additional measures as necessary to achieve program objectives.
Exchange Regime and Exchange Rate Policy
Seychelles’ external vulnerabilities are manifested in a misaligned exchange rate,
sustained by pervasive foreign exchange restrictions. Lack of confidence in the rupee has
fostered an active parallel market. In 2007 the Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) started to
gradually remove exchange restrictions, shifting foreign exchange dealing to the commercial
banks and allowing individuals to open foreign exchange accounts. While these were
important steps in the right direction, extensive restrictions remained – including a system of
foreign exchange retention and rationing operated by the CBS at the official rate to ensure
that essential foreign exchange needs could be met - and excess demand for foreign currency
persisted at the official exchange rate.
The CBS reduced the pegged exchange rate by 45 per cent against the $US over the 12
months to October 2007; however, most restrictions remained in place and the nominal
depreciation was compromised by loose liquidity conditions and increased spending by
state-owned enterprises, including to fund a doubling of Seychelles’ fuel import bill, adding
to inflationary pressures and undermining competitiveness gains.
With a very low level of foreign exchange reserves, limited external financing options and
large external debt obligations, the Government concluded that a pegged exchange rate
regime was no longer viable. Therefore, on 1 November 2008 Seychelles eliminated all
foreign exchange controls and floated the rupee. On the day of the float, the exchange
rate depreciated from 8.9 rupees to the US dollar to around 15 – broadly in line with the
previous parallel market rate. Consistent with international best-practice, the CBS will
operate in the foreign exchange market to avoid excessive volatility, meet the Government’s
foreign exchange needs and accumulate international reserves over time, but will not seek to
influence the exchange rate level.
The Government and CBS are committed to supporting the float through tightened
fiscal and monetary policy, thereby minimizing over-shooting of the exchange rate,
reducing second-round inflationary effects and ensuring that nominal exchange rate
depreciation translates to increased external competitiveness.
Monetary Policy
Prior to liberalizing the exchange rate, the Central Bank introduced a market-based
monetary policy framework directed at establishing price stability through greater

3
emphasis on reserve money management. In early-2008 the CBS started actively trading
in the secondary market for government securities and in early-October introduced weekly
auctions for both Treasury Bills and a central bank deposit facility. Implementation is
proceeding well, with T-Bill auctions well-covered, higher domestic interest rates supporting
demand for the rupee and a positive yield curve emerging. The CBS is committed to
achieving price stability through tighter liquidity conditions and increased interest rates.
The Government and CBS have also been working intensively with public and private
financial institutions, both before and after the float, to assist their transition towards
the new exchange regime and monetary policy framework. Our authorities are confident
that introduction of facilities for trading T-Bills, foreign exchange and deposits at the CBS
will promote more efficient liquidity management and support the development of an active
inter-bank market.
Seychelles is also committed to addressing risks identified by the IMF’s recent
safeguards assessment rapidly and comprehensively.
Fiscal Policy
The Government achieved a significant fiscal tightening in 2008, in line with the Budget
announced in December 2007. The primary fiscal balance improved from a 2.3 per cent of
GDP deficit in 2007 to an estimated 5.6 per cent of GDP surplus in 2008 (excluding the
transfer of valuation gains from the CBS). This is being achieved through a combination of
new measures, tight controls on nominal expenditure and revenue buoyancy following a
period of high growth and inflation. Nonetheless, the overall fiscal balance is expected to
record a 3½ per cent of GDP deficit in 2008, reflecting scheduled interest payments on public
sector debt of around 10 per cent of GDP.
Looking ahead, the Government will maintain primary fiscal surpluses of around
6½ per cent of GDP in 2009-2010 - even as nominal GDP growth slows - through
measures that will improve the structural fiscal position by some 5 percentage points of
GDP. The authorities recognise the importance of tightening fiscal policy to support the
objectives of the exchange rate float and monetary policy. The Government is also striving
to maximize the funds available for debt repayment as it works towards normalizing relations
with official and commercial creditors. A comprehensive list of revenue and expenditure
measures supporting the fiscal projections are outlined in the authorities’ Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), many of which have already been introduced.
The fiscal position will also be supported by strengthened public financial management,
tax administration and public debt management. Following up on the recommendations
of a recent IMF public financial management review, the Ministry of Finance is considering
options to further rationalise expenditure – including with the assistance of the World Bank
- and will implement measures to strengthen budget preparation, implementation and
monitoring processes. The Seychelles Revenue Commission has launched tax audits of the
20 largest enterprises and bolstered its capacity. On public debt management, the
Government will submit to the National Assembly a Public Debt Law before the end of 2008

4
and will formulate a medium-term public debt strategy that complies with the stringent limits
on the contracting or guaranteeing of new loans specified under its proposed Stand-By
Arrangement.
Structural Reforms
The program’s fiscal objectives are supported by the replacement of universal subsidies
with a targeted social safety net. The Government has repealed universal product subsidies
and is enforcing a cost-recovery policy in the provision of public utilities, thereby eliminating
a social welfare system that had been in place for over 20 years. In its place, a Welfare
Agency has been established to manage a new system of means-tested income support that
will protect the most vulnerable segments of the population while ensuring that incentives to
work are maintained. Importantly, the social safety net will be time-limited to guard against
welfare dependency. The Government also recently announced a modest increase in the
statutory minimum wage, public sector wages and social security benefits, partially offsetting
substantial declines over the last two years.
The Government is committed to reforming the public sector to support the fiscal
position, boost productivity and promote private sector activity. The public sector
accounts for over 50 per cent of the Seychellois workforce, with the government currently
engaged in areas that could be more efficiently provided by the private sector. In recent
years the Government has privatized a large number of state-owned enterprises and this
process will continue. A high-level government taskforce, headed by the Minister of
Finance, is conducting a comprehensive review of the range of services provided by the
government to achieve further rationalization. Moreover, in late October the Government
announced a 12.5 per cent reduction in the public sector workforce by 1 January 2009. This
will be achieved primarily through a voluntary departure scheme, supported by a retraining
and placement program to assist employees to transition to the private sector. A low
unemployment rate and significant importation of labour, primarily in the construction and
tourism sectors, provide clear evidence of the private sector’s capacity to absorb this cadre of
available workers. Through containing public sector wage increases, the reduction in
government employees will place downward pressure on the Government’s wage bill.
The Government will undertake a fundamental review of the tax system in 2009 that
will aim for simplification, a broadening of the tax base and low harmonized tax rates.
A number of important measures have already been taken in this direction, including the
removal of various GST and income tax exemptions and an adjustment to the GST rate on
tourism services. The next step is the removal of all provisions for discretionary exemptions
in the Trade Tax and Business Tax Acts from 1 January 2009. With the assistance of the
Fund, the Government is aiming to complete the review of the tax system in mid-2009.
International Support
Policy adjustment on its own will not be sufficient to relieve Seychelles’ debt and
balance of payments crisis. Closing Seychelles’ near term financing gaps and returning
future debt service payments to a sustainable level will also require upfront balance of

5
payments assistance under an IMF-supported program, debt restructuring and direct financial
support from donors.
On 30 September the Government announced that it will seek the support of creditors
in the restructuring of around $US800 million of external debt. Seychelles’ public debt
is over 150 per cent of GDP, two-thirds of which is external and some $US313 million is in
arrears. With the assistance of legal and financial advisors, the Government is committed to
developing a comprehensive debt restructuring strategy focused on the principles of
transparency, inter-creditor equity and open dialogue with all creditor groups. As a starting
point in this process, approval of an IMF-supported adjustment program will provide the
basis for discussions with the Paris Club creditors, who have indicated their willingness to
consider Seychelles’ debt under an Evian approach.
More broadly, Seychelles will require the assistance of donors to meet its financing
needs over the life of the program and to support the investments necessary to place the
economy on a sustainable growth path. The authorities welcome the positive signals that
they have received from the World Bank and African Development Bank and look forward to
engaging the support of bilateral development partners in the near future.
Conclusion
President Michel announced the Government’s economic reform program in an
address to the nation on 31 October. The President emphasised in his speech that
implementation will be challenging, with recovery from the current economic crisis only
possible after a process of substantial adjustment. President Michel also stressed that this is a
defining moment in Seychelles’ history, highlighting the importance of making a break from
the policies of the past and emphasising that strong implementation of the Government’s
economic reform program will underpin sustained growth and prosperity over the medium
term. Importantly, the Government’s reform program has attracted broad support politically,
amongst the local business community and within civil society.
The sentiment of the President’s address is captured in the program’s macroeconomic
projections, which show that - through adherence to their comprehensive economic reform
program and with the support of the international community - Seychelles’ GDP is expected
to contract slightly in 2009 before staging a recovery from 2010, inflation is forecast to peak
in the second quarter of 2009 before declining steadily over the projection period, and the
current account balance is projected to improve significantly from 2009.
As the above reforms take hold and macroeconomic stability is restored, the
Government will increasingly focus on addressing structural impediments to
Seychelles’ growth and development. The authorities are working with the IMF, World
Bank and African Development Bank on developing a comprehensive medium-term
structural reform program. Once this work is finalised, the Government intends to request a
longer-term engagement with the Fund under a successor Extended Fund Facility
arrangement.

Finally, my Seychellois authorities would like to thank the Managing Director, Deputy
Managing Director Kato and Ms. Sayeh for their support. They also extend their deepest
gratitude to the IMF’s Mission Chief, Mr. Paul Mathieu, and his team for their hard work and
dedication in assisting the design of Seychelles’ economic reform program.
