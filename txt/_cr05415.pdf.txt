Article IV consultation discussions were held in Kyiv during July 25-August 2,
and were continued at the Annual Meetings in Washington, D.C. on September
22-26, 2005. The Ex Post Assessment (EPA) of Ukraine’s longer-term program
engagement with the Fund was also discussed at the Annual Meetings. The
mission met with NBU Governor Stelmakh, Minister of Finance Pynzenyk,
other senior officials, and representatives of the diplomatic community,
financial institutions, think tanks, and entrepreneurs’ associations.

•

The mission comprised Mr. Jaeger (Head), Mr. Rossi, Ms. Schaechter,
Mr. Tiffin (all EUR), Mr. Flanagan (FAD), Mr. Halikias (PDR), and Ms. Ong
(MFD), and was assisted by Mr. Franks, Senior Resident Representative.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background. GDP growth this year has slowed sharply from 8½ percent during 2000–04 to
about 3 percent for January-August 2005. Export growth has decelerated, investment has
slumped, but private consumption has been fuelled by rising wages and social transfers.
Inflation has been on an upward trend since early-2003, and has been hovering around
15 percent for most of this year. Fiscal policy has been tightened, compared with 2004, but
massive hikes in public pensions and wages—financed by a concomitant increase in the tax
burden—have fuelled inflation pressures. Despite some attempted tightening by the NBU,
monetary conditions remain loose. The Ukraine-EU Action Plan contains a sweeping agenda
for structural reforms, but, aside from the trade policy area, progress has been limited.
Outlook. In the short term, GDP growth is projected to slow to 4 percent in 2005, before
picking up somewhat to 5½ percent in 2006. On the one hand, the projection assumes a
rebound of investment but, on the other hand it also assumes stronger external headwinds,
particularly lower terms of trade. The downside risks stem from the external sector as well as
a generally difficult investment climate. Inflation is likely to exceed the authorities’ end-2005
objective, and tighter and more coordinated fiscal and monetary policies will be needed to
bring inflation back into single digits during 2006. Under a strong reform scenario, Ukraine’s
medium-term growth outlook should be bright.
Policy discussions. The discussions focused on the following issues:
•

Staff argued that the authorities’ 2005 deficit target (2½ percent) needs to be met, while
the 2006 budget needs to be tight (deficit target of 2¼ percent of GDP) to support
disinflation. A key measure would be to ensure that wage and pension increases do not
exceed projected inflation in 2006. Staff also urged the authorities to base their 2006
budget on a realistic and consistent macroeconomic framework. The authorities’ draft
2006 budget aims at a slightly higher deficit target (2½ percent of GDP), but the
macroeconomic framework also seems optimistic. The budget could be significantly
changed in parliament.

•

Staff argued that monetary policy needs to be tightened and that the NBU should adopt a
more flexible exchange rate regime to allow better control of inflation. The authorities
have made some steps in this direction, but seem bent on moving slow and gradually,
particularly in the present political context.

•

The financial sector’s vulnerabilities and capacity to manage shocks were a concern to
both sides. Progress has been made on the regulatory and supervisory side, but key
legislation remains stuck in parliament and much remains to be done.

•

There was agreement that reforms that foster more market-friendly institutions are key to
sustaining Ukraine’s catchup growth and that the investment climate was of particular
concern. But the key bottleneck remains reaching political consensus.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The consultation discussions focused on the policy requirements for restoring
and maintaining macroeconomic stability, as well as improving medium-term growth
prospects. Following a generally strong macroeconomic performance during 2000–04,
recent inflation rates have persistently exceeded their target, while GDP growth has
slackened. And, notwithstanding the remarkable growth spurt during 2000–04, Ukraine’s
economy remains highly inefficient in using its available human and physical resources. This
mainly reflects slow progress in building more market-friendly institutions, and it also
highlights the significant scope for accelerated growth once a political consensus on the
necessity of reforms is established.
2.
Discussions took place against a fluid political background, and significant
uncertainties remain. Following last year’s tumultuous elections, President Yushchenko
was inaugurated in January 2005 on a reform platform that pledged to tackle pervasive
corruption and rent seeking. Following a close policy dialogue during the first half of 2005
(Box 1), the Article IV discussions in Kyiv were held during July 25–August 2, but shortly
thereafter, on September 8, the president dismissed the government led by then-Prime
Minister Tymoshenko. Prime Minister Yekhanurov was confirmed by parliament in a
second-round vote, and a new cabinet has taken office. Constitutional amendments that will
shift power from the president to the prime minister and parliament are scheduled to take
effect early next year, giving the March 2006 parliamentary elections added importance.

Box 1. Impact of Recent Staff Advice
A 12-month Stand-By Arrangement, treated as precautionary by the authorities, expired in March 2005.
Relations with the Fund through March 2005, including the effectiveness of policy advice, are discussed in the
Ex Post Assessment (EPA) of long-term use of Fund resources. This box covers the impact of more recent staff
advice since President Yushchenko took office, a period characterized by close policy dialogue and extensive
provision of technical assistance.
On fiscal policy, staff argued for a significant tightening of the stance in 2005, cautioning in particular against
going ahead with already-approved large hikes in public pensions, and recommending overall restraint on recurrent spending combined with broadening of tax bases. In the event, the 2005 supplementary budget adopted
in March 2006 targeted a deficit in line with staff recommendations (2½ percent of GDP). In addition, tax
loopholes were closed and pension hikes were partly rolled back. Nevertheless, the remaining increase in
pensions has left the pension fund in a precarious financial imbalance. And, against staff’s advice, nominal
public wages were raised by more than 50 percent, providing a strong additional impetus to inflation.
On monetary and exchange rate policy, staff noted that monetary conditions are loose and recommended
tightening while also advocating a shift to more exchange rate flexibility. In this context, the NBU welcomed
staff’s attempt to provide detailed analysis of policy options and risks. The NBU argued that it has taken
adequate steps to control inflation, including by stepping up sterilization operations, tightening reserve
requirements, and allowing some nominal appreciation of the hryvnia. Although agreeing in principle with the
need for more exchange rate flexibility, the NBU prefers a very gradual approach, which it considers to be more
in tune with Ukraine’s specific economic and political circumstances.
On structural reforms, the Ukraine-EU Action Plan provides a sweeping blueprint for structural reforms, many
of them long advocated by the Fund. Staff also called for a speedy resolution of the debate on past privatizations
of state-owned enterprises that started in February 2005, which, however, continued to linger, aggravating an
already difficult investment climate.
The recent policy dialogue, combined with intensive technical assistance, seems to have fostered internal debate
and reflection, even when the authorities and staff have disagreed.

household sector. And, at the same time, drifting structural policies and the budget’s sharp
hike in the tax burden have dampened private investment demand.
4.
Inflation has risen well into double digits. Since 2000, with the monetary policy
framework centered on defending the de facto peg to the U.S. dollar, inflation has remained
unanchored, decelerating initially when growth took off, but trending upward again since
early-2003. The lack of an effective anchor is indicated by the high persistence of inflation in
Ukraine (Figure 1).1 Recent inflationary pressures are mainly rooted in strong domestic
demand, particularly consumer demand for food items, fuelled by large increases in social
spending and wages. At the same time, pressures on producer prices have been receding
somewhat, mainly owing to a slowing economy. Efforts to fight inflation by narrowly
targeted administrative measures, such as price caps in the food and energy markets, may
have contained some pressures on the headline rate, at least temporarily.

B. External Sector Developments
The impetus from favorable external demand and prices is fading.
5.
Export growth, vibrant during 2000-04, has lost momentum. Ukraine’s economy
is highly open, with exports heavily concentrated in metals (Figure 2). Several factors
combined to underpin booming exports during 2000-04: strong price and cost
competitiveness; significant idle capacities; and strong external demand for Ukraine’s main
export items. More recently, however, exports have slowed markedly, reflecting an
appreciating real exchange rate and slowing global demand, including for metals.
6.
Ukraine has benefited from favorable terms of trade, but this external impulse
leveled off in 2005. Metal prices in particular have skyrocketed since 2003, and are presently
about 50 percent above their long-term trend (Figure 2). While energy prices have also
increased substantially, the overall movement in the terms of trade during 2003-04 has been
strongly in Ukraine’s favor, boosting corporate profits and accounting for most of the
increase in the current account surplus during 2003-04 (Table 2). But, in 2005 the upward
trend in the terms of trade came to an abrupt halt, as metal-price increases leveled off and
energy prices soared.2
7.
Capital inflows have been subdued since 2000, and foreign investor interest,
while picking up, remains cautious. The persistence of market-unfriendly institutions has
weighed heavily against capital inflows, notwithstanding booming growth and reasonable
prospects of macroeconomic stability. In particular, per capita FDI inflows during 1998-2004
remained very low; among transition economies, only the Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan,
and Uzbekistan have fared worse (Figure 2). But foreign interest is rising: rating agencies
have upgraded Ukraine, noting its low external public debt (19 percent of GDP in 2004) and
promising growth prospects; and sovereign spreads have narrowed significantly. Foreign
portfolio investors, also attracted by a perceived undervaluation of the hryvnia, have returned
for the first time since 1998 to purchase most of the government’s T-bills. But uncertainty
about the direction of policies, combined with a dearth of attractive financial assets,
continues to constrain inflows.

2

Ukraine, while a net energy importer, is well hedged against rising oil prices, as transit fees
for oil, along with higher Russian demand for Ukraine’s exports, act as significant offsets. At
the same time, prices for imported natural gas remain well below international levels, and the
potential convergence of natural gas prices to world prices constitutes a significant external
downside risk. See the Selected Issues paper “Ukraine: External Risks and Opportunities.”

C. Macroeconomic Policies
Recent policies have lacked consistency.
8.
The 2005 budget, while aiming at a significant fiscal tightening, massively raised
public pensions and wages, offsetting the spending hike by a similarly large increase in
the tax burden. The 2005 supplementary budget targets a state budget deficit of 1¾ percent
of GDP (Table 3). This is equivalent to a general government deficit of 2½ percent of GDP,
well below the 4½ percent realized during 2004, and the 6-7 percent implicit in the original
budget for 2005. The targeted fiscal tightening reflects a series of measures, including the
closure of tax loopholes, improved tax administration, higher state-enterprise dividends, and
steep cuts in capital spending. However, the supplementary budget largely accommodated
the previous government’s pension increases, and boosted the public wage bill, raising
average public pensions and wages by over 50 percent (against an inflation target of just
under 10 percent). Public pension spending in 2005 is projected to approach 15 percent of
GDP, up by 3½ percent of GDP compared with 2004—one of the world’s highest ratios
(Figure 3).
9.
Budget implementation during the first half of 2005, however, was on track.
Through end-June, the general government deficit, including VAT refund arrears, was
1 percent of annual GDP (the total stock of VAT refund arrears at end-June amounted to
about Hrv 3 billion, or ¾ percent of GDP). In the same period, expenditures were broadly in
line with targets. Apart from increased VAT refund arrears, buoyant cash revenue collections
mainly reflect the tax measures introduced in the 2005 budget. Corporate tax receipts have
been particularly buoyant (but may also reflect the lagged impact of last year’s boom), as
have customs revenues (reflecting an anti-smuggling program, and the shift of energy-related
tax collections to the border).
10.
Monetary conditions have remained loose. Apart from a short-lived episode during
last year’s financial near-crisis, the NBU has continued to purchase foreign exchange, while
sterilization efforts remained limited. The largest liquidity-absorbing support for monetary
policy has come from the government, which has issued new T-bills to buy back higher-yield
restructured securities held by the NBU, and which has built up deposits by maintaining a
tight fiscal stance (Table 4). The NBU’s own liquidity-absorbing operations, on the other
hand, were relatively limited, even when accounting for an increase in reserve requirements
effective September 1. As a result, there is high excess liquidity in the banking system, and
all interest rates, including banks’ lending rates, are now negative in real terms (Figure 4).
Monetary aggregates have expanded more slowly than in 2004, but this comes against a
backdrop of sharply decelerating money demand as inflation has risen into double digits.
11.
But the NBU has taken first steps toward greater exchange rate flexibility. The
first of these was a relaxation of foreign exchange control measures, including export
surrender requirements and the provision that non-residents predeposit the full amount of
their T-bill auction bids. In August, the NBU lifted the ban that required banks to operate
only on one side (buy/sell) of the foreign exchange market within the same day, and also
allowed forward operations. Together with the 1.5 percent foreign exchange transaction tax,

which the draft 2006 budget proposes to halve, these were the main impediments for
developing Ukraine’s foreign exchange markets and instruments. At the same time, the NBU
has introduced a new restriction on purchases by non-residents of government securities with
original maturities of less than one year, but which is likely to be non-binding (government
securities generally have original maturities that exceed one year). The NBU also introduced
a 20 percent reserve requirement on foreign currency loans with a maturity of up to 180 days
from non-residents. On April 20, in a surprise move, the NBU also allowed the hryvnia to
appreciate by almost 3 percent, and has since occasionally withdrawn from the market
(Figure 4).
12.
Reflecting high domestic inflation, the real exchange rate has appreciated
markedly. The real exchange rate fell sharply in the aftermath of the 1998 financial collapse,
and remained steadily undervalued after 2000, owing to the hryvnia’s de facto peg to a
weakening U.S. dollar and relatively high inflation in Russia. This undervaluation was
evident in PPP-based comparisons, large and growing current account surpluses, and the
significant buildup of foreign exchange reserves (Figure 5). Since August 2004, however, a
surge in domestic inflation and a modest nominal re-valuation against the U.S. dollar has
appreciated the real exchange rate by about 11 percent. In addition, U.S. dollar wages in
manufacturing have increased by almost 40 percent, and the current account surplus declined
considerably during the first half of 2005.
13.
Nevertheless, the real exchange rate remains competitive. Updated indicators of
price and cost competitiveness—including PPP-based measures, staff estimates of the real
equilibrium exchange rate, and international wage comparisons—suggest that Ukraine’s real
exchange rate remains below its equilibrium level, although quantitative estimates vary
considerably. Wages, in particular, are still about half the level prevailing in Russia.
14.
A lack of clear and market-friendly structural policies has dampened an already
difficult investment climate, weighing on the economy’s supply side. A protracted debate
on the scope and modus of reconsidering past privatizations of state-owned enterprises has
aggravated uncertainties about property rights—domestic and foreign investors have
responded by adopting a wait-and-see approach. Heavy-handed interventions to contain price
pressures in the fuel, meat, and sugar markets further added to a perceived drift in the
government’s policies. Finally, while there was tangible progress in certain areas, particularly
WTO accession, lack of political consensus has continued to hinder progress on long-delayed
structural measures, including the adoption of a joint stock company law.

D. Financial Sector Developments
15.
The banking system weathered last year’s political shocks well, but the nearcrisis also revealed prudential and supervisory shortcomings. The events surrounding the
presidential election triggered a shift into foreign-currency denominated cash holdings as
well as capital flight, resulting in a sharp decline in foreign reserves. The NBU responded
with a well-orchestrated package of liquidity support for banks, combined with
administrative measures aimed at slowing the hemorrhaging of reserves and deposits. Once
the political crisis dissipated, reserves and deposits quickly recovered previous losses.
However, the near-crisis has exposed several weaknesses, including: a legislative framework
that makes it difficult to prevent panic-driven withdrawals of time- and savings deposits; the
indirect exchange-rate risk resulting from lending in foreign currency to unhedged
borrowers; inadequate liquidity management by many banks; and a lack of administrative
preparedness by the NBU to handle a full-blown financial crisis.
16.
The banking system continues to be plagued by structural weaknesses.3 The
largest vulnerability of the banking sector is the potential impact of a disappointing
macroeconomic performance on the repayment ability of borrowers, particularly given the
sharp increase in banks’ loan portfolios over past years. Credit growth in August remained
high at 42 percent, after some deceleration in late 2004 and early 2005 (Figure 6). Banks are
refocusing on household-sector loans (their share in total loans has increased from 5 percent
at end-2001 to 19 percent by end-August 2005), including mortgage lending to a booming
housing market. These vulnerabilities are exacerbated in some banks by concerns about
capitalization, risk management practices, related-party lending, widening maturity
mismatches, and the still-high, albeit declining, non-performing loans ratio (Table 5). In
particular, low profitability—though also a reflection of tax avoidance—restricts banks’
ability to replenish capital from own resources. Competition, risk management practices, and
efficiency are expected to increase as more foreign banks enter the market, which has so far
been dominated by domestic banks.4

1/ Nonperforming loans (NPLs) comprise those classified as substandard, doubtful, and loss. The increase in NPLs in
2003 is largely due to a change in loan classification rules. The NBU estimates that at end-March 2004 about 94 percent
of substandard loans were serviced timely. Excluding these timely serviced loans from the NPL definition would reduce
the ratio to about 8 percent (see Table 6).

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Key Issues
17.
Ukraine faces several economic challenges and vulnerabilities, but also
opportunities:
•

Restoring macroeconomic stability is the immediate policy challenge. In particular,
what is the appropriate mix of fiscal and monetary policies to restore low and stable
inflation?

•

Ukraine is a potentially rich country, but slow institution building has resulted in a
highly inefficient economy. How can Ukraine achieve a path of sustained, rapid
catchup growth that brings it closer to its long-term potential?

•

While Ukraine has strong macroeconomic fundamentals in many areas, particularly
as regards public debt and external competitiveness, there are also significant
financial vulnerabilities. How could policies and reforms help minimize them?
B. Fiscal Policy

Present plans are tentative.
18.
There was agreement that reaching the 2005 general government deficit target
of 2½ percent of GDP was important. In staff’s view, while meeting the target would
support the authorities’ disinflation effort, the composition of the budget itself was a key
driving force behind inflationary pressures. The authorities viewed the target as important in
enhancing their fiscal management credibility, and were confident that they could reach it
while fully repaying the accumulated stock of VAT arrears. Financing the deficit—even a
higher deficit—will not be difficult, despite a potential shortfall in privatization proceeds,
given World Bank loan disbursements and good prospects for issuing a eurobond. Recent
preliminary data hint at buoyant income- and VAT collections through August, suggesting
that, with maintained spending discipline, the deficit target would be missed by only a small
margin, up to ½ percent of GDP (Table 3).
19.
The mission called for targeting a general government deficit of 2¼ percent of
GDP in 2006, underpinned by a freeze of real recurrent spending. While the deficit target
implies only a mild fiscal tightening, the recurrent spending freeze would help contain
domestic demand pressures by restraining nominal growth in social spending and public
wages—a key factor behind currently high CPI inflation. As part of an overall strategy, the
recommended fiscal policy stance would be consistent with single-digit inflation, without
overburdening monetary policy. It would also leave the general government debt ratio on a
gently declining trend (the level would fall by over 4 percent to 18½ percent of GDP).

- 19 -

20.
The authorities’ draft 2006 budget targets a general government deficit
equivalent to 2½ percent of GDP, broadly in line with staff recommendations, but the
actual outcome could be higher. As a general point, the authorities noted that the large
hikes in social spending in the 2005 budget need to be viewed as a one-time adjustment, and
that future budgets will have to focus on the country’s development and investment needs.
The draft 2006 budget was prepared by the recently-dismissed government and might still be
revised significantly, including in response to amendment requests by parliament.5 The draft
budget projects a strong rebound of real growth in 2006, 1½ percentage points higher than in
the staff’s baseline, and continued revenue buoyancy. As for revenue measures, the budget
includes a 2 percentage point reduction in the payroll tax rate, a halving of the foreign
exchange transaction tax, and an increase in the basic personal income tax allowance. On the
expenditure side, average public wages and pensions are envisaged to increase by some
18 percent and 13½ percent—both increases somewhat above projected inflation. Staff’s
preliminary estimates suggest that, based on a more realistic macroeconomic framework and
somewhat more

while nominal spending would remain roughly unchanged. A fiscal package to achieve this
target could include: expenditure cuts, including to subsidies, net lending, and goods and
services; a lower minimum wage increase in line with inflation; and further reduction of tax
expenditures. In addition, to reduce the risk of a discretionary loosening of the fiscal stance
in 2006, the staff urged the authorities to eliminate the provision that allows spending of
excess privatization receipts without previous parliamentary approval.
21.
The authorities aim at resolving the VAT refund arrears problem, but some
steps may not be effective. They have abandoned a recently-introduced risk-oriented audit
scheme, owing to its heavy information requirements. Instead, they intend to legalize their
practice of denying refunds to any claimant who sources from a chain where VAT was not
paid. On the positive side, they are strengthening their reporting systems to identify fraud at

an earlier stage. The mission urged the authorities to reconsider risk-based audits, but based
on a simpler approach.
22.
Regarding the medium-term fiscal policy agenda, the staff suggested that many
needed reforms could be implemented over time in a self-financing manner. For
instance, raising low civil servant wages could be addressed by cutting excessive
employment over time; tax-rate cuts could be offset by broadening the tax base (including
through reform of the simplified taxation regimes and improvement in tax administration);
and additional social spending on health and education could be financed by better targeting
of benefits. Increased reliance on public private partnerships to finance public investment
would be another option to help bridge resource gaps, but the staff strongly cautioned against
such an approach, at least until a capacity to monitor and assess related risks can be built up.
23.
The mission also argued that decisive pension reforms will have to be a key part
of the medium-term fiscal policy agenda. The recent pension hikes have effectively
dismantled the multi-pillar system envisaged by the 2003 reform.6 Ukraine’s pension system
is now one of the most expensive in the world, and massive budget transfers are needed to
cover contribution shortfalls. Furthermore, each contributor to the pension fund is already
effectively supporting one pensioner, suggesting that higher labor taxation will not be a
feasible solution. Ukraine’s difficult demographic outlook also points to a need for early
action. The mission suggested that the focus should be on better targeting the minimum
pension subsidy, lifting retirement ages, and pruning privileged pension regimes. To build
support for the reform, the mission suggested that the authorities strengthen transparency
regarding the cost of the privileged pension regimes. The authorities saw little scope for
discussing such reforms prior to parliamentary elections.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
The monetary framework is evolving slowly.
24.
The roots of Ukraine’s high and persistent inflation rate were subject to
different interpretations:
•

Staff took the view that the present monetary framework is unlikely to anchor
inflation around a low and stable rate. External and internal shocks have provided
inflationary impulses, but these impulses have faced little resistance from monetary
policy—as higher net international reserves under the de facto peg have translated
directly into higher monetary aggregates.

•

The NBU, while agreeing that inflation was ultimately a monetary phenomenon,
argued that the sharp increases in social spending and public wages, as well as some
supply side shocks, have been the main driving forces. In their view, the contribution

6

See Selected Issues paper “Rebalancing Ukraine’s Public Pension Finances.”

- 21 -

of monetary policy was relatively minor. Moreover, the NBU stressed that last year’s
near-financial crisis had distorted monetary and credit aggregates, and that it was
broadly on track toward achieving the monetary targets outlined in the NBU’s 2005
Monetary Policy Guidelines.
25.
Staff argued that the monetary stance needs to be tightened to bring inflation
back to single digits. The NBU should more actively absorb excess liquidity and limit
monetary growth to a rate consistent with an end-2006 inflation goal of about 9 percent. The
mission stressed that the effectiveness of monetary policy would be limited by maintaining
the de facto peg. At the time of the mission, staff viewed the NBU’s envisaged base money
growth target of 38-43 percent for end-2005 as too expansionary to achieve the
recommended end-2006 inflation target of about 7 percent. Money demand had slowed faster
than projected, reflecting rising inflation and the cooling of the real economy (Figure 3).
Staff therefore at the time of the mission recommended a slowdown in base money growth
during the remainder of the year (to about 32 percent) and a significant deceleration in 2006
(to about 22 percent) as the decline in velocity was projected to slow further in line with
experiences in more advanced transition economies. However, as monetary conditions have
not been tightened in the interim, money growth and inflation during the remainder of 2005
are now likely to exceed staff’s earlier recommendations.
26.
The NBU, while stressing policy uncertainties, argued that its planned monetary
stance for 2006 is adequate to reduce inflation to single-digits. The NBU did not view
monetary policy by itself as sufficient to address current imbalances, and called also for
tighter fiscal policy and accelerated structural reforms to increase aggregate supply.
Moreover, the NBU was concerned that a tighter monetary policy could worsen the growth
outlook. In its 2006 Monetary Policy Guidelines, the NBU envisages a sharp deceleration of
monetary aggregates—the lower bounds of the targeted corridors for base and broad money
growth are broadly in line with staff recommendations. The NBU’s inflation objective of
8.5-9.5 percent for end-2006 is in line with staff’s current suggested disinflation path for
2006, but only because the 2005 inflation outturn is now expected to be higher than if policy
had been tightened from mid-2005. The NBU underscored that the Guidelines are
preliminary and may have to be adjusted in response to other policy developments,
particularly in fiscal policy, and to changes in the Cabinet of Ministers macroeconomic
forecasts.
27.
Staff argued that the NBU can attain lower and more stable inflation by
adopting a monetary framework that allows for more exchange rate flexibility. The
current peg has served Ukraine well in the past but seems no longer to be compatible with the
objective of low and stable inflation. Staff also stressed that, as Ukraine successfully
implements institutional reforms, attracts large capital inflows, and secures sustained growth,
it should expect its real exchange rate to appreciate. In this context, the choice facing the
authorities was whether real adjustment would take place via nominal appreciation or higher
inflation, with staff arguing in favor of lower inflation.

- 22 -

28.
In addition, a more flexible exchange rate would have other advantages. It could
function as a shock-absorber for Ukraine’s highly open economy, stem speculative capital
inflows, and discipline unwarranted risk-taking by the private sector.
29.
The mission recommended that the authorities move gradually to a managed
float, and ultimately to inflation targeting. The mission urged the authorities to swiftly
proceed with their preparations for the new regime, in line with recommendations provided
by various MFD technical assistance missions (Box 2). If sufficient progress is made in 2006,
the NBU could introduce implicit inflation targeting in 2007, using, for example, its 2006
Monetary Policy Guidelines to communicate the characteristics of the new regime.
30.
While the NBU reiterated its commitment to move to an inflation targeting
framework, it favored a gradual approach not bound by a specific timeframe. The NBU
stressed that more exchange-rate flexibility would eliminate a key anchor of stability while
also negatively impacting competitiveness; a concern in light of the shrinking trade surplus
and the slowing economy. The NBU also emphasized the need to find a shared view on
exchange rate policy among the main government agencies.

Box 2. Preparing Inflation Targeting
MFD has provided substantial technical assistance to support preparations for more exchange rate
flexibility, as well as in support of an ultimate move to inflation targeting. The focus was on developing
Ukraine’s financial infrastructure and strengthening the monetary transmission mechanism. Both are
important preconditions for effective monetary policy, but even more so under inflation targeting. The main
recommendations included:
Develop foreign exchange markets by: (i) allowing banks to conduct forward operations and to trade in
both directions within the same day; (ii) eliminating the current limited trading session; (iii) reconsidering
the 1.5 percent tax on foreign exchange operations; and (iv) making the NBU reference exchange rate more
transparent. Most recommendations were implemented in August 2005.
Improve banks’ risk-management capabilities by: (i) allowing the use of hedging instruments; (ii)
encouraging banks to extend loans in foreign currency to borrowers who have foreign exchange income and
who are appropriately hedged against foreign exchange risks; and (iii) conducting a survey on banks’ direct
and indirect foreign exchange rate exposures, and closely monitoring banks’ ability to manage these
exposures.
Strengthen monetary policy operations by: (i) communicating more clearly the NBU’s main policy rate;
(ii) engaging in more active liquidity management through open market operations; (iii) securitizing the
NBU loan to the government, which could then be used for open market operations; (iv) improving
coordination between monetary and fiscal policy; and (v) promoting development of interbank and
government securities markets to provide benchmark interest rates.
Dealing with volatile capital inflows by: (i) reducing incentives for short-term inflows, including by
increasing the flexibility of the exchange rate and maintaining a consistent monetary-exchange rate-fiscal
policy mix; (ii) carefully sequencing capital control liberalization, including by liberalizing some controls on
capital outflows; (iii) avoiding new capital controls; and (iv) better monitoring and analyzing the nature of
capital flows.

The NBU has plans to revitalize a long-term lending facility for banks, which
staff has opposed firmly on earlier occasions. The NBU argued that such a facility would
allow it to expand its monetary policy tool kit and improve credit intermediation in the
economy. Staff noted that a similar facility, operated by the NBU during 2003–04, was
eliminated since it was viewed as interfering with the monetary policy function of the central
bank, exposing the NBU to considerable credit risk, and distorting market-determined
financial intermediation.
D. Near-Term Outlook
Given policy and other uncertainties, the near-term outlook is clouded.
32.
Compared with both official and staff forecasts, growth in 2005 has been
disappointing. With preliminary data suggesting that GDP growth over January–August
2005 has declined to about 3 percent (relative to the same period last year), and with a strong
rebound in investment unlikely before next year, growth in 2005 is projected to slow to
4 percent. From a regional perspective, Ukraine’s growth slowdown stands out and seems
mostly driven by factors specific to Ukraine. Staff project a modest recovery in investor
confidence after the March 2006 elections, but this will likely be offset by a further
deterioration in Ukraine’s external environment. Easing demand for Ukraine’s exports,
combined with significantly higher energy import prices, will result in a decline in Ukraine’s
terms of trade—which are assumed to drop by about 6 percent in 2006. The net impact is an
expected 2006 growth rate of about 5½ percent, underpinned in large part by continued
strong consumer demand.
Output growth in Ukraine is slowing faster than
elsewhere in the region.

Present policies are unlikely to bring 2006 inflation back into single digits. The
current budget envisages further social payments in the final quarter of 2005, adding to
upward pressure on household demand and consumer prices. Moreover, sharply increased
gasoline prices this year have raised transport and business costs and will continue to impact
the general price level. In sum, staff project that CPI inflation will remain firmly in the
double digits in 2005, with an end-year outcome of around 14 percent. Looking forward into
2006, the baseline scenario assumes that long-anticipated increases in utility prices and
tariffs will be delayed until after the March 2006 elections, complicating efforts to bring
inflation down in 2006. On the basis of the authorities’ announced policy intentions—with
continued monetary accommodation and no fiscal tightening—staff project that inflation will
likely remain in double digits.

Ukraine's trend of expanding current account
surpluses reversed in 2005.

Gross investment 1/

34.
Reflecting a significant downward
shift in savings, Ukraine’s current account
surplus is projected to shrink rapidly in the
near term. As noted above, fiscal policy over
2004-05 has effected a sizeable reallocation of
resources from the high-savings corporate sector
to the low-savings household sector. So, while
investment has remained subdued, savings have
fallen significantly—the counterpart to this fall
has been a decline in the current account
balance, with buoyant household demand
prompting a surge in import volumes.

Staff outlined to the authorities an adjustment scenario that would bring 2006
inflation back below 10 percent. Fiscal policy would need to play a key part in this effort,
with a general government deficit of 2¼ percent of GDP and a real freeze on recurrent
spending. On monetary policy, staff recommended a significant slowdown in the rate of
money growth in 2006. Staff also recommended that the NBU move to a more flexible
exchange rate—which would provide the autonomy needed to focus on inflation, and would
ease the burden on other policy measures if foreign exchange inflows were to persist. Under
the adjustment scenario, staff projected that inflation could be reduced to 9 percent in 2006,
with little impact on growth (the combined impact of tighter policy and a possible nominal
appreciation was unlikely to exceed half a percentage point).
36.
Looking ahead, macroeconomic policies should be implemented in a more
coordinated fashion. Over the past year, policies were not well coordinated; with
procyclical fiscal spending policies fuelling inflation, monetary policy putting up insufficient
resistance against inflationary pressures, and structural policies undermining the economy’s
supply side and growth momentum. Moreover, communication on policies has sometimes
left the public confused about policy objectives and responsibilities. The NBU noted that
efforts are underway to address these problems, including by reaching a formal coordination
agreement among key policy makers.

- 25 -

E. Institutional Reforms and Medium-Term Framework
Medium-term growth opportunities are considerable.
37.
The crux of Ukraine’s growth problem is low production efficiency, which in
turn is rooted in market-unfriendly institutions. Cross-country data suggest that Ukraine
uses its physical and human resources poorly, even when compared with other transition
economies. Furthermore, staff’s analysis suggests that this stems from weakness, in Ukraine,
of those institutions needed to create and regulate markets—proxied by indicators that
capture the security of property rights, degree of corruption, competence of civil servants,
and regulatory quality (Figure 7).7
38.
But reform of market-enhancing institutions seems to have essentially stalled
since 1998. The investment and business climate in Ukraine remains daunting—confronting
entrepreneurs with complex regulations, bureaucratic discretion, and corruption. Ukraine
continues to perform poorly according to Transparency International’s corruption perception
index, ranking 122 out of 146 countries in 2004. And broad governance indicators suggest
that this state of affairs seems to have changed little since the 1998 crisis (Figure 7).
Moreover, the strength of market-friendly institutions in Ukraine continues to lag behind the
more successful transition countries.
39.
Against this backdrop, the authorities have placed institutional reforms at the
top of their policy agenda. The president in particular has stressed the key role of marketenhancing institutional reforms in improving the living standards of Ukraine’s citizens. As a
strategic choice, the authorities have also emphasized the benefits of anchoring Ukraine’s
reform drive within a program of closer integration with the European Union and global
markets. To this end, the authorities have sought to transpose the Ukraine-EU Action Plan
into specific reforms and measures, including many that have long been advocated by the
Fund and other IFIs (Table 10).
40.
The authorities pointed to several achievements and reform plans. Notable
achievements included: (i) adoption of legislation to simplify the permit system, and to
mutually offset and restructure the debts of the energy sector; (ii) considerable reduction of
import tariffs on food products, appliances, and some groups of industrial equipment; and
(iii) establishment of a telecommunications regulatory agency. Noteworthy plans include:
(i) presidential decree on eliminating corruption and reforming customs administration and
procedures; (ii) adoption of a Cabinet of Ministers concept for comprehensive reform of the
internal financial control and auditing system; and (iii) legislation on regulating the scope
and modus of reviewing past privatizations, which was pending before the dismissal of the
previous government. The previous government also announced a large number (about 3000)
of targeted cuts in red tape and regulations, and the first steps have already been taken to
establish a new agency to assist foreign investors.

41.
The staff’s medium-term baseline scenario assumes a sustained structural
reform effort, but allows for delays or slippages. Stalled or unsuccessful institutional
reforms would sharply limit Ukraine’s longer-term growth potential, and might conceivably
be associated with increased macroeconomic instability, as implied by Ukraine’s own
experience during the 1990s. On the other hand, under the staff’s cautiously optimistic
baseline, a moderately successful reform effort would help boost productivity and support a
trend growth rate of about 5 percent. At the same time, if the authorities were to implement
their reform agenda in full, the experience of other transition economies suggests that
productivity can be increased significantly, consistent with a medium-term growth rate as
high as 8-9 percent (Table 6).8 With higher growth relative to the baseline, and assuming the
debt-GDP ratio is kept constant at about 16 percent of GDP over the medium term, this could
free up budgetary resources of about 2 percent of GDP annually, which could be used to
foster additional fiscal reforms. On inflation, the baseline scenario assumes that, as part of a
move to inflation targeting, the authorities will succeed in bringing average inflation down
into single digits in 2007; a similar monetary policy regime is assumed in the higher-growth
scenario, but this scenario also includes front-loaded policy adjustments in 2006, consistent
with a lower inflation path in 2006-08. This would then place Ukraine within range of a
feasible longer-term inflation target (4-5 percent) by 2009.
42.
Public debt is low and sustainable, assuming that risks from the savings lost
during the 1990s hyperinflation are contained. Sensitivity analysis suggests that only a
collapse in medium-term growth or the recognition of lost savings as public debt would pose
a serious threat (Table 8 and Figure 8). In particular, recognition of the lost savings as debt
(up to 30 percent of GDP) could more than double the current level of public debt. The
parliament and president have both made proposals in 2005 to repay this debt over extended
periods of time, and without awarding interest. In staff’s view, any settlement would need to
be sustainable and final, and carefully designed in view of financing, macroeconomic, and
budget impacts. Certain means of settlement, for instance mutual debt cancellation (which
has been utilized in 2005), should not be considered in view of adverse incentive effects.
43.
Externally, the baseline assumes continuing healthy export growth, but the
economy is also projected to return to an external deficit. The current account is forecast
to switch to moderate deficits by the end of the projection period. These deficits should be
comfortably financed by capital inflows, especially foreign direct investment and private
long-term borrowing. In this setting, gross international reserves should remain at adequate
levels, both in terms of import coverage and in relation to short-term debt. The changing

8

The higher-growth scenario is based on the assumption that the authorities implement their
ambitious reform agenda in full: i.e. the scenario assumes that, over the next decade, Ukraine
will have successfully met all the requirements for EU membership. A precise policy
roadmap is difficult to outline at this stage, and will likely evolve over time.

structure of the balance of payments is appropriate for an emerging market economy like
Ukraine, but also opens up new financial vulnerabilities—vulnerabilities that have been
largely avoided so far, owing to Ukraine’s recent relatively high-savings, low-investment
path. Key factors underpinning the medium-term switch in the current account position
include: an increase in investment; more rapid productivity growth relative to Ukraine’s main
trading partners; and real appreciation (mainly through nominal exchange rate flexibility
rather than high inflation).
44.
The medium-term outlook is subject to a number of external risks and
opportunities.9 On the current account, external risks include a much sharper-than-projected
reduction in world metal prices, a slowdown in metal export markets, or a rapid convergence
of Ukraine’s energy import prices, particularly for natural gas, to world levels. These risks
could entail a much sharper deterioration of the current account and an adverse impact on
growth. In this context, Ukraine’s relatively high external debt, which is significant by the
standards of most transition countries, suggests that, without substantial FDI inflows,
Ukraine could have difficulties running large and sustained current account deficits in the
future (Figure 9, Table 9).10 By contrast, there are significant opportunities on the capital
account. In particular, deep institutional reforms could result in FDI and other long-term
inflows that are higher than envisaged in the baseline, mirroring the experience of the more
successful transition economies. At the same time, the economy could also be faced with
more volatile short-term capital flows.
F. Financial Sector Issues and Vulnerabilities
45.
There was broad agreement that bank credit risks need to be monitored most
closely. Staff highlighted the banking system’s large exposure to credit risk, especially
against a deteriorating macroeconomic outlook, opaque ownership structures, and concerns
about capitalization. The increasing exposure to the real estate market, either through
mortgage and construction lending or through collateral, could become a major vulnerability
over the medium term if recent real-estate price increases were to reverse (housing prices
have quadrupled over the past 3½ years). Such risks could be exacerbated by populist
government policies aimed at boosting mortgage lending at below markets rates, as
envisaged in a recent plan for the State Mortgage Corporation, which, however, has not
found majority support in parliament. The NBU broadly agreed with the assessment and
stressed the need to improve the quality of bank capital to provide appropriate buffers against
shocks. In that vein, it plans to further tighten asset revaluations, has increased the minimum
core capital adequacy ratio from 4 percent to 5 percent, and has reduced the ceiling on
related-party lending. It also plans to strengthen banks’ reporting requirements on mortgage
lending.

The mission applauded these steps but reiterated that an increase in the minimum capital
adequacy ratio from 10 percent to 12 percent would serve as a further safeguard until riskmanagement practices and the quality of capital improve.
46.
But other risks also warrant attention. The mission argued that proper
foreign-exchange risk management will be key if banks are to adjust to an environment of
more exchange rate flexibility. In light of Ukraine’s political uncertainties, liquidity risk also
remains a concern and has prompted the NBU to submit draft amendments to legislation that
would limit early withdrawal of deposits. To address other risk-related concerns, the NBU
has reduced limits on open foreign exchange positions and tightened loan-loss provisioning
requirements. While the NBU has strengthened regulatory requirements, its supervisory
practices remain rigidly procedural rather than risk-based, as observed by representatives of
private banks. The mission also encouraged implementation of MFD recommendations on
strengthening the process of bank resolution.
G. Trade Policy
47.
The authorities have made progress in implementing their ambitious trade
policy agenda. The government has set itself two key trade policy objectives for 2005: (i)
acceding to the WTO; and (ii) receiving market economy status from the EU. To ensure
WTO-conformity of Ukrainian laws, parliament has adopted a number of key bills, including
on intellectual property rights. Moreover, significant tariff cuts have been enacted; and
parliament has also adopted legislation to lower the 17 percent export tax on sunflower seeds
by 1 percentage point per year upon WTO accession. But several WTO bills, particularly on
agricultural issues, have faced strong parliamentary opposition. Ukraine also still needs to
complete bilateral negotiations with a number of countries, including the United States.
While Ukraine seems close to being granted EU market economy status, recent issues raised
included bankruptcy laws, price controls, and the re-surgence of VAT refund arrears.
H. Statistics
48.
There seem to be no compelling reasons to doubt the broad integrity of the 2004
national accounts data. Several senior government officials have noted that export and GDP
statistics for 2004 might have been significantly overstated, reflecting fraudulent VAT refund
claims, and that this could explain part of the growth slowdown in 2005. The Statistical
Office took the view that, while investigation of the issue is pending, there are no strong
reasons to adjust the national accounts data before 2005. Staff’s own preliminary analysis
suggests that Ukraine’s export data seem to be broadly consistent with direction-of-trade
statistics, as well as the import growth of Ukraine’s trading partners, and dollar-price trends
of Ukraine’s main exports.

- 32 -

IV. RELATIONS WITH THE FUND
49.
The EPA attributes Ukraine’s disappointing transition experience mainly to a
lack of political consensus, particularly on building more market-friendly institutions.
Following a very difficult start (1992-94), Ukraine made gradual progress on macroeconomic
stabilization, but output kept tumbling owing to the slow pace of structural reforms
(1995-99). In the aftermath of the 1998 financial crisis, the economy rebounded strongly
(2000-04), supported by a favorable external environment, a highly competitive real
exchange rate, the authorities’ limited but focused structural reform efforts, and maintained
fiscal discipline—the latter partly necessitated by financing constraints. But indicators of the
institutions needed to create and regulate markets, which are vital in raising production
efficiency and sustaining long-term growth, have improved little since 1998. Tackling longdelayed institutional reforms should therefore be at the top of the authorities’ policy agenda,
as indeed recognized by the Ukraine-EU Action Plan.
50.
Based on this broad assessment, the EPA concludes that better program
ownership, rooted in stronger political consensus, would be key in improving the
chances of success for a potential future program-based engagement. The EPA notes that
Fund-supported programs were quite effective in supporting macroeconomic stability, but
did not help much in accelerating market-friendly institutional reforms, explaining Ukraine’
poor program compliance. The EPA also finds that transfer of macroeconomic knowledge
through continuous policy dialogue was a crucial pay-off from longer-term Fund
engagement. The success of a potential future program, if considered as an alternative to
continued surveillance, would depend critically on program ownership, including whether
structural reforms can be anchored externally, for example by the Ukraine-EU Action Plan.
In this vein, prior actions should focus on demonstrating that the authorities command
sufficient political and social consensus to assure program success.
51.
The authorities felt that the EPA put too much stress on the role of lagging
institutions in accounting for Ukraine’s transition experience, while shortcomings in the
Fund’s past advice received too little attention. They highlighted in particular the
significant progress on building fiscal and monetary policy institutions since 1998, with key
support from the Fund. As regards accounting for the 2000-04 growth rebound, they thought
too much weight was given to favorable external conditions, while the contribution of the
government’s structural reforms was underplayed. They also felt that the EPA should have
refrained from discussing the link between market institutions, which were seen as outside
the Fund’s competence, and Ukraine’s longer-term growth experience. Instead, the EPA
should have focused only on fiscal, monetary, and financial sector issues.11 Finally, they also
noted that past Fund advice has often been provided without outlining alternative policy
options, and that it insufficiently reflected Ukraine’s specific conditions. The authorities did
not express a view on the desirability of a near-term IMF-supported program engagement.
11

In response, the discussion in the EPA was adjusted by adding Box 3, which draws a
distinction between market-stabilizing institutions and market-enhancing institutions.

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
52.
While Ukraine faces considerable challenges, a focused improvement in policies
would help unleash the economy’s significant untapped potential. Ukraine’s highly open
economy, undiversified export structure, and terms-of-trade gains expose it to considerable
external risks. However, with more coherent policies and a focused effort at restoring and
maintaining macroeconomic stability—combined with sustained implementation of the
authorities’ structural reform agenda—Ukraine’s inefficient economy should respond
strongly, allowing catchup growth to resume.
53.
Over the last year, GDP growth has slowed sharply, while inflation has surged
into double digits. Over 2000–04, Ukraine’s economic performance has been impressive;
reflecting in part a favorable combination of external factors, but also reflecting a generally
prudent set of macroeconomic policies, especially fiscal policy. But, during the run-up to the
2004 presidential elections, fiscal policy shifted abruptly to a procyclical stance. And while
the supplementary 2005 budget targeted an appropriately lower deficit, it nevertheless added
to inflationary pressures by raising public pensions and wages, while increasing an alreadyheavy tax burden. Monetary policy has remained largely focused on defending the peg
against the U.S. dollar, and has for the most part accommodated excess demand pressures.
Finally, progress on structural policies has remained limited, while a protracted debate on
past privatizations of state-owned enterprises has raised concerns as to the security of
property rights, further clouding an already difficult investment climate.
54.
Tighter monetary conditions are needed to contain inflation. The NBU should
actively reduce excess liquidity in the banking sector, by constraining money growth to rates
consistent with the goal of single-digit inflation. This will most likely require a significant
deceleration in money growth in 2006, especially in light of the current liquidity overhang.
The lower bound of the NBU’s currently envisaged monetary growth corridors for 2006,
when combined with appropriate other macroeconomic policies, would be broadly in line
with bringing inflation below 10 percent by end-2006.
55.
The introduction of more exchange rate flexibility and an inflation targeting
framework would provide better leverage for achieving low and stable inflation. The
peg served Ukraine well in stabilizing inflation following the Russian crisis, but it now fails
to provide a firm nominal anchor. Looking forward, current-account related inflows will
continue to result in reserve accumulation under a maintained peg, given that the real
exchange rate still appears undervalued, notwithstanding the recent real appreciation.
Moreover, and in line with Ukraine’s substantial investment needs, sound macroeconomic
policies and institutional reforms could attract significant capital inflows.
56.
Tentative steps toward a more flexible exchange rate regime are welcome, but
the NBU should also communicate its policies more consistently. While the shift to a
more flexible exchange rate is neither simple nor risk free, Ukraine would still move from a
position of relative strength and could proceed gradually. But the modalities of the new
regime would need to be explained transparently to avoid market confusion. In this vein, the
NBU should build on its recent efforts—which have included significant deregulation of the

- 34 -

exchange rate market—and continue to strengthen its operational framework and the
development of financial markets. The NBU’s tentative plans to expand its tools and support
bank intermediation by a long-term credit facility should be re-considered. The NBU should
see its main role in providing liquidity, rather than longer-term credit, to the banking system.
57.
Fiscal policy needs to support disinflation in 2006. For 2005, the authorities should
seek to achieve the budget deficit target of 2½ percent of GDP, while clearing all legitimate
VAT refund arrears. For 2006, the draft budget submitted to parliament in mid-September,
while targeting a general government deficit of 2½ percent of GDP, appears to be based on
unrealistic macroeconomic assumptions. Moreover, it contains policies that might be
revisited. Staff recommends maintaining a tight fiscal stance in 2006, including by targeting
a general government deficit of 2¼ percent of GDP and freezing re-current expenditures in
real terms. If new initiatives in the draft budget are upheld, they should be financed through
spending cuts or measures to broaden the tax base.
58.
There is also a strong case for improving policy coordination between the
government and the NBU. International experience shows that assigning clear objectives
and roles to policy makers is key for ensuring macroeconomic stability and sustained growth.
Staff therefore welcomes a recent NBU initiative to reach a more formal understanding on
policy coordination between the NBU and the government.
59.
Restoring a viable public pension fund would open significant room for higher
public investment and lower taxes in the medium-term. The recent pension hikes have put
the pension fund in a precarious financial position, requiring large budget transfers to cover
contribution shortfalls and constraining the room for reducing the high tax burden on labor.
The authorities’ focus should be on better targeting the minimum pension subsidy, lifting
retirement ages, and pruning privileged pension regimes.
60.
The main impetus for sustained growth will have to come from the new
administration’s welcome vision of sweeping structural reforms. Even accounting for the
growth rates of 2000-2004, Ukraine’s performance has lagged significantly behind that of
most other transition economies; and this shortfall ultimately reflects a failure to agree upon
and build the market-enhancing institutions that would allow Ukraine to use its resources
more efficiently. An ambitious reform agenda is both timely and appropriate, and the new
administration’s goals in this regard are promising—the Ukraine-EU Action Plan commits
the authorities to a wide range of actions, anchoring the institutional reform drive within
closer integration with the EU and global markets.
61.
A rapid resolution of the debate on past privatizations is needed. The recent
presidential memorandum guaranteeing property rights, as well as the government’s efforts
to clearly and quickly identify those state enterprises to be privatized, along with the official
commitment to fully comply with privatization legislation is welcome. However, a credible
legislative proposal is needed that outlines the full scope of possible challenges to past
privatizations. Such a proposal would help eliminate investor uncertainty and strengthen the
prospects for successful new privatizations. More broadly, the authorities should give priority
to improving the investment climate. Entrepreneurs and investors currently have to negotiate

- 35 -

a daunting array of excessive, opaque, and discretionary regulations, so the authorities’ goal
of targeting some 3,000 unhelpful regulations for elimination is a welcome first step.
62.
The ambitious trade-policy agenda is also highly welcome. Trade will be key in
improving overall productivity, leading to the creation of new and better-paid jobs, and also
helping improve corporate transparency. The liberalization achieved so far this year
constitutes an important step, but early implementation of the pending measures needed for
WTO membership should remain a priority.
63.
Development of domestic capital markets is important. In line with earlier Fund
and World Bank recommendations, the authorities should focus on establishing benchmark
issues for government securities, setting up a coherent debt management strategy, and swiftly
adopting a Joint Stock Company Law. In addition to their role in risk management and
financial intermediation, more developed capital markets will facilitate the shift to inflation
targeting by strengthening the transmission mechanism.
64.
The financial sector’s supervisory framework should be strengthened further.
Regulatory changes to tighten requirements have been positive, including: foreign-currency
loan-loss provisioning; open foreign currency positions; limits for related-party lending; and
the definition of capital. But it is essential to approve the long-delayed amendments to the
Banking Act, which would require identification of bank owners. Revisions to the Civil Code
and the Banking Act to limit early withdrawal of deposits should also be a priority to
safeguard against a future liquidity crisis. Moreover, the authorities should move from their
current, highly-procedural supervision methods to a more risk-based framework, and they
should strengthen their bank resolution process. Also, improving the quality of capital is key,
so until this is achieved and the structural weaknesses of the banking system have been
overcome, the authorities should consider raising the minimum capital adequacy ratio to
12 percent.
65.
There has been tangible progress on statistics, which are broadly adequate for
surveillance, but shortcomings remain. The recent controversy about the integrity of the
2004 export and GDP statistics should be resolved speedily, based on impartial assessments.
Further improvements of statistical data should focus on reconciling stock data on sectoral
financial assets and liabilities with flow data, particularly on the external side. Also, the
quality of labor market data, particularly on wages and employment, could be improved.
66.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Increase in nonperforming loans (NPLs) in 2003 partly due to new classification rules.
2/ The NBU estimates that as of end-March 2004, 6.2 percent of loans classified as substandard were being timely serviced.
3/ NPLs are those classified as substandard, doubtful, and loss.
4/ About half of the drop in the provision to NPL ratio from end-2002 to end-2003 is due to new loan classification rules.

1/ The consolidated government budget balance includes the central government, local governments and social funds. It excludes US$ 98 million of non-cash property income paid annually by Russia
in exchange for amortization of Ukraine's debt to Russia, which are included in the authorities’ official figures. Clearance of VAT refund arrears is reflected in the consolidated government (cash basis)
through a reduction of net VAT cash revenues. Any outstanding stock of arrears is reflected in the general government balance (commitments basis).
2/ Government and government-guaranteed debt, and NBU debt. Excludes debts by state-owned enterprises.
3/ The baseline scenario is based on current macroeconomic policies and the authorities' plans for structural reforms.
4/ The high growth scenario assumes fiscal and monetary tightening in 2006, some nominal and real appreciation of the hryvnia, and an acceleration of structural reforms in line with the Ukraine-EU Action plan over the medium term.

1/ Government and government-guaranteed debt and arrears, plus NBU debt. Excludes debt by state-owned enterprises.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency denominated debt;
and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Average nominal interest rate on public debt (in percent) 8/
Average real interest rate (nominal rate minus change in GDP deflator, in percent)

2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP
γροωτη ρατε, ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes. The large historical residuals mainly reflect balance of payment items (portfolio equity and short-term capital outflows) that are not
included in the stock of foreign assets as captured by the official international investment position data.
5/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

Safeguards Assessments:

The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) was subject to a safeguards assessment with respect to
the Stand-by Arrangement, approved on March 29, 2004. The safeguards assessment was
completed on July 14, 2004. The assessment found that the NBU has made progress in recent
years to strengthen its safeguards framework, however, further improvements can be made in
some areas, notably the financial reporting and legal structure and independence areas. The
main recommendations of the assessment include (i) full adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS), (ii) a detailed review of the NBU Law, and other legislation that
impinges on the central bank, in order to strengthen the NBU's independence, and (iii) semiannual audits by the NBU's internal audit function of the monetary data reported to the Fund.
VIII. Exchange Arrangements:
In September 1996, the authorities introduced the hryvnia (HRV) at a conversion rate of
karbovanets (Krb) 100,000 to HRV 1. The rate was initially informally pegged to the dollar.
In September 1997, the peg was replaced by a formal band of HRV 1.7–HRV 1.9 per
U.S. dollar. The limits of the band were moved on several occasions, most recently on
February 9, 1999, to HRV 3.4–4.6 per U.S. dollar. Since March 19, 1999, the exchange rate
for the hryvnia has been allowed to be determined by the interbank market for foreign
exchange. On February 22, 2000, the NBU officially confirmed its intention of allowing the
free float of the hryvnia. However, the authorities intervene regularly to limit fluctuations in
the exchange rate, so the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified, effective
January 1, 2001, as a conventional pegged arrangement. On August 30, 2005 the hryvnia
stood at HRV 5.05 per U.S. dollar.

2

This schedule is not the currently applicable schedule of payments to the IMF . Rather, the
schedule presents all payments to the IMF under the illustrative assumption that repayment
expectations-except for SRF repayment expectations-would be extended to their respective
obligation dates by the IMF Executive Board upon request of the debtor country. SRF
repayments are shown on their current expectation dates, unless already converted to an
obligation date by the IMF Executive Board.

- 50 -

APPENDIX I

On September 24, 1996, Ukraine accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and
4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, and two remaining restrictions were eliminated in
May 1997. A number of new restrictions were introduced in September 1998. The
restrictions on current international transactions introduced in September 1998 were removed
in March 1999.

Article IV Consultation:

Ukraine is on the standard 12-months consultation cycle. The staff report (IMF Country
Report No.05/15), and the Selected Issues (IMF Country Report No.05/20) and Statistical
Appendix (IMF Country Report No.05/21) were considered by the Executive Board on
October 25, 2004, and published January 24, 2005.

FSAP Participation and ROSCs

A joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission conducted an assessment of
Ukraine financial sector as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) between
May 10–24, 2002. An update mission visited Ukraine between February 18–21, 2003,and the
Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) report (IMF Country Report No. 03/340) was
considered by the Executive Board on May 14, 2003. A further FSAP follow-up mission
visited Kyiv between July 25-August 2, 2005. The observance of the following standards and
codes were also assessed: Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision; Code of
Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies; CPSS Core Principles
for Systemically Important Payment Systems; OECD Principles for Corporate Governance;
Accounting and Auditing Practices; World Bank’s Principles and Guidelines for Effective
Insolvency and Creditor Rights System; and AML/CFT Methodology. A Data ROSC Module
was conducted in April 3–17, 2002, and was considered by the Executive Board on August 5,
2003 (IMF Country Report No. 03/256). A Fiscal Transparency Module (experimental) was
issued in September 1999, and an update in April 2004 (IMF Country Report No. 04/98).

APPENDIX II

UKRAINE: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(September 2005)
Country Assistance Strategy
The World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ukraine was approved on October
23, 2003. It covers fiscal years 2004–07, and its major focus is to support the “European
choice” agenda of Ukraine—including further institutional reform that would lead to a
business-friendly environment and a more inclusive and responsive government. It
emphasizes the need to work toward Ukraine’s European goal both from the top, through
reform of institutions and policies, and from the bottom, through strengthening of civil
society, which will help to increase public sector accountability. The strategy proposes a
US$2.4 billion Base Case lending program. Allowance is also made for a more ambitious
High Case (up to a maximum of US$3 billion).
A distinct feature of the Ukraine CAS is its results orientation—the amount and content of
financial assistance will depend on the ability of the Government to accomplish the relevant
benchmarks.
On July 5, 2005 the Executive Board reviewed the CAS Progress Report which assessed the
first two years of the CAS implementation and discussed proposals for the program
adjustment. While the overall goals remain broadly unchanged, the strategic priorities
outlined in the CAS were adapted to the country’s evolving needs.
World Bank Program
There are 11 operations under implementation in the current project portfolio with total net
IBRD commitments of US$ 1,010.4 million, including 10 investment projects totaling
US$759.1 million, and the first Development Policy Loan (DPL) in the amount of
US$251.3 million. The second final tranche of the Programmatic Adjustment Loan 2 (PAL2)
was disbursed in June 2005. Ten projects are currently under preparation.
The new series of Development Policy Loans were designed to integrate government and
donor activities under three broad themes to improve public governance: investment climate;
public administration and public finance management; and social inclusion.
Among other projects in the public sector are the State Tax Service Modernization Project
(US$ 40million), and a Statistical System Modernization Project (US$30 million).
In the area of rural development, the World Bank supports establishment of the unified
registry under Rural Land Titling and Cadastre Development Project (US$195 million).
The Bank’s support for the energy sector has been significant and is expected to increase
with a sequence of sector investment loans. The first one, the Hydropower Rehabilitation
project (US$106 million), was approved in June 2005. The projects on power transmissions
and pump storage are under preparation. The Kyiv District Heating Improvement Project

- 54 -

APPENDIX II

(US$160 million) is under implementation, and the US$18.29 million Kyiv Public Building
Energy Efficiency Project has been successfully completed in June 2005.
In the infrastructure, the Lviv Water and Wastewater Project (US$24.25 million) is under
implementation. An Urban Infrastructure Project (US$80 million) is under preparation, and is
designed to provide loans to local governments and utilities for priority investments in water,
wastewater and solid waste sector.
In the area of private sector development and financial-sector reform, the Bank has two
projects under preparation: the Access to Financial Services project (US$125 million) will
provide for increased access by the rural population and by municipalities to financial
services, and a Second Export Development Project (US$150 million) is being prepared to
build upon the success of the first project and to promote the Ukrainian economy’s export
capacity and to strengthen the institutional capacity of Ukreximbank. The Private Sector
Development Loan (US$30 million), which was approved in March, 2002, has experienced
serious implementation difficulties and has been cancelled.
The Bank has devoted considerable resources to the social sector assistance. The
US$50 million Social Investment Fund Project, which supports the development of
community-based social services for the most vulnerable groups, was approved in late 2001.
The US$60 million Tuberculosis and AIDS Epidemic Control Project was approved in
December 2002. An Equal Access to Quality Education project in the amount of
US$86.6 million was approved in May 2005. Projects aimed at modernization of Social
Assistance System (US$101 million) and at Health Reform (US$100 million) are under
preparation.
The Bank is also providing significant non-lending support. Through the People's Voice
Program, the World Bank initiated a new generation of programs in Ukraine that focus on the
development of civil society. This program is aimed at building integrity at the municipal
level through strengthening the voice of citizen groups demanding better governance and
services, and by facilitating more responsive public organizations.
The main focus of the Global Development Learning Network Project is to help build and
strengthen administrative and institutional capacity in Ukraine through provision of access to
learning facilities from a variety of global sources.
The Bank also carries out extensive program of economic research, including recent studies
on tax policy and tax administration, regional policy, intergovernmental reform, pension
policy, public expenditures and the budget process, poverty, financial sector and corporate
governance, procurement system, financial accountability, health, education, energy and
agriculture. Recently published reports also include Country Economic Memorandum, and a
Trade Study. Reports under preparation are Public Expenditure Review, and a package of
policy notes linked to the PAL/DPL program.

APPENDIX III

UKRAINE: RELATIONS WITH THE EBRD
(September 2005)
Ukraine joined the EBRD in 1992 and since then the EBRD has been active in supporting
Ukraine’s transformation toward a market economy, promoting the business environment
and improving the investment climate for all investors. The EBRD’s main contribution has
been the funding of projects in both the pubic and private sectors, including some equity
investments. This has been supported by a range of technical cooperation activities and by
engaging in policy dialogue with the government. The latter has included membership of the
Foreign Investment Advisory Council, but more especially, and in a sector-focused manner,
through the EBRD’s co-chairmanship of the Energy Sector Task Force and the Transport
Working group recently established between EBRD and the Ministry of Transport.
The EBRD’s first country strategy for Ukraine was approved in October 1992 and was
revised in November 1993. These two documents underlined the need for financing private
sector projects, developing the financial sector and rehabilitating existing infrastructure. In
June 1997, the Board of Directors approved a new country strategy which in addition to the
objectives listed above, emphasized the need to restructure the energy sector. During the
period covered by this strategy, the EBRD and the Ukraine authorities established the Energy
Sector Task Force (ESTF). The ESTF became one of the main channels for the EBRD to
engage in policy dialogue with the authorities on reform in the energy sector, a dialogue
which continues today. Among the main achievements of the ESTF was its work setting
appropriate conditions, especially with respect to tariffs, for the privatization of the first
power distribution companies to strategic investors in April 2001.
A revised country strategy was approved by the Board in August 2000 which focused on
strengthening the financial sector and supporting the needs of SMEs; promoting the
commercialization and structural reform of public utilities; improving energy efficiency and
supporting the transition of the enterprise sector, especially in agribusiness. In addition
during these years the EBRD sought to improve nuclear safety through the Nuclear Safety
Account and the Chernobyl Shelter Fund initiatives, and also sought to ensure a clear
understanding of the conditions to be fulfilled in respect of the K2R4 project financing to
cover the completion of two nuclear power plants. In order to help strengthen the
implementation of its projects, the post of Director for Banking Operations in Ukraine, based
in Kyiv, was established towards the end of 2000.
In the 2002 Country Strategy, which was approved by the EBRD Board in September 2002,
the EBRD resolved to further expand its activities in Ukraine, building on the period of rapid
economic growth, the progress in reform in some sectors, for example energy and
agriculture, as well as its success in attracting more non-EBRD financing. The main elements
of the EBRD’s operational strategy since have been: encouraging sustained momentum in
privatization and commercialization of major utilities, encouraging energy efficiency in both
the state and private sectors, providing funding through the banks to develop the small and
medium business sector (SMEs) and commence funding for the agricultural sector through
the provision of working capital.

- 56 -

APPENDIX III

To support these activities the EBRD emphasized the importance of policy dialogue with the
authorities to improve the investment climate, the need to maintain co-ordination with other
IFI’s and also with bilateral donors to secure valuable sources of TC funding.
This approach was endorsed in a first Program of Co-operation signed in April 2003 by the
Government of Ukraine and the EBRD. The agreement identified several priority projects in
the public sector including those in the transport, energy and municipal infrastructure sectors,
and emphasized the importance of nuclear safety. The EBRD also stressed its support for the
development of the private sector, particularly the banking sector.
With respect to the K2R4 project, this project was approved by the EBRD Board in July
2004 and signed later that month. The EBRD will lend US$42 million, with a further
US$83 million from the European Commission (Euratom), to finance post start-up safety and
modernization measures at the two nuclear reactors. The focus of the project is to enhance
nuclear safety and was approved on the basis that the previously agreed safety levels (before
start-up) at the two reactors had been attained and that the completion of the remaining safety
features would be to internationally accepted standards. A further condition of the loan is that
tariff levels within the nuclear sector should be sufficient to enable the authorities to establish
a decommissioning fund, as well as other funds to commence a program of safety upgrades at
the other 13 nuclear plants in Ukraine. The respective loan and guarantee agreements were
ratified by the Parliament if Ukraine in September 2005.
As regards the development of the financial sector and financing for SMEs, the Bank
continued to finance small and medium enterprises through a US$ 88 million sovereign
SME II Credit Line and started to provide financing through local banks without sovereign
guarantee. A new US$ 200 million framework for SME/MSE lending direct through local
banks was approved in December 2004. During the strategy period, the EBRD also
contributed to the good progress in developing the Warehouse Receipt Programme (WHR)
through the finalization of three projects based on the provision of working capital financing
against WHRs.
In 2004 EBRD continued its efforts in establishing a framework for direct lending to
municipalities. The Bank began the preparation of the first investment project in the
municipal sector without a sovereign guarantee for the city of Dnipropetrovs’k.
The current EBRD Country Strategy for Ukraine, which was approved by the EBRD Board
in May 2005, outlined three main areas of operational focus:
¾ Helping to improve the business climate and the competitiveness of private sector by
encouraging and sharing risk with foreign direct investors, promoting syndications,
enhancing integrity and corporate governance in local private sector projects, and
supporting environmental and energy efficiency related projects.
¾ Strengthening the institutional capacity of the financial sector and increasing the level of
finance for micro enterprises and SMEs by supporting consolidation in the banking

- 57 -

APPENDIX III

sector, providing specialized credit lines, working with more banks and starting to work
with insurance companies and other non bank financial institutions.
¾ Supporting the restructuring and modernization of Ukraine’s road, railway, harbor,
airport infrastructure, power and oil & gas sectors by financing sovereign guaranteed
projects that help promote transition goals such as greater commercialization or more cost
reflective pricing, and promoting new non-sovereign guaranteed structures and providing
pre-privatization finance.
The new strategy was underpinned by a second Program of Co-operation for 2005–06 signed
in September 2005 by the Government of Ukraine and the EBRD. The agreement identified
several priority projects in the public sector including those in the transport, energy and
municipal infrastructure sectors.
The EBRD’s portfolio in Ukraine has increased from 5 projects in 1994 to 64 by the end of
August 2005. These amount to a historical net cumulative business volume of EUR 1,935.2
million. Of this amount EUR 1,055.6 million represented the portfolio (operating assets plus
undrawn commitments) of which about 60 percent was assigned to the private sector (EUR
628 million) and the remaining to the state sector (EUR 426.8 million). Operating assets
amounted to EUR 533,9 million at the end of August 2004.
The outstanding commitments to Ukraine represent about 7.2 percent of the total of the
EBRD’s commitments to all its countries of operation as of end-August 2005. There are in
addition Technical Cooperation activities in Ukraine which, as of March 2005, included
239 projects with a total value of commitments of almost EUR 57 million. These are mainly
related to project preparation and implementation.
Projects in the financial sector account for about 23 percent of the EBRD’s commitment to
Ukraine, with much of this represented by the loans provided under sovereign guarantee to
support the development of small and medium size companies through lending via
participating banks. The energy sector accounts for a further 16 percent of all net
commitments. The largest single project in this category is in the power sector; other projects
include the development of oil and gas resources, gas transit and energy efficiency. Projects
in general industries, including agribusiness, represent about 33 per cent of net cumulative
commitments, while transport and municipal and environmental infrastructure account for
about 20 percent of all commitments.
The EBRD will prepare a new country strategy for Ukraine during the first quarter of 2007.

- 58 -

APPENDIX IV

UKRAINE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Economic and financial data provided to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance, albeit
with some shortcomings. The authorities continued to make improvements in a number of
areas over the past year. The data module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) was prepared in 2002, and published on IMF’s website on August 19, 2003.
On January 10, 2003, Ukraine became the first CIS country to subscribe to the SDDS.
Ukraine’s first international investment position was compiled by the National Bank of
Ukraine (NBU) in 2002. The country’s IFS page has been published since July 1996.
While the Fund’s technical assistance has been significantly reduced in recent years, various
multilateral and bilateral sources continued to play an important role. The data ROSC
recommended strengthening the independence of the State Committee on Statistics (SCS).
Some statistical deficiencies remain for the national accounts and balance of payments data
and publication of external debt data has been delayed. A STA mission visited in Kyiv in
June 2004 to assist in revising the International Transaction Reporting System (ITRS) and
assess the quality of current account data .
Key statistical data are generally provided in a timely manner, as summarized below.
Real sector statistics
The 1993 SNA is the general framework for compiling national accounts. The classifications
used are largely in accordance with international standards. The source data are obtained
from the extensive survey program of the SCS, supplemented with data from administrative
and other sources. The main survey report forms have been revised significantly in recent
years to bring them into line with the definitions, scope, and classifications of national
accounts data, and the new chart of accounts of enterprises.
Significant improvements have been introduced in the compilation of the quarterly GDP
estimates as data are now compiled on a discrete basis and fourth quarter estimates are
consistent with the other quarters estimates. Seasonally adjusted quarterly GDP data are also
now compiled, but have been disseminated only to a few selected users. A STA real sector
mission in March 2005 found that the lack of appropriate price indices hamper production of
accurate long-term GDP volume series using the new classification of economic activities
adopted since 2001. There are still no proper quarterly price indices for exports and imports,
although the development of these indices has started. The authorities agreed that the
methodology covering the informal economy needs to be revised and improved. A further
improvement of the data collection and production environment is needed, in particular,
through greater use of sample surveys, and improving data flow management and processing.
To address the shortcomings, it is important to revive the Statistical Council to provide
guidance to the SCS on the quality of the statistical series and on strategies for improving
data production.

- 59 -

APPENDIX IV

Government finance statistics
The Ministry of Finance and the State Treasury have made considerable progress in the
compilation of fiscal data. The MoF publishes monthly data on operations of the central and
regional government within 25 days of the reference period. The economic classification of
transactions and the classification of outstanding debt are consistent with the methodology
outlined in the 1986 Fund publication A Manual on Government Finance Statistics (GFSM
1986). From 2002, the functional classification is consistent with the GFSM 2001, the
current standard. All central government transactions and local government revenue
transactions are recorded in the Treasury Single Account. Starting in 2004, the authorities
have provided STA with local government expenditures for the period through 2003.
The data ROSC report highlighted that Government Finance Statistics (GFS) are available
monthly but do not provide the recommended coverage. The authorities have since reported
central and local government data for 1999-2003 in the GFSM 2001 format, for publication
in the GFS Yearbook.
The staff also noted that reporting on arrears, both for receipts and payments, should be
improved and that there remain significant delays in reporting on the operations of special
social funds.
Monetary and financial statistics
The data ROSC recommended that the timeliness of the analytical accounts of the central
bank be improved using the daily accounting records on monetary operations. Ukraine uses
both SDDS flexibility options for monetary data: the first for timeliness of the analytical
accounts of the banking sector and the second timeliness of the analytical accounts of the
central bank.
The authorities are establishing a migration plan to adopt the recommendations included in
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and have submitted an experimental
compilation of monetary data through February 2005, using STA’s standardized report
framework.
External sector statistics
Ukraine’s balance of payments statistics are compiled in broad conformity with the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual and are reporting quarterly to STA with a lag of
about ten weeks. The principal data sources are the ITRS, administrative data sources, and a
survey of enterprises. Following the recommendations of the data ROSC, the authorities have
expanded the survey on inter-enterprise arrears to include information relevant for balance of
payments purposes, and intend to implement lower reporting thresholds for banks. A one-off
pilot survey of travelers is to be conducted in 2006, and it is hoped that this will be the basis
for improving the quality of shuttle trade, compensation of employees, and travel estimates.
Some methodological weaknesses exist in private portfolio and FDI surveys. The authorities
have made progress in disseminating international reserves data. The release of monthly data,

- 60 -

APPENDIX IV

in line with the Fund’s reserve template, started in mid-2002. Though the cooperation
between different government agencies has improved in recent years, problems still exist in
coordinating the work of the National Bank of Ukraine, the SCS, and the MoF, particularly
regarding short-term external debt. Ukraine started disseminating external debt data that meet
all SDDS requirements in September 2004. An IMF technical assistance mission visited
Ukraine during June 29-July 12, 2005. The report dealt with issues concerning customsbased trade statistics, data validation procedures, and data exchange between the State
Statistics Committee and the National Bank of Ukraine.

UKRAINE: TABLE OF COMMON INDICATORS REQUIRED FOR SURVEILLANCE

- 61 APPENDIX IV

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
UKRAINE
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with the Fiscal Affairs
and Policy Development and Review Departments)
Approved by Michael Deppler and Michael Hadjimichael
November 4, 2005
1.
This supplement provides information on developments since the staff report was
issued. These developments, particularly the successful re-sale of the Kryvorizhstal steel
combine, point to an improvement in the investment climate, which is in line with staff’s
assumption that investment activity would pick up to support growth in 2006. At the same
time, uncertainties regarding the use of the windfall proceeds from the Kryvorizhstal re-sale
strengthen the staff appraisal’s concern that fiscal policy may turn out insufficiently tight to
support disinflation in 2006.
2.
Recent high-frequency indicators are broadly in line with staff’s short-term
projections. The sharp deceleration of real GDP growth during 2005 came to a halt in
September; GDP growth over January-September has declined to about 3 percent (over the
same period last year). Annual CPI inflation in October slowed to 12.4 percent, following a
deceleration to 13.9 percent in September, suggesting that end-year CPI inflation is now
likely to reach 12 percent, somewhat lower than projected in the staff report (14 percent).
Nevertheless, assuming full execution of fiscal spending plans and continued rapid growth of
household incomes and spending, inflation is likely to remain in double-digits through early2006. While annual base and broad money growth slowed somewhat in September (to
27 percent and 31 percent, respectively), reflecting declining intervention pressure in the
foreign exchange market, credit expansion has picked up (44 percent), financed increasingly
through borrowing from abroad. With declining excess liquidity in the banking system,
overnight interbank rates have been trending upward to 4½-6½ percent in September and
October, but most interest rates remain negative in real terms. On the external side, the thirdquarter current account was weaker than previously envisaged, and the staff forecast for the
full-year surplus has been revised down to 4.8 percent of GDP (from 6 percent of GDP). The
weakening of the current account is likely to be more than offset by the impact of the
Kryvorizhstal re-sale on the capital account, and, as a consequence, gross official reserve
accumulation for 2005 could be higher than previously envisaged.

-2-

3.
Budget implementation has remained on track. Cash revenue through September
2005 remained buoyant, including for VAT and profit tax collections. At the same time, the
stock of VAT refund arrears was reduced to ½ percent of GDP at end-September (from
¾ percent of GDP at end-June). To ensure foreign financing of the budget, the government
issued in October a ten-year EUR 600 million eurobond yielding 4.95 percent, consistent
with a spread of only 155 basis points above the German benchmark bond. Parliament has
approved a supplementary 2005 budget, which incorporates unbudgeted pension spending
amounting to some ¾ percent of GDP (already anticipated in the staff’s projections) and
spending of ¼ percent of GDP to re-capitalize the two state banks. At the same time, recent
data point to a significant underexecution of spending, which, if maintained, could broadly
compensate for the additional spending measures. Against this background, the general
government deficit target of 2½ percent of GDP for 2005 could still be within reach, or be
exceeded by only a small margin.
4.
The re-auction of the Kryvorizhstal steel combine fetched an unexpectedly high
price. In a transparent auction, Mittal Steel acquired an equity stake of about 93 percent of
the Kryvorizhstal steel combine for $4.8 billion (5¾ percent of GDP). This amounted to six
times the price paid at last year’s privatization auction, which was widely viewed as rigged.
Observers have interpreted the re-auction outcome as signaling improved confidence by
foreign investors in Ukraine’s economic prospects, notwithstanding that parliament twice
voted to stop the re-sale. After repaying Kryvorizhstal’s previous owners $0.8 billion, net
revenue to the budget from the sale will amount to about Hrv 20 billion (or 5 percent of
GDP), significantly exceeding budgeted privatization revenue for 2005 (1¾ percent of GDP).
The government and Mittal Steel have agreed that payments will be completed before
end-2005.
5.
A wide range of options is being discussed for using the privatization windfall,
with some options calling for adjustments in the macroeconomic policy mix. According
to staff estimates, 1½ percent of GDP of the proceeds will be needed to cover the remaining
gross financing needs of the state budget in 2005 (assuming no additional borrowing takes
place during the rest of the year), leaving a net windfall of 3½ percent of GDP. Government
officials have stressed the need to restrict the use of the additional financial resources for
operations that broadly preserve the net worth of government, particularly repaying debt and
investing in public infrastructure. On the other hand, with parliamentary elections looming in
March 2006, other leading politicians have advocated increasing recurrent spending,
including social transfers and subsidies for agriculture and mining. Since additional recurrent
spending would add to inflationary pressures, it would call for an offsetting monetary policy
response. Moreover, even without changes in the fiscal stance, a shift in the budget’s
financing structure, for example from domestic debt toward the use of privatization receipts,
could still impact liquidity conditions and require a compensatory monetary policy response.
6.
The outcome of the 2006 budget process remains uncertain. Parliament rejected
the government’s draft budget during the first reading and proposed to increase revenue
projections, including by removing proposed tax cuts, raise spending, and increase the deficit

-3-

ceiling by about 1 percent of GDP. The unexpected privatization windfall has added to
pressures to raise spending and the deficit ceiling. However, government officials have
consistently noted that there is no good reason to increase the deficit and that there is a need
to reduce the tax burden. In a repeated first reading on November 1, parliament approved a
revised government budget proposal that kept the deficit ceiling unchanged, but
parliamentary pressures to raise spending and the deficit are likely to remain strong.
7.
The new government has made some headway toward tackling structural
reforms. The Cabinet of Ministers approved a new draft law on strengthening minority
shareholder rights (three previous drafts were, however, rejected by parliament). The
government is also considering eliminating the Economic Code, parts of which contradict the
more business-friendly Civil Code. Moreover, parliament adopted two more bills required for
WTO accession, while the EU Commission has confirmed that it will grant market economy
status to Ukraine at the beginning of December. Finally, indicating progress toward more
market-friendly institutions, the latest 2005 Transparency International corruption perception
index upgraded Ukraine, which ranked 107th out of 158 countries in 2005, to be compared
with 122nd out of 146 in 2004.
Staff Appraisal
8.
The transparent re-auction of Kryvorizhstal is welcome, but the proceeds should
be used wisely. The authorities should avoid using the additional financial resources in ways
that could further complicate macroeconomic management, particularly by increasing
inflation pressures through higher recurrent spending, such as social transfers or subsidies.
Accordingly, the authorities should allocate the windfall proceeds primarily for debt
redemptions that do not aggravate the domestic liquidity overhang, and, to a limited extent,
for well-targeted spending on public infrastructure programs. Such a strategy would help
avoid fuelling significant inflationary pressures, broadly preserve the government’s net
worth, and build room against future contingencies as well as for the country’s sizable
medium-term fiscal needs. Nevertheless, monetary policy makers would need to be vigilant
to counteract in a timely manner any relaxation of monetary conditions entailed by the use of
the Kryvorizstal privatization proceeds.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Over the last 13 years, while drawing heavily on Fund policy advice and financial support, Ukraine’s
transition experience has been disappointing. This report discusses the reasons for Ukraine’s
lackluster performance, the Fund’s role in shaping policies, and lessons for future Fund engagement.
Why did Ukraine’s transition disappoint? The country had a difficult start during 1992-94, with
collapsing output and bursts of hyperinflation. During the second half of the 1990s, Ukraine
increasingly conducted monetary policy, and, with a lag, fiscal policy in a manner broadly conducive
to macroeconomic stability. But the slow pace of reforming market-enhancing institutions kept the
economy in a growth rut, rendering gains on macroeconomic stability fragile. The key factors
accounting for the slow buildup of more market-friendly institutions included: (i) the prevalence of
rent seeking and the absence of strong private-sector lobbies favoring reform; (ii) a lack of political
consensus on the scope and pace of economic reforms; and (iii) a public administration with a
generally thin economic knowledge base and weak capacity to prepare and implement policy
decisions. As a result, Ukraine got stuck in an under-reform trap, with constrained growth dynamics,
an expanding shadow economy, and a pervasive non-payment culture. The 1998 financial crisis
proved, with hindsight, a turning point. Growth rebounded strongly during 2000-04, triggered mainly
by a massive real devaluation combined with limited, but focused, structural reform efforts.
Moreover, the export-led growth rebound and maintained fiscal discipline put Ukraine on a highsavings path, and, given the difficult investment climate, resulted in large and growing external
surpluses. As a consequence, Ukraine has emerged from its transition with relatively low levels of
public and external debt. At the same time, the backlog of more market-friendly institutions remained
largely unaddressed, inflation started to trend up in early-2003, and the growth boosting effects of a
fundamentally undervalued exchange rate and excess capacities seem to be fading.
What role did the Fund play in Ukraine’s transition? Fund-supported programs had a mixed
record in achieving their objectives. While the programs were quite effective in supporting
macroeconomic stability, they did not succeed in accelerating the buildup of more market-friendly
institutions. Lack of political consensus would always have been a major obstacle for success, but
effectiveness also suffered from program designs that, at least until 1999, were too wide-ranging in
the structural area and difficult to monitor. At the same time, the Fund can take credit for a widelyappreciated role of transferring knowledge through continuous policy dialogue and technical
assistance; efforts that gradually allowed the authorities to develop improved home-grown capacities
for analysis and policy.
What lessons can be drawn for future Fund engagement? While Ukraine has certainly come a
long way from its 1990s travails, the past seems to hold three lessons for a future program
engagement: (i) program ownership is key and needs to be tested; (ii) political and administrative
constraints argue for streamlined conditionality; and (iii) in terms of objectives, a program should
focus on Fund core areas, i.e. strengthening and maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability.
Although there is no immediate external financing need, a Fund-supported program could provide a
coherent macroeconomic framework as Ukraine seeks to catch up on its institutional backlog. A
program may also be useful in providing insurance, given Ukraine’s highly open and undiversified
economy and its vulnerability to adverse shocks. A program would have to include sufficient
conditionality in critical structural areas—anchored within the Ukraine-EU Action Plan and
coordinated with the World Bank—to ensure that Ukraine’s backlog of market-enhancing institutions
is addressed. In this vein, it would also be desirable to first test the strength of political consensus
behind a future program by making a prior action implementation of a few key, but long-delayed
reforms, for example in the areas of strengthening transparency in the banking sector or improving
corporate governance.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.

This Ex Post Assessment (EPA) focuses on three main issues:

•

Accounting for Ukraine’s macroeconomic record: In particular, why did Ukraine
during the 1990s turn in what was likely the weakest growth performance among
transition economies unaffected by internal or external strife? But also, why did the
economy, starting in 2000, stage an almost equally-surprising growth rebound?

•

Accounting for the Fund’s role in Ukraine’s difficult transition: What were the
Fund’s contributions during Ukraine’s economic rollercoaster experience? In
particular, why did Fund-supported programs often not achieve their objectives?

•

Drawing lessons for future Fund involvement: What can be learned from the past
record under Fund-supported programs? And how can the Fund best contribute to
Ukraine’s further transition?

2.
The EPA draws on a number of disparate sources, including IMF documents since
Ukraine became a Fund member in September 1992 as well as studies by academics and by
World Bank and Fund staff, including a 2002 Country Strategy Paper. The EPA also draws
on interviews and discussions with Fund and Bank staff and with present and former
government officials of Ukraine.
3.
The report is structured as follows. Section II recounts Ukraine’s macroeconomic
record, moving from the traumatic years of 1991-99 that witnessed a dramatic output decline
to the more recent strong-growth years of 2000-04. Section II also reports on the key features
of IMF-supported programs and their tendency to often go awry. Section III tries to account
for Ukraine’s macroeconomic record. It attributes the precipitous output decline during the
1990s to slow institutional reforms. At the same time, it credits the growth turnaround since
2000 in part to the consequences of the 1998 financial crisis—these included a large real
devaluation, improved fiscal discipline, and limited but well-targeted structural reforms.
Section IV looks at the role of the IMF, asking in particular why the Fund almost
consistently stayed engaged in program mode, at least before 2001, notwithstanding the
programs’ limited success in fostering reforms. Finally, Section V takes stock and reflects on
what lessons to draw for future Fund engagement in Ukraine.
II. WHAT HAPPENED?
4.
Ukraine’s economic development since independence and the Fund’s role in
shaping policies fall into three distinct phases (see also the period averages in Table 1):
•

The first phase, spanning 1992-94, was characterized by incoherent policies,
rampant inflation, and collapsing output. During this period, the Fund acted mainly as
an educator and provider of technical assistance.

-6-

•

The second phase, 1995-99, saw a fitful drive toward macroeconomic stabilization
amidst continued output declines, while structural reforms were lagging behind. This
phase was brought to an end by the financial crisis in 1998, which shattered foreigninvestor confidence in Ukraine. During this phase, the Fund played a high-profile role
in shaping policies through consecutive Fund-supported programs and by providing
large amounts of technical assistance.

•

The third phase, stretching from 2000-04, brought a strong rebound in growth,
together with an all-around strengthening of Ukraine’s financial fundamentals.
Improved fiscal discipline and massive relative price shifts in favor of corporate
sector profitability, combined with a difficult investment climate, transformed
Ukraine into a “savings overhang” economy with little need for IFI financing. In this
setting, progress on building more market-friendly institutions remained slow,
stymied by lack of political consensus. Nevertheless, the Fund and the authorities
maintained an intensive policy dialogue, punctuated by attempts to rekindle a formal
program relationship.

Measures of output in transition economies, particularly during the early transition phase,
are subject to numerous caveats (see Bloem and others, 1996). Nevertheless, the conclusion
in the text seems reasonably robust with respect to cross-country differences in the size of the
shadow economy, which is estimated, however, to be larger in Ukraine than in most other
transition economies.

potential.
7.
Other social indicators suggest that Ukraine’s transition experience has left deep
scars in its social fabric. As regards health standards, perhaps most striking, and mirroring
Russia’s experience, is the dramatic drop in male life expectancy since 1991 (Table 2). While
spending on education in Ukraine has remained robust, enrolment ratios for secondary
education seem not to have kept pace with those in Eastern European countries.5 Birth rates
have declined sharply, and, also reflecting high emigration rates, Ukraine’s population has
shrunk by 4 million since independence. Though only patchy measures are available on the
distribution of income and wealth, the gap between the rich and the poor seems to have
widened dramatically during the transition. Finally, survey data on life satisfaction, while
also to be taken with a grain of salt, consistently rank Ukraine at the extreme bottom in crosscountry comparisons (see, for example, Sanfey and Teksoz, 2005).

The authorities have noted, however, that the school enrolment data used in Table 2 may be
unreliable.

9.
The 1998 financial crisis marked the
beginning of a shift to high national savings
and persistent external surplus positions.
After pressing up against tight external and
domestic financing constraints for most of the
1990s, fiscal policy from 2000 onward adopted
and broadly maintained a tight stance, reflected
in a shift toward higher public savings. Private
savings also increased, mainly driven by
improved corporate profitability following a
sharp real devaluation and favorable shifts in the
terms of trade. The level of investment (as a
percent of GDP) has remained fairly steady
throughout the transition, reflecting a difficult
investment climate, so the external current
account surplus has ballooned (Figure 4).

Over time, Ukraine’s control of
inflation has improved gradually, but the
goal of keeping inflation low and stable has
remained elusive. Following two brushes
with hyperinflation—monthly CPI inflation
rates exceeded 50 percent in 1993 and again
in late-1994—monetary control over inflation
was broadly established by late-1996,
notwithstanding the continued output decline
until 1999 (Figure 3).6 But inflation rates
during recent years have shown little
tendency to converge to a low and stable
inflation rate, first veering toward deflation
in 2002, and, since 2004, surging back into
double-digits.

External and public debt positions improved significantly following the 1998
financial crisis. In fact, the World

11.
The 1998 financial crisis also proved a watershed for financial sector
development. On the one hand, in the period since the crisis re-monetization of the economy
and re-intermediation by banks accelerated (Figure 6). For example, the loan portfolio of
Ukrainian banks, which had contracted to

200 percent of quota at end-November 1998 and has since declined to 67 percent of quota as
of end-July 2005.

Ukraine’s program compliance was generally weak. Ukraine was late in obtaining
financing through the STF, despite the facility’s more lenient conditionality. Four Fundsupported programs covered the next seven years almost continuously, but only three out of
13 reviews were completed on time and without waivers (Table 3). Measured by the number
of reviews, programs were off-track for more than 85 percent of the time, or, if programs
with delayed reviews are considered as still on track, 45 percent. Ukraine drew 68 percent of
the approved amounts (excluding the recent precautionary SBA).
14.
The early programs aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability. The programs’
focus was threefold: (i) limiting central bank financing of the fiscal deficit; (ii) eliminating
directed lending to so-called priority sectors; and (iii) preparing the ground for structural
reforms. However, lack of policy resolve during mid-1995 delayed stabilization, depleted the
NBU’s international reserves, and pushed the first SBA off track. Financial stability was
restored under the second SBA, with most quantitative performance criteria observed. But
while the second SBA seems to stand out as a relative success—inflation was brought down
to 25 percent by early-1997 and the fiscal deficit reduced to 3.2 percent of GDP in 1996
(from 4.9 percent in 1995)—the authorities achieved the latter mainly by running arrears. To
address this problem, the next SBA established ceilings on arrears as new conditionality.
When fiscal adjustment continued to lag, the new program went promptly off-track.
15. After scoring some gains on macroeconomic stability, programs increasingly
sought to tackle underlying institutional weaknesses. A comprehensive medium-term
reform agenda to be supported by an EFF arrangement was discussed in 1997. But it did not
find political support in the run-up to the parliamentary elections in March 1998, and the
authorities and the Fund instead agreed on a one-year SBA (approved in August 1997), with
focus on structural reforms. When the political deadlock was resolved after the elections,
new discussions for an EFF arrangement finally succeeded. The choice to move from shortto medium-term Fund-supported programs reflected the view that institutional shortcomings
were the major obstacles for turning Ukraine’s growth performance around. The outbreak of
the Russian financial crisis, which occurred only days before the scheduled Board meeting
to discuss the request for the EFF arrangement, did not change the Fund’s assessment that a
medium-term program would be the appropriate tool to support Ukraine’s transition.
Nevertheless, the EFF arrangement was adjusted to reflect short-term stabilization needs.
The structural measures under the program included a wide range of areas, including:
privatization; public, tax and customs administration; treasury operations; pension system;
public employment; energy and agricultural sectors; external trade; and the banking sector.
In contrast to programs with most other transition economies at the time, but in line with
Russia’s program, Ukraine’s case placed much more weight on structural reforms in nonFund core areas, particularly privatization (Table 4).
16. Stabilization policies were broadly appropriate under the EFF arrangement, but
the program was derailed by lagging structural reforms. After a short period of
determined stabilization efforts in the immediate aftermath of the Russian financial crisis to
counter inflationary pressures from the depreciation, and relatively quick progress in

- 12 -

restructuring government debt, the EFF reviews came to a halt after twelve months.
Progress on structural reforms stalled again, and a major misreporting incident cast a long
shadow on already difficult relations with the Fund (Box 1). The Fund briefly disengaged,
and, when it reengaged in December 2000, sought to assure program ownership with a new
strategy. Structural measures followed a much more streamlined approach and, when
program performance remained poor, the Fund interrupted the arrangement. Only one
delayed review was completed before the program expired in September 2002. Major
sticking points were the accumulation of VAT-refund arrears; failure to reduce tax
exemptions and export taxes; the slow pace of banking sector reforms; delays in
privatization; and poor transparency.

Box 1. Misreporting International Reserves
While under IMF Stand-By Arrangements during 1996-98, Ukraine consistently
misreported its levels of foreign reserve assets. The misreporting arose from
numerous incidents of counting as reserves items that did not meet performance
criteria definitions under the programs. This included “round-tripping operations,” in
which NBU deposits in foreign banks were on-lent to domestic banks, which in turn
deposited them in foreign banks, leading to double-counting of NBU reserve assets.
Subsequent audits, commissioned by the NBU, found no evidence of
misappropriation of Ukraine’s reserves.
Blame had to be shared all around. The Fund’s Executive Board concluded in
September 2000 that, as a result of misreporting reserve assets, Ukraine had breached
its obligations under the Articles of Agreement. At the same time, it was also
observed that, on the Fund’s side, a willingness to work under rushed and
disorganized circumstances and a climate of forbearance to “make the programs
work” had played a role in allowing the misreporting to go on for a prolonged period.
The misreporting incident, which was highly publicized in the international
financial press, temporarily cooled relations between the Fund and the
authorities. While the amounts of noncomplying purchases were relatively small, the
attitudes that led to the incidents—on the authorities’ side, a cavalier attitude toward
complying with program undertakings; on the Fund’s side, a willingness to cut
corners—led to a period of re-assessment of relations. The EFF arrangement was offtrack from September 1999 to December 2000, partly due to slow reform progress,
but perhaps more importantly because the Fund and the international community
were no longer willing to settle for waivers and modifications of programs given an
apparent lack of commitment and ownership by the authorities.

- 13 -

17.
But Ukraine managed to restructure its public debt, including through private
sector participation⎯one of the first cases encouraged by a Fund-supported program
(Box 2). Ukraine faced serious cash-flow problems in the wake of the financial crisis and
resorted to selective debt restructuring with private creditors between 1998 and early 2000.
But the extent of relief proved insufficient, and the authorities sought a comprehensive debt
restructuring agreement, including a request to the Paris Club, which eventually entered into
force after the completion of the fifth and sixth review under the EFF arrangement in
September 2001.

Box 2. Public Debt Restructuring
The initial debt restructuring strategy, which focused on selected creditors and
instruments, did not succeed in restoring debt sustainability. In August 1998, the
government agreed with domestic banks on a voluntary exchange of short-term T-bills
for long-term bonds. An exchange of T-bills for non-resident investors for a Eurobond
and the restructuring of a fiduciary loan by Chase Manhattan followed. But as
negotiations, strongly encouraged by the Fund, with ING Barings for debt falling due
in June 1999 stalled, the second review of the EFF arrangement in May 1999 called for
the completion of a financing review before the next purchase. As negotiations were
prolonged beyond the completion of the financing review in June, the Board issued a
statement at end-June 1999 insisting on an agreement with private creditors on terms
comparable to those of recent agreements with other creditors, thus strongly urging
private sector involvement in debt restructuring before resorting to official financing.1/
Later on, a comprehensive restructuring effort succeeded in lowering debt levels,
but the initiative was launched relatively late, a year and a half after the financial
crisis. At the third review of the EFF arrangement in August 1999, the Board
concluded that the selective debt restructuring efforts had not resulted in medium-term
sustainability. Ukraine then launched a comprehensive exchange with a 99 percent
participation rate, which involved the swap of four Eurobonds and three Gazprom
bonds maturing in 2000-01 for four Eurobonds maturing in 2007. Between 2000 and
2002, Ukraine restructured its external debt with Paris Club creditors, and with other
bilateral creditors, most importantly Turkmenistan. The total debt restructuring
operation covered US$2.5 billion of external debt and US$0.3billion of domestic debt,
representing about 9 percent of GDP. Debt restructuring together with the rapid
economic growth and fiscal discipline combined to bring the public debt down from
67 percent of GDP in 1999 to 25 percent of GDP in 2004.

- 14 -

program, which aimed at sustaining stabilization gains in a year of presidential elections,
came after an extended period of negotiations and attempts to build ownership and political
consensus. Structural reforms were considered as having advanced in a few areas, including
the introduction of a new budget code, public administration and pension reform, reforms in
the banking sector, and trade liberalization. In addition, five prior actions were met,
including: various measures to reduce VAT refund arrears; a delay in a minimum wage
increase; and an increase in banks’ minimum capital adequacy ratio. Nevertheless, the
program went quickly off-track, mainly derailed by a massive loosening of fiscal policy in
the run-up to the presidential election, a renewed buildup of VAT refund arrears, and little
follow-up on structural reforms; in fact, none of the structural performance criteria were
observed.
C. IMF−World Bank Cooperation
19.
The World Bank also found it difficult to make headway on structural reforms.
Like the Fund, the World Bank engaged relatively late in Ukraine through project and
program lending. Initially, the Bank focused its engagement mainly on sectoral
developments, in particular the enterprise, coal, agricultural, and financial sectors. But
implementation of its 1996-99 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was
disappointing⎯disbursement ratios were significantly lower than in other CIS countries;
many of the prepared projects did not materialize; and the Bank’s resource cost in
supervising projects and programs were 50 percent higher than the regional average (World
Bank, 2000a). In 2000, the World Bank approved a new CAS that shifted from a strategy of
separate sector adjustment operations, which was viewed as a major shortcoming (World
Bank, 2000b), to an approach that would address institutional and governance issues that cut
across sectors. While progress was slower than envisaged, and disbursements calibrated upon
progress, achievements were made in World Bank supported areas, including better financial
discipline, budget system and treasury reform, stepwise tax reform, passage of a laws for
secured interest and mortgage finance, establishment of regulatory agencies for non-bank
financial institutions and telecom, financial sector reform, and the legislative basis for
pension reform. Nevertheless, many objectives of the strategy were not achieved and Bank
disbursements, particularly for project lending, fell far short of the envisaged envelope.
20.
The Fund and the Bank proceeded generally in a coordinated fashion, but the
two institutions’ roles changed over time. Overlapping conditionality was used for key
reforms (such as conducting an audit of the state energy company, selling gas through cash
auctions, completing audits of the largest banks, and resolving or rehabilitating problem
banks), and the combined leverage helped to achieve some progress in these areas. Different
timings in engagements by the two institutions, however, complicated program relationships
with Ukraine. When in 1998 progress stalled under the Bank’s first CAS and the
disbursements under the Bank’s adjustment program halted until the redesigned
Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL), the Fund stepped up its efforts to promote structural
reforms. At the same time, the Fund drew heavily on World Bank expertise in formulating
and monitoring policies in non-core Fund areas. A shift in responsibilities back toward the

- 15 -

World Bank occurred in 2000 when the World Bank approved its new CAS. The timing of
the new World Bank strategy coincided with the Fund’s approach of streamlining
conditionality. In 2003 and 2005, the World Bank opted to financially support Ukraine
through a PAL and a Development Policy Loan, respectively, while the Fund had no formal
program relationship. But, the Fund’s assessment letters, on both occasions, were one factor
that the World Bank took into account when considering design and loan amounts in the
lead-up and during Board discussions.

III. ACCOUNTING FOR THE MACROECONOMIC RECORD9

Ukraine’s initial conditions were unfavorable. Prima facie, several potential
tailwinds seemed to augur well for Ukraine’s transition prospects: a well-educated
population; excellent conditions for agriculture; a favorable geographic position; and an
international community eager to provide support, not least to address security issues,
particularly nuclear weapon stockpiles and Chernobyl. But two Soviet legacies proved to be
major impediments:
•

First, as in other CIS countries, external shocks caused an initial output collapse,
reflecting primarily the loss of supply links to traditional trading partners and a sharp
terms of trade deterioration. This combined with the fact that Ukraine was dependent
on heavy, energy-intensive industries, including a large military goods sector.

•

Second, Ukraine’s knowledge base for managing the transition from plan to market
was thin. Ukraine not only had to build its own state institutions almost from scratch,
but its capacity for planning, implementing policies was weak.

9

Other, and in part complementary, broad-brush accounts of Ukraine’s macroeconomic
record include Åslund (2005) and Litwack and Wetzel (2004).

- 16 -

22.
Nevertheless, the length and
severity of Ukraine’s economic downturn
during the 1990s was very much
unexpected. For example, while the WEO
projected Ukraine’s real GDP to remain
roughly stable between 1994 and 1999
(measured in terms of cumulative one-yearahead WEO forecasts of real GDP growth),
growth fell short of projections year after
year, resulting in a record cumulative
forecast error of more than 40 percent during
1994–99 (Table 5, Figure 8).

Although lessons were initially learned the hard way, monetary policy gradually
succeeded in reducing inflation. The wrenching experience of very high inflation, which
was fuelled by large monetized fiscal deficits and directed credits to state enterprises while
accompanied by steep output declines, helped refute claims that a loose monetary policy was
needed to protect the economy’s supply side. At the same time, repeated bursts of
hyperinflation undermined society’s confidence in state institutions and policy making, and
may in part account for later

However, fiscal discipline took
longer to establish. Modern budgetary
institutions and practices (treasury, budget
code) emerged only slowly. At the same
time, fiscal discipline, as measured by
deficit outcomes, seemed broadly
maintained (Figure 10). But repeated GDP
growth shortfalls, an ingrained culture of tax
and spending arrears, high quasi-fiscal
deficits, and sales of high-yield but shortterm T-bills to non-residents created a
potent mix for destabilizing the economy in
case of adverse shocks. Nevertheless, when
the 1998 financial crisis hit, and Ukraine
was temporarily unable to roll over its shortterm external debt, it proved to be a
liquidity crunch rather than a solvency problem.

Slow reform of market-enhancing institutions acted as the ultimate bottleneck
for growth (Box 3). Econometric analysis indicates that relatively market-unfriendly
institutions—proxied by variables that capture the security of property rights, degree of
corruption, competence of civil servants, and regulatory quality—account for Ukraine’s large
efficiency gap in producing output (Figure 11).

Box 3. Institutions, Growth, and Macroeconomic Stability: Three Lessons
Institutions are the rules of the game that shape economic actions. In the context of Ukraine’s
transition, it is useful to distinguish two broad types of institutions:
•

Market-stabilizing institutions include monetary, fiscal, as well as financial sector
prudential and supervisory arrangements. While these institutions are sometimes relatively
easy to legislate—e.g., adopting a modern central bank law or budget code—, effective
implementation can be difficult, creating gaps between formal and informal institutions.
With strong support from the Fund, Ukraine made gradual but consistent progress on
strengthening its market-stabilizing institutions, particularly following the 1998 financial
crisis.

•

Market-enhancing institutions are needed to allow markets to work efficiently, including
by establishing secure property rights, enforce contracts, and regulate markets. These rules
of the game are generally hard to legislate directly as they are the outcome of diffuse
processes that also reflect the political and judicial systems. Moreover, in the case of
Ukraine, formal laws and regulation are sometimes unclear or inconsistent (e.g., the
Economic and Civil Codes). The indicators in Kaufmann and others (2005) are widely used
to measures the strength of market-enhancing institutions.

Against this backdrop, the recent literature on institutions, growth, and macroeconomic stability has
highlighted three cross-country lessons, all of which seem pertinent for Ukraine:
•

First, the strength of market-enhancing institutions is strongly positively correlated
with countries’ income levels and productive efficiency in the longer term (see the crosscountry evidence in International Monetary Fund, 2003, and Figure 11). Ukraine’s own
growth experience since 1992 seems consistent with this first lesson.

•

Second, growth accelerations can occur without a broad-based strengthening of
market-enhancing institutions (see the cross-country evidence in Hausmann and others,
2004). Such growth spurts may, for example, be initiated by limited market-enhancing
reforms or favorable external shocks. Ukraine’s strong growth rebound during 2000-04
seems to fit this category. But the cross-country experience also suggests that growth
rebounds that remain unsupported by broader institutional reforms tend to peter out as
productive dynamism can not be maintained in the longer term.

•

And third, progress on market-stabilizing institutions that is not complemented by
progress on building market-enhancing institutions is unlikely to ensure durable
macroeconomic stability (see the cross-country evidence in Acemoglu and others, 2003).
Thus, notwithstanding Ukraine’s marked progress in building effective market-stabilizing
institutions, this third lesson suggests that macroeconomic stability in the medium term
needs to be anchored by progress in broader institution building.

- 19 -

26.
Mass privatization resulted in dispersed ownership and may have contributed to
the protracted output decline. For political and historical reasons, the Ukrainian
privatization mechanisms used during 1992–98 involved mainly transfer of ownership to
large numbers of individuals or to holdings of broadly-held financial intermediaries. In a
legal environment that did not much support to minority shareholders, such dispersed
ownership structures led to pilfering of enterprise assets by insiders, which may have
undermined economic activity.10 At the same time, allowing widespread strategic foreign
ownership, perhaps the most promising alternative privatization method, was not the
preference of the authorities and, in any case, would have been difficult to implement given
the adverse investment climate.
27.
The economy responded to lagging market-enhancing institutions by creating
further inefficiencies, setting in motion a vicious circle:
•

Activities migrated into the shadow
economy⎯estimated to make up more than
half of official GDP in1997 (Figure 12). To
maintain fiscal revenues, the government had
to levy a high tax burden on the formal
economy, driving even more activities
underground.

3 percent of GDP in 1996, surging to 6 percent
in 1999 after external financing had dried up during the financial crisis. With the
government leading by example, a non-payment culture became ingrained.

•

Lingering doubts about the solidity of the currency and lack of trust in the poorly
supervised financial institutions led to demonetization of the economy and sharply
restricted the availability of bank loans to newly privatized enterprises.

28.
But why did reforms of market-enhancing institutions not take off? There seem
to be four interlocking reasons:
•

10

No strong private sector lobbies for institution-building emerged. Initially, the
post-independence elite seemed more focused on consolidating its hold on power than
on economic reform. As a result, there was no serious effort to limit the looting of
state enterprises or to prevent rent-seeking. This led to the creation of powerful
See Pivovarsky (2003).

- 20 -

insider groups bent on state capture and with a vested interest in maintaining a
relatively disorganized and lawless situation.
•

The political system was fractured. Early on there was little institutional clarity on
the roles of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Moreover, policy making
was hampered by the slow buildup of legal foundations11 and a rapid succession of
governments (Appendix IV). As regards parliament, vested interests came to
dominate decisions, as up to one half of the members had no or only loose party
affiliation, representing specific business or regional interests. Frequent switching
between party lines added to instability and unpredictability of parliamentary
majorities.

•

Policy making remained within a Soviet-style managerial framework (Box 4).
Government decision making at the highest levels was mainly focused on micro
crises—for example, clearing wage arrears to teachers, closing specific coal mines, or
dealing with the fate of specific enterprises—leaving little time or energy for
pursuing the more strategic task of putting in place laws and regulations needed for
the operation of a market economy. This focus on a managerial rather than a strategic
mode of policy making partly reflected incentives: ministers and senior officials
could expect most rewards from being seen pulling on available levers of power to
resolve micro crises, which, in turn, tended to proliferate in an economy unmoored by
agreed and credible rules of the game.

•

And Ukraine suffered from a version of the natural resource curse. The
dominance of heavy industries, including coal and steel, and large energy and
agricultural sectors provided a ready habitat for corruption and rent-seeking activities
(Box 5). A small set of people benefited from asset-stripping and brazen insider deals
in these sectors, casting a shadow on the security of property rights as ownership
structures came to be viewed as illegitimate by a large part of the population. This in
turn provided incentives to the owners to invest heavily in political capital, reenforcing the existing fracturing of the political system.

11

Ukraine was, for example, the last CIS country to adopt a constitution on June 28, 1996.
The NBU Act and the Banking Law only became effective in 1999 and 2000, respectively.

- 21 -

Box 4. Retooling Ukraine’s Policy-Making Machinery
Sundakov (1997, 2000) observed that, as a legacy of Soviet-era holdovers, policy making in Ukraine
tended to focus on perpetual fighting of micro crisis, preventing the government from focusing on
key strategic policy priorities. He identified three key issues that would need to be addressed to
improve policy making at the government level:
•

Establishing a government agenda that focuses on strategic priorities. With the
government machinery prone to generating and responding to a multitude of specific issues,
gaining control of the agenda would require that the government controls its policy agenda
by restricting decision making to properly constituted meetings with a pre-announced and
transparent agenda.

•

Preparing policy papers to inform policy meetings on options and risks. Sundakov
(2000) in particular noted that government decision making was largely based on draft
legislation acts, which by their nature did not facilitate discussions of the different policy
options and the risks entailed by these options.

•

Building requisite policy analysis skills. Assuring the quality of papers underlying policy
decisions would require a medium-term program to develop and upgrade the analytical and
strategic skills of ministry staff involved in preparing policy background papers.

Box 5. The Energy Sector: From Rent- to Profit-Seeking
Ukraine started its transition with a highly energy-dependent economy. In 1991, measured on a
per dollar of output basis, Ukraine’s energy use surpassed that of other transition economies. Most
energy needs were covered by imports, originally at a fraction of the world price. As a consequence,
sharp rises in energy prices would impose immense adjustment costs on producers and consumers.
The energy sector became the fulcrum of industrial and social policies that led to a massive
redistribution of rents. As energy prices rose, industrial lobbies pressed to delay an otherwise
imminent output decline and the restructuring of their industries. Given intensive political pressures,
state-owned energy companies failed to introduce hard budget constraints on enterprises and
households, and arrears rapidly piled up. On several occasions, arrears were formally transformed
into government debt (with the largest operation involving a $3.3 billion gas settlement with Russia
and Turkmenistan in March 2005). Energy traders and other enterprises engaged in intransparent
barter strategies, both inside and across Ukraine’s borders, that quickly worsened governance
problems in the energy sector while giving rise to the emergence of powerful and rich elites.
Quasi-fiscal activities in the energy sector declined substantially after reforms were introduced
during 1999-2000. The cash collection ratio for electricity increased rapidly from a 15 percent in
1999 to 50 percent by end-2000 and over 90 percent by end-2004. However, the economy remains
highly energy-intensive and governance in energy markets remains weak, constituting a potential
source of economic instability. A key test will come once prices for gas supplies from Russia and
Turkmenistan, which are still sold far below market rates, adjust to international levels.

- 22 -

B. Accounting for the Growth Turnaround: 2000–04
29.
The growth turnaround came as a big surprise to forecasters. Given limited
progress on institution-building, there seemed to be little basis for a sustained growth
turnaround. Thus, Ukraine’s growth boom during 2000-04 confounded most observers’
expectations, this time in line with positive growth surprises for other CIS countries
(Table 6). GDP during 2000-04 increased cumulatively by some 50 percent, while one-yearahead WEO forecasts added to an increase of only about 19 percent, leaving a cumulative
forecast error of 31 percent
30.

Why did growth rebound with such unexpected vigor?

•

Rising demand met idle capacities. By the late-1990s, Ukraine had a large stock of
unused capacities, and the growth rebound faced few supply constraints as soon as
demand started to take off.

•

Massive relative price shifts turned the
enterprise sector profitable (Box 6).
The sharp devaluation and fall in real
wages following the financial crisis
raised the competitiveness of Ukraine’s
products (Figure 13). Thus, the real
devaluation, combined with the
consolidation of previously dispersed
ownership structures, effectively
encouraged managers to behave in ways
that spurred economic growth, even
without far-reaching governance reforms.
By then, enterprises had also learned
how to make traditional products more
marketable (see Berengaut and others,
2002). Subsequently, sharp terms of
trade gains added to this growth
momentum as Ukraine benefited from
rapid increases in global prices for its
exports of steel, other metals, and
chemicals.

social arrears⎯by the new government led by then-Prime Minister Yushchenko
tackled the nonpayment culture in the energy and other sectors (Figure 14) and raised
efficiency in the agricultural sector.12
31.
While the growth rebound facilitated fiscal discipline, tight external and
domestic financing constraints also played a key role in keeping fiscal deficits in check.
Repeated positive growth surprises helped to meet budget deficit targets (Figure 10). At the
same time, access to external and domestic financing was severely constrained during
2000-02, as demand by foreign and domestic investors for government securities had dried
up and privatization revenue remained subdued (Table 1). But quasi-fiscal deficits,
particularly in the energy sector, also started to decline sharply in 2001, while fiscal
institution-building gathered momentum. By 1998, an interim treasury account that recorded
most central government cash and noncash expenditure had become operational; and a
modern Budget Code was introduced in 2001.
32.
Maintaining low and stable inflation rates has remained elusive. Inflation
declined sharply after 2000, notwithstanding continued robust nominal money growth
(Figure 9). Rapid re-monetization of the economy and the nominal peg to the U.S. dollar
seemed to have ushered in a period of low and stable inflation. But, following a phase of
deflation in 2002, inflation started to trend upward again in early-2003, reflecting a complex
mix of shocks, including: rapid economic growth since 2000; large terms of trade gains that
boosted current account surpluses and incomes; supply-side disturbances to Ukraine’s rigid
food markets; and hikes in public wages and pensions in 2004 and 2005. However, the final
impact and persistence of these multiple shocks on inflation was enhanced by a monetary
policy framework primarily devoted to defending the peg to the U.S. dollar, a framework that
left medium-term inflation outcomes seemingly unanchored.
33.
The main driving forces behind the recent growth spurt are waning. Capacity
bottlenecks have emerged, in particular since investment activity remained relatively
subdued during the growth rebound. Also, the recent surge in inflation, combined with some
nominal appreciation so far in 2005, has partly corrected the hryvnia’s real undervaluation.
Finally, prices for Ukraine’s major exports, which had climbed rapidly since 2001, have
started to reverse.
34.
At the same time, the crux of Ukraine’s growth problem—weak marketenhancing institutions—remains unaddressed. The World Bank’s broad indicators of
institutional strength point to no significant improvements in governance since 1998
(Figure 15). Moreover, in 2004, Ukraine still ranked 122 out of 146 countries in the
corruption index compiled by Transparency International. And the business climate remained
difficult during 1998-2004, as indicated by the miniscule cumulative FDI flows to Ukraine.

Yushchenko government, see Åslund (2001).

IV. THE ROLE OF THE IMF
35. Ukraine proved a difficult counterpart for the Fund, but there were successes as
well as disappointments. IMF-supported programs were instrumental for supporting the
authorities’ gradual drive toward macroeconomic stability. But programs also had little
traction as commitment devices for the authorities and were not able to permanently tip the
balance toward accelerating the pace of building more market-friendly institutions. As a
consequence, during most of the 1990s output kept declining, rendering gains on
macroeconomic stability tenuous. As discussed in the previous section, the Russian financial
crisis and its fallout “resolved” Ukraine’s growth problem, albeit in a second-best manner
and most likely only temporarily. This section first reviews the main obstacles that made it
difficult for Fund-supported programs to play a more effective role in Ukraine’s transition.
The section further discusses issues related to program implementation and design that may
also have diminished program effectiveness. Finally, it highlights that the Fund played a
crucial role in the transition of the Ukrainian economy by: (i) transferring knowledge about
macroeconomic policy making and implementation through a continuous policy dialogue;
(ii) facilitating coordination and communication of the authorities’ policy agenda; and
(iii) helping to block, or at least mitigate, errant policy initiatives.13

13

Stone (2002) also assesses the role of the Fund in Ukraine’s transition process.

- 25 -

36.
At the outset, it is also important to keep in mind that policy developments and
Fund advice in Ukraine (and other CIS countries) often shadowed trends in Russia. For
example, the move toward, and then away from, a long list of structural conditions in
Ukraine almost exactly mirrored the pattern in Russia.
A. Political and Administrative Obstacles to Program Effectiveness
37.
Lack of political consensus to pursue market-friendly reforms was the main
cause for repeated program failures. Ukraine started the reform process with a strong
degree of resentment against outside recommendations on how to move to a market
economy. After the wrenching experience of hyperinflation and output collapse in 1992-94,
the authorities became more receptive—albeit reserved–subscribers to IFI advice, a change
of mind no doubt also driven by a pressing need to obtain external financing. But, while there
was no lack of sweeping structural reform visions as early as in 1994, these visions were
never anchored in a broad political consensus. In particular, parliament, riddled with special
interest groups, often proved a stumbling block for reform initiatives. This lack of political
consensus set Ukraine not only apart from many Eastern European and Baltic countries,
many of which could rely on European integration as an external anchor or commitment
device, but also from Russia, where reformers were able to push their agenda more
effectively.
38.
Implementation of programs was hampered by weak administrative capacities.
It took Ukraine much longer than other CIS countries to raise the quality of its administrative
apparatus, establish decision-making capacities, and create mechanisms of communication
among the various public institutions, all of which hampered its ability to implement reforms.
For example, the World Bank, in its 2000 Country Assistance Evaluation report (2000a,
p. 19) concluded that “one consistent weakness has been an over-estimation of … the
government’s implementation capacity.”
39.
Unfunded social promises may also have undercut policy making and
commitments. Ukraine started its transition with a comprehensive set of social protection
programs that quickly proved fiscally unsustainable. Given the hardships that radical changes
to this system would have meant, social mandates were maintained, or even extended,
notwithstanding the government’s rapidly shrinking fiscal room for maneuver. When funding
proved insufficient, adjustments either took the form of arrears, or more often, the social
mandates were simply ignored. As a result, there was always an unresolved tension between
legislated social promises and fiscal reality, adding to the population’s mistrust in the
country’s political institutions. Moreover, the accumulated “social mandates overhang” also
meant that there would always be strong incentives for the government to use fiscal resources
procyclically and strategically for political aims, as indeed happened in the case of the
massive public pension hikes during the run-up to the 2004 presidential elections (Box 7).

- 26 -

Box 7. Ukraine’s Social Mandate Overhang
A surprise hike of public pensions in 2004 brought actual pension practices in line
with the legal obligations⎯at substantial fiscal costs. In September 2004, during the
run-up to the presidential elections, in a snap decision taken without consulting the
Fund as agreed under the program, the government raised monthly pensions to the
subsistence minimum level of Hrv 284. The massive pension hike was rationalized by
noting that it fulfilled (for the first time in Ukrainian history) the social mandate
guaranteed by Article 46 of Ukraine’s Constitution, which states that no pension
should be below the subsistence minimum level. Staff estimates suggested that the
annualized budget cost of the decision was about 3½ percent of GDP. Together with a
further increase in the subsistence level later in the year, pension spending rose by
5 percent of GDP to an estimated 14 percent of GDP in 2005. As a further side effect,
the pension hike decision also derailed the shift to a multi-pillar pension system, as
foreseen by legislation approved in 2003, nullifying many years of pension reform
efforts.
Ukraine’s Constitution and other laws include many other social mandates that
are either only partially fulfilled or simply ignored. They include guarantees of the
right to free education, healthcare, and public housing. According to some estimates,
the costs of fulfilling all these social mandates could amount to about 10 percent of
GDP. At the same time, the potentially most costly unresolved social promise is the
compensation for the savings lost during the hyperinflation periods. While a law to
recognize those losses as public debt was vetoed by the President in June 2005, the
proposal could resurface and create additional official government debt up to about
30 percent of GDP.

B. Additional Factors Hampering Program Effectiveness
40.
At least until 1999, the authorities’ perception of the Fund’s willingness to be
engaged in a continuous program relationship may have undermined program
effectiveness. The Fund’s strong interest in supporting Ukraine was reflected in the nearly
uninterrupted program coverage during 1994-99, the large number of missions, and other
efforts including delivery of copious technical assistance (Table 7). Additionally, Fund
management was generally closely involved in program negotiations and reviews. The aim of
tipping the balance toward reformers was the main driving force behind the desire to stay
involved⎯a goal which was shared by the Fund’s shareholders whose security and strategic
considerations also lent support for Fund engagement. However, major shareholder pressure,
while existent, was considered by interviewees to have played a much less prominent role

- 27 -

than in the case of Russia.14 At least at the time of the 1998 financial crisis, the Fund was
also concerned about regional contagion given Ukraine’s size and trade links. Against this
backdrop, failure to implement agreed program commitments may have seemed to the
authorities to carry little practical consequences in terms of delaying program approvals and
disbursements. Some staff involved in Fund operations at that time suggested that almost
uninterrupted access to Fund (and other IFIs) financial support may well have delayed
reform efforts before 1999.
41.
In the face of a truly unique challenge, the design of structural conditionality in
early transition programs may have lacked focus. The Fund entered uncharted territory,
particularly in the CIS, with challenges not well understood and with little practical
experience. It is therefore not surprising that program design itself underwent a learning and
adjustment process over time. For example, the early programs did not include conditionality
on arrears buildup, or the establishment of more effective fiscal institutions, while they did
place much emphasis on numerical targets for privatization. In hindsight, the early programs
focused on a set of reforms that were already on the government’s own agenda, while not
tackling the authorities’ creative ways of evading fiscal discipline and delaying the buildup
of more effective fiscal institutions. At the same time, and again judged with the benefit of
hindsight, the early programs’ focus on the speed, rather than the modus and quality, of mass
privatization may have been misplaced.15
42.
On the other hand, in later programs, structural measures proliferated. To step
up the pace of institutional reforms, the EFF-supported program introduced a large policy
matrix with the objective of providing the authorities with a step-by-step action plan.
However, the policy matrix, which included 88 measures (and 150 sub-measures), proved
unwieldy, taxing the staff’s and the authorities’ limited capacities to monitor implementation.
The matrix included many measures in non-core Fund areas, including the energy sector and
privatization—areas viewed as critical for triggering an economic rebound, even though
progress under earlier World Bank programs had been unsatisfactory.16 But some
interviewees noted that, with Fund staff struggling to properly monitor these non-Fund core
areas, attention and resources had to be diverted from core areas.17 Finally, the fact that none

By 1998, the World Bank had disbursed $1.8 billion to Ukraine (90 percent adjustment
loans), but with little to show for it, in particular in the energy sector (World Bank 2000a).

of the measures were performance criteria under the original program (four of the measures
later became structural performance criteria) may have been viewed by the authorities as a
signal that there was substantial leeway to waive progress in reforms for completion of
reviews. The staff sought to remedy this problem by introducing a large number of prior
actions for completing reviews, an approach, however, that came to be seen by the
authorities as an arbitrary shifting of goalposts.
43.
At the same time, the detailed policy matrix was welcomed by the authorities at
a technical as well as at a political level, but without necessarily strengthening weak
program ownership. On a technical level, the policy matrix was not unlike the central plans
sent from Moscow during Soviet times, providing guidance and serving as a coordination
tool. However, at a political level, the matrix was a convenient device for deflecting criticism
to the Fund when implementation faced heavy political opposition or was bungled at the
administrative level.
44.
In the event, Ukraine’s EFF supported-program became a leading example of
excessive structural activism. In response to an initiative by Fund management to
streamline structural conditionality, at the second review the structural policy matrix of the
EFF arrangement was reduced from 88 to 36 measures. Views within the Fund on whether
the smaller number of structural measures remained excessive or not differed, however, and
pressures for further streamlining continued. In particular, the conditionality on reducing the
export tax on sunflower seeds became a rallying cry for those arguing that the Fund had
drifted toward excessive micromanaging, although based on its merits the case seems less
than straightforward (Box 8). The recent precautionary SBA-supported arrangement shifted
to a highly parsimonious approach on structural conditionality, including only five structural
measures (in addition to five prior actions), all clearly located in Fund-core areas (see
Appendix VI).
45.
Finally, there were also claims that the Fund made mistakes in its policy advice,
in particular because it lacked sufficient insight into the workings of the Ukrainian
economy and politics. The authorities felt that the Fund’s insistence in 1997-98 on the
government letting T-bill rates to be market-determined and avoiding restrictions on
purchases by non-residents contributed to the severity of the 1998 financial crisis. Regarding
structural reforms, interviewees that were involved on the Ukrainian side suggested that the
Fund not only overestimated the political support for reforms, but that in a few cases
measures were ill-advised and had later to be adjusted, providing ammunition for reform

the sugar sector, revising the house subsidy scheme, conducting a land reform, and
strengthening the bankruptcy mechanism.

- 29 -

Box 8. Why was the IMF Concerned About Sunflower Seeds?
An export tax on sunflower seeds turned into a well-publicized test case on
enforcing highly specific structural conditionality. Ukraine is one of the world’s
largest producer and exporter of sunflower seeds. In August 1999, in a clear breach
of the EFF–supported program undertaking to refrain from introducing any new
restrictions on exports, Ukraine imposed a 23 percent export tax on sunflower seeds.
Fund staff strongly argued for eliminating the export tax, arguing that the tax was
emblematic of the ability of powerful groups (in this case, domestic oilseed crushing
plants) to bend the rules of the game to their advantage at the expense of weaker
groups (in this case, growers of sunflower seeds). Moreover, the tax not only
redistributed income but also imposed a significant deadweight cost. At the same
time, it was difficult to make a compelling case that reducing the tax was critical for
achieving key program objectives. And some policy-relevant aspects of the tax—
particularly to what extent it could be avoided or evaded—remained unclear, and
staff spent much time trying to clarify the situation. In the event, in December 2000,
an EFF review was completed without the tax having been eliminated, but a
structural benchmark to reduce the tax to 10 percent was agreed. In June 2001, the
tax was reduced to only 17 percent, but the sunflower seed issue was quietly
dropped from the agenda. In July 2005, to fulfill a precondition for WTO accession,
parliament adopted legislation to lower the tax by 1 percentage point per year upon
WTO membership.

opponents. Two specific examples mentioned were the increase in housing and rental tariffs
in 1995 (a structural benchmark of the 1995 SBA), which led to large arrears buildup, and
the increase in the alcohol excise tax in 1998 (a prior action of the EFF arrangement), which
caused sharp increases in smuggling. The Fund’s underestimation of the rapid remonetization
after the 1998 financial crisis and repeated calls for more exchange rate flexibility—
including a call for tighter monetary policy in 2001 when, as it turned out later, Ukraine was
in fact on the brink of deflation—were singled out as telling examples of how the Fund
would sometimes cling to unduly dogmatic positions (Box 9). While these and other
examples may confirm that the Fund made policy mistakes, the criticism appears to single
out individual measures, without acknowledging that these measures were part of a much
broader policy package advised by the Fund.

While the authorities intended to adopt it in
1995, the Fund insisted to delay it to mid-June 1996 after central bank financing had
become less rampant and inflation had come down somewhat. Once the regime was
introduced though, the Fund, though often reluctantly, no longer made exchange rate
policy a sticking point to its program support. In hindsight, it appears that before the crisis
the hryvnia was overvalued as the real effective exchange rate appreciated and institutional
reforms had stalled. A more gradual depreciation might have contributed to an earlier
recovery, but the effects were difficult to gauge at the time when the focus was
predominantly on closing the reform gap. During the financial crisis, the Fund agreed to
defend the exchange rate including through administrative controls⎯a mistake in hindsight
as the NBU lost substantial amounts of reserves and ultimately had to float the currency.
After the crisis, the Fund strongly favored a more flexible regime but accepted the
authorities’ choice of a de facto peg partly because a peg had also been agreed under the
Fund-supported program for Russia. Over the coming years, the Fund regularly pointed at
the risks that rapid reserve accumulation under the peg would pose for inflation and the
lack of incentives to hedge bank lending in foreign currency, but the de facto peg generally
served Ukraine well by disciplining fiscal policy and serving as an external anchor. The
uncertainty about the speed of remonetization, which allowed inflation to remain relatively
low until 2004, and the strength of the U.S. dollar explains why the exchange rate regime
did not become a hurdle under the EFF arrangement and the precautionary SBA (even
though it became a key issue under the SBA program review).
Today the authorities favor a very gradual approach to more exchange rate
flexibility. The Fund has argued for some time that the peg has outlived its utility (see IMF
Staff Report 2004), but the Ukrainian authorities have been cautious and have emphasized
that the Fund underestimates the risks and unique features of the Ukrainian economy.

- 31 -

C. Other Impacts of Fund-Supported Programs and Involvement
46.
Despite their mixed record as commitment devices, Fund-supported programs,
and Fund involvement more generally, played important roles in Ukraine’s transition.
Even when programs were off track, the frequent attempts to reconcile assured that the Fund
stayed involved in addition to the technical assistance provided (Table 7). More broadly,
within and outside the program context, the Fund served three valuable functions in Ukraine:
transferring knowledge, coordinating policies, and advising on policy initiatives. In fact,
particularly during the 1990s, the Fund may have faced a trade-off between running the risk
of repeated program disappointments and exercising these valuable functions.
47.
Perhaps the most-widely appreciated role of the Fund’s engagement in Ukraine
was transferring economic knowledge. Interviewees, including the authorities, stressed the
positive impact of the continuous policy dialogue in establishing a more widespread
understanding of the requirements for a market economy, and the functioning and interaction
of macroeconomic policies. The knowledge transfer was viewed as highly beneficial by
policy makers as well as at the technical level. The Fund was also instrumental in setting up
key policy-making institutions, such as the central bank, and has continuously supported the
buildup and strengthening of the banking supervisory function. Another example is the
Fund’s guidance in preparing statistics according to market economy standards—in fact, in
2003 Ukraine became the first CIS country to subscribe to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS). While the Fund’s functional departments supplied technical
support, the area department helped in identifying technical assistance needs and priorities. It
also used the EFF arrangement as leverage to foster progress in some areas that were
supported by technical assistance, such as tax collection, the creation of a single treasury
account, setting up of fiscal analysis and forecasting, strengthening bank supervision, and
dealing with banks in distress. The findings of the Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FASP) were used to formulate one prior action and conditionality under the precautionary
SBA. However, according to the Independent Evaluation Office (2005), this link between
program conditionality and technical assistance may have impaired effectiveness of technical
assistance by blurring technical and policy decisions.
48.
As a coordinator, the Fund had some success in facilitating the policy dialogue
among the government agencies. Fund-supported programs introduced the authorities to
the need for consistent macroeconomic frameworks that take into account the interlinkages
between monetary and fiscal policies. They also facilitated the sometimes difficult
communication among different policy makers, including the NBU and the Ministry of
Finance. The Fund’s role as a coordinator, however, often took time to yield results. For
example, fiscal policy interfered for quite some time with monetary policy, either through
NBU deficit financing or the directing of credit.
49.
As an advisor, the Fund commented on a wide range of policy initiatives,
sometimes trying to fend off errant ideas. The Fund’s close engagement served as a
constant reminder of the need to conduct appropriate macroeconomic policies, particularly
during times when there were no programs in place. The Fund was particularly useful in

- 32 -

screening potentially detrimental policy proposals, for example the introduction of new tax
exemptions and amnesties, proposals that have had a tendency to proliferate in Ukraine’s
political environment. The Fund was also partially successful in shielding particular policy
areas. For example, quite recently, it helped to fend off government pressure on the NBU to
provide cheap refinancing loans to banks for on-lending to the agricultural sector when it
made the elimination of this practice (which had been introduced against the
recommendation of the NBU) a precondition to complete discussions of the precautionary
SBA.
V. LESSONS
A. Taking Stock
50.
Ukraine’s transition to a market economy has—so far—not worked out as well
as expected. The sustained rebound in output that got underway in 2000 seems to owe much
to exceptional and temporary conditions. And Ukraine’s income levels remain relatively low,
reflecting an economy that is highly inefficient in using its available resources. Ukraine’s
disappointing transition experience is ultimately rooted in lagging progress in adopting more
market-friendly institutions. While the growth turnaround since 2000 has been underpinned
by clear progress on structural reforms at important margins, as illustrated by the rapid remonetization of the economy over the last few years, available indicators suggest that
Ukraine’s institutional landscape has seen little fundamental improvement during 1998-2004.
51.
Thus, while Fund-supported programs were broadly successful in supporting
macroeconomic stabilization, they tried hard but did not succeed in accelerating reform
of market-enhancing institutions. High inflation and excessive fiscal deficits were
gradually but successfully reigned in from the mid-1990s, as Fund-supported programs
redirected monetary and fiscal policies to focus on macroeconomic stability. By contrast, the
programs’ other key objective—to initiate sustained reforms of the institutions needed for a
well-functioning market economy—was not achieved. For this outcome, the main blame has
to fall on the lack of a reform-oriented political consensus within Ukraine. Until 1999, the
Fund’s perceived eagerness to stay in a continuous program relationship, and program
designs characterized by perhaps excessive structural activism were unhelpful but not
decisive in delaying reforms.
52.
Against this backdrop, President Yushchenko has put reforms at the top of his
government’s agenda. The President has stressed that Ukraine’s market-unfriendly
institutions are the root cause of its disappointing economic performance, pledging in
particular to tackle corruption and rent-seeking. He also argued that Ukraine’s chances to
succeed would be maximized by anchoring its reform drive within closer integration with the
EU and global markets (see, for example, Yushchenko, 2005).
53.
The main payoff for Ukraine from Fund involvement may well have come from
successful knowledge transfer. Ukraine started its transition from plan to market with a thin

- 33 -

economic knowledge base. In addition to wide-ranging technical assistance, the close and
continuous policy dialogue between the Fund and the authorities, within and outside program
contexts, helped provide the authorities with the tools for macroeconomic analysis and policy
making.
B. Lessons for Future Fund Engagement
54.
What role could an IMF-supported program in the near-term play? Under
plausible baseline projections, Ukraine has no immediate external financing need. In this
setting, a potential Fund-supported program could have two major benefits. First, together
with the EU-Ukraine Action Plan and other IFI engagement, it could help anchor and
coordinate the authorities’ reform agenda, particularly by reestablishing a coherent
macroeconomic framework that aims at bringing inflation back into the single-digits. And
second, a program could provide some insurance given Ukraine’s exposure to external
shocks. For example, a sharp decline in metal prices and export demand, uncertainty about
foreign direct investment and short-term capital flows, and a potential convergence of energy
import prices to world levels constitute key external risks for Ukraine’s economy. At the
same time the banking sector, which has taken on large credit and indirect foreign exchange
risks during the rapid growth years, also remains vulnerable to a slowdown of the economy.
55.
But what conditions would need to be in place for more successful Fund
program engagement? This paper’s review of past program experiences points to the
following checklist for assessing the risks to program effectiveness:
•

Is there sufficient political support behind a program? Strong program ownership
and political support would be the key preconditions. In the past, underestimating
political constraints led to program failures. In this context, President Yushchenko’s
vision of the need for sweeping institutional reform is encouraging. So far, the
present parliament has been reluctant to adopt proposed reform legislation. The
upcoming March 2006 parliamentary election should clarify the extent of political
support for a strong structural reform agenda. In this context, the Ukraine-EU Action
plan could be viewed as a blueprint, serving the authorities as a compass for where
they want to go during the program period and beyond.

•

Are the policy-making capacities to implement a program in place? The present
authorities’ decision-making process seems to exhibit many of the tendencies noted
by earlier observers as inhibiting government effectiveness (Box 4). In particular,
there may still be too much focus on addressing micro crises (reflected in recent
heavy-handed interventions in fuel, meat, and sugar markets) at the cost of focusing
the government’s energies on achieving strategic goals (such as WTO accession).

•

Is the program sufficiently focused on addressing the key obstacles to sustained
growth? Currently, the main issues to be addressed in a Fund-supported program
would seem to comprise: (i) as regards monetary and exchange rate policy, tightening
loose monetary conditions and re-orienting the monetary framework toward

- 34 -

achieving low and stable inflation, including through a shift to a more flexible
exchange rate regime; (ii) as regards fiscal policy, maintaining a tight fiscal stance,
restoring a viable public pension fund, systemic tax reform, and strengthening the
transparency of fiscal and quasi-fiscal operations; (iii) as regards the financial sector,
strengthening the resilience of the banking sector and developing domestic capital
markets; and (iv) improving the investment climate through stronger governance and
institutions. Past experience suggests that measures would need to be kept
streamlined and focused on critical institutional bottlenecks. This paper’s analysis
and the authorities’ own diagnostics leave little doubt that building more marketfriendly institutions remains the key to relaunching sustained catch-up growth, and
closing the institutional gap should therefore play a key role in a Fund-supported
program. In marked contrast to earlier programs, such a structural reform agenda
could be anchored externally in the Ukraine-EU Action Plan.
56.
What form should a Fund program engagement take? Given no immediate
external financing needs, the program would likely be a low-access, precautionary
arrangement. Moreover, to be able to address the medium-term challenges for Ukraine’s
economy, a Fund-supported program would have to consider a duration that exceeds one
year. At the same time, given Ukraine’s circumstances and uncertain prospects for closer EU
integration, it will be difficult to design a credible exit strategy. Before re-engaging in a
program, and to address potential concerns about ownership given the past record, the Fund
could therefore ask first for a demonstrated track record of good macro policies and prior
implementation of key structural reform measures that serve to demonstrate that the
authorities command the political consensus needed to see a program through. Potential
candidates for such prior actions could be long-delayed measures to strengthen transparency
in the financial sector (such as making ownership structures more transparent) or to improve
corporate governance (such as adopting a market-friendly joint-stock company law).
57.
What would be the benefits of a Fund-supported program over Fund
surveillance and technical assistance for Ukraine? A program could serve the authorities
as an additional external anchor, both in terms of jumpstarting structural reforms, including
through prior actions, and staying the course during the program period. The Fund played a
similar role in Bulgaria’s and Romania’s EU accession process, but these experiences also
suggest that the Fund’s leverage was closely linked to the status and progress in EU
membership negotiations. Whether an additional anchor has merit for improving policy
making in Ukraine will ultimately be the authorities’ decision, but the success of a future
program will clearly rest on their willingness and ability to implement agreed policies. As an
alternative, the Fund could remain engaged through a close policy dialogue and technical
assistance, an option that would allow it to continue to provide valuable support through
transferring knowledge and advising on policies.

APPENDIX VI

benchmarks modified. Structural reform benchmarks: none fully met. (It later
emerged that Ukraine also had arrears of $17 million to western creditors that
it had not reported to the Fund, and therefore its September 29 purchase was
non-complying; in December the Fund granted Ukraine a waiver for that noncompliant purchase.)

•

•

Third review, to be based on October 31 test date, was postponed due to
“repeated non-observance of the performance criteria on external payments
arrears, serious slippages in the area of privatization, and continuing
uncertainties about the budget.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 11, 2005

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with Ukraine
On November 9, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Ukraine.1
Background
After four years of strong activity, annual growth has slowed sharply, from a peak of
about 12 percent in 2004, to 3 percent for January-September 2005. In part, the decline
reflects a somewhat less favorable external environment—export growth has fallen from
41 percent in 2004 (in nominal terms) to about 9 percent over the first half of 2005; while
import growth remained roughly unchanged from 24 percent to 23 percent respectively.
However, the fall in domestic growth also reflects the impact of continuing political
uncertainty on domestic investment.
Inflation has been trending upward since mid-2003. From a low of -0.6 percent in 2002,
the 12-month Consumer Price Index (CPI) reached 12.3 percent by end-2004, peaked
at 14.9 percent in August 2005, and declined somewhat to 12.4 percent in October
2005. Much of the recent surge in inflation has been concentrated in select food-related
items, reflecting in part the impact of higher pensions and wages on consumer demand.
Prices at the wholesale level, however, have eased from the highs of last year; the
Producer Price Index (PPI) reached a peak of about 25 percent toward the end of 2004,
and has since fallen to 12.9 in October 2005 owing to a slowing economy.
Wages continue to grow strongly. In July 2005, the average nominal monthly wage was
38 percent above its level the previous year, representing an increase of about
20 percent in real terms.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities.

-2-

Fiscal policy in 2005 has aimed at a significant fiscal tightening, with the supplementary
2005 budget targeting a general government deficit of 2½ percent of GDP; compared to
the 4½ percent of GDP realized during 2004, and the 6-7 percent of GDP implicit in the
original 2005 budget. However, the budget allowed for a substantial increase in public
pensions and wages, and offset this additional spending by a large increase in the tax
burden, partly reflecting the closing of tax loopholes, and steep cuts in capital
investment. The spending provisions have helped raise average public pensions and
wages by over 50 percent (against an inflation target of just under 10 percent), with a
noticeable impact on household income and consumer prices. Budget implementation in
2005 has been on track. Cash revenue through September have been buoyant,
reflecting tax measures introduced in the 2005 budget, while recent data point to a
significant underexecution of spending at the central government level. If maintained,
it could compensate for the unbudgeted pension spending pressures that have
materialized (some ¾ percent of GDP) and should put achieving the general
government deficit target of 2½ percent of GDP within reach. The stock of value added
tax refund arrears amounted to ½ percent of annual GDP at end-September 2005.
The re-auction of the steel company Kryvorizhstal resulted in unexpectedly high net
privatization revenues (after repaying the previous owners) of $4 billion (5 percent of
GDP), significantly in excess of the overall budgeted privatization revenue for 2005
(1¾ percent of GDP).
Monetary conditions have remained loose. Apart from a 5 percent nominal appreciation
of the hryvnia against the U.S. dollar during the first four months of the year and, more
recently, a somewhat reduced presence in the interbank foreign exchange market, the
NBU has continued to purchase foreign exchange rather than allow the exchange rate
to appreciate. Moreover, sterilization efforts have remained limited. The largest support
in absorbing liquidity has come from the government; which has issued new T-bills to
buy back the higher-yield restructured securities held by the National Bank of Ukraine
(NBU), and which has built up deposits by maintaining a tight fiscal stance.
With continued foreign exchange inflows, there is excess liquidity in the banking system,
and most interest rates are now negative in real terms. Monetary aggregates have
expanded more slowly in 2005, compared to 2004, but this comes against a backdrop of
decelerating money demand, as inflation has risen into double digits.
Reflecting high domestic inflation, the real exchange rate has appreciated markedly;
with the real effective rate rising by about 12 percent during the 12 months to end-July
2005. However, all indicators, including cross-country wage data, suggest that price
competitiveness of Ukrainian exporters remains strong.
The NBU has taken tentative steps toward greater nominal exchange rate flexibility, and
has relaxed a number of foreign exchange restrictions, including Ukraine’s export
surrender requirements and the provision that non-residents predeposit the full amount
of their auction T-bill bids. In August, the NBU allowed banks to operate on both sides
(buy/sell) of the foreign exchange market within the same day, and also allowed forward
operations. Together with the 1.5 percent foreign exchange transaction tax, which the
draft 2006 budget envisages to halve, these restrictions were the main elements

-3-

impeding development of Ukraine’s foreign exchange markets and instruments. In
contrast, however, the NBU has introduced a new, but likely non-binding, restriction on
purchases by non-residents of government securities with original maturities of less than
one year (government papers generally have original maturities that exceed one year)
and a 20 percent reserve requirement on foreign currency loans with a maturity of up to
180 days from non-residents.
The banking system weathered last year’s political turmoil well. However, credit
expansion and credit quality are still a concern. Credit growth remained high at
44 percent in September 2005, after some deceleration in late 2004 and early 2005.
Banks are refocusing their lending on household-sector loans (their share in total loans
has increased from 5 percent at end-2001 to 20 percent by end-September 2005),
including mortgage lending to the buoyant housing market. The non-performing loans
ratio of the banking system is declining, but remains high.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Ukraine made impressive economic gains during 2000–
04, largely as a result of favorable external factors and prudent macroeconomic policies.
However, the period since late 2004 has been a turbulent time for Ukraine, involving
political uncertainties and major shifts of policy that adversely affected business
confidence and investment. In tandem with less favorable external conditions—notably
on the terms of trade—and slow progress on structural reforms, this turbulence led to a
significant weakening in economic performance in 2005: growth slowed sharply,
inflation accelerated, and the current account surplus halved. Directors welcomed the
tentative signs of stabilization of the macroeconomic situation in recent months.
Directors stressed that a focused effort by the authorities to restore macroeconomic
stability and implement structural reforms to complete the transition to a full-fledged
market economy will be needed to unleash the economy’s significant untapped
potential. They considered that Ukraine’s medium-term growth outlook is highly
favorable, provided the right policies are put into place. Against this background,
Directors welcomed the authorities’ expressed commitment to fiscal discipline and their
progress in implementing a sound fiscal policy in 2005, as well as their initial steps
toward greater exchange rate flexibility, their commitment to market-strengthening
structural reforms, and their efforts to resolve lingering uncertainty regarding property
rights in Ukraine.
Directors observed that the relaxation in the fiscal stance during the run-up to the 2004
presidential elections, together with the large increases in public pensions and wages in
the supplementary 2005 budget, contributed significantly to recent inflationary
pressures. While this has been partly offset by targeting a reduced 2005 fiscal deficit of
2½ percent of GDP, higher spending has necessitated a significant increase in the
overall tax burden, although in good part through the welcome closing of tax loopholes
and improvements in taxpayer compliance. Directors commended the prudent budget
implementation in 2005, noting that the authorities seem broadly on track toward

-4-

achieving their 2005 general government deficit target, and encouraged the authorities
to clear all legitimate VAT refund arrears.
Looking ahead, Directors underscored the need for a fiscal stance that supports
disinflation. They urged the authorities to continue to resist strong pressures to raise
spending, particularly on social transfers and subsidies, and the fiscal deficit in the runup to elections in 2006. They recommended that the general government deficit not
exceed 2¼ percent of GDP in 2006, underpinned by a freeze on recurrent expenditure
in real terms and realistic macroeconomic assumptions. In line with this target,
Directors called on the government to allocate the Kryvorizhstal privatization windfall
primarily to debt redemptions that do not add to domestic liquidity, and to resist
pressures to re-open the tax loopholes that were closed in the 2005 budget. Such a
fiscal strategy would avoid fuelling inflationary pressures, and would increase the
authorities’ ability to address future contingencies as well as Ukraine’s sizeable mediumterm fiscal needs, including spending on public infrastructure.
Directors considered the reestablishment of a viable public pension fund to be a key
medium-term priority. They noted that the recent massive pension hikes have put the
pension fund in a precarious financial position, requiring large budget transfers to cover
contribution shortfalls and constraining the authorities’ scope for reducing the high tax
burden on labor. Directors encouraged the authorities to improve the targeting of the
minimum pension subsidy, raise effective retirement ages, and prune privileged pension
regimes.
Directors stressed that tighter monetary conditions are needed to help contain inflation,
while acknowledging both the limitations of interest rate policy given the absence of a
developed monetary transmission mechanism and the need to pay attention to ongoing
relative price adjustments. They urged the NBU to reduce further the excess liquidity in
the banking sector through a deceleration in money growth. Directors cautioned against
the NBU’s tentative plans to support bank intermediation by establishing a long-term
credit facility, since the NBU’s main role should be to provide liquidity rather than longterm credit.
Directors broadly agreed that a gradual shift to increased exchange rate flexibility and
inflation targeting would increase the NBU’s ability to achieve low and stable inflation,
particularly in the context of strong foreign investor interest and a competitive exchange
rate. They therefore welcomed the NBU’s recent steps toward a more flexible exchange
rate regime. However, they stressed the need for the NBU to communicate its policies
and intentions more consistently, and to ensure that the appropriate preconditions and
technical capacity for a successful policy shift are in place. In this regard, they
encouraged the NBU to build on its recent efforts to deregulate the foreign exchange
market and further strengthen its operational framework, while developing financial
markets. Directors noted Ukraine’s low productivity relative to potential, and stressed
that competitiveness is best enhanced through productivity-boosting reforms and
prudent policies to lower inflation.

Directors saw a strong case for improving macroeconomic policy coordination,
and welcomed the recent NBU initiative to reach a more formal understanding on policy
coordination between the NBU and the government.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ vision of sweeping structural reforms.
They observed that Ukraine’s lagging growth performance since 1992 relative to that of
most other transition economies—even accounting for the strong growth rates of 20002004—in large part reflects long-standing difficulties in reaching a political consensus to
build the more market-friendly institutions that would allow Ukraine to use its resources
more efficiently. They stressed, in particular, the importance of reforms to strengthen
public administration, fight corruption, and establish a stable and predictable business
environment. In this context, Directors welcomed the Ukraine-EU Action Plan, which
commits Ukraine to a wide range of structural policy actions and anchors the authorities’
reform drive within the process of closer integration with the EU and global markets.
They urged the authorities to launch an aggressive campaign to educate the public on
the benefits of these reforms.
Directors encouraged a rapid resolution of the debate on past privatizations. The recent
presidential memorandum guaranteeing property rights, the government’s efforts to
clearly and quickly identify those state enterprises to be privatized, the official
commitment to fully comply with privatization legislation, and the transparent re-auction
of the Kryvorizhstal steel mill were all seen as important steps in the right direction.
Directors noted, however, that a credible legislative proposal that outlines the full scope
of possible challenges to past privatizations may still be needed to address lingering
investor concerns.
Directors welcomed the government’s ambitious trade-policy agenda. While the
liberalization achieved so far this year constitutes important and tangible progress,
Directors considered that early implementation of the remaining measures needed for
WTO membership should remain a priority.
Directors viewed the development of domestic capital markets as key in strengthening
the monetary policy transmission mechanism and improving risk management and
financial intermediation. In line with Fund and World Bank recommendations, the
authorities should establish benchmarks for government securities, set up a coherent
debt management strategy, and swiftly adopt a Joint Stock Company Law.
Directors noted that there are continuing fragilities in the financial sector, and
encouraged the authorities to strengthen further the supervisory framework.
They commended the NBU for tightening regulations, including those pertaining to
foreign-currency loan-loss provisioning, open foreign currency positions, limits for
related-party lending, and the definition of bank capital. They welcomed the submission
to Parliament of revised legislation that would allow limits on early withdrawal of deposits
during financial emergencies. However, Directors regretted the delay in amending the
Banking Act, and encouraged the authorities to consider short-term measures to shore
up the banking system until the new legislation is approved—including raising the
minimum capital adequacy ratio to 12 percent. They also encouraged a switch from the

-6-

highly procedural supervision methods to a more risk-based framework, and a
strengthening of the bank resolution process.
Directors welcomed the progress in improving statistics. Although these are broadly
adequate for surveillance, shortcomings remain. In particular, stock data on sectoral
financial assets and liabilities need to be reconciled with flow data, especially on the
external side; and the quality of labor market data, particularly on wages and
employment, could be improved.
Directors welcomed the candid Ex Post Assessment (EPA) of Ukraine’s longer-term
program engagement with the Fund. They welcomed the EPA’s findings that Fund–
supported programs were quite effective in supporting macroeconomic stability, and that
the continuous policy dialogue between the Fund and the authorities influenced
important policy decisions and resulted in a beneficial transfer of knowledge to Ukrainian
policy makers. At the same time, Directors noted that Fund-supported programs did not
succeed in accelerating the pace of reform of more market-friendly institutions, which
ultimately explains Ukraine’s relatively poor program compliance. In light of this,
they concluded that stronger program ownership, rooted in stronger political consensus,
would be key to maximize the chances of success of any future program.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of
the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the
country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article
IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional
level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with
longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of
general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
