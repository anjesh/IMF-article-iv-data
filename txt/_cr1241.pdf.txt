STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 23, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Growth Prospects: After a mild downturn in 2009, the economy recovered strongly in
2010. This rebound was propelled by a pickup in mineral exports, domestic demand
growth supported by the fiscal stance, and easier monetary conditions in the Common
Monetary Area (CMA). Growth is projected at 3½ to 4 percent in 2011, improving to
around 4½ percent over the medium term. Inflation is expected to remain within
single-digit rates. Downside risks to growth stem mainly from the current turmoil in
Europe and its potential implications for the global economy and commodity markets.
Reestablishing fiscal policy buffers: The government launched a major three-year
fiscal initiative in 2011 aimed at increasing growth and employment. Public debt is now
rising rapidly, from a low base. The authorities intend to unwind the fiscal expansion in
2014. Fiscal consolidation would help keep public debt to a manageable level, support
the economy’s external position, and provide room for maneuver if further shocks arise,
including a potential fall in revenues from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU).
Reinforcing monetary and financial stability: The authorities reaffirmed their
intention to support the exchange rate peg against the South African rand. The
banking sector appears sound and regulation of non-bank financial intermediaries is
being strengthened. Namibia’s direct exposure to current international financial
pressures may be limited, but increased vigilance to address possible indirect
exposures and other vulnerabilities, including from the housing market, is warranted.
Buttressing structural reforms to promote employment and diversification: The
authorities are taking steps to lower the cost of doing business, while seeking to
support private investment growth, job creation, and export diversification.

Inflation remains subdued, despite

Imported inflation weighs heavily in the

South Africa. Some upside risks therefore arise
from the recent depreciation of the rand, to
which the Namibian dollar is pegged.

arrears. Nevertheless, the overall deficit for
FY2011/12 is projected to rise to 8.9 percent of
GDP, with the non-SACU deficit increasing to
18 percent of GDP (from 12.9 percent in
FY2010/11). The deficit is being financed from
domestic and regional sources, and through
the successful issuance of a $US500 million
Eurobond in October 2011. Public debt is
projected to increase from 16.2 percent of GDP
in FY2010/11 to 24.5 percent of GDP by end
FY2011/12.

NAMIBIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. The Targeted Intervention Program for Employment
and Economic Growth (TIPEEG)

The TIPEEG initiative, announced in the FY2011/12 budget, aims to support job creation and
more diversified growth in the economy. This program was motivated by concerns over
Namibia’s very high rates of inequality and unemployment, especially among youth, and by
what was seen as the need to take significant policy actions to address these problems.
Over FY2011/12 to FY2013/14, TIPEEG is projected to add $N14.6 bn. in government spending
(about 15 percent of current year GDP), comprising increases in both current and capital
spending. Although implementation has been slow to date and is widely expected to fall far
short of 100 percent, at least in FY2011/12, the government has recently tried to step up
implementation by reforming procurement processes to strengthen decentralization of TIPEEGrelated spending.
Through TIPEEG, the government aims to preserve or create about 104,000 direct and indirect
jobs—a sizable share of the total 15+ population of just under 1 million. Four sectors are
targeted:
Agriculture: funds for improved livestock farming, horticulture development, water
supply, and crop production.
Tourism: spending on tourism marketing and infrastructure investment.
Transport: improvements in transport infrastructure, including road and rail networks
and port facilities.
Housing and sanitation: funding for servicing of land, construction of low-cost
housing, and sanitation facilities.

Although rigorous prioritization and monitoring of TIPEEG projects remains essential, this
initiative has the potential to raise growth and employment in some areas. For example,
improvements in domestic road, rail, and port infrastructure should complement the
strengthening in transport networks in the southern African region and support growth in
regional trade. TIPEEG’s targeting of the agriculture and tourism sectors stems in part from
domestic analyses identifying these sectors as promising sources of long-term output and
employment growth.

the real effective exchange rate in 2009–10,
and the more expansionary fiscal stance. For
end-2011, international reserves are estimated
at $US1.4 billion, covering 2.4 months of
prospective imports of goods and services; this
compares with the recent peak of
$US1.9 billion in reserves (4.7 months import
cover) at end-2009. With the weakening of the
rand, the appreciation of the real effective
exchange rate has reversed in recent months.
Overvaluation estimates currently vary in a
range of 1 to 10 percent (see Box 2), but given
the uncertainty and volatility in these
estimates, the staff’s overall view is that the
exchange rate does not deviate significantly
from its equilibrium value.

The monetary stance remains

supportive of the peg to the rand. The Bank
of Namibia lowered its policy rate to 6 percent
in December 2010, representing a cumulative
reduction of 450 basis points since December
2008—in line with similar actions by the South

Conditions in the banking sector

have improved as the economy recovers.
Total earnings grew by 12.4 percent in 2010,
helping maintain bank profitability. Nonperforming loans fell to 1.6 percent of total
loans at end-November 2011, down from
2.7 percent at end-2009. With overdue loans
also declining, the asset quality of the banking
sector has remained satisfactory.
7.

High unemployment and income

inequality are significant policy concerns.
The most widely cited official unemployment
rate is 51 percent, a rate that includes
“discouraged workers” (who have given up
looking for employment). But even excluding
these, unemployment reaches 38 percent.
While some measurement questions surround
these official rates, there is no doubt that
unemployment is unacceptably high. Unequal
income distribution is also very high by
international standards (chart).

deviate substantially from its equilibrium level.
Current account norm (Macroeconomic Balance approach)
According to the macro balance approach, the
Namibian dollar is 1 percent above its
equilibrium level. This assessment hinges on an
estimated “underlying” current account deficit
of about 2½ percent of GDP, which is expected
to prevail in 2016 when the output gap is
closed, compared to an estimated current
account norm of a deficit of about 1 percent of
GDP.
The external sustainability approach points
to an overvaluation of 9½ percent as the
current account that stabilizes the net foreign
assets is estimated at a surplus of 1 percent of
GDP in 2016.

Outlook.

B. Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks
8.

The economic outlook appears

favorable. This outlook is supported by
projected growth in the natural resource
sector, including investment to support
diamond output, the recent licensing of the
world’s fourth largest uranium mine, and
increased optimism surrounding development
of natural gas reserves. Exploration is also
underway for new mineral resources,
including oil, and there is ongoing growth in
non-resource intensive area such as
construction, manufacturing, and services.
Over the medium term, output growth is
projected to average around 4½ percent. The
staff’s baseline scenario envisages current
account deficits of about 3 percent of GDP on
average over 2012-16. However, their impact
on Namibia’s external debt trajectory is
projected to remain modest, as a large share
of the projected imports is related to foreign
direct investment in the mineral sector (see

Debt Sustainability Analysis in the
Informational Annex).
9.

There are a number of risks to the

outlook, however. The current external
environment remains fragile and uncertain,
especially given the difficulties in the euro
area and their potential spillovers. These
concerns imply significant downside risks to
commodity demand and prices. While
significant investment plans and prospects in
the resource sector underpin the favorable
outlook noted above, these plans could be
delayed or put on hold should the global
economic climate deteriorate. Furthermore,
the expansionary fiscal stance will likely lead
to strong growth in domestic demand and
imports, and could put upward pressure on
prices of non-tradables—weakening the
economy’s external position and
competitiveness. Given these risks and their
potential for undermining the objectives of
the TIPEEG initiative, particular vigilance is

Authorities’ Views
12.

The authorities fully recognized the

need to ensure internal and external
balance in the economy. They stressed that
the current fiscal expansion was temporary,
aimed at addressing supply bottlenecks and
providing a catalyst for economic and
employment growth. They signaled their
intention to keep public debt below 35 percent

especially as large capital imports (e.g., for the
resource sector) may be self financed through
foreign direct investment (FDI) and other
inflows.2 Nevertheless, they acknowledged that
keeping reserves at an adequate level by
internationally recognized standards would
help to support international confidence in the
economy and the exchange rate peg,
particularly in view of the increased external

Box 3. The Measurement of Potential Growth in Namibia
Namibia registered impressive GDP growth in the years preceding the financial crisis (2000–08),
1
although growth rates have been volatile due to developments in the mineral sector (chart).
Following the GDP contraction in 2009, growth rebounded in 2010 and is now estimated to have
surpassed its pre-crisis level.
Potential output growth was estimated by applying two conventional statistical filters, HodrickPrescott and Baxter-King, as well as an unobserved component method. Although the results should
be interpreted with caution given both the

The results also suggest that, during the 2009
episode, the output gap moved sharply negative,
to about 2½ percent, from a positive level of
2–2½ percent in the previous two years. In light
of the strong growth in 2010, the output gap has
narrowed significantly (based on the average of
the three estimations). But with projected
subdued growth in 2011 and a modest recovery
thereafter, the output gap is projected to remain
in negative territory until it converges to zero in
2015–16.

Box 4. Results of the International Comparison Program (ICP) for
Namibia and Comparators, 2005
In view of the concerns expressed about Namibia’s recent classification as an upper middle-income country, a
methodological question surrounds what exchange rate is best used to compare counties’ income levels. While
the income classification exercise relies on market exchange rates, during the last 40 years there have been
several attempts to develop economic statistics reflecting the purchasing power parities (PPPs) of national
currencies. Such measures may be more useful and less misleading than those based on market exchange rates,
which could fluctuate significantly. The ICP, launched by the World Bank in 2003, represents the most recent
systematic measurement of world PPPs. The ICP adopted 2005 as the year of reference for measuring price and
volume levels of GDP (and its components) on a PPP basis for more than 100 countries around the world,
grouped in 5 geographic regions.
The ICP results for Namibia and other regional comparators reveal the following:
I. Namibia, together with Swaziland, Cape Verde, and Lesotho, has significantly lower real GDP per capita than
other middle-income African economies.
II. In relation to the African average, Namibia was one of the most expensive countries to live and work.
III. The standard of living in Namibia, as measured by real actual consumption per capita, was at the bottom of
the country list, except for Cape Verde and Lesotho. The standard of living in Mauritius and South Africa, which
profited from relatively low prices, was the highest in the country sample.
IV. Gross fixed capital formation per capita in Namibia is below the regional average.
V. The price level of gross fixed capital formation is some 22 percent above the regional average.
VI. Namibia generally spends less than comparators across standard CPI spending categories.

strengthening the non-SACU fiscal balance
should also be a policy priority. To reach these
goals, increases in current and capital
spending planned under TIPEEG need to be
unwound at the end of this initiative, if not
before, and the risk averted that these
increases become locked into permanent
growth in public spending. To enhance the
credibility of the government’s
macroeconomic strategy, these fiscal goals
should be presented as formal commitments,
reflected in the fiscal framework beginning in
FY2012/13, and then adhered to.
29.

Measures proposed to strengthen

the tax base and revenue collection need to
be rapidly implemented. Revenue losses
from tax incentives should also be contained—
for example, by full accounting of tax
expenditures, updating and streamlining the
incentive regime, and sunset provisions on the
granting of exemptions.
30.

Rigorous prioritization and

monitoring of development spending is
essential. To ensure high-quality public
spending, including sound execution of public
investment, current plans for spending growth
may need to be reined in to ensure such
growth is consistent with capacities to assess
and implement development projects,
including the application of transparent

31.

Fiscal restraint is needed to help

preserve a sound external position and the
sustainability of the peg. While the
benchmark of 3 months import cover for
official reserves may not be entirely suitable
for a resource intensive economy such as
Namibia, staff agrees with the authorities’ goal
of ensuring reserve adequacy by this along
with other metrics. This goal is particularly
appropriate given the increased scrutiny of the
economy by ratings agencies and international
investors.
32.

The exchange rate peg to the rand

has anchored macroeconomic and financial
stability. At its current level, the exchange
rate appears broadly in line with its equilibrium
value. Further alignment of the BoN policy rate
with that of SARB should be considered,
particularly if fiscal consolidation takes place
and if the weakening external environment
spills over to the Namibian economy.
33.

Namibian banks have weathered the

global financial crisis well. Remaining
vulnerabilities need to be contained, however,
in light of the heightened global uncertainty.
In this regard, staff welcomes the authorities’
progress in strengthening regulation and

Sources: Namibian authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ "Overall balance" reflects externally financed project spending (except for roads) that is not channeled through the state account.
2/ "Overall balance excluding extrabudgetary spending" excludes such spending and thus corresponds directly with the authorities' concept.
3/ The change in domestic debt includes bonds issued for local capital market development.

1/ "Overall balance" reflects externally financed project spending (except for roads) that is not channeled through the state account.
2/ "Overall balance excluding extrabudgetary spending" excludes such spending and thus corresponds directly with the authorities' concept.
3/ The change in domestic debt includes bonds issued for local capital market development.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The
authorities provide core monthly data to the Fund with a lag of one to two months, except for the
national accounts and international trade data, which are reported quarterly and annually with
longer lags. The authorities have recently completed a Household Income and Expediture Survey
that will allow them to update the CPI basket and re-estimate Gini coefficients in the near term.
National Accounts: National accounts estimation has not kept pace with changes to the structure
of the economy and needs to be rebased (the current base year is 2004). An update of the national
accounts base year is tentatively scheduled for FY2012/13. Seasonally adjusted quarterly national
accounts (QNA) estimates, at 2004 prices are disseminated on Namibia’s National Planning
Commission’s website, though there is a need to improve existing source data.
Price Statistics: In February 2005, the government introduced a nation-wide consumer price index
to replace the previous index that only covered the capital city of Windhoek; the new index is
available from January 2002. However, the weights for the index are estimated from the 1993–94
National Household Income and Expenditure Survey and seasonal items and new products are
excluded. Data on the labor market, including labor force, employment, and wages are not
regularly collected, which impedes the analysis of labor market developments.
Government Finance Statistics: Annual budgetary central government data by fiscal year, which
are reported on a cash basis in the GFSM 2001 format, are reasonably complete, despite some
gaps in terms of details. No fiscal statistics are compiled for extra budgetary institutions,
consolidated central government, or consolidated general government.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monthly monetary statistics for the Bank of Namibia (BoN)
and the other depository corporations (ODCs) are reported on a regular basis, although there is
room to improve the timeliness of reporting, particularly with regard to BoN data. Beginning in
April 2002, data are based on standardized report forms, which accord with the concepts and
definitions of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics: External Debt: Since
2001, the BoN has been reporting the balance of payments data on a quarterly basis with a lag of
one quarter. Those data are subject to substantial revisions. The methodology underlying the
balance of payments is consistent with the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual.
The international investment position (IIP) data are compiled quarterly with a lag of one quarter.
The Bank of Namibia has focused its work to improve the compilation of capital and financial
transactions and IIP statistics. They have expanded their data collection capabilities through survey
data collection. However, further work is needed to expand the coverage of the IIP and restate the
IIP in a format that will allow for comparison with the balance of payments statistics.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Namibia has participated in the GDDS since late 2002. A ROSC (Data Module) was published in
2002 and updated in 2005.

III. Reporting to STA
The MOF reports, on a regular basis, annual data for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook. Work on establishing monthly reporting of high frequency data is still in
progress.
The BoN reports monetary and financial statistics to STA regularly. Balance of payments and
international investment position data are published in International Financial Statistics (IFS) and in
the Balance of Payments Yearbook.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS

Approved By

Domenico Fanizza and
Dhaneshwar Ghura

Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2011
Consultation with Namibia

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS NAMIBIA

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
Namibia’s public debt for FY2010/11 is
estimated at about N$13.5 billion
(16.2 percent of GDP). About 24 percent of the
debt is owed to bilateral, multilateral and private
foreign creditors while the rest is domestic debt.
Before its recent rise, public debt had fallen from
26 percent of GDP in 2005/6 to 15.5 percent in
2009/10, with domestic debt declining from
22.2 percent of GDP to 11.5 percent over the
same period. However, the current expansionary
stance of fiscal policy is projected to increase debt
sharply, bringing overall public debt to
35.3 percent of GDP in FY2016/17. Further upside
risks stem from a potential future decline in SACU
revenues.
2.




Table 2 shows two scenarios:
The first scenario shows the fiscal outcome
if real GDP growth, real interest rates, and
the primary balance remain at their
historical 10-year averages. In this case, the
public debt to GDP would only reach
19.8 percent of GDP by 2016, reflecting the
relatively more benign historical levels of
the key variables, including the prudent
fiscal stance over the last decade.
The second scenario shows the fiscal
outcome if government’s policies in 2010
remain unchanged, with the primary deficit
standing at 3.6 percent of GDP throughout
the medium term. In this case, public debt
rises sharply to 59 percent of GDP, thereby
breaching the authorities’ indicative limit
of 35 percent of GDP.

3.
The bounds tests reveal the
vulnerability of the fiscal position to

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

exogenous shocks (Figure 1). The most benign
shock is that stemming from a negative growth
shock (decline from 4.3 percent to 2.6 percent)
which could result in a 12 percentage point
increase in the debt to GDP ratio. Public debt is
also highly sensitive to shocks to the primary
balance and contingent liabilities.
4.
Namibia’s external debt is projected to
increase somewhat by 2016, yet remain at a
moderate level. In 2011, external debt is
estimated to have increased by 3 percentage
points to 23 percent of GDP, largely reflecting the
substantial deterioration in the external position
as well as the recent issuance of the Eurobond by
the government (US$500 million). The debt ratio
is set to remain on an upward trajectory over the
medium-term and reach 25 percent of GDP in
2016 as the current account deficits—although
moderating—are projected to persist. In this
regard, the impact of the current account deficits
on the external debt’s trajectory is projected to
remain modest, as a large share of the projected
imports are related to foreign direct investment in
the mineral sector.
5.
The rising external debt ratio increases
the vulnerability of the economy to external
shocks, although risks remain manageable.
Stress tests suggest that Namibia’s external debt
is mostly sensitive to a persistent non-interest
current account shock, which would increase the
external debt ratio to 44 percent of GDP. This
scenario, which could be interpreted as a sharp
drop in external demand for Namibia’s mineral
exports in the event of a protracted global
slowdown, should be seen as the upper bound
estimates, particularly given that a standard DSA
scenario does not capture the likely impact of

NAMIBIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

such a shock on relative prices. A one-off
depreciation of 30 percent, as well as a scenario
that combines a relatively moderate shock to
both current account balance and GDP growth,
are also estimated to sharply increase the debt

ratio to around 40 percent of GDP by 2016. In
contrast, a separate shock to GDP growth and
interest rates is projected to have a relatively
moderate impact on the external debt’s trajectory.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Namibia
On February 6, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Namibia.1
Background
The Namibian economy rebounded strongly in 2010 following the mild contraction in 2009,
which was driven largely by a drop in diamond output. GDP is now estimated to have increased
by 6.6 percent in 2010, supported by rising diamond and uranium production and ongoing
growth in non-mining sectors. There appears to have been some slowing in growth in 2011,
following severe flooding in the north and the weaker-than-expected state of the global
economy, and GDP may have risen by 3½–4 percent. For 2012, growth is projected to be
around 4 percent. Inflation remains moderate and is expected to remain within single digits. The
official unemployment rate is very high by international and even regional comparison, whether
using the broad measure (51.2 percent) or strict measure (37.6 percent) from the 2008 Labor
Force Survey. Income inequality is also high by international standards.
The fiscal stance expanded significantly in FY2011/12, with the Government introducing a new
program aimed at increasing long-term growth and employment. Under this program,
infrastructure spending is to be increased and temporary jobs created within the public sector,
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

with measures targeted on the sectors of agriculture, tourism, transport, and housing and
sanitation. Although substantial under-execution of spending appears likely in FY2011/12, the
fiscal deficit is expected to be around 9 percent of GDP and public debt is projected to rise to
nearly 25 percent in FY2011/12 (compared with 16 percent of GDP in FY2010/11).
The Bank of Namibia has maintained its policy rate at 6 percent since December 2010, 50 basis
points above the rate of the South African Reserve Bank. Conditions in the banking sector have
improved as the economy recovers, and supervision of the rapidly growing sector of non-bank
financial institutions is being strengthened.
Despite a rebound in exports, driven by improved revenues from diamonds and other minerals,
Namibia’s external position weakened over 2010-11. This deterioration was attributable in part
to strong import growth, supported by the expansionary fiscal stance, and lower SACU
revenues in 2010. Official foreign exchange reserves at end-2011 were US$1.9 billion, including
the proceeds of Namibia’s debut $US500 million Eurobond issuance in October 2011, and
provide around 3.0 months of import cover.
The economic outlook appears promising, but faces some important downside risks. There are
good prospects for further investment and growth in the natural resource sector, and ongoing
growth is expected in such areas as construction, manufacturing, and services. The fragile
external climate, however, poses risks for commodity demand and prices. Furthermore, the
expansionary fiscal stance will likely lead to strong growth in domestic demand and imports and
could put upward pressures on prices of non-tradables–hence weakening efforts to strengthen
Namibia’s external competitiveness and economic diversification.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the recent strong economic recovery and the favorable medium
term outlook. Directors cautioned, however, that the economy faces substantial downside risks,
including spillovers from the deteriorating global environment and the sustained high level of
unemployment and income inequality. Against this backdrop, they encouraged the authorities to
rebuild policy buffers by pursuing prudent fiscal policies, prioritizing public spending,
safeguarding reserves, and pressing ahead with structural reforms to boost the economy’s
growth potential.
Directors stressed the importance of maintaining debt sustainability and rebuilding adequate
buffers against external shocks, which will require the timely unwinding of the current fiscal
stimulus, particularly if external conditions deteriorate further. They emphasized the importance
of strengthening the domestic revenue base and of rigorously prioritizing and monitoring public
spending, which will help address the risk of further volatility in revenues from the mineral sector
and from the Southern African Customs Union.
Directors welcomed the resilience of the financial sector, and encouraged the authorities to
remain vigilant. In particular, it will be important to closely monitor banks’ exposure to the

3
domestic housing sector and take preemptive measures to contain risks from a reversal of the
surge in house prices.
Directors concurred that the peg to the South African rand has served the Namibian economy
well, and noted the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with
fundamentals. Directors agreed that closer alignment of the Bank of Namibia’s policy rate to that
of the South African Reserve Bank could be considered, especially if the current fiscal stimulus
is unwound or if the domestic economy slows. Rebuilding reserves would help safeguard the
country’s external position.
Directors concurred that wide ranging reforms were needed to address Namibia’s very high
levels of unemployment and income inequality. They encouraged the authorities to tackle these
problems mainly through structural reforms and stronger private investment, rather than through
unsustainable increases in public spending. Directors noted the scope to improve the climate for
business formation and job growth by strengthening education and training, improving the
functioning of labor and product markets, and easing business registration procedures.
Directors welcomed the recent reclassification of Namibia as an upper middle income country
as an indication of the country’s successful macroeconomic performance. A few Directors
supported the authorities’ request for donors to postpone the phasing out of concessional
support given the ongoing serious development challenges.

Statement by Mr. Majoro on Namibia
Executive Board Meeting
February 6, 2012
Introduction
1.
My Namibian authorities appreciate the constructive engagement and policy dialogue
with staff in their effort to address pervasive unemployment, sustain the growth momentum
and preserve macroeconomic stability. They value highly the support from staff,
Management, and Executive Directors, and find the staff report informative, well balanced,
and a source of meaningful advice on the country's economic program and policy challenges.
2.
The authorities have demonstrated a track record of sound macroeconomic policy
implementation, reflected in solid economic performance over the last decade or so. However
this impressive performance was interrupted by the global financial and economic crises as
the slump in external demand resulted in a contraction in domestic output and a shift in the
fiscal position into a deficit. In spite of recent gradual rebound, income inequality has
remained wide, the level of unemployment unacceptably high and poverty pervasive. Some
official estimates place the unemployment rate as high as 51 percent comprising mostly the
youths and unskilled. The authorities have responded astutely to these policy challenges as
reflected in the five-year National Development Plans (NDPs) and Vision 2030 under which
the country aims to be an industrial, knowledge-based society with high per capital income
and near full employment by the year 2030. Notwithstanding these bold attempts to redress
the situation, high unemployment and income inequality have persisted.
3.
It is against this background that the authorities in 2011 launched the Targeted
Intervention Program for Employment and Economic Growth (TIPEEG). TIPEEG is a
specialized short-term program aimed at addressing the acute high unemployment rate,
thereby laying the foundations for sustained economic development. Focusing on four
strategic, high growth-enhancing sectors—agriculture, tourism, transport, and housing and
sanitation— this three-year program entails fiscal expansion, estimated at about 15% of GDP
in FY2011/12, its first year of implementation. It is envisaged that its successful
implementation will result in the preservation and creation of over 100,000 direct and
indirect job opportunities. While the authorities' medium-term expenditure framework
(MTEF) is predicated on this policy intervention, they are mindful of the macroeconomic
implications of the scaling up of resources under the program and reaffirm their commitment
to unwind their spending intervention at the end of the current MTEF.
Recent economic developments and prospects
4.
The Namibian economy registered robust performance prior to the global financial
and economic crises, with growth averaging 6.3 percent between 2004 and 2008 and inflation
at single digits.. The fiscal and external positions strengthened as a result of significant
improvement in tax administration, increased mineral exports, and substantial Southern
African Customs Union (SACU) transfers. The strong fiscal performance allowed for
considerable reduction in the public debt from 28 percent in 2004 to 16 percent in 2009.

2

5.
This substantial macroeconomic buffer helped the authorities weather the impact of
the global financial and economic crises. Growth rebounded strongly in 2010 recording a real
increase of 6.6 percent supported by rising mineral production and the continued expansion
in non-mining sectors. A decline in mining activities and a slowing in the secondary
industries resulted in a slowdown in growth in 2011 estimated at 3.8 percent. Though
gradually increasing, inflation has remained moderate with the average annual inflation rate
for 2011 at 5.0 percent compared to 4.5 percent in 2010. While the current account weakened
on account of lower global commodity demand, official foreign exchange reserves were
boosted by the successful issuance of $US500 million Eurobonds. As at end-December 2011,
the reserves position stood at around US$1.86 billion, representing over 3 months of
forward-looking import cover. The economy is projected to grow by 4.2 percent during 2012.
6.
The medium-term growth outlook is promising supported by potential increase in
mineral production, mainly diamond and uranium, and infrastructural development owing
partly to TIPEEG. The growth of the non-mining sector—manufacturing, construction, and
services—and the prospects for future oil production also underpin this favorable outlook.
However, downside risks remain. The sovereign debt crisis in the Euro Area and a weakerthan-anticipated global economic recovery could pull commodity prices down resulting in
lower mining output and decreased export earnings.
Fiscal policy developments and outlook
7.
My authorities have continued to pursue prudent fiscal policy aimed at promoting
economic growth, efficient service delivery and socio-economic welfare within the ambit of
macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability. To support real sector activity as the global
economic slowdown intensified, an expansionary fiscal stance was adopted in FY2009/10 on
the back of the fiscal buffers accumulated in the pre-crises period. The fiscal stimulus
increased significantly in FY2011/12 in support of the TIPEEG, with the widening of the
overall deficit. While the adoption of countercyclical fiscal measures has provided muchneeded boost to the economy, the authorities remain mindful of the potential impacts on
fiscal outcomes. The public debt is, however, expected to remain relatively low, at below 25
percent of GDP for FY2011/12, in spite of the projected increase in the fiscal deficit. The
authorities, nonetheless, take particular note of staff’s debt sustainability analysis
highlighting the longer-term unsustainability of the current fiscal stance and the vulnerability
of the fiscal position to negative growth shock. Given their demonstrable capacity to rein in
the public debt, the authorities are confident of preserving its sustainability over the medium
to long term.
8.
The authorities remain committed to widening the fiscal space by enhancing revenue
collection and strengthening tax administration. To this end, amendments to the income tax
act and the value added tax act aimed at broadening and deepening the tax base have been
submitted for legislative approval. Efforts are underway to streamline tax procedures,
improve computerization of tax collection and adopt a taxpayer self-assessment system. To
further strengthen revenue flows, the introduction of an export levy on raw material exports
and specific environmental taxes is being explored. While the near-term outlook for SACU
revenues seems favorable, the authorities are aware of the downside risks. Thus, going

3
forward, they are committed to implementing fiscal rules based on sustainable non-SACU
fiscal balance and strengthening the budget framework and processes to help mitigate the
risks to the fiscal framework.
9.
The authorities will seek to strengthen public financial management, including
through an integrated tax management system that will help simplify tax administration
processes and improve services to taxpayers. To ensure transparency, accountability, and the
efficient use of public resources, expenditure reviews and tracking will be carried out during
this MTEF period and a roll-out of program-budgeting to all votes undertaken.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
10.
In spite of the limited scope for independent monetary policy arising from the
country’s membership of the Common Monetary Area (CMA), the Bank of Namibia (BoN)
responded strongly to the global financial and economic crises by adopting an expansionary
monetary policy stance. The repo rate was reduced by 300 basis points in 2009 and a further
100 basis points to 6 percent in 2010 to provide additional stimulus to the economy. Given
the largely benign inflation environment and the weak recovery of the domestic economy, the
BoN has maintained its policy stance and kept the rate at 6 percent.
11.
The authorities continue to view the exchange rate peg to the South African rand as
an appropriate monetary policy anchor. They are therefore committed to maintaining
international reserves at sufficiently high levels to safeguard the peg and, at the same time,
reinforce the economy’s defenses against potential external shocks. As a result, deliberate
policy action is being taken to maintain the gross international reserves position well-above
the threshold of 3 months of import cover. Additionally, staff’s assessment indicating that
real effective exchange rate remains broadly in line with economic fundamentals provides
much comfort.
Financial sector developments and reforms
12.
Namibia’s financial system exhibited immense resilience in the face of the global
financial and economic crises and has remained sound and well-functioning. The commercial
banking sector is well capitalized, provisioned and profitable, with minimal direct exposure
to foreign financial institutions. The authorities are, however, mindful of the risks from
exposures of banks’ loan portfolios to the real estate sector and stand ready to institute
appropriate macroprudential measures to mitigate the risk of any potential house price bubble
stemming from cross-border real estate purchases.
13.
Notwithstanding the smooth functioning of the financial system, the authorities
recognize the need to address its inherent weaknesses, ranging from limited access to
financial services to less effective regulation, if the sector is to meaningfully contribute to
economic development. To this end, plans have been put in place to strengthen the Namibia
Financial Institutions Supervisory Authority (NAMFISA), including its capacity to
effectively supervise the growing number of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs). The

4
Financial Institutions and Markets Bill which has already been approved by Cabinet is
expected to receive parliamentary approval in the coming months.
14.
In addition to the several national initiatives in recent years, such as the NDPs and
Vision 2030, a ten-year Financial Sector Strategy (FSS) was launched in December 2011
aimed at addressing the underlying shortcomings of the system with a view to building a
more resilient, competitive and dynamic financial system. A key focus of the strategy is the
achievement of financial inclusion by creating a favorable environment in which the financial
sector would flourish and create equal access to financial services, thereby helping to narrow
income inequalities, reduce poverty and foster economic growth. Other areas of intervention
include consumer literacy and protection, localization of the financial sector, and financial
system deepening and development. An Action Plan with clearly defined expected outcomes
has been developed to aid in monitoring and evaluation of the strategy.
Structural reforms
15.
My authorities are committed to implementing far-reaching structural reforms to
complement their sound macroeconomic policies in order to achieve a more broad-based
growth and address the endemic problem of income inequality and high unemployment.
TIPEEG, discussed earlier, represents one such initiative to spur activity in strategic, high
growth-enhancing sectors and create job opportunities. The authorities have also been
unrelenting in improving the business climate and promoting private sector development. In
this regard, a series of legislative amendments are currently underway aimed at modernizing
the Foreign Investment Act, manufacturers’ incentives, Export Processing Zones (EPZ), and
Exploration and Prospecting Licenses (EPLs), to name but a few. Furthermore, there is firm
commitment to reducing the cost of doing business through significant investment in
infrastructure and energy. Policies to foster competitiveness and enhance productivity are
expected to form centerpiece of the next five-year national development plan, NDP4.

Finally, as staff highlighted, my authorities are concerned over the financial
implications of the country’s recent reclassification as an upper middle-income country as it
essentially precludes it from access to much-needed concessional financing. The authorities
are of the view that the country’s significantly high income inequality and enormous
development challenges are not properly reflected in the classification methodology. The
results of staff’s analysis which employs the World Bank’s International Comparison
Program (ICP) based on a purchasing power parity approach (staff report Box 4) clearly
highlight the country’s low ranking in terms of living standards and consumption patterns
relative to regional comparators. The country’s reclassification has already rendered it
ineligible for renewal of assistance under the Millennium Challenge Corporation and access
to EU concessional financing is now limited. Given the emerging downside impact of the
global economic downturn, my authorities intend to argue for a postponement of donor
actions in phasing out concessional support.
Conclusion
My Namibian authorities remain committed to pursuing sound macroeconomic

policies and implementing far-reaching structural reforms to address the high level of

unemployment, promote external competitiveness and enhance economic productivity. They
are confident that judicious implementation of TIPEEG will create much-needed job
opportunities and help unleash the economy’s growth potential. They undertake to unwind
the fiscal expansion at the end of the initiative in order to preserve medium to long-term
fiscal sustainability.
