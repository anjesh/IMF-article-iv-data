IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Japan

On July 17, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Japan.
A modest economic recovery is underway. GDP is expected to grow at an above-potential pace
this year (0.8 percent) buoyed by gradually strengthening private consumption on higher real
wages and a gradual recovery of external demand. Inflation remains well below the Bank of
Japan’s 2 percent target partly due to commodity price developments, but will start to pick up
toward the end of this year with the dissipation of the negative effects of falling oil prices and
higher wage growth.
Ongoing structural reforms have improved long-term prospects modestly. Growth is projected to
stabilize at around 0.7 percent over the medium term with improvements in productivity and
capital formation and higher labor force participation offsetting headwinds from the diminishing
labor force. On the back of the closing of the output gap, a tight labor market and renewed
favorable wage-price dynamics, inflation is expected to increase gradually to about 1.5percent
over the medium term under current policies. However, risks to this outlook are tilted to the
downside with the most important risks stemming from weak domestic demand and incomplete
policies, particularly with regard to the fiscal consolidation and structural reforms.
Abenomics needs to be reloaded so that policy shortcomings do not become a drag on growth
and inflation. In addition to swift implementation of already announced reforms, further highimpact structural reforms are urgently needed to lift growth, facilitate fiscal consolidation, and
unburden monetary policy. The next round of reforms should lift labor supply, reduce labor

market duality, continue agricultural and services sector deregulation and turn the financial
sector into a driver of reforms.
A credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plan is needed to remove uncertainty about the
direction of policies that may be holding back domestic demand. The medium-term fiscal reform
plan should aim to put debt on a downward path, based on realistic economic assumptions, and
specify structural revenue and expenditure measures upfront. The Bank of Japan needs to stand
ready to ease further, provide stronger guidance to markets through enhanced communication,
and put greater emphasis on achieving the 2 percent inflation target in a stable manner. However,
further monetary easing without bolder structural reforms and a credible medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan could lead to sluggish domestic demand and overreliance on yen depreciation
to pursue domestic policy objectives, with possible adverse spillovers abroad.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the improved medium-term outlook for growth and inflation.
Directors commended the authorities for persistently pursuing the three-pronged economic
strategy to lift growth, overcome entrenched deflation, and reduce public indebtedness. With
risks tilted to the downside, Directors underscored that it would be essential to reinvigorate all
elements of the government’s economic strategy, the success of which will also be beneficial
for the global economy.
Directors emphasized the urgency of completing far-reaching structural reforms to address the
challenge of population aging and achieve the ambitious growth objectives of the revitalization
strategy. They welcomed the recent progress in improving corporate governance and raising
female labor force participation. Directors encouraged further growth-enhancing reforms to
increase labor supply, reduce labor market duality, and deregulate the agricultural and service
sectors. Continued efforts are also needed to enhance the efficiency of resource allocation
through the financial system.
Directors agreed that the fiscal consolidation strategy needs to strike a balance between making
progress on deficit reduction and supporting growth and inflation momentum. They welcomed
the recent announcement of a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan with specific primary
deficit targets while acknowledging the need for flexibility to take account of economic and
price developments. Directors noted that prudent economic assumptions, identification of
concrete measures to put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward trajectory, and strong fiscal
institutions would help impart credibility to the consolidation plan. Specifically, ongoing efforts

to raise the consumption tax and reform expenditures are crucial to this strategy.
Directors stressed that raising inflation in a stable manner remains an important— albeit
challenging—priority. They were reassured by the authorities’ readiness to take further monetary
policy action as necessary, complemented with enhanced communication to guide markets.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to improve monetary policy transmission, and to
strengthen momentum for wage increases in the tripartite dialogue.
Directors agreed that the financial system remains sound and well capitalized. They supported
initiatives to further enhance its resilience to risks, including from volatility in interest rates and
liquidity in the government bond market. Directors saw scope for financial institutions to seek
higher returns while improving their risk management tools. They emphasized the role of
macroprudential policies in addressing financial stability risks in a low interest rate environment.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that Japan’s external position was broadly consistent
with fundamentals in 2014 but that the yen has depreciated since then. Going forward, ambitious
structural reforms to boost domestic demand and credible fiscal consolidation are critical to avoid
overreliance on the depreciation of the yen. These efforts will ease the burden of monetary
policy, as well as help avert negative spillovers from portfolio rebalancing by Japanese financial
institutions.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 30, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Abenomics has lifted Japan out of the doldrums and needs to be reinforced to accomplish
the desired “once in a lifetime” economic regime shift. Building on initial positive results,
policies now need to embark on a sustained effort to meet the unprecedented challenges

Japan is facing: ending an entrenched deflationary mindset, raising growth, restoring fiscal
and debt sustainability, and maintaining financial stability in the face of adverse
demographics.
Japan should be at the vanguard of structural reform. More vigorous efforts to raise
labor supply and deregulate domestic markets, backed by further endeavors to raise wages
and investment and designed to boost confidence and raise domestic demand, will be
essential to lift growth, facilitate fiscal consolidation, and unburden monetary policy.
A credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plan is needed to remove uncertainty
about the direction of policies that may be holding back domestic demand. The
overarching goal should be to put debt on a downward path, through gradual but steady
consolidation that does not derail growth and inflation momentum. It should be based on
prudent economic assumptions and on concrete structural revenue and expenditure
measures identified upfront.
More explicit monetary guidance would enhance inflation dynamics. Actual and
expected inflation remain well below the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ’s) inflation target and
monetary policy transmission remains weak. The BoJ needs to stand ready to undertake
further easing and should provide stronger guidance to markets through enhanced
communication. Absent deeper structural reforms, even with further easing, reaching twopercent inflation in a stable manner is likely to take longer than envisaged, suggesting that
the BoJ should put greater emphasis on achieving the inflation target in a stable manner
rather than within a specific time frame.
The financial sector should be a greater catalyst for growth, and guard against risks
from unconventional policies. The soundness of the financial system allows more risk
taking and consolidation, while remaining resilient to the likely higher volatility of asset
prices, exchange rates and interest rates, and lower liquidity in the JGB market as quantitative
easing proceeds.
While the 2014 external position was assessed to be broadly aligned with
fundamentals, subsequent developments and incomplete policies raise the risk of
negative spillovers. With the depreciation of the yen relative to its mid-2014 level, further
monetary easing without bolder structural reforms and a credible medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan could lead to sluggish domestic demand and overreliance on yen
depreciation to pursue domestic policy objectives.

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
1.
In late 2012, Japan launched “Abenomics,” an economic revival plan to exit from
decades-long deflation, low growth, and rising public debt. The three-pronged strategy of
aggressive monetary easing, flexible fiscal policy, and structural reforms promised to be a clear
break from previous incremental efforts. So far, the pace of real GDP growth has remained similar to
the post-bubble period at about 1 percent, and deflation risks remain. This is partly due to external
shocks, including slower global growth and the collapse in commodity prices. In addition, the
negative impact of the consumption tax rate hike in 2014 was bigger than expected as nominal
wage growth fell short of inflation despite very tight labor market conditions. However, structural
impediments have also played a role, including rigid wage dynamics due to labor market duality and
the deeply entrenched deflationary mindset, while the effects of the sharp yen depreciation on
exports and domestic investment have been weaker than expected due to a trend increase in
production offshoring and headwinds from population aging.
2.
Abenomics needs to be reloaded so that policy shortcomings do not become a drag on
growth and inflation. With the exception of corporate governance and some progress on female
labor force participation, structural reforms have not yet been in areas that could provide the
biggest bang for the buck (Annex I). While there are concerns that structural reforms may be
deflationary in the short term as they expand supply, a comprehensive package should bring
forward demand and contribute to wage and price pressures. Fiscal policy needs to provide clear
direction to reduce uncertainty for the private sector. And monetary policy should provide stronger
guidance to markets.

MODEST RECOVERY UNDERWAY
A. Recent Developments
3.
A modest recovery is underway as domestic demand has bottomed out (Figure 1). GDP
growth accelerated to 3.9 percent in 2015:Q1 (qoq, saar). The rebound in business investment is
especially encouraging, but consumption remains sluggish and more than half of the reported
quarterly growth stemmed from inventories. Leading indicators such as retail sales and industrial
production suggest a continued modest recovery of

4.
Inflation expectations are still below the
Bank of Japan’s (BoJ’s) inflation target and actual
inflation has been pushed down by commodity price
developments (Figure 2). After rising to 1.5 percent in
mid-2014, core inflation (excluding fresh food and the
effects of the consumption tax increase) declined
rapidly and has been close to zero since February 2015.
Initially, the decline reflected the waning effects of yen

depreciation in 2013 and weak domestic demand. More recently, falling energy prices have added to
disinflation. A CPI sub-index, with items less sensitive to the exchange rate, has been in deflationary
territory since last October. Market-based measures of inflation expectations have declined since
mid-2014 and recently stabilized at around 1 percent.

Loose monetary policy has improved financial conditions and fueled asset prices.

 Stock prices have more than doubled since the launch
of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE)
by the BoJ, mainly driven by actual and expected
earnings growth (Figure 4).1 Fundamental drivers
include increased profitability of large corporations on
the back of yen depreciation, lower corporate income
tax rates, recent corporate governance reforms, and
buybacks by companies. The portfolio allocation shift
by the Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF)
towards equities and other riskier assets and the BoJ’s
additional purchases of ETFs have also contributed to
this outcome.

increase and overseas lending has picked up. In contrast, lending to the manufacturing sector has
been broadly flat, owing to ample corporate cash balances, while household borrowing is continuing
at its historic rate.
7.
Financial system soundness has continued to improve. Banks are benefitting from the
recovery, loan growth and higher equity market valuations. With low credit costs and declining loan
loss provisioning, capital positions have strengthened and internationally-active banks remain on
track to meet Basel III capital requirements. Although major Japanese banks are more leveraged
compared to other G-SIFIs, credit risks are limited by large holdings of low-risk assets such as
government bonds. With interest rate margins squeezed by competition, most banks have
expanded non-interest income. Moreover, QQE has reduced interest rate risk primarily for major
banks, while regional banks have been slow to shed their JGB holdings given more limited lending
opportunities. Insurance companies have dealt with low interest rates by investing in instruments
with longer maturities and high-yield assets and expanding overseas investments while reducing
guaranteed rates on their savings-type products. They have maintained their solvency margin ratios
at levels well above 200 percent—the regulatory threshold to take corrective actions. The GPIF has
aligned its portfolio allocation targets to international practices.

year and carry over into 2016, with these “base effects” accounting for half of 2016 GDP growth.
Positive wealth effects from the stock price rally contribute in a limited way given the relatively
small share of equity holdings by households.
 Business investment is projected to grow modestly, supported by lower production costs from
declining oil prices, record-high corporate profits, ongoing corporate governance reforms, and
the availability of credit. Lending is projected to grow slightly faster than GDP, as there are no
lending constraints, but less than broad money, which is boosted by QQE (Table 2). The Tankan
survey shows that the manufacturing sector still has excess capacity, implying that it will take
time for investment to accelerate.
 Net exports are expected to continue to contribute moderately to growth in 2015–16. The pace
of export growth is set to rise gradually in line with the recovery of external demand, while
production offshoring remains a structural headwind (Box 1, Table 3). Import growth will
gradually rise in line with stronger domestic demand, but dampened by the weaker yen.
 Despite a substantial improvement in the headline structural primary balance, the drag on
growth from fiscal consolidation in 2015 and 2016 will be manageable at 0.2 and 0.7 percentage
points, respectively (Table 4). The modest growth impact in 2015 is due to the fact that half of
the fiscal improvement comes from last year’s consumption tax rate increase (including from
collection lags), whose adverse growth effects have already occurred. For 2016, the growth
impact will be larger as a bigger share of the adjustment comes from declining government
consumption and investment.
9.
Under current policies, potential growth will rise to 0.6 percent over the medium term
(Table 5). The rise in female labor force participation will partly offset the drag from population
aging, which will nonetheless continue to be a structural headwind to investment. The recently
implemented corporate governance reforms will help lift potential growth by reducing incentives for
accumulating large cash buffers and by supporting investment, dividend payouts, and M&A
activities over the medium term.
10.
Inflation is expected to increase gradually under current policies. Although QQE is
having positive effects, the effect on inflation has so far been limited as the expectations channel
seems to be weak (Box 2), leaving yen depreciation as the key transmission channel. Several factors
will put upward pressure on the price level in the near term, including the recovery of oil and
commodity prices from their lows, the lagged effect of the recent episode of yen weakening, and
the closing of the output gap. Continued tightening of the labor market could accelerate favorable
wage-price dynamics. As a result, under current policies, staff expects inflation to rise gradually to
1½ percent over the medium term.
11.

Risks to this growth and inflation outlook are tilted to the downside (Annex II).

 Near term. The economic recovery could stall on weakness in domestic demand. Wage growth
following the spring Shunto (annual synchronized wage bargaining) round and spending of the

JAPAN

oil windfall could disappoint. Smaller wage growth would imply larger multipliers from the fiscal
adjustment in the pipeline, resulting in more depressed demand. Declining JGB market liquidity
could spark volatility in government bond yields, possibly triggered by global developments,
and cause gyrations in the stock market and the exchange rate, undermining consumer and
business sentiment. Other external risks include lower-than-expected growth in China and the
U.S. and safe-haven appreciation.
 Medium term. Weak domestic demand and incomplete fiscal and structural reform policies,
could result in either stagnation or stagflation. Without swift progress in structural reforms,
headwinds from population aging and production offshoring could undermine domestic
demand. If, on the other hand, continued aggressive monetary easing and further yen
depreciation raise inflation, expectations of monetary policy normalization could arise at a time
when potential growth is low and fiscal deficits are large. In both cases, doubts about long-term
fiscal sustainability could lead to a jump in the sovereign risk premium, forcing abrupt further
fiscal adjustment with adverse feedback to the financial system and the real economy. This could
compound low profitability of the banking system and trigger excessive volatility in the JGB and
currency markets.

Authorities’ Views
12.
The authorities were confident that growth would accelerate. They expected the
recovery to continue on the basis of robust domestic demand in the near term. The increase in base
wages and total compensation following this year’s collective wage bargaining round is expected to
underpin private consumption, while easy financial conditions and high profits would support the
nascent recovery in corporate capital expenditure. In a “revitalization” scenario under which the
authorities were designing their medium-term fiscal consolidation plan, they expected real GDP
growth to rise to about 2 percent over the medium term through steady implementation of the
three arrows’ strategies for the revitalization of the Japanese economy.
13.
The BoJ was determined to achieve its 2 percent inflation target “around” the first half
of FY2016. The BoJ noted that inflation could become negative and remain subdued throughout
the summer of 2015, but would pick up strongly toward the end of this year with the dissipation of
the negative effects of falling oil prices, higher wage growth, a further rise in medium- to long-term
inflation expectations, and the positive output gap. While acknowledging that the evolution of
wage-price dynamics was uncertain in the context of an unprecedented effort to dislodge a deeply
entrenched deflationary mindset, the BoJ noted that the introduction of the price stability target and
QQE had shifted trend inflation away from zero percent after 15 years at that level.2

GROWTH REFORMS VITAL TO ABENOMICS’ SUCCESS
14.
Japan should be at the vanguard of structural reform. The economy faces the formidable
challenge of a rapidly shrinking labor force which needs to be countered by higher labor force
participation and faster productivity growth. Despite some progress in a number of areas, the
impact of reforms has yet to substantially materialize and potential growth remains far below what
is required to realize the “revitalization” scenario. While swift implementation of already announced
reforms is essential, it should be accompanied by further substantial reforms to boost confidence
and contribute to higher domestic demand.

Policy Issues and Staff’s Views
15.
Structural reforms are progressing in a number of areas. Female labor force
participation, which had been rising gradually since the mid-2000s on tightening labor market
conditions, got a further boost with Abenomics, possibly

and the launching of the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 comprising only profitable firms with good corporate
governance and disclosure. Deregulation in designated special economic zones (SEZs) is under
discussion at the local government level. Even so, these measures may not suffice to counter the
headwinds on labor supply from adverse demographics.
Further high-impact reforms are urgently needed.

take place under contracts that balance job security and flexibility to reduce labor market duality
and raise horizontal mobility, contributing to higher productivity and wage growth. The
authorities should move quickly to clarify the legal and regulatory environment surrounding
these “intermediate” contracts. At the minimum, these reforms should counter the declining
labor force, but in the medium-term they need to boost potential growth above current levels.
 Corporate governance reform: Governance reforms should be strengthened to unlock renewed
dynamism in product markets. Next steps should include more ambitious requirements for
independent directors, greater transparency of beneficial ownership, as well as other measures
to reduce incentives to hoard cash such as introducing regulatory limits to discourage excessive
cross-shareholdings, removing bottlenecks which prevent takeovers, and introducing prepackaged reorganization plans for bankruptcy procedures.
 Deregulation: The conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement could
provide a boost to activity, but only if it leads to deregulation of agriculture and domestic
services sectors and elimination of most tariffs and non-tariff and investment barriers in Japan.
Deregulation in SEZs should be expedited with a view to rolling out these reforms nation-wide
as soon as possible as it would raise productivity and provide investment opportunities,
including inward foreign direct investment.
17.
The financial sector should help drive more efficient resource allocation. It should take
advantage of the recent corporate governance reforms to unwind cross-shareholdings, foster
consolidation in the enterprise sector, and promote exit of unviable enterprises. The authorities
should phase out financial sector support schemes for SMEs that do not invest or hire workers and
promote the expansion of securitization and the provision of risk capital. The supervisory agency’s
guidance to move from collateral to risk-based lending and its efforts to promote better risk
management should help. Private-sector led consolidation in the financial system, in particular
among regional banks, would also be beneficial. Given the substantial changes to the portfolio
allocation of the GPIF, it will be important to strengthen its governance structure. To further
promote portfolio rebalancing of households to riskier investment through tax-exempt individual
savings accounts, consideration should be given to extending the 5-year term limit and gradually
raising the maximum contribution limit.
18.
As part of the tripartite dialogue, the authorities are rightly calling for higher wage
increases. The labor market is very tight with the unemployment rate at historic lows and
participation rising. With booming profits, corporations have the opportunity to establish favorable
wage-price dynamics. Ongoing wage increases are a good start, and their momentum should be
further strengthened by raising all administratively controlled wages and prices, calling for a
supplementary wage round, the conversion of some of the seemingly permanent bonuses into base
wages, and a stronger-than-usual winter bonus round. Higher-than-usual minimum wage increases
and strengthening tax incentives for firms that raise wages should be considered.

Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities emphasized significant progress with ongoing reforms, such as
corporate governance. They noted that enhancement of corporate governance was leading to a
historic shift in Japan’s corporate culture, which should result in a much more dynamic corporate
sector. The authorities felt that their “comply or explain” approach would be effective in a Japanese
context. The “Seiroshi” tripartite dialogue among the government, corporate sector, and labor, in
which PM Abe actively participates, led to large wage hikes for two consecutive years by
encouraging large companies enjoying record high profitability to grant generous wage increases
and higher contract prices to their suppliers. In addition, the authorities emphasized progress on
other structural reforms such as labor market reforms and deregulation: 25 related bills have been
submitted to the Diet, with the final stage reforms in the energy sector being approved on June 17,
2015, adding to the 44 bills which have already been passed (Annex I).
20.
The authorities highlighted that the FY2015 tax reform aimed to support growth. The
statutory corporate tax rate was cut by 2.5 and 0.8 percentage points in FY2015 and FY2016,
respectively, reducing it by a cumulative 3.3 percentage points by FY2016. To finance the CIT-rate
reduction, encourage companies to make more active efforts to improve their profitability and
develop new technologies, and induce companies to record corporate income, the deduction
limitation for loss carried forward was modified. It is being lowered from 80 to 65 percent in FY2015
and to 50 percent in FY2017. The pro-forma standard taxation (based on value added and capital
base of corporations) will be expanded from ¼ to ½ of local enterprise tax revenue between
FY2014–16. These changes should reduce the tax burden on companies with “profit-earning power”
and allow a broader sharing of the tax burden. The authorities eased requirements to qualify for tax
incentives for wage hikes.

BALANCED FISCAL ADJUSTMENT
21.
The authorities recently announced a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan. Following
the halving of the primary deficit of the national and local governments between FY2010 and
FY2015, they intend to achieve a primary surplus by FY2020 under the “revitalization” scenario. The
consumption tax rate increase to 10 percent in April 2017, is a key measure, together with a further
1½ percent of structural adjustment over 2018–20 to be identified at a later stage.

Policy Issues and Staff’s Views
22.
Sound principles need to underpin the fiscal consolidation plan to secure its
credibility. Low and stable JGB yields should not be taken for granted as shifts in investor sentiment
could happen abruptly. A concrete and credible medium-term plan based on the following
principles would remove uncertainties about fiscal intentions, which could be hampering domestic
demand, and create space to respond to downside risks:
 Use of prudent and realistic economic assumptions;

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

JAPAN

 Adoption of a long-term goal of putting debt on a downward path;
 Specification of adjustment in terms of structural fiscal balance; and
 Upfront identification of specific structural revenue and expenditure measures.
23.
Stronger fiscal institutions will be necessary to impart credibility to such a plan.
Continuous large deficits, the record high level of public debt, the use of optimistic growth
assumptions, and the uncertainty introduced by recurrent recourse to supplementary budgets
suggest large benefits from anchoring fiscal discipline in a more credible medium-term budget
framework. As the fiscal adjustment will span at least a decade, such a framework should include
rules to curb expenditures, limits on the use of supplementary budgets, and publication of
independent assessments of the outlook and budget projections by the Fiscal System Council. This
would prevent procyclical policies, remove a source of volatility, and establish clear visibility about
the direction of policies.
24.
The announced medium-term plan provides a useful anchor to guide fiscal policy.
Planned adjustment in 2015 and 2016—mainly withdrawal of past stimuli and waning reconstruction
spending—is appropriate in striking a balance between Japan: Gross Public Debt1/ and Fiscal Balance

Further balanced consolidation will be necessary to place the public debt-to-GDP ratio
on a downward trajectory (Annex III). The recent decline in the fiscal deficit through containment
of spending and higher consumption tax revenue (Figure 5) and the similar measures planned
for 2016–20 will temporarily stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio at about 250 percent before it
accelerates again under current policies To put debt on a downward path in the long run, staff sees
the need for a further adjustment in the structural primary balance by 4½ percent of GDP. This
adjustment scenario should be balanced in two ways: to maintain growth momentum its pace
should be measured, at about ¾ percent of GDP per year; and, it should comprise both expenditure
and revenue measures, including further increase, in the consumption tax rate beyond 10 percent.

Authorities’ Views
27.
The authorities emphasized that they aim to achieve both economic revitalization and
fiscal consolidation and firmly maintain the target to achieve a primary surplus of the central
and local governments by FY2020. The authorities noted that they are likely to achieve the interim
target of halving their primary deficit of the central and local governments to GDP ratio by FY2015
from the ratio in FY2010, which demonstrates their capability to deliver on their commitments. In
order to achieve FY2020 target, they will proceed with the following three measures: (i) overcoming
deflation and revitalizing economy through steady implementation of three arrows of strategies,
(ii) reforming expenditures, and (iii) revenue measures. They underscored the importance of firmly
maintaining a visible anchor (FY2020 target) to guide fiscal policy while acknowledging that more
efforts will be needed after achieving a primary surplus to put debt firmly on a downward trajectory.
28.
With regard to the expenditure reform, the authorities emphasized that concrete and
credible measures would be essential. They were considering constraining the increase of
expenditure as done under the current Abe administration. Social security and local government
finance are the key policy areas of the reform, with a need for emphasis on effective and concrete
measures for social security reform. They noted that the expenditure reform would not jeopardize
the economy because its essence was to constrain expenditure growth rather than implement
across-the-board cuts. In addition, they noted that further progress in structural reform would be
essential to accelerating the closure of the output gap and emphasized the role of structural
reforms, e.g., deregulation, to promote private investment. Meanwhile, public investment is being
implemented in a focused and efficient manner taking into account depopulation trends. Transfers
should be carefully examined and well-targeted in order to maintain cost effectiveness. The

authorities agreed that the next consumption tax rate increase would be an important contribution
to restoring fiscal sustainability.

CONTINUING SUPPORTIVE MONETARY POLICY
29.
In response to falling inflation and inflation expectations, monetary policy was eased
further in October 2014. In a bold step, surprising markets, the BoJ expanded its QQE framework
by increasing net purchases of JGBs to 80 trillion yen annually, extending the average maturity of
JGBs purchases to about 7–10 years, and tripling its purchases of private assets (ETFs and J-REITs).5
Mainly because of the sharp fall in oil prices, in April 2015, the BoJ delayed the timing for achieving
the 2 percent inflation target to around the first half of FY2016 while continuing to emphasize that it
will continue QQE until the 2 percent inflation target is achieved in a stable manner.

Policy Issues and Staff’s Views
30.
Despite some progress, lifting inflation is taking longer than expected. Policy actions
thus far have raised underlying inflation and eased financial conditions through reduced real interest
rates, a depreciated yen, and a booming equity market. Credit has started to pick up and land and
real estate price growth has turned positive, underpinning a nascent revival of construction activity.
The output gap is closing and wage pressures are gradually rising. However, the transmission to
inflation is taking longer than expected, in part because of the effect of lower energy prices, the
deep entrenchment of the deflationary mindset, and structural impediments to stronger wage-price
dynamics.
31.
Weak monetary policy transmission creates a policy conundrum. As intended, the BoJ’s
balance sheet has more than doubled since the beginning of QQE. However, given weak credit
growth there has been a large build-up of excess reserves.

In January 2015, the BoJ extended the Loan Support Program by one year to the end of March 2016 and raised the
ceiling of the Growth Support Funding Facility by 1 trillion yen to 2 trillion yen per financial institution and from 7 to
10 trillion yen overall while opening both facilities to non-BoJ deposit account holders.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAPAN

32.
The BoJ needs to stand ready to ease further, provide stronger guidance to markets
through enhanced communication, and put greater emphasis on achieving the 2 percent
inflation target in a stable manner.
 Additional easing: Reflecting the weak and delayed transmission, further easing should take the
form of increased asset purchases and lengthening their duration. This would further lower the
long end of the yield curve and strengthen the commitment to low interest rates “for as long as
it takes,” while accelerating portfolio rebalancing by institutional investors. At the same time,
further fiscal and structural reforms remain imperative to unburden monetary policy and,
together with macroprudential policies, mitigate financial stability risks.
 Enhancing communication to guide markets: The BoJ should communicate more clearly the
drivers that underpin its forecasts, including the output gap and wage-price dynamics and the
factors that are believed to raise inflation expectations. In addition, the BoJ could clarify the
indicators used to assess whether inflation is on track and spell out the criteria for judging
whether its target has been sustainably achieved. Similarly, clarifying the conditions that would
trigger additional actions would be helpful as this would help guide expectations when there is a
need to adjust the asset-purchase program and facilitate preparations for an eventual exit. In
this context, the publication of the oil price assumption underlying its forecast and studies of the
effectiveness of its QQE and progress of the regime shift it is trying to engineer is highly
welcome.
 Reaffirming the BoJ’s commitment to achieve the 2 percent inflation target in a stable manner: To
strengthen this commitment, the BoJ should reiterate that it remains open to all further avenues
of easing when and if appropriate by: raising the amount of purchases of assets, lengthening
their duration, broadening their range, and lowering the deposit rate on excess reserves and the
policy rate.

Authorities’ Views
33.
The BoJ stressed that its monetary framework is clear and working well. It emphasized
that reaching 2 percent inflation in a stable manner is the primary objective and that use of a
timeframe of achieving the price stability target at the earliest possible time with a time horizon of
about two years emphasized their commitment and contributed to engineering a regime shift. BoJ
officials assessed that underlying inflation has been improving significantly, although the firmness is
currently masked by the temporary negative impact of the sharp decline in oil prices. Hence they
saw no need for further easing at this point, but they repeated that the BoJ stands ready to ease
further, with all options on the table, if underlying inflation momentum falters.

35.
As QQE is maintained, liquidity in the JGB market may diminish, raising risks of
volatility. Given the importance of the JGB market, spillovers to other financial market segments are
likely. So far, traditional liquidity indicators of the JGB futures market such as the bid-ask spread and
the daily price range to transaction volume ratio show that the JGB market has been functioning
normally, though other indicators show some decline in liquidity (Box 3, Figure 6).7 Liquidity of the
JGB market could suffer more as the BoJ’s share of JGBs increases further, especially in specific
maturity segments. In this context, the doubling of the BoJ’s securities lending facility is a welcome
backstop to JGB market liquidity, while its cost and access criteria should remain under review to
ensure its effective use. Continuing consultations with market participants and close monitoring of
liquidity will be essential.
36.
Financial sector policies should guard against risks from unconventional policies.
Financial institutions need to continue to be tested for
their resilience to higher volatility of asset prices,
exchange rates and interest rates, and lower liquidity in
markets. Banks look well capitalized, but their risk
management needs to be further strengthened and
business models adapted to raise profitability in the
medium term (Figure 7, Table 6). Banks lending in foreign
currency should secure robust funding sources to
manage their gaps between illiquid loans and stable
funding, which have recently stabilized. Regional banks,

treatment of unrealized losses in capital. Insurance companies need to enhance profitability to work
through the legacy of guaranteed return products. While there are no immediate concerns,
macroprudential policies should be readied in case exuberant equity market developments and
riskier lending (including abroad) threaten financial stability.

Authorities’ Views
37.
The FSA noted that financial sector health has further improved. Internationally-active
banks have ample capital and liquidity to meet Basel III capital requirements as well as the liquidity
coverage ratio (LCR). Various risks such as foreign funding risk and interest rate risk are being closely
watched in light of banks’ business and market developments. The FSA did not see any immediate
risks from booming asset markets and is focusing supervisory efforts on improving risk
management. As for the Japan Post Bank (JPB), the application for new lending businesses is being
examined to ensure that these new services will be provided in a sound and efficient manner, in
accordance with the Banking Act. Similarly, it is being verified whether the implementation of new
services would impede competition between JPB and other financial institutions, and the
appropriate provision of the services, in accordance with the Postal Services Privatization Act.

POLICIES UNDER DOWNSIDE SCENARIOS
38.
Accelerating structural reforms is the only effective policy lever to address downside
risks and maintain confidence in Abenomics. Demand-side policies in response to downside risks
will depend on the nature of the risks. Specifically, the fiscal policy response would need to be
contingent on the behavior of the sovereign risk premium and monetary policy on inflation
developments and the stability of financial markets, with macroprudential policies stepping in as
needed. Should Abenomics fail to reinvigorate domestic demand or adverse external shocks occur,
the resulting weaker outlook could sap investment and confidence and abort the nascent favorable
wage-price dynamics.
 The resulting stagnation scenario would cast doubt
on fiscal sustainability, leading to higher sovereign
and corporate risk premiums, though only when the
BoJ reaches the limits of its QQE program.8 Fiscal
policy could attempt to revive demand but the
stimulus would need to be very large to push
growth back to the baseline. Further concomitant
easing by the BoJ could at least delay the rise in risk
premia, but in the end an adverse feedback loop

including the financial system would likely take hold.
In contrast, accelerating structural reforms would be
the only effective and sustainable policy lever, with
higher productivity growth and labor and product

preventing the rise in risk premia, allowing growth

1/ Only credit risks and interest rate risks were estimated using unconsolidated
balance sheets, the former by using the relationships between non-performing assets
and GDP growth and interest rates; the latter by applying the duration analysis to all
bond holdings for all banks.
2/ Macroeconomic assumption were taken from the GIMF simulation.

 Stagnation with rising risk premia would induce
immediate mark-to-market losses on banks from
their significant government bond holdings. Retail and wholesale funding costs would rise,
compounding losses from equity holdings. Using the input from the GIMF scenarios, stress tests
suggest a significant adverse impact on capital adequacy. Moreover, weaker activity and tighter
financing conditions are likely to boost non-performing loans. Conversely, the structural reform
scenario would have a positive effect on capital levels over the medium term from better
earnings and lower credit risk.

oil and commodity prices, the goods trade balance
turned to surplus in 2015:Q1 for the first time since 2011:Q1 before the Great East Japan Earthquake.

A. External Sector Assessment
40.
Taking last year’s trade developments into account, Japan’s external position and its
real effective exchange rate in 2014 were assessed to be broadly consistent with
fundamentals and desirable policies (Annex IV). The assessment takes into account structural
shifts (e.g., production offshoring) as well as temporary factors (e.g., impact of nuclear power
shutdowns) affecting the trade balance.
Subsequently, terms of trade effects and the REER depreciation suggest a strengthening of the
external position under current policies. The reduction in the oil import bill has improved the trade
balance and the REER depreciated by 7 percent through May 2015 relative to its 2014 average. This
has moved the REER toward a moderately weaker level than would be consistent with its

18

JAPAN

fundamentals suggested in the 2014 assessments. The weakening of the yen has been beneficial,
given the current stage of the economic cycle and the need to address low inflation and reduce
deflation risks. However, sustained easing by the BoJ while others tighten, combined with the lack of
bolder structural reforms and the absence of a credible and specific medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan could strengthen the external position.

B. Spillovers
41.
Continued portfolio rebalancing may induce sizable capital outflows. Japanese banks’
claims over other countries show strong connection to

suggests that Japanese financial institutions could shed
165 trillion yen of JGBs by end-2017 (110 trillion yen by banks and 55 trillion yen by nonbanks),
which could result in significant portfolio outflows amounting to 42 trillion yen ($350 billion).9 Under
the current allocation ratios, 80 percent of these flows would go towards advanced economy bonds,
14 percent into emerging market bonds, and 6 percent into global equities.
42.
Without further strengthening of fiscal and structural policies, the balance of
spillovers may turn negative. The BoJ’s QE announcements have contributed to favorable financial
conditions in EM Asia through lowering government borrowing costs, boosting equity prices, and
loosening credit conditions with a decline in corporate bond spreads.10 In addition, increased
portfolio outflows and continued expansion of overseas’ bank lending and foreign direct investment
are positive spillovers from Japan, though they may add to vulnerabilities in some neighboring
countries. However, further weakening of the exchange rate has dampened imports while raising
Japan’s corporate competitiveness in global goods markets. Without bolder structural reforms and
credible fiscal consolidation, domestic demand could remain sluggish, and any further monetary
easing could lead to overreliance on yen depreciation in the pursuit of domestic policy objectives,
with adverse effects on direct competitors.

Authorities’ Views
43.
The authorities expressed understanding of the 2014 external assessment but saw any
assessment for 2015 as premature. Although acknowledging the need to better understand the
implications of recent large movements in the major currencies, they argued that it is not possible to

JAPAN

make an assessment of the external position for 2015 based on REER developments to date or on
the 2015 current account forecast given large uncertainty about developments over the remainder
of the year.
44.
The authorities reiterated that successful launching of all three arrows of Abenomics
will have positive spillovers to global economy. They noted that spillovers had been benign so
far and that potential capital outflows could help ease financing conditions of EMs in the region.
They also added that spillovers through the trade channel would be more limited than in past
episodes of large depreciations due to structural factors, including from the offshoring of
production. They also agreed that completing all three arrows is important to avoid overburdening
of monetary policy.

STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
A modest recovery is underway and inflation is expected to rise gradually over the
medium term. Rising real income due to wage growth and favorable terms of trade effects should
support private consumption while external demand and yen depreciation will underpin exports.
Investment is likely to respond with a lag, helped by the availability of credit and a sound financial
system. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, stemming from weaker-than-expected
domestic demand, incomplete policies, possible shocks to the sovereign risk premium, low mediumterm profitability of the financial system, and slower-than-expected growth abroad.
46.
All arrows of Abenomics need to be strengthened to lift Japan out of its entrenched
deflationary mindset. Building on initial positive results, policies now need to embark on a
sustained effort to meet the unprecedented challenges Japan is facing, by lifting growth and
restoring fiscal sustainability against adverse demographics, while maintaining financial stability.
47.
Japan should be at the vanguard of structural reform. While swift implementation of
already announced reforms is essential, it should be accompanied by further high-impact reforms to
provide a robust long-term outlook and underpin near-term demand. The next round of structural
reforms should lift labor supply, reduce labor market duality, continue with agricultural and services
sector deregulation and turn the financial sector into a driver of reforms.
48.
Credible and balanced fiscal consolidation, to avoid jeopardizing growth and inflation
momentum, will support confidence and private consumption. The medium-term fiscal reform
plan should aim to put debt on a downward path, based on realistic economic assumptions, and
specific structural revenue and expenditure measures should be identified upfront. It should be
bolstered by stronger fiscal institutions and aim for a pace of adjustment that strikes the right
balance between reversing the debt dynamics and safeguarding growth momentum.
49.
More explicit monetary guidance would enhance inflation dynamics. With a persistent
difference between market expectations and the BoJ’s inflation target and timeframe as well as still
low inflation, the BoJ needs to stand ready for further easing, provide stronger guidance to markets

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAPAN

through enhanced communication, and put greater emphasis on achieving the 2 percent inflation
target in a stable manner. In their role as partner in tripartite discussions and in light of
unprecedented corporate profits, the authorities should continue to emphasize the need for
adequate wage growth.
50.
Ensuring that the financial sector remains resilient to economic and policy risks will be
essential. Internationally-active banks have ample capital and liquidity to meet current and
prospective regulatory requirements while supporting more risk taking, while other banks are
sufficiently capitalized. Exposure to domestic and foreign interest rate risk and funding risk of
overseas operations are the main concerns.
51.
While the 2014 external position was assessed to be broadly consistent with
fundamentals, subsequent developments and incomplete policies raise the risk of negative
spillovers. With further the depreciation of the yen relative to the mid-2014 level, further monetary
easing without bolder structural reforms and credible fiscal consolidation could lead to sluggish
domestic demand and overreliance on depreciation of the yen in the pursuit of domestic policy
objectives.
52.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

Box 1. What Explains Japan’s Export Sluggishness?1
Solid external demand growth and the large yen
depreciation since late 2012 have failed to trigger a firm
export recovery. Offshoring, a substitution of production at the
source of overseas demand for exports, seems to be the main
culprit. A compositional shift in foreign demand towards less
import-sensitive items and a leveling-off of trade growth due to
the maturing of Asia’s supply chain also contributed. Since these
factors constitute structural headwinds to exports, they are likely
to be only partially compensated by a weaker yen. Successful
implementation of structural reforms in Japan could rekindle a
virtuous cycle of private investment and more dynamic exports.
Japanese firms’ offshoring seems to be the main driver
behind the sluggish recovery of exports.
Over the last two decades, Japanese firms have expanded
abroad to exploit labor cost differentials and rising demand
in host countries. The pace of offshoring accelerated since
the global financial crisis, partly due to large yen
appreciation and uncertainty about energy supply after
the 2011 earthquake. As a result, overseas investment now
accounts for about 25 percent of total manufacturing
investment, while domestic production capacity declined by
about 4 percent since 2011. In 2014, exports by Japanese
overseas subsidiaries (to countries excluding Japan)
exceeded exports from Japan by more than 40 percent.



A standard Armington export model augmented with the
ratio of overseas to total investment captures the largely flat
export performance of Japan after the global financial crisis
(in both additive and multiplicative specifications, with
partner country growth and the real effective exchange rate).



Other factors have also contributed to slowing export
growth in recent years. Import intensity-adjusted demand,
which takes into account the fact that different component of
expenditure have different import contents, exhibited a slower
recovery during and after the crisis compared to a conventional
measure of aggregate demand. In addition, with deepening of
global supply chains, more Japanese firms that used to export
intermediate goods have expanded abroad and some
intermediate good supplies are now sourced from local suppliers
in host countries. This explains the broad decline in Japanese
value-added embedded in other countries’ gross exports since
mid-2000s.

Box 2. Drivers of Inflation in Japan1
Inflation forecasts for Japan are highly uncertain. Inflation developments will depend critically on whether the
Philips curve will become steeper and shift upward, which in turn depends on the credibility of the Bank of Japan
and the extent to which higher actual or expected inflation feeds into nominal wages and other price-setting
behavior. Furthermore, estimates of inflation expectations are hampered by a consistent upward bias for surveybased measures and limited liquidity for market-based indicators.
An expectations-augmented Philips curve confirms that the Philips curve is relatively flat in Japan and
that nominal earnings growth is an important determinant of actual inflation. The estimation assumes that
inflation expectations would gradually become less adaptive and more forward-looking and therefore
increasingly drive actual inflation.2 However, despite rising inflation expectations in 2014, neither wage growth
nor portfolio rebalancing accelerated substantially. Furthermore, as actual inflation declined in the wake of
faltering aggregate demand after the consumption-tax hike and waning exchange rate effects, inflation
expectations reversed. This suggests that inflation expectations may not be an important driver of actual inflation,
at least not until actual and expected inflation are nearer to the BoJ’s target level.
An alternative model—separating adaptive and forward-looking inflation expectations—suggests

the wrong sign, with inflation dynamics characterized by substantial persistence. These results support the view
that inflation expectations are lagging rather than leading actual inflation and that the transition to more
forward-looking inflation formation has not yet occurred. Instead, the increase in inflation during the past two
years largely reflects the weakening yen and higher total earnings growth, which, given the dynamics in the
inflation process, has had a persistent impact, but should not be interpreted as a permanent upward shift in trend
inflation.

Box 3. Volatility in the JGB Market1
Following the BOJ’s QQE, the volatility of the JGB market has increased. Cross-country comparisons
suggest that both common and country-specific factors have contributed to the increased volatility in
government bond yields in Japan.
JGB yields correlate well with the yields of the government bonds of the US and other advanced
economies. In particular, the volatility in the Swiss government market in January-February and the
German bund market in April affected the volatility of the

interest rates. Similar, but less pronounced than other QE
sovereigns, the JGB market went through a significant gyration ( mini-“tantrum”) in early 2015 with the
10-year JGB yield sharply falling and then doubling within less than a month.



There are indications that liquidity in the JGB market has been declining. Although traditional
indicators suggest that the JGB market continues to function normally, the volume of limit orders at the
best-ask price, the impact of a unit volume of transactions on the market price in the JGB futures market,
the divergence in quotes offered by dealers in the JGB cash market, and the lending fee of JGBs in the SC
repo market—all suggest that liquidity in the JGB market has been declining (Figure 7). A BOJ survey
revealed that 75 percent of Japanese bond dealers included said bond market functioning had worsened,
but more than 60 percent said they were not experiencing “a lot of trouble” in fulfilling orders.
Some structural factors may have contributed to the reduced liquidity in the market. Recent and
envisaged regulatory reforms affecting the size of the balance sheet and risk management practices may
have reduced the capacity of market makers to conduct operations with JGBs. The share of more volatile
overseas investors in the total stock of tradable JGBs has increased. This would suggest that the volatility of
the JGB market in the future will remain above historical levels.
The authorities are prepared to mitigate shocks and financial stability risks emanating from the JGB
market. The repo, money and derivatives markets, as well as well as structured finance rely heavily on a
well-functioning JGB market, given that the corporate bond market is small and less liquid. JGB yields are
widely used as benchmarks. To guard against risks, the BoJ and MoF have stepped up their regular
consultations with market participants, the MoF is conducting liquidity enhancing auctions, and the BoJ has
doubled the size of its securities lending facility.

IMF assessment and advice

Increase childcare facilities capacity by 200 thousand by FY2017
(implementation ongoing; 43 thousand children were on the nurseries'
waiting list as of Oct 2014). Raise childcare leave benefits (implemented in
FY2014). Removal of tax and social security disincentives for working
spouses (under discussion but no progress observed yet). A bill requiring
large companies to prepare plans to promote women will be re-submitted
to the Diet, after not passing last year.

FLP has risen substantially during the past two
years, in part due to "Womenomics". However, more
needs to be done to increase the availability of child
care. Specifically, regulatory impediments for
privately provided childcare facilities and for
caregivers should be relaxed and tax and social
security distortions to FLP should be eliminated.

Relaxation of the current points-based preferential immigration system of
highly-skilled professionals (implemented as of Dec 2013). Extending
trainee program period from 3 to 5 years for foreign workers (decided).
Use SEZs to encourage use of foreign human resources (decided).

Pending bills and decisions will not materially raise Immigration equivalent to a rise of Japan's labor

sectors with labor shortages using a sector- and skillbased approach. Allow certain industries to enter in
direct agreements with the government to fill labor
shortages. Establish a qualification framework for
recognition of skills. See Ganelli and Miake
(Forthcoming, IMF WP) for more details.

Expand subsidies for job mobility (decided from FY2015 budget).
Discussion underway to ease non-regular work rules (Bills related to
dispatched workers and fixed-term workers submitted to the current Diet).
Relax the conditionality for dismissal in SEZs (decided).

Reforms introduced so far are bypassing contract
reform that would significantly reduce duality and
raise productivity by clarifying the legal framework
for limited regular contracts. Contract reform should
also encourage greater horizontal labor mobility.

A substantial reduction in labor market duality would
increase productivity, potential growth and wages,
although the precise magnitude is difficult to quantify
(Aoyagi and Ganelli IMF WP 13/202).

Six areas were designated on March 28, 2014--including Tokyo and
Osaka--accounting for about 40 percent of GDP. Expected deregulation
includes easing restrictions on land use and medical practices, agriculture
reform, labor reform and creation of new businesses. SEZs are expected
to propose specific measures--to be vetted by a national committee--in the
near future.
Land banks to increase farm size established. Private companies are
allowed to join agricultural enterprises, but the shareholding is limited to
25% (private companies requested for relaxing the regulation to allow a
majority holding, but the discussion will restart after 2019). Review of rice
production adjustments ongoing (gentan system to end by FY2018).
Farmers' income subsidies are not abolished although they have shrunk.
Japan Agriculture group approved a plan to abolish the Central union of
Agricultural Cooperatives. Discussions are ongoing on reforming the public
rice price setting system (gaisankin).

Initial plans surprised on the upside in terms of the
scale of designated areas. SEZs could become a
laboratory for reforms to be implemented at the
national level, but detailed measures under
discussion at the local government level have been
slow to progress.
Measures taken so far have been steps in the right
direction, but fall short of fully deregulating
agriculture, including the elimination of subsidy
support and allowing majority holdings of private
companies in agricultural enterprises, which would
raise productivity and competition.

Unlikely to have a significant growth effect in the
short term, but could be more substantial once rolled
out at the national level.

Electricity reform

First fundamental reform in 60 years to be completed by 2020, including (i)
a gradual opening of grid; (ii) liberalization of the retail electricity sector;
and (iii) legal separation between electricity generators and distributors
and abolish retail price regulation. Legislation passed.

Full deregulation in agriculture could boost
productivity by up to 30 percent although the sector
is small in percent of GDP (IMF estimates).

Likely to have a modest impact on potential growth
by reducing production costs.

Business sector

Corporate governance

Japan’s Stewardship code for institutional investors introduced in February
2014. Companies Act amended in June 2014 to encourage appointment of
outside directors. Corporate governance code (requiring at least two
outside directors on "comply or explain" basis) became effective in June
2015.

Significant progress has been made, but more
should still be done to materially affect corporate
behavior. The corporate governance code could be
more ambitious in its requirements for outside
directors and other measures aimed at reducing
incentives to hold cash (e.g. regulatory limits on
cross shareholdings; removing bottlenecks which
prevent takeovers; and introducing pre-packaged
reorganization plans for bankruptcy procedures).

Raising shareholders' rights could result in unlocking
excessive corporate savings. The economic impact
is difficult to quantify but likely to be substantial (see
Aoyagi and Ganelli, WP 2014) especially in
combination with other reforms that reduce
incentives for large cash balances stemming from
precautionary demand, transactions costs, and
taxation (see Sher, WP 2014).

Corporate income tax reform

Reduction of corporate tax rate (from 34.62 to 32.11 percent).
Government internal discussions ongoing about elimination/reduction of
existing tax incentives.

CIT reform is desirable as part of a comprehensive
medium-term fiscal consolidation package.

CIT rate cut is likely to be good for investment and
growth, but not self-financing, so compensatory
measures will need to be identified (see de Mooij
and Saito, WP 2014).

Started participating in negotiations of the ambitious 12-nation free trade
plan in July 2013. More negotiating to do after multi-lateral talks failed in
Singapore in February 2014. Japan-US remain apart on the issue of tariff
reduction/elimination of Japan’s “sacred” agricultural products. Final
decision is expected to be made by July 2015.

The decision to join the TPP negotiations was
welcome and should be used as an opportunity to
deregulate protected sectors.

Japan would stand to gain considerably from an
agreement, provided it is a comprehensive deal that
leads to widespread tariff reductions and
deregulation (about 0.1-0.2 higher growth p.a., see
Peterson Institute)

GPIF to shift away from JGBs towards riskier assets (decided in June
2013). GPIF governance reform was proposed but to a more limited extent

New stock market index including only profitable companies (launched in
January 2014). Tax-free investment accounts (NISA) to encourage shifting
household savings away from cash (launched in January 2014).

Substantial progress has been made to facilitate
portfolio rebalancing, but GPIF governance needs to
be strengthened. Reforms should now focus on
stimulating the provision of risk capital and phasing
out the full credit guarantees to SMEs, which should
stimulate firm entry and exit.

Financial sector reforms that raise risk capital and
induce a restructuring of the SME sector could lift
potential growth by about 0.2 percentage points
(Source: 2013-14 Art. IV Reports).

and leading to bond market

the BoJ succeeds with raising
inflation, but growth would
remain sluggish leading to a
higher sovereign risk premium
(stagflation).

The DSA and risk scenarios presented in Box 5 show that in both
cases, the sovereign risk premium would rise, worsening public debt
dynamics substantially, albeit gradually as the average maturity is
about 6.5 years. In addition, such a shock could have a material effect
on the financial sector.

results in a significant slowdown

The recovery of exports would stall not only due to close trade links
but also due to potential yen appreciation on safe-haven effects.

Increased inflation expectations would help lowering expected real
rates and thereby stimulate activity as well as leading to sustained 2percent inflation. It would improve debt dynamics, minimizing the
negative effect of consolidation on growth.
Policy response: The BoJ should prepare a credible exit strategy and
the government should save any fiscal over-performance.

Policy response: The BoJ should strengthen communication by
clarifying the indicators used to assess whether inflation is on track
and spell out the criteria for judging whether the BoJ’s target has
been sustainably achieved.

Policy response: Despite limited policy space, the government should
deploy additional measures on all policy fronts in order to restore
growth and inflation momentum and maintain confidence in
Abenomics.

Policy response: The authorities should prepare a credible and
concrete fiscal adjustment plan to restore credibility while
implementing ambitious structural reform to raise growth potential.
The BoJ should calibrate QQE depending on market developments.

Policy response: If the authorities commit to a credible fiscal
consolidation plan by passing concrete measures, the near-term
fiscal withdrawal could be made more gradual. Ambitious structural
reforms are important to boost domestic demand and the pace of
BoJ asset purchases could be accelerated.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the
view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is
meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent
or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.
Non mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Japan’s public debt is unsustainable under current policies. Although the gross debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to rise only marginally during the WEO projection period due to an improving primary
balance and a favorable differential between interest and growth rates compared to past values,
complementary analysis up to 2030 (paragraph 24) shows that the rise in the debt ratio will
accelerate after 2020, reaching around 290 percent of GDP in 2030. The debt outlook is vulnerable
to various shocks especially when financial sector shocks cause spillovers to growth, the deficit, and
the interest rate. Persistent shocks to growth and inflation could also have a significant impact in the
long run. Moreover, larger public health spending is an important downside risk. While all the debt
profile indicators are below early warning benchmarks, Japan’s extremely high financing needs point
to vulnerabilities to changes in market perceptions.
Baseline and Realism of Projections


Assumptions. The analysis is based on the following key macroeconomic projections and policy
assumptions (Table 5): potential growth will rise from the current 0.4 percent to 0.6 percent
by 2020 assuming moderate gains from currently approved structural policies, with actual
growth being somewhat volatile in part due to fiscal policy. The output gap closes by end 2016
and growth will remain at potential beyond 2020. Monetary policy is assumed to remain
accommodative during the entire projection period, with CPI inflation converging to around
1.5 percent over the medium term. Fiscal policy assumes the rise in the consumption tax rate
from 8 to 10 percent in April 2017, without offsetting measures, such as additional stimulus or
multiple rates. It also assumes the gradual waning of past stimulus and reconstruction spending,
with no further adjustment in the baseline after 2018. As no hikes in risk premia are assumed in
the baseline, long-term interest rates are projected to only gradually pick up, in tandem with
rising inflation, to around 3 percent on new long-term bond issuances, but because of the
average maturity of government bonds of around 6.5 years (including financing bills), the
nominal effective interest rate on public debt is lower and rises gradually to 1.0 percent in 2020,
implying a favorable interest-growth differential of -0.5 with a nominal GDP growth rate of
1.5 percent. As a result, after the second stage of the consumption tax hike, although the
primary deficit will remain around 3 percent of GDP, the overall fiscal deficit will start rising in
the outer years due to gradually rising interest payments.



Financing Needs. Japan’s gross financing need (defined as the public sector deficit, plus all
maturing debt) was 56 percent of GDP in 2014, the highest among the advanced economies.
Despite the decline in the primary deficit in the next few years, the gross financing needs will
remain exceptionally large above 50 percent of GDP in 2020. Although the government intends
to lengthen the average maturity of JGBs, without specific plans, a similar maturity structure to
the one in 2014 is assumed throughout the projection period.



Debt Profile. The debt financing conditions are helped in the medium-term by a number of
factors. The 10-year bond yield has been at a record low and its spread against the US is
negative at around 190 basis points. The external financing requirement, incorporating the

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAPAN

current account surplus, is well below the lower threshold at 10 percent of GDP. This reflects the
fact that foreign holdings of JGBs are quite low at 8 percent. In addition, there are no direct risks
related to exchange rates as no debt is denominated in foreign currencies, which is also
assumed for the future.


Net Debt. Given the large financial assets held by the government, net debt is an important
indicator for Japan. It should be noted, however, that not all the financial assets are available for
debt repayment or easy to liquidate as, for example, they include assets for future pension
payments. The financial-assets-to-GDP ratio is assumed to be stable at around 120 percent.



Realism of Baseline Assumptions.

1

-

Past assumptions on real growth1 have been neither too optimistic nor pessimistic compared
to peer countries. Although past projections of the GDP deflator were on the optimistic side,
the difference with actual values is small.

-

Past assumptions on the primary balance have been neither too optimistic nor pessimistic.
Recent underperformance is due to the response to the global financial crisis and the 2011
earthquake. The size of Japan’s 3-year adjustment on a cyclically adjusted primary balance
(CAPB) basis is in the top quartile of the historical experience for high-debt market access
countries, but the CAPB level is in the lowest quartile due to the large deficit. Staff believes
that the pace of fiscal consolidation in 2015–18 of around 0.5–1.0 percent of GDP per annum
is appropriate, balancing the high deficit and debt on one hand, with the need to end
deflation and revive growth on the other.

-

Underlying growth without fiscal adjustment would be even more above potential for the
projection period, but this is due to a strengthening of the private-sector recovery on the
back of supportive monetary policy and declining oil prices. For the fiscal consolidation in
the baseline, the overall fiscal multiplier is assumed to be 0.5, which is lower than the default
value of 1. The reasons for this include that about half of the fiscal consolidation is assumed
to come from revenue measures (mainly the consumption tax increase to 10 percent with a
multiplier of around 0.7), that there are partly offsetting rate reductions in more
distortionary taxes such as the corporate income tax, and that some expenditure reductions
take place in areas with relatively lower multipliers such as pension spending.

Optimistic growth projections for 2011 are mainly due to the earthquake.

Shocks and Stress Tests


Fan chart. The fan chart, which incorporates feedback effects between macroeconomic variables
and relies on historical data to calibrate shocks, illustrates additional risks around the baseline.
For example, under the worst quartile case, the debt-to-GDP ratio could reach around
260 percent of GDP in 2020, more than 10 percentage points higher than in the baseline. In
addition, when the possibility of positive primary balance shock is ruled out considering recent
experience, the debt-to-GDP ratio could be even higher by 5 percent of GDP in 2020.



Primary balance shock. The impact is estimated to be modest. The improvement in the primary
balance underperforms by half of the 10-year historical standard deviation of changes in the
primary balance, compared to the baseline. Additional borrowing cost of 25 basis points per
1 percent of GDP worsening of the deficit is assumed. The gross debt-to-GDP ratio will be
higher by around 3 percent of GDP in 2020 than the baseline.



Growth shock. The impact on the debt ratio is the second largest among the shock scenarios.
Real output growth rates are lower by a half of the 10-year historical standard deviation of
changes in growth, compared to the baseline, for 2 years starting in 2016. As a result, the
primary balance deteriorates, leading to higher interest rates as in the primary balance shock
scenario. Also, a decline in inflation is assumed at a rate of 0.25 percentage point per 1 point
decrease in growth. The impact is relatively large, bringing the debt ratio to around 260 percent
of GDP, around 10 percentage points higher relative to the baseline.



Interest rate shock. The effect becomes larger with the passage of time. A spike in JGB yields is
an important medium-term tail risk. A shock of 200 basis points is assumed to happen in 2015
and stay for the rest of the period. Although increasing only gradually due to the average
maturity of around 6.5 years, the effective interest rate is higher by around 1 percentage point
in 2020 than the baseline, with the debt ratio higher by around 5 points. The difference with the
baseline does not look very large, but the impact will accelerate as the interest rate hike
becomes fully reflected. In addition, such a shock could have a material effect on the financial
sector with possible knock-on effects on the debt ratio and could lead to distress in the financial
sector (see next shock).



Interest rate and contingent liability shock. The impact is by far the largest among the scenarios.
A one-time capital injection equivalent to 2.5 percent of banking sector assets (approximately
10 percent of regional banks assets) will increase government spending by around 3.0 percent
of GDP. The interest rate is assumed to rise by 25bps for each percentage point increase in the
primary deficit. This is also combined with the real GDP growth shock. As a result, the debt ratio
will increase to around 275 percent of GDP in 2020, more than 20 percentage points higher than
in the baseline.

Longer-term Projections and Risks. Despite the relatively stable fiscal outlook in the medium term,
the gross and net debt-to-GDP ratios are projected to start increasing faster after 2020 and reach
around 290 percent and 170 percent of GDP by 2030, respectively. This increase is a reflection of a

46

JAPAN

gradual rise in the interest rate-growth differential towards the historical average of 1. 2 Long-term
projections are sensitive to macroeconomic and policy assumptions.
12

One important downside risk is a larger increase in public health spending than assumed in the
baseline (Kashiwase, Nozaki, and Saito 2014). Maintaining the same macroeconomic assumptions as
in the baseline, this would imply a debt ratio of 305 percent of GDP by 2030, about 15 percentage
points higher than in the baseline. Other risks include a less favorable interest rate-growth
differential due to disappointing growth or interest rate hikes upon BoJ exit or both, and changes in
the investor base towards foreign sources of funding that will demand higher risk premia.

2
The differential is currently lower than the historical average, estimated at around -0.8 in 2014, partly reflecting
exceptional monetary easing.

Annex IV. Assessment of Japan’s External Sector
Japan
Background. The net international investment position (NIIP) position has nearly doubled in the last ten years to close to
70 percent of GDP in 2013 (assets: 166 percent; liabilities: 98 percent) . In the medium term it is projected to rise toward 75 percent
with higher current account (CA) surpluses, before stabilizing as valuation effects are offset by dis-saving as the population ages.
Assessment. Vulnerabilities are limited (equity and direct investment comprise a rising share of liabilities, now at 35 percent of
total). Assets are diversified geographically and by risk classes. The NIIP generates annual investment income at 3-3 ½ percent of
GDP, keeping the current account balance positive despite the rising trade deficit.
Current account Background. The 2014 CA surplus fell to 0.5 percent of GDP. Export volumes grew 0.6 percent y/y (4 ¾ percent in value) in the
face of continued headwinds - rising share of offshoring, loss of market share, limited pass-through of the depreciation to lower
export prices, and low global investment. Nonetheless, exports picked up in Q4 2014 supported by gradual economic recovery
overseas and delayed J-curve effects. Despite weak domestic demand and the REER depreciation, import volumes grew 0.7 percent
(5 ¾ percent in value), with rising import penetration in electronics and smartphones.
Assessment.
- EBA estimates the 2014 cyclically-adjusted CA at 0.6 percent of GDP. Staff adjust the estimate for temporary factors (delayed
effects of depreciation, elevated energy imports with the nuclear power plant shutdown, regional tensions), to get an
underlying, cyclically-adjusted CA of 2-2 ¼ percent of GDP.
- EBA estimates the 2014 CA norm at 3.1 percent of GDP. Staff adjust the estimate to account for factors not captured by EBA structurally lower export competitiveness and permanently higher domestic demand and imports under complete Abenomics to get a norm of 1 ¼ to 2 percent of GDP.
- The underlying CA in 2014 is therefore assessed to be 0-1 percent of GDP larger than the norm, broadly consistent with
desirable policies and medium-term fundamentals. (See notes, below.) The 2015 surplus is expected to rise to 2 percent of GDP
under the current policy mix on lower oil prices (the oil balance deficit improves from – 3.6 percent of GDP in 2014 to 2.5 percent projected in 2015) and a pick-up in export growth.
Background. The real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated 5 ¾ percent between 2013 and 2014 (a further 7 percent through
Real exchange
May 2015 (relative to the 2014 average), mainly on account of the nominal depreciation fueled by further widening of interest rate
rate
differentials relative to the U.S. (10y JGB yields stayed suppressed below 60 bps for most of 2014 in anticipation of further BoJ
easing, and eventually dipped as low as 30 bps after the BoJ accelerated its QQE program in October).
Assessment. The EBA REER Level model estimates the 2014 average REER to be 21 percent weaker (EBA Index REER model:
26 percent weaker) than the level consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies, mainly from a large unexplained residual. The
model does not include fiscal policy and so the estimated policy gap is close to zero. Other Japan-specific factors that affect the
REER – JGB-UST spread, portfolio rebalancing, speculative short positions against the yen, and the shock requiring higher energy
imports - are also not included. Because of these missing factors, the EBA REER model is not used in Japan’s assessment. Instead,
using the staff-assessed CA gap range as reference, staff assess a 2014 REER gap midpoint of -5 percent with an indicative
range of 0 to - 10 percent.
Background. There has been a pick-up in portfolio outflows as institutional investors have begun to diversify overseas. Net short

Overall Assessment
Overall Assessment:
The 2014 external position was broadly
consistent with medium-term fundamentals
and desirable policies.
As of May 2015, the key developments
relative to 2014 are the reduction in the oil
import bill, the REER depreciation, and some
pickup in exports. The REER depreciation
compared to the average of 2014 has been
beneficial, given the current stage of the
economic cycle and the need to address low
inflation and reduce deflation risks. At the
same time the REER has moved toward a
moderately weaker level than would be
consistent with its fundamentals suggested
in the 2014 assessment.
Together with these developments,
sustained easing by the BoJ while others
tighten, combined with the lack of bolder
structural reform and the absence of a
credible and specific medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan could strengthen the
external position.
Potential policy responses:

JAPAN

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 49

Forceful structural reforms are needed to
raise growth as well as lift prices. These
include measures to boost labor supply,
reduce labor market duality, enhance risk
capital provision, and accelerate agricultural
and services sector deregulation. Fiscal
consolidation should proceed anchored by a
concrete plan to achieve the medium-term
target, and its conduct attuned to economic
conditions and prospects. These ’desirable’
policies are expected to support growth,
boost domestic demand, imports and prices,
without overreliance on depreciation of the
yen, and help prevent the external position
from moving out of line with fundamentals
over the medium term.

50
Technical
Background
Notes

1/ Export elasticities are structurally lower because offshoring of production and a higher share of intermediate goods exports which
makes Japanese exports less sensitive to yen fluctuations than in the past.
2/ The norm is positive because of high corporate saving in excess of domestic investment opportunities, low residential investment,
and a sizable income account owing to the large NFA position and favorable return differential on assets relative to liabilities.
3/ The uncertainty in the CA gap results from (i) varying estimates of the impact of temporary factors weighing on the CA; (ii) hard-toquantify implications of Abenomics policies for the norm; and (iii) uncertain effects of structural changes – higher offshoring, reduced
competitiveness of some tradable sectors – on the trade balance.

JAPAN

Annex V. Main Recommendations of the 2014 Article IV Consultation
Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions

Fiscal Policy:
The second consumption tax rate increase in 2015 to 10 percent
with a uniform rate should be confirmed.

The government postponed the next consumption tax rate
increase from 8 to 10 percent from October 2015 to April 2017.

A post-2015 fiscal consolidation plan is urgently needed and
should include further revenue measures and entitlement reforms
such as:
 Gradually increasing the consumption tax to at least
15 percent;
 Broadening the personal income tax base;
 Taking measures to contain pension and health care
spending;
 Reforming the spousal deduction from the personal income
tax and threshold below which dependent spouses are
exempted from paying social security contributions; and
 Restructuring the currently untargeted wage deductions
scheme.

The Diet approved new stimulus of about 0.8 percent of GDP,
mainly consisting of cash transfers and public investment.

A corporate income tax cut schedule should be announced
upfront, but phased in over time.

The government announced the reduction of the effective
corporate income tax (CIT) rate by 3.3 percent over the next two
years, together with base broadening measures including
lowering the limit for loss carried forward and the increase of
the ratio of pro-forma standard taxation.

In late June 2015, the government announced the mediumterm fiscal consolidation plan to achieve a primary balance by
FY2020, which identified additional measures of about
1½ percent of GDP, mostly through containing social security
spending.

Monetary Policy:
The BoJ should act quickly if actual or expected inflation stagnates
or growth disappoints.

In October 2014, the BoJ expanded its QQE framework further
by increasing purchases of JGBs to 80 trillion yen annually,
extending the average maturity of JGBs purchases to about 7–
10 years, and tripling its purchases of private assets.

Communication should focus on achieving 2 percent inflation in a
stable manner aided by a more transparent presentation of the
BoJ’s forecast and underlying assumptions.

The BoJ has published the oil price assumption underlying its
forecast and studies of the effectiveness of its QQE and
progress of the regime shift it is trying to engineer.

Financial Sector Policy:
Strengthening capital standards for domestically oriented banks
by including reassessing the treatment of unrealized losses in
capital.

While consolidation of regional banks is being led by the
private sector, the FSA is encouraging regional banks with low
profitability and weak prospects for their local economies to
change their business strategy in a forward-looking manner.

Mitigating foreign-exchange funding risks for banks with
overseas activities by raising deposits overseas and by issuing
long-term foreign-denominated debt.

The FSA is closely monitoring banks’ liquidity risks, in particular
in foreign currency, by changing the regulatory framework to
raise the quality of capital and requiring banks’ provisioning
practices more forward looking.

Growth Strategy
Raising labor supply by fully implementing plans to increase the
availability of child care, gradually raising the retirement age, and
relaxing immigration restrictions in areas with labor shortages.

The portfolio investment target of the GPIF was revised to
increase investment in equities and foreign assets while
reducing JGB holdings.

Enhancing risk capital provision by focusing on increasing credit
to new growth projects and by revising GPIF‘s investment
strategy.

The Stewardship code was introduced to induce greater
institutional investor activism.

Implementing comprehensive corporate governance reform to
strengthen firms’ governance and potentially unlock corporate
savings for more growth effective use.
Deregulating agriculture and domestic services sectors to raise
productivity and encourage inward foreign investment.

The Companies Act was amended and the Corporate
Governance Code was adopted to require listed companies to
appoint outside directors on a “comply or explain” basis.
The JPX-Nikkei index comprising only profitable firms with
good corporate governance and disclosure was launched.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Japan maintains a free floating exchange rate regime. Since the 2014 Article IV consultation, Japan
has not had foreign exchange intervention. The ministry of finance publishes foreign exchange
intervention information on its website. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions, with the exceptions of restrictions
imposed solely for the preservation of national or international security that have been notified to
the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144–(52/51).

Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Framework:
Japan underwent an assessment of its AML/CFT framework against the AML/CFT standard by the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Asia/Pacific Group (APG) in 2008. Significant deficiencies
were identified, notably with respect to customer due diligence (CDD) requirements, transparency of
legal entities, the criminalization of terrorist financing and the freezing of terrorist assets. Since the
2014 Article IV mission, Japan has made significant progress in its commitment to strengthening its
AML/CFT legal framework through the FATF standards, notably by enacting the Amendment Act on
Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds, the Act to Amend the Terrorism Financing Act, and the
Terrorist Assets Freezing Act. Japan will continue to be monitored by the FATF on its progress
including the issuance of subsidiary legislations to implement the enacted Acts.
Article IV Consultation:
The 2014 Article IV consultation discussions were held during May 19–30, 2014; the Executive Board
discussed the Staff Report (IMF Country Report No. 14/236) and concluded the consultation on July
23, 2014. The concluding statement, staff report, staff supplement, selected issues paper, and PIN
were all published.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Prepared by

Asia and Pacific Department

1.
This supplement contains information that has become available since the
Staff Report was circulated to the Executive Board on July 2, 2015. It does not
alter the staff’s broad assessment of policy issues and recommendations contained in
the report.
2.
Data releases continue to be in line with staff projections. Private
consumption rebounded in May, with the real synthetic consumption index up by 0.6
percent (m/m), while consumer confidence edged up to 41.7 in June from 41.4 in May.
In May, private machinery orders (excluding volatile items) rose (0.6 percent, m/m)
while industrial production fell (2.1 percent, m/m). Core inflation (excluding fresh food)
rose slightly to 0.1 percent (from 0.0 percent in April).
3.
On June 30, the government announced “Basic Policy on Economic and
Fiscal Management and Reform 2015.” One of its main pillars is a 5-year fiscal
consolidation strategy to achieve a primary surplus of the central and local
governments by FY2020 and contains the following key components:


A substantially higher nominal and real growth rate than in the staff’s baseline
WEO projections. Higher growth is expected to stem mainly from continued
implementation of the current structural reform agenda;



An interim benchmark in FY2018 of a primary deficit for the central and local
governments of around 1 percent of GDP. Additional expenditure and revenue
measures will be considered if needed to reach the FY2020 target;



Containing expenditure growth, especially for social security spending, to the trend
increase of the past 3 years (approximately 1.6 trillion yen for general expenditures
of the central government), taking into consideration economic and price
developments;

JAPAN



Revenue neutral comprehensive tax reform with a focus on supporting low-income
households and those with children, securing neutrality with regard to how people
choose to work, and securing intra- and inter-generational fairness; and



Acknowledging the need for flexibility to make sure that the economy will weather
the next consumption tax hike scheduled in April 2017 but without specifying
measures.

4.
In its June 2015 policy meeting, the BoJ left its stance unchanged and
announced a new communication framework to provide higher frequency and
more detailed forecasts for Japan’s economy and prices, which serve as the basis
for policy decisions. The changes, which take effect from January 2016, are designed
to enhance the transparency of the policy board's decision-making process and
include:

2



Preparing the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices on a quarterly rather than a
semi-annual basis;



Releasing each board member’s forecasts for growth and prices with a risk
assessment;



Issuing the “Summary of Opinions” in about a week after each monetary policy
meeting, providing information about the policy board's debates; and



Reducing the frequency of monetary policy meetings from around 14 to 8 times a
year.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Mikio Kajikawa, Executive Director for Japan;
Tetsuya Hiroshima, Alternate Executive Director;
Kazuki Watanabe, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director; and
Koki Masuhara, Advisor to the Executive Director
1.
We are grateful for the candid dialogue between staff and our authorities during
this year’s Article IV Consultation, and for the excellent set of papers. The authorities
have strongly implemented the economic policy mix, namely the “three-arrows” of
Abenomics, consisting of aggressive monetary easing, flexible fiscal policy, and
structural reforms, in order to end a prolonged period of deflation, revitalize the Japanese
economy and advance fiscal consolidation. In what follows, we will briefly explain our
authorities’ assessment of Japan’s economic developments as well as their views and
commitments in terms of macroeconomic policies and growth strategy.
Current Developments and Outlook for the Japanese Economy
2.
The Japanese economy has continued to recover as a trend, albeit with more than
expected fluctuations due to the front-loaded increase in demand prior to the consumption
tax hike in April 2014 and the subsequent decline: the real GDP growth during the 1st
quarter of 2015 recorded plus 3.9 percent (quarter-on-quarter growth on an annualized
basis) and plus 9.4 percent in nominal terms, well above the expectations of market
participants and economists, recorded positive growth for the second consecutive quarter.
This is due to the resilient consecutive growth in private consumption and business
investment.
3.
The virtuous cycle from income increase to consumption and investment has
been operating steadily in both the household and corporate sectors. For example, the
corporate sector is now achieving a higher profitability and, indeed, the total net profit of
listed companies at Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) hits the highest records as of March
2015. Against the background of the favorable corporate earnings, firms have maintained
a proactive stance on investment, as suggested by the large upward revision of investment
plan shown in the recent Tankan survey (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in
Japan). The labor market continues to be tight: the unemployment rate has been
approaching around 3.3 percent, breaking its bottom record for the first time in 18 years
and the ratio of job openings-to-applications have reached the highest level in 23 years.
Monthly wages have increased by 2.20 percent after this spring’s annual wage
negotiations, the highest level in 17 years.
4.
Looking forward, consumption and business investment are expected to grow
further with the tailwind of favorable business performance, decline in oil prices, and
wage hike. The real GDP growth rate in FY2015 is expected to be 1.5 percent, the major
contribution of which is stemming from the domestic demand.

Fiscal Policy
5.
Fiscal consolidation has made major progress since Abenomics started. Thanks to
revenue increase under the resilient economic performance, consumption tax rate hike to
8 percent, and reforms in the expenditure side, the FY2015 budget is projected to achieve
the interim target of the halving of the primary deficit to GDP ratio by FY2015 from the
ratio in FY2010 (from ▲6.6 percent to ▲3.3 percent). On the other hand, we would like
to emphasis here that the government is paying due attention to strike a right balance
between revitalizing the economy and fiscal consolidation: the consumption tax hike to
10 percent has been postponed to April 2017, and the FY2014 supplementary budget was
formulated, taking into account the economic conditions; moreover, the size of the FY
2015 budget recorded the highest ever.
6.
With regard to medium-term fiscal consolidation plan, “the Plan to Advance
Economic and Fiscal Revitalization,” has been formulated on June 30, with the following
three pillars: “overcoming deflation and revitalizing the economy”, “reforming
expenditure measures” and “reforming revenue measures.” In this plan, the government
firmly maintains the original fiscal target which intends to achieve a primary surplus by
FY2020 and put debt steadily on a downward trajectory thereafter. The government,
cooperating with the ruling party, considers the plan as effective and concrete. Based on
the plan, the government will further strengthen the measures which have been
implemented over the past 3 years and make progress in revitalizing the economy and
fiscal consolidation. Although staff points out that the fiscal outlook may rely on
optimistic growth assumptions, the government will materialize the growth scenario in
the plan by steadily revitalizing the economy for the next 5 years and, at the same time,
the government will achieve the 2020 fiscal target of a primary surplus by making
continued efforts of expenditure reform in line with the past developments.
7.
The abovementioned plan stipulates that the progress of fiscal consolidation will
be assessed in FY2018 against the interim benchmarks of achieving approximately 1
percent of the primary deficit to GDP ratio in FY2018, and intensive reforms will be
implemented by then. For instance, on the expenditure side, the recent 3-year efforts to
manage the expenditure size shall be continued toward FY2018, taking into account the
total rise of expenditure being contained to 1.6 trillion yen from FY2013 to FY2015 and
the economic and price development. (In the same manner, with regard to social security
expenditures, the recent 3-year efforts to manage its size shall be continued toward
FY2018, taking into account the outcome of economic reforms, the rise of its expenditure
(approximately 1.5 trillion yen) being attributable to the population aging, and the
economic and price development.) In assessing the progress of the reforms on both the
expenditure and the revenue sides at the mid-term review in FY2018, additional measures
in expenditure and revenue will be considered, if necessary, to achieve the FY2020 fiscal
target, while maintaining the goal of overcoming deflation and economic revitalization.

8.
On the revenue reform, the consumption tax hike to 10 percent will surely be
implemented in April 2017 in order to sustain the social security system. In addition, the
pro-growth corporate tax reform will be completed shortly. Furthermore, given the
economic and social structural changes including population aging, the government will
proceed with a comprehensive overhaul of the tax system in a prompt manner.
Monetary Policy
9.
The quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQME), which the Bank of
Japan introduced in April 2013 and expanded in October of last year, has been producing
the intended effect: with a virtuous cycle from income to spending likely to maintain
steadily in both the household and corporate sectors under the QQME, Japan’s economy
is expected to continue growing at a pace above its potential. The underlying trend in
inflation has steadily been improving against the background of the improvement of
output gap and the increase of inflation expectation. The BOJ expanded QQME in
October 2014 since there is a risk in the short term that changing people’s deflationary
mindset will be delayed by the substantial decline in crude oil prices and somewhat weak
developments in demand following the consumption tax hike. Looking at developments
in inflation expectations thereafter, market-based indicators and various survey results
have not declined despite the fall in crude oil prices.
10.
Looking ahead, although staff emphasizes that it would take more time than
expected to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, the BOJ expects that the
improvement in the output gap and an increase in inflation expectations are likely to
continue, and thus the underlying trend in inflation is expected to steadily rise. Although
the timing of the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI reaching around 2 percent
depends on developments in crude oil prices, this is projected to happen around the first
half of fiscal 2016, assuming that crude oil prices will rise moderately from the recent
level. The BOJ believe that this forecast is consistent with the commitment to achieving
the price stability target at the earliest possible time, with a time horizon of about two
years. That said, if there are changes in the underlying trend in inflation and it is deemed
necessary to take action in order to achieve 2 percent inflation, the BOJ will make
adjustments as appropriate without hesitation.
11.
With regard to the communication strategy, staff insists that the BOJ needs to
strengthen the strategy to anchor the market expectation. Actually, the BOJ decided at the
monetary policy meeting (MPM) held in June to further enhance deliberations at the
MPMs and the BOJ’s communication on monetary policy: the BOJ will increase the
frequency of publication of the outlook report from the current semiannual basis to a
quarterly basis; each member’s forecasts and risk assessments will be released; summary
of opinions presented at each MPM will be released in about a week after the meeting.
Those changes will take effect in January 2016.

Growth Strategy
12.
The third arrow (growth strategy) is critically important to end a prolonged period
of deflation and revitalize the Japanese economy and advance fiscal consolidation.
Strengthening a virtuous cycle from favorable business performance to the increase in
investment and wages, and hence consumption, is warranted to ensure self-sustaining
growth led by private demand and materialize revenue increase. Necessary measures to
make effective use of retained earnings, exceeding 60 percent of GDP, are already
undertaken, including the corporate governance reforms, the coordination at the Trilateral
Partnership Forum by representatives of employers, labor unions and political leaders,
and the pro-growth corporate tax reform.
13.
For example, regarding corporate governance, the authorities have been working
to promote changes in corporates’ behavior through corporate governance reforms. In
June, the Corporate Governance Code was formally introduced and all listed companies
are now asked, in comply-or-explain basis, to appoint at least two outside directors, and
to disclose overall policy and voting criteria of cross-shareholding. The Japan’s
Stewardship Code, which encourages investors to fulfill their fiduciary duties for their
clients, has been adopted by more than 190 institutional investors, including the
Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), one of the largest pension funds in the
world. We have already observed concrete fruits of these reforms through increase in
ROE (raises from 5.8 percent in the 4Q of 2012 to 8.5 percent in the 1Q of 2015), share
buy-backs, and capital investments.
14.
Furthermore, the authorities established the abovementioned Trilateral Partnership
Forum with the aim to strengthen momentum for wage increases. This framework has
contributed to 2.20 percent average increase in monthly pay by Japanese companies in
this spring wage negotiations, which was the highest in 17 years. The wage increase
momentum is spreading among SMEs as well and is expected to be a large tailwind for a
resilient recovery.
15.
With regard to the corporate tax reform, the government will reduce the
percentage level of effective corporate tax rates down to the twenties over several years,
combined with broadening tax bases. The first phase of reductions is already in place:
reducing the rate by 2.5 percent in FY2015 and by 0.78 percent in FY2016. The
government facilitates companies through the reform to enhance their competitiveness
and earnings by imposing more tax burden on underperformance companies while
mitigating tax burden to favorable performance companies.
16.
Another crucial issue facing Japan is declining labor force and, as staff rightly
indicates, enhancing female labor force participation is crucial. Substantial resources in
FY2015 budget has been allocated to the area including providing for sizable increase in
child care facilities. As of the end of FY2014, additional childcare capacity for

approximately 0.2 million children was secured, and, on top of that, 0.2 million capacity
will be added by the end of FY2017. We have already observed concrete fruits in this
area as well; the number of employees has already increased by 0.9 million since
Abenomic started and women’s labor participation rate at ages 25-44 has increased from
70.9 percent to 74.3 percent for the last 2 years. More enterprises now adopt females as
executive members or management level employees.
17.
Regarding the tourism, with the tailwind of the deregulation of visa requirement
in Asian countries and deregulation in Tokyo Haneda airport, the number of foreign
tourists visited Japan hit a record of 13.4 million in 2014, and the pace from January to
May in 2015 is increasing further by 44.9 percent compared to that in 2014. As a result,
the travel balance has now turned to surplus. The government will make continued efforts
to improve tourist environment to be ready to accept 20 million tourists from abroad in
near future.
18.
The government announced in June the revised version of the Japan
Revitalization Strategy, an updated growth strategy, and the strategy will be kept
evolving going forward. The strategy includes a wide range of agenda, but the
government will surely implement the revised strategy in a prompt manner.
Financial Sector
As shown in the fact that all banks meet the safety and soundness concerns such as
capital adequacy ratio, Japan’s financial system remains, overall, sound and stable. The
NPL ratio has been kept low and banks’ net incomes remain high. In terms of interest rate
risks, the Japanese banks have resilient enough to address risks stemming from higher
interest rates, supported by their ample capital base. In this regard, my authorities
continue to make efforts toward monitoring and assessing risks and strengthening
stability of our financial system, taking into account the staff’s views.
Spillovers
19.
We take note of the staff’s view that, without bolder structural reforms and
credible fiscal consolidation, domestic demand could remain sluggish and the outward
spillovers may turn negative. Our authorities continue to make efforts toward the
implementation of all three arrows of Abenomics and boosting domestic demand. In this
light, the goal of Abenomics is achieving a positive economic growth cycle through an
increase in corporate performance, incomes, investments and, most importantly,
consumption. It is expected that, in FY2015, economic growth is led by not external but
domestic demand.
20.
In terms of capital flows, it is worth noting that, after Abenomics has taken place,
capital outflows to other countries are significantly increasing. For instance, on the back
of the QQME, banks, insurance industry, and pension funds including the GPIF, have

rebalanced their portfolios and started to reallocate their investments to foreign assets.
Japanese banks, in this context, have actively increased their foreign investments and
loans, inter alia, for Asian countries, as their net foreign assets increased to 3.4 trillion
USD as of the end-March this year, which is record high. Furthermore, foreign direct
investments by the Japanese firms reached 12.8 trillion yen last year from 9.8 trillion yen
in 2012, mainly toward North America and the ASEAN countries.
21.
We have been implementing the fiscal consolidation and further consolidation
efforts are clearly needed. We, however, would like to highlight here the positive side of
our fiscal consolidation implemented in a different timing from other major economies; if
Japan had implemented fiscal consolidation in parallel with the US and the euro area, the
negative spillover would have been synchronized, resulted in larger impact on global
economy as a whole. In other words, such differences in the timing of the consolidation
efforts contribute to minimizing negative impact on the global economy and hence have
positive spillover to support the global recovery momentum.
