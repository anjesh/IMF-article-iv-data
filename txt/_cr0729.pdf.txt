Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation, First Review of the Policy Support
Instrument, Request for Waiver of Assessment Criteria, and
Request for a Three-Year Policy Support Instrument
Prepared by the African Department
Approved by Robert Corker and Mark Plant
December 1, 2006

Main topics. This report recommends completion of the first review under the Policy
Support Instrument (PSI) and approval of a new three-year PSI.
Electricity crisis. Uganda’s electricity-generation capacity has fallen to about half of
peak demand, a crisis brought on by delayed hydroelectric investment and a regional
drought. Emergency measures are now being put in place and new dam construction is
about to start.
Infrastructure gap. Uganda’s roads, railroads, and other infrastructure are insufficient
to support future growth. MDRI debt relief provides an opportunity to scale up
investment, but project implementation needs to improve.
Participants. The mission met with President Museveni, Finance Minister Suruma,
Bank of Uganda Governor Tumusiime Mutebile, other government officials, and
representatives of the private sector and the international community. The mission
team comprised Messrs. Green (head, AFR), Mikkelsen, Gershenson (both AFR),
Espejo (PDR), and Jonas (FAD). Mr. Selassie, the Fund’s resident representative in
Kampala, participated in the discussions. Mr. Ukpong, senior advisor to Mr. Gakunu,
attended policy meetings.
Selected Issues Paper. A joint selected issues paper was prepared for the 2006–07
Article IV consultations with Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.
Article VIII status. Uganda has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, sections
2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments for current international transactions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

PSI Performance. All quantitative assessment criteria for the first PSI review were
observed, but quantitative indicative targets on domestic arrears and administrative
expenditures were not met. In addition, two structural assessment criteria were not
met: one was implemented with a slight delay and the other with a slight deviation
from plan. The authorities are taking steps to address the unresolved slippages.

•

New PSI. The authorities request a new three-year PSI. The main objectives of the
program are to sustain macroeconomic stability and to alleviate constraints on
growth. Tackling the ongoing electricity crisis, other infrastructure deficiencies, and
low financial intermediation will be key program objectives. Other structural
measures will address domestic arrears, including measures not completed in the first
PSI, and debt management.

•

Macroeconomic policies. Sound economic policies during the last 15 years have
resulted in one of the best records in Africa, although per capita growth and poverty
reduction have slowed in recent years. While there are growing calls for more
government intervention to stimulate growth, the government remains committed to
prudent fiscal and monetary policies and market-based reforms, as evidenced by the
government’s success in maintaining fiscal discipline in 2005/06, despite spending
pressures arising from the electricity crisis, higher oil prices, and the elections.

•

Recent developments. While economic growth and Uganda’s external position were
largely consistent with program assumptions in 2005/06, an acute electricity crisis
threatens macroeconomic performance. Extensive power cuts have mostly hurt
manufacturing and a few other energy-dependent sectors. Inflation was slightly above
projections through September due to higher energy costs.

•

Political developments. Economic prospects could significantly improve from an
end to the 20-year conflict in northern Uganda. Peace talks were restarted earlier this
year and discussions for a permanent peace agreement are ongoing. President
Museveni was reelected in February 2006.

•

Key risks. Further delays in augmenting electricity capacity could undermine the
economy. Moreover, the full economic impact of the current situation is not yet
known. Growth and revenue projections could be revised downward. The expected
increase in agriculture production may not materialize, as the sector remains very
sensitive to adverse weather conditions.

5

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
To build on the impressive economic gains of the past 15 years, Uganda needs to
maintain macroeconomic stability, strengthen infrastructure development, improve
governance and institutions, and remove remaining administrative bottlenecks for businesses.
As an immediate priority, the government must resolve the ongoing electricity crisis.
2.
At the conclusion of the 2004 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors
commended Uganda’s impressive growth and poverty reduction, but noted that
progress had started to taper off.1 They encouraged Uganda to launch a second wave of
reforms to boost per capita growth and reduce poverty. The authorities were in agreement
with these recommendations and pursued policies broadly consistent with Fund advice
(Box 1).

Box 1. 2004 Article IV Key Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Fund policy recommendations centered on fiscal consolidation, structural reforms, and
sterilization mix. The Fund and the authorities agreed that fiscal consolidation would remain
an essential element of macroeconomic management, and this has been reflected in the
authorities’ Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. The Fund stressed the importance of
structural reforms, such as improving governance and reviving the public administration
reform program; this sentiment was shared by the authorities, but progress remained slow.
Consistent with the Fund’s recommendations, the authorities adjusted their sterilization mix
in favor of foreign exchange sales, contributing to lower interest rates and an increase in
private sector borrowing.

3.
The authorities have requested a three-year PSI to support of their near- and
medium-term policies. The preference to move to a multi-year relationship was already
envisaged at the time of the request for the current PSI, when discussions on substantive
medium-term policies were postponed until after the presidential and parliamentary elections
of February 2006. Uganda remains a strong candidate for a PSI with its longstanding track
record of prudent macroeconomic policies, ample foreign exchange reserves, and low
external debt, particularly after the recent Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).

5.
More recently, however, per capita growth has tapered off and poverty
reduction stagnated. Apart from slower economic growth, poverty trends were adversely
affected by declining terms of trade (in the late 1990s) and widening income inequalities.
The fall in per capita growth is explained by a dwindling contribution from the positive postconflict catching up effects, relatively low productivity growth, and very high population
growth.2 Uganda’s annual population growth—now over 3 percent—is one of the highest in
the world.
6.
An acute electricity crisis
threatens Uganda’s macroeconomic
performance. The regional drought in
2005/06 reduced Uganda’s already
inadequate hydropower-generating
capacity, resulting in a production gap of
nearly one-half of demand. In
consequence, businesses and consumers

were forced to endure prolonged service cuts, with some shifting production to times when
power is available and larger businesses relying on high-cost backup generators.
Manufacturing, high-value agriculture (flowers), and processing industries (fish) are most
affected by power cuts, and profits in these industries are being squeezed. Measured GDP
growth in 2005/06 (5½ percent) was largely unaffected because of these short-term coping
strategies and because of the methodology used in estimating GDP.3
7.
The electricity crisis has had a more immediate impact on inflation and the
trade balance. Underlying inflation,
which excludes food, moved close to

The wider deficit drove down the reserve
import cover to about 5½ months at end2005/06, although financing was not a concern because net donor support remained above
8 percent of GDP. The MDRI debt relief will augment the government’s resource envelope
in the short and medium term (Box 2).
B. Constraints to Growth
8.
Discussions with the authorities and private sector representatives emphasized
several medium-term growth constraints:
•

3

Inadequate electricity generation and distribution. The present situation with
extensive load-shedding blackouts is not sustainable. For several years, Uganda’s
generating capacity, which is based on relatively inexpensive hydropower, has
increasingly fallen short of demand. The recent drought conditions have exacerbated
the problem, with hydroelectric production cut in half to about 100 megawatts (MW).
Efforts to build a dam at Bujagali were delayed several times by planning errors and

Official GDP statistics in Uganda may not fully capture the decline in value added stemming from increased
costs. As in many other African countries, they are based on production volume indices and therefore they do
not reflect the recent increase in energy input costs.

8

environmental concerns (since addressed). Temporary diesel generators (100 MW)
were recently added to the power grid, helping to reduce load shedding. The cost of
the crisis was worsened by high world oil prices.

Box 2. MDRI Debt Relief: Allocation of Available Resources
The IMF, the World Bank, and the African Development Fund (AfDF) granted debt relief to
Uganda under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). The IMF debt relief will have a
significant impact in the 2006/07 budget, while the flow impact of World Bank and AfDF
relief is expected to be spread out over a longer period due to longer grace periods and
maturities. However, the net flow effect of the debt relief from the World Bank could be
small as future IDA allocations may be lower than previously envisaged.
The government has decided to allocate IMF debt relief to projects in energy infrastructure
starting with the 2006/07 budget. The World Bank and the AfDF debt relief could be
incorporated in the 2007/08 budget framework to support the achievement of MDGs. The
AfDF relief is expected to be delivered before end-2006.

•

Poor transportation network. Uganda’s indicators for road and railway
infrastructure are among the worst in Africa. Given the country’s landlocked status,
this poses considerable cost disadvantages, with some exporters turning to high-value
goods that can be transported by air freight. Rural areas are also faced with an
infrastructure deficit that prevents easy access to local markets, particularly for food
crops and fish. These represent close to 25 percent of GDP.

The need for financial deepening is also reflected in the persistent high spread
between lending and deposit rates for most customers. This problem derives from
relatively low financial savings, as well as some inadequate institutional
arrangements on which financial activity depends. Notwithstanding a successful
microfinance sector, which is an important contributor to poverty alleviation in the
larger cities and along the main highways, access to credit is a particular problem in
the rural areas.

•

Corruption and governance problems. According to Transparency International’s
Corruption Perception Index, Uganda ranked 117 out of 158 countries and in the
lower half of sub-Saharan countries. Recent investigations into mismanagement of
Global Fund money and irregularities in government procurement have illustrated the
need to strengthen policies in this area, but, on the positive side, the government’s
willingness to take on difficult cases. The successful restructuring of the Ugandan
Revenue Authority (URA) has resulted in improved governance and increased tax
collection.

10

III. THE PSI REVIEW— MOSTLY ON TRACK, BUT SOME DELAYS AND SLIPPAGES
9.
All quantitative assessment criteria for end-June 2006 were met, but several
indicative targets were not observed (Table 6). The indicative target on minimum
expenditures under the Poverty Action Fund was reached, but public administration spending
was about U Sh 50 billion (0.2 percent of GDP) above the ceiling due to unanticipated
election costs and a salary increase for parliamentarians. Reported domestic arrears under the
commitment control system (CCS) were above the indicative target (U Sh 13 billion), despite
efforts to limit new arrears and progress in related structural measures (see below). Reporting
of CCS arrears remains a problem, but should improve as teething problems with the new
computerized system are resolved and as efforts to enforce existing rules are strengthened.
10.
Fiscal developments in 2005/06 were broadly in line with the program and its
consolidation objective (Table 2). The overall deficit ratio, excluding grants, declined by
1 percentage point to 7.5 percent of
GDP, reflecting both higher tax

Progress continued in implementing the structural program, but not as
originally envisaged (Table 7). Two structural assessment criteria were not completed on
time and three structural benchmarks were not observed. The assessment criterion on
repayment of old arrears was met, but the strategy paper for avoiding domestic arrears was
submitted to Cabinet with a delay. This reflected a more ambitious paper than initially
planned and the need to fine tune the approach proposed. Provisions for arrears payment in
the 2006/07 budget were doubled, but the allocated amount fell just short of that envisaged
due to the urgent needs of the electricity sector. There has been progress in meeting the
structural benchmarks, including on submitting budget contingency regulations (completed)
and preparing guidelines on contracting, managing, and monitoring external debt.
Verification of all old (pre-CCS) arrears is nearly complete, but missing personnel records
has slowed verification of military arrears. The Uganda Development Bank increased lending
by a small amount before its new management team was in place.
IV. MEDIUM-TERM POLICY CHALLENGE—MAINTAIN MACROECONOMIC STABILITY
AND ADDRESS INFRASTRUCTURE DEFICIENCIES
13.
Uganda’s key medium-term challenge is to sustain economic growth at a rate
consistent with significant poverty reduction. The authorities at the highest levels are
committed to macroeconomic stability through achieving prudent fiscal and monetary
policies and market-based reforms. As outlined in Uganda’s Poverty Eradication Action Plan
(PEAP), sustaining higher growth will depend on finding ways to scale up transportation
infrastructure and utilities, improve access to rural finance and SMEs, remove barriers to
investment, and continue to focus on education as Uganda’s young population enters the
labor force.

12

14.
The public policy discourse affirms the need to maintain macro stability, but
there are also growing calls for government intervention in a few areas. Some would like
tax incentives as a way to attract more foreign investment, while others would like
government support for rural savings institutions and other financial services. At this point,
the authorities are only contemplating limited tax incentives and experimentation with
promoting financial services for the rural poor. The authorities also see regional cooperation
as a means of spurring development. As outlined below, the establishment of the East
African Community (EAC) has expanded the local market and given the countries involved a
forum for policy discussions on further economic integration.
15.
In line with the PEAP, the baseline medium-term framework envisages annual
real GDP growth of 6 to 7 percent and inflation of 4 to 5 percent. The projected growth
pickup assumes that

16.
The framework is conditioned on (i) addressing the electricity sector’s supply and
demand imbalance; (ii) construction of new roads and other infrastructure; and
(iii) strengthening the financial system, and (iv) further domestic revenue mobilization,
together with spending discipline and prioritization. Absent scaling up of grants, the
authorities would consider borrowing for well-defined infrastructure projects.
17.
The staff sees the medium-term framework as feasible, but with some risks. The
overall strategy of supporting private sector growth through continued emphasis on sound
macroeconomic policies, better infrastructure, financial sector development, and regional
cooperation is appropriate. But while timely completion of infrastructure projects is key to
success, careful project selection and implementation would be essential, along with
appropriate financing and avoidance of adverse macroeconomic consequences and a rapid
buildup of debt. Interventionist policies should also be measured given that experience in
Uganda and other countries suggests that tax incentives and direct support to the financial
sector can be costly and ineffective.
A. Solving the Electricity Crisis
18.
The government is implementing a two-part solution to the crisis. It is installing
temporary diesel (thermal) generators to replace capacity lost because of drought conditions,
promoting energy conservation, and reducing the currently high distribution and billing
losses. Further ahead, it will complete construction of new hydropower plants at Bujagali and
Karuma:
•

One half of the planned 200 MW thermal generating capacity has already been
installed and loadshedding has been reduced. Capital and operating costs of the
thermal generators would be financed over the next four years through the already
implemented doubling of the average electricity tariff, the government’s own
resources, and a World Bank loan. The approximately 100 percent increase in tariffs
in 2006 is expected to cover about one-third of the costs of running these generators
and puts tariffs in line with the expected marginal cost of producing power with the
Bujagali plant. Further tariff increases may be needed if world oil prices rise.

•

The Bujagali project is in the late planning stages and would be financed through a
public-private partnership arrangement. Approval by the private consortium and
financing partners is expected in early 2007. When electricity production begins in
about four years, Uganda would decommission its diesel generators, but projections
indicate that the supply—demand gap would not be fully closed.

14

•

The Karuma dam and a heavy fuel oil power station (part of the emergency project)
would be needed to meet anticipated demand in the medium term. As with Bujagali,
Karuma is downstream on the Nile and would utilize water already flowing from
Lake Victoria. The government is keen to move ahead quickly to avoid future
electricity shortages, promote growth, and have power for rural electrification. The
government’s energy fund (US$55 million in the 2006/07 budget) would provide seed
money, but more resources will be needed.

19.
Oil reserves were recently discovered in Uganda (Box 3). At this stage, proven
reserves are small, but could help meet a part of Uganda’s demand in the future. The
government is committed to transparency policies and proper accounting procedures.
Box 3. Oil Exploration: Prospects and Policy Implications
Oil has been discovered in the Lake Albert region in western Uganda. Continuing
exploration there—under production-sharing agreements—could attract additional
investments.
If extraction proves to be economically viable, oil production could amount to about a half of
current demand by 2009. The government is conducting a detailed feasibility study of oil
extraction—including cost estimates—to be completed by early 2007. Depending on the
amount of recoverable reserves, the government could build an on-site mini refinery (at a
cost of about US$200 million) and a thermal power plant. The financing options have not yet
been finalized, but a private-public partnership contract might be used.
The government is working on specific transparency and accounting procedures for the
prospective oil industry. The objectives are to administer oil production efficiently; ensure
transparency in the management, operations, and accounting of the oil-generated resources;
and protect the environment in the oil-producing areas.
B. Dams and Roads—Macroeconomic Considerations4
20.
Construction of large infrastructure projects, including the Bujagali and
Karuma dams, will require both domestic and external resources. The program
incorporates the estimates for the full Bujagali dam, ongoing road construction, and some
funds for Karuma (ring-fenced savings at the Bank of Uganda). These are sustainable in
terms of financing and imports, and are necessary to maintain economic growth in the 64

The Bujagali and Karuma dams are listed in the PEAP as is road construction and maintenance.

15

7 percent range in the medium term. Fiscal space for completion of Karuma and other
projects could be created through a mix of the following:
•

changes in priorities within recurrent and development spending allocations,
including donor-financed projects;

•

concessional financing, provided that debt sustainability is preserved (see below);

•

nonconcessional financing could be considered as a last resort and only if a specific
project can be shown to be economically viable;

•

drawing down government deposits at the BOU, including the new Energy Fund.
This would cause a monetary expansion unless matched by a decline in BOU
international reserves; and

•

domestic bond financing, with due consideration for domestic debt sustainability.

21.
MDRI debt relief has given Uganda room to borrow externally, and prudent
fiscal policies have kept domestic debt low. The DSA baseline scenario, which is
consistent with the baseline macroeconomic projections through 2009 and historical public
investment and borrowing thereafter, shows that Uganda’s debt would remain below
threshold levels through the long-term DSA period. The alternative DSA scenario
incorporates a higher investment path, including the Karuma dam and road projects. It shows
debt ratios rising well above current post-MDRI levels and close to threshold levels in the
stress tests. Thus, the cautious approach to new borrowing envisaged in the government’s
draft debt strategy is warranted to avoid future debt distress.
22.
Large infrastructure investment projects would likely be import intensive.
Import spending on these projects will reduce their claim on domestic resources (limiting the
risk of inflation). Because these projects are expected to be mostly financed through external
resources, current projections over the three-year program period show a comfortable level
of reserves at about five months of
import cover.
Export performance

23.
The envisaged infrastructure
projects could contribute to real
exchange rate appreciation. The
current level of the real exchange rate—
supported by the independently floating
exchange rate regime—seems
appropriate for competitiveness, as

evidenced by growth of nontraditional exports. In the near term, appreciation pressures could
come if domestic production cannot meet demand for nontraded goods required for
infrastructure construction and other donor-funded projects. These near-term pressures will
need to be closely monitored. In the medium term, higher productivity growth may lead to a
real exchange rate appreciation, but this would not be a problem from the perspective of
competitiveness.
24.
Much depends on improved project execution. Procurement problems, inability to
enforce contracts, and limited implementation capacity have delayed the completion of a
number of important infrastructure projects in the past, including Bujagali. Such
implementation problems will need to be addressed promptly.
C. Broadening the Financial Sector
25.
The financial system needs to be deeper and more accessible. Over the past
several years, Uganda has created a well-capitalized and profitable banking sector that
provides short-term financing to large customers at rates close to treasury bill yields. Uganda
has also fostered a dynamic microfinance sector. More remains to be done, including reforms
to promote long-term financing, reduce the cost of borrowing for SMEs, and bring financial
services to rural areas.
26.
Staff stressed the importance of strengthening the institutional framework of the
financial sector.5 As recommended in the 2005 FSAP Update, a credit reference bureau, a
revamped insolvency legislation, and a national identity card system would reduce the cost of
credit, especially to SMEs (MEFP, paragraph 26). The credit reference bureau is nearly
operational, but procurement of identity cards has been suspended pending an investigation
into procurement irregularities. Other challenges are:
•

5

Enhancing the availability of long-term financing. The authorities are completing
the restructuring of the Uganda Development Bank (UDB) to enable it to provide
long-term financing for sound projects on a sustainable basis and without government
interference. The new Board is in place and the management team is being finalized
(completing a benchmark under the first PSI). The planned restructuring of the legal
framework for insurance and pension companies, together with the establishment of a
new supervisory body to cover these and any other financial institution not currently
supervised, would further contribute to expanding the supply of long-term financing
(MEFP, paragraph 28).

See the chapter on private sector credit in the accompanying selected issues paper.

17

•

Expanding financial services in rural areas. The authorities are developing a plan
that would facilitate the presence of member-owned Savings and Credit Cooperatives
(SACCOs) in each sub-county. The initiative would provide modest incentives to
newly formed SACCOs and bolster their accounting capabilities to safeguard
deposits. A legal framework defining the licensing and supervisory procedures for
SACCOs will also be developed (MEFP, paragraph 27).

27.
The staff emphasized the risks associated with policies to increase UDB lending
and some elements of the rural finance initiative. International experience with local
development banks is mixed, particularly in cases with subsidized lending and political
interference in lending decisions. It is therefore essential that the UDB in practice be
independently managed and that its operations be limited until a supervisory body has been
established. Similarly, the rural finance strategy must be closely monitored to safeguard
SACCO depositors, who are mostly poor farmers. Rural financing in developing countries
carries a high risk, since the income of farmers tends to be very sensitive to changes the
external environment. It will therefore be important to move slowly on the development of
SACCOs to gain the needed experience.
D. Regional Integration
28.
In the context of coordinated Article IV discussions for the three EAC countries,
the authorities and staff agreed that regional integration within the EAC presents an
opportunity to bolster growth prospects. EAC objectives include trade promotion and
eventually some form of monetary integration. The EAC customs union was established in
2005 to form a larger market and improve the framework for policy discussions. Trade tariffs
within the EAC have been reduced, yet the level of trade protection outside of the union
remains significant. Consequently, when the common external tariff is reviewed in 2009, the
efficiency benefits of a lower tariff will need to be weighed against possible revenue losses.
It was also agreed that coordinated investment incentives were desirable, but that rates
needed to be calibrated to each country’s circumstances. The longer-term objective of a
common currency arrangement will be difficult to achieve because of diversity in the EAC
economies.
29.
Enhanced tax incentives to attract more foreign investment are under
consideration (MEFP, paragraph 20). EAC partners Kenya and Tanzania provide tax
holidays to companies operating in Export Processing Zones (EPZs), and potential foreign
investors continue to press Uganda to provide similar benefits. While well-targeted and
administered incentives can make some difference, badly designed or overly generous
incentives such as significant cuts in corporate taxes could put revenue collection and macro
stability at risk. Moreover, they could lead to rent seeking behavior, especially if
implemented before the URA modernization program has been completed. The staff urged

18

caution, emphasized the desirability of close regional cooperation, and argued that the best
way forward would use the country’s scarce resources to improve infrastructure.
V. PSI—POLICIES FOR 2006/07
A. Macroeconomic Policies
30.
With the installation of more electricity generation capacity and recovery in
agriculture, macro conditions are projected to improve in 2006/07. Real GDP growth is
projected at 6¼ percent, while average underlying inflation is expected to climb temporarily
to about 6 percent for this period, reflecting increases in energy-related prices.
31.
The 2006/07 budget aims for continued fiscal consolidation in line with Uganda’s
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), albeit at an appropriately slower pace
than initially envisaged because of the electricity crisis. While the overall deficit, excluding
grants, is expected to widen by over 1 percent of GDP, excluding energy crisis spending the
deficit is projected to remain almost unchanged compared with 2005/06. Elements of the
fiscal program include:
•

An expected increase in tax collections by 0.4 percentage points of GDP on the basis
of efficiency gains and new measures introduced with the 2006/07 budget (increases
in excise taxes and fees, MEFP paragraph 13), despite downward pressure on
corporate taxes related to the electricity crisis.6 The efficiency gains will be achieved
through the ongoing modernization at the URA (MEFP, paragraph 19). Efficiency
gains have improved revenue mobilization since URA modernization began, and an
IMF technical assistance report estimates that the modernization could yield 1½ to
3 percent of GDP in revenue gains over the next five years. The Government’s
decision to address the problem of tax payment on government procurement should
also help boost tax compliance (MEFP, paragraph 16).

•

Domestic financed energy crisis spending of 1 percent of GDP, of which about onehalf is earmarked for a ring-fenced energy fund. Spending from this fund for the
Karuma project is expected to begin in 2007/08. MDRI debt relief, has been
earmarked for temporary subsidies to the energy sector. In addition, foreign financed
energy crisis spending amounts to about 0.3 percent of GDP.

6

The package is estimated to yield additional revenues of 0.3 percent of GDP. It includes a new tax treatment of
treasury bill interest income; a wider application of presumptive withholding taxes; and selected increases of
excise and import taxes.

19

•

An increase in primary school teacher salaries and provisions to start universal post
primary education.

•

Onetime spending for the October 2007 Commonwealth Heads of Government
Meeting.

•

Doubling of provisions for domestic arrears clearance to 0.8 percent of GDP, in line
with the strategy to eliminate all domestic arrears over the next 3-4 years.

•

Negative net domestic financing of about 1 percent of GDP.

32.
The monetary program will continue to target base money while aiming to bring
underlying inflation back to 5 percent or below. The BOU will accommodate the recent
rise in demand for currency associated with increased use of shillings for transactions
purposes in neighboring countries. At the same time, the base money program will be
sufficiently tight to target underlying average inflation below 5 percent for 2007/08,
notwithstanding an expected outturn for 2006/07 closer to 6 percent due to higher energy
prices.
33.
The BOU will continue to employ a mix of foreign exchange sales and open
market operations to sterilize foreign exchange inflows. It will primarily rely on the
former by targeting foreign exchange sales consistent with program targets for international
reserve accumulation. There is little scope for large-scale open market operations because of
the limited capacity of the domestic financial market to absorb government borrowing. In the
short term, however, the BOU is reluctant to rely solely on foreign exchange sales because
this could risk excess volatility in the relatively shallow foreign exchange market. The BOU
will intervene in the foreign exchange market only to smooth out short-term fluctuations and
refrain from countering macroeconomic fundamentals.
B. Structural Policies
34.
The PSI will support Uganda’s structural reform agenda outlined above,
including follow up on measures not completed under the first PSI. For the remainder of
the 2006/07 financial year, particular attention will be given to the following public
expenditure management issues:
•

Reducing the accumulation of new domestic arrears (MEFP, paragraph 15). The
Cabined has recently adopted a new arrears strategy, with the objectives to (i) clear
the existing stock of arrears within 3 years; and (ii) strengthen existing initiatives to
prevent new arrears. New arrears have been accumulated even under the CCS/IFMS
system, pointing to the lack of discipline. Thus, the new strategy focuses
appropriately on strict discipline and punitive actions against the accounting officers

20

involved in violating the CCS. The authorities will publish quarterly a “shame list” of
violators. Utility arrears would be addressed by sufficient budgetary allocation for
utility bills and prepayment systems, while new pension arrears will be prevented by
including recurrent pension among spending priorities that must be fully budgeted
for.
•

Completing the verification of pre-CCS arrears (mainly military pensions) and
continuing repayment of old arrears (U Sh 149 provision in the 2006/07 budget).

•

Strengthening the public expenditure management systems at the subnational level,
including implementation of IFMS for local governments (MEFP, paragraph 22).

•

Implementing the Debt Management Strategy aimed at preserving debt sustainability
by limiting borrowing to electricity, transportation, and water projects. The domestic
arrears strategy outlined above has been combined with strategies for domestic and
external borrowing into a single paper. The package is being reviewed by the IMF
and development partners before submission to cabinet and implementation.
C. Program Monitoring

35.
For monitoring performance under the three-year PSI, quantitative assessment
criteria, quantitative indicative targets, and structural assessment criteria and benchmarks
have been set (MEFP, Tables 1 and 2). The quantitative targets will be monitored on a semiannual basis and include net credit to the central government from the banking system, base
money, and net international reserves of the BOU. Targets to be monitored on a continuous
basis include nonaccumulation of external arrears, contracting or guaranteeing of new
nonconcessional external debt, and new short-term external debt. The standard provisions on
the exchange system and trade issues that apply to the use of the Fund’s financial resources
will apply as continuous assessment criteria under the PSI. The assessment dates for the first
year will be end-December 2006 and end-June 2007 and will be followed by reviews.
36.
At the request of the authorities, the safeguards assessment is being updated.
Staff determined that the BOU has strengthened its safeguards framework in most areas.
Recommendations have been made to improve the BOU's legal framework.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Uganda has a long record of strong macroeconomic performance and structural
reform. High economic growth and reasonable price stability have been supported by
responsible fiscal policy, prudent monetary management, a sound banking sector, and
substantial donor assistance. The economy has also been largely deregulated and most
parastatals privatized. These conditions have contributed to improved living standards for

21

Uganda’s fast-growing population and investments in health and education. In recent years,
however, per capita growth has tapered off and declines in poverty rates have stagnated. To
regain high, sustainable growth and rekindle poverty reduction, there is a need to scale up
investment in infrastructure and deepen the financial sector.
38.
The staff agrees that addressing Uganda’s infrastructure bottlenecks is a high
priority, but that careful attention must be paid to financing and macroeconomic
considerations. The government’s two-stage approach to the electricity crisis is already
paying off with the installation of temporary generators. The staff supports the financing
package for these, including higher tariffs and temporary government subsidies, and the
Bujagali hydroelectric dam public—private partnership. Other infrastructure projects—the
Karuma dam and roads—need to be well planned and financed to the extent possible through
grant scaling up, domestic savings, concessional borrowing, and in exceptional cases,
commercial loans. The DSA shows that there is room for borrowing. The cautious approach
outlined in the proposed debt strategy strikes an appropriate balance between the need to
borrow to address infrastructure needs and the risk of a rapid debt buildup.
39.
Uganda’s independently floating exchange rate regime continues to provide an
appropriate framework for macroeconomic management, but the effective value of the
Uganda shilling needs to be monitored carefully. In the near term, there is a risk that
demand for nontraded goods from donor assistance and infrastructure spending could lead to
a Dutch disease-type of real appreciation. The Bank of Uganda’s emphasis on foreign
exchange sales for liquidity management mitigates this risk. Successful implementation of
the envisaged infrastructure projects could cause a real exchange rate appreciation. But to the
extent that this is accompanied by higher productivity growth, this need not be a problem for
competitiveness. Effective project selection and implementation are key to achieve the
required rise in productivity.
40.
Uganda’s financial sector needs deepening to build on recent improvements in
the banking sector. Over the past several years, the government and the Bank of Uganda
have restructured the commercial banks and established first-rate supervision of deposit
institutions. However, sources for long-term capital need to be developed, and the
government is working on new supervision and legal arrangements for this sector. The
government has also restructured the UDB, which will now be operating on commercial
principles. In addition, the government has decided to assist member-owned savings societies
with technical support to bring savings accounts and eventually loans to underserved rural
areas. In both cases, it will be important for the government refrain from directing lending
that could undermine these institutions.
41.
Staff urges caution in introducing tax incentives to attract investments. The
experience from other countries is mixed and in the given situation, the best way forward for

22

Uganda would be to use the country’s scarce resources to improve its deteriorating
infrastructure.
42.
The staff welcomes Uganda’s efforts to advance regional integration. The EAC
customs union, established in 2005, should promote regional trade and provide a forum for
discussion of other trade policies and advancement of regional financial integration.
However, the long-term goal of a common currency arrangement will be difficult to achieve
due to the diversity of the EAC.
43.
The staff recommends completion of the first review under the PSI. It supports
the authorities’ request for waivers for the nonobservance of assessment criteria on
(i) submitting a new arrears strategy to cabinet (observed with a delay) and (ii) the provision
of U Sh 155 billion for domestic arrears repayment in the 2006/07 budget, which was
reduced by a small amount, U Sh 6 billion, in the final budget along with almost all
discretionary votes to help address the energy crisis. All quantitative assessment criteria were
observed. The authorities are continuing to address the slippages relative to several indicative
targets, including by paying old domestic arrears and identifying new measures to limit new
accumulations.
44.
The staff supports the authorities’ request for a new three-year PSI. Following
national elections in early 2006, the government has mapped out an economic program for
the next five years. The program aims at maintaining macroeconomic stability through
continued prudent fiscal, monetary, and exchange policies. As in the past, these would set the
basis for private sector-led growth.
45.
The main risks to the economic program are further delays in restoring
electricity capacity or shortfalls in financial support to the sector. Adverse external
developments—a drop in coffee or other export prices—could hurt the economy, but as in
the past would be manageable in the short run because of Uganda’s adequate reserves. And
domestically, food production will continue to be sensitive to unfavorable weather
conditions. Medium-term risks center on delays in hydroelectric dam construction, lackluster
progress in broadening the financial sector, undue government intervention in the economy,
and the failure to meet ambitious tax revenue target and maintain strict spending discipline.
These would postpone needed gains in productivity, divert resources from infrastructure
investment and education, and leave the economy unable to provide jobs for Uganda’s fast
growing population.
46.
Executive Board endorsement of Uganda’s request for support under the PSI would
automatically place Uganda on the 24-month Article IV consultation cycle.

APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT I
UGANDA: LETTER OF INTENT
Kampala, Uganda
November 29, 2006
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato:
On behalf of the Government of Uganda, I would like to inform you of the progress we have
made under our economic program backed by the International Monetary Fund’s Policy
Support Instrument (PSI) and request continued cooperation through a new three-year PSI.
All quantitative assessment criteria for the first review under the PSI were observed.
Notwithstanding the drought conditions which have reduced our hydroelectric generation
capacity sharply and the adverse effects of high oil prices, macroeconomic performance and
policies remained strong in 2005/06. Fiscal developments were broadly in line with the
program objective of fiscal consolidation, and monetary policy targets were met.
We made progress on the structural front as well. The assessment criterion on repayment of
old arrears was observed and the assessment criterion on submitting the arrears strategy
paper to Cabinet was observed albeit with delay. However, the assessment criterion on
provision for arrears payments in the 2006/07 budget was not observed. The payment
amount, however, fell short of the envisaged target by U Sh 6 billion, which we re-allocated
to meet the emergency in the energy sector.
In light of the progress achieved in the implementation of the program, the Government of
Uganda requests waivers for nonobservance of the assessment criteria on submission of the
arrears strategy paper to Cabinet and on provision for arrears payments in the 2006/07
budget.
To better align program targets with our medium-term development needs, the Government
of Uganda wishes that the current PSI be canceled immediately after the first review and that
a new three-year PSI better aligned to the fiscal year commence immediately thereafter. The
new PSI is described in the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial policies
(MEFP). The policies outlined in the MEFP are based on addressing Uganda’s infrastructure
needs in an environment of continued fiscal consolidation and implementation of the broader
policy agenda as envisaged in the Poverty Eradication Action Plan.

37

The Government of Uganda believes that the policies set forth in the MEFP are adequate to
achieve the objectives of our PSI program. Given our interest in macroeconomic stability, we
stand ready to take additional measures as may be necessary to achieve needed objectives.
Our PSI proposes assessment criteria for the performance target dates of end-December 2006
and end-June 2007 for the first and second reviews, which are expected to be completed by
end-April 2007 and end-October 2007, respectively We stand ready to work with the Fund
and other development partners in the implementation of our program and will consult in
advance should revisions be contemplated to the policies contained in the PSI.
The Government of Uganda authorizes the publication and distribution of this letter, its
attachments, and all reports prepared by Fund staff regarding the current PSI review and the
new PSI.

Sincerely yours,
/s/
Dr. Ezra Suruma
Minister of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development

38

APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT II
UGANDA: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
(JULY 2006–JUNE 2009)
1.
The Government of Uganda is committed to achieving sustained economic growth
and poverty reduction. The strategy to achieve these goals is set out in the Poverty
Eradication Action Plan (PEAP)1 and relies on prudent macroeconomic policies and
structural changes. The Government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are
cooperating on the economic program through a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI).
This memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) reviews the performance
under the current PSI and describes policies and targets for 2006/07 (July-June) and the
medium term.
I. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PSI
2.
The Government continued to implement sound economic policies during 2005/06.
Despite severe electricity shortages related to the drought and high fuel prices, these efforts
resulted in healthy economic growth and continued price stability.
3.
Real GDP growth is estimated at 5½ percent in 2005/06. The construction and
communications sectors maintained strong growth, while manufacturing and agriculture
output was subdued because of electricity shortages and difficult weather conditions,
respectively. Underlying (core) inflation, which excludes food prices, was just above
5 percent. International reserves of the central bank remained comfortable equivalent to
5½ months of import cover.
4.
Fiscal performance was in line with the program. The overall budget deficit,
excluding grants, continued its declining trend to 7.5 percent of GDP in 2005/06, below the
deficit targeted under the program. Tax collection continued to be strong because of reforms
at the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) and tax measures. While recurrent spending was
higher than envisaged, development spending were lower due to delays in donor-financed
projects. Despite efforts to improve expenditure management, domestic arrears continued to
accumulate. The Government, however, repaid more than U Sh 80 billion of outstanding
arrears.

1

Uganda’s latest PEAP and Joint Staff Advisory Note were considered by the Executive Board in July 2005
(Country Report No. 05/308). An implementation report is currently being prepared and is expected to be made
available to the IMF and other partners in mid-2007.

39

5.
The monetary program was on track. The target for base money growth was met.
A combination of tight fiscal policy and on the use of an appropriate instrument mix for
liquidity sterilization led to continued decline in interest rates, which in turn promoted a rise
in private sector credit. The banking sector remains healthy with a very low level of
nonperforming loans.
6.
Progress was made in implementing the structural program. The two structural
assessment criteria through June were met, albeit one with a small delay. The third was not
observed but by a small margin and with no material impact on the program.
II. OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES FOR THE THREE-YEAR PSI
7.
Our overriding economic objective is to regain the high rates of growth we
enjoyed in the mid-1990s. Continued macroeconomic stability is a necessary condition for
meeting this challenge. At the same time, scaled up infrastructure investment will be required
to raise productivity. Policies will therefore focus on macro stability, education through the
post primary level, modernizing Uganda’s infrastructure—particularly in electricity
generation, roads and railways—deepening the financial sector to bring down interest rates
for small and medium-size enterprises, strengthening Uganda’s business-friendly
environment, and providing better incentives for the private sector. In this way, Uganda can
achieve an increase in annual GDP growth to 6-7 percent, while maintaining low inflation.
8.
The macroeconomic outlook depends critically on a solution to the present
electricity crisis. Reflecting the current drought conditions and policy missteps, electricity
generating capacity has declined to about one-half of peak demand. The Government has
decided on a two-part solution to this problem: (i) in the near term, install temporary thermal
power generators to increase capacity by 100 MW, promote energy conservation, and reduce
the currently high distribution losses; and (ii) in the medium term, complete construction of
new hydropower plants at Bujagali and Karuma and then Aragon. These measures will result
in an increase in electricity tariffs. In addition, savings in other parts of the budget and
support from development partners are required to solve the electricity crisis.

40

III. THE POLICY AGENDA FOR 2006/07
9.
During 2006/07 the Government will focus on policies consistent with its
medium-term objectives. To this end, fiscal consolidation will continue, albeit at a slower
pace than initially envisaged because of the electricity crisis, monetary policy will target an
inflation rate of five percent or less, and structural measures will aim at building a
competitive economy, especially in rural areas. The Government will also begin to phase in
universal post-primary education.
10.
With the installation of additional electrical generators, macro conditions are
expected to improve in 2006/07. Real GDP growth is projected at about 6 percent, while
underlying inflation is projected to remain close to 5 percent. The external current account
deficit, excluding grants, is projected to increase, partly reflecting higher fuel imports.
A. FISCAL POLICY
11.
The Government’s fiscal priorities are to: (i) implement the approved 2006/07
budget; (ii) improve the monitoring and control of domestic arrears and reducing their stock;
and (iii) continue implementing the modernization program of the URA.
12.
The 2006/07 budget provides for emergency energy spending, new infrastructure
investment, and arrears repayment. The deficit, excluding grants and emergency energy
spending, is projected at 7.1 percent of GDP. The main expenditure initiatives include:
•

New electricity-related spending of 1.1 percent of GDP. About 0.5 percent of
GDP of the spending is earmarked for a new Energy Fund, which will be ringfenced for future dam construction. The remainder will be used to subsidize new
thermal generators.

•

Additional investment in roads.

•

A one-third increase in primary school teacher salaries and funding for the first
phase of universal post-primary education.

•

A near doubling in the budgeted allocation for domestic arrears payments to
U Sh 149 billion.

•

Provisions for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 2007.

13.
Domestic revenue collections are expected to rise by 0.4 percent of GDP on the
basis of efficiency gains at the URA and increases in some taxes and fees. Grants are

41

projected to remain at 6½ percent of GDP. Net external borrowing is projected at about
3 percent of GDP, implying virtually no need for domestic financing.
14.
The Government is committed to settling all domestic arrears, which amount to
about U Sh 610 billion. While this burden is very large, we plan to address our obligations
in upcoming budgets as an urgent priority by finding savings elsewhere in the budget. Our
overall strategy is to pay old arrears first from the central budget, while requiring spending
ministries to honor arrears incurred during the 2005/06 and 2006/07 budgets from their own
current resources. To reduce the stock of arrears, we will (see Table 1):
•

Repay U Sh 149 billion of verified obligations incurred before June 2004 as
provided in the 2006/07 approved budget. This allocation will be increased to
U Sh 300 billion and 330 billion in 2007/08 and 2008/09, respectively.

•

Within the allocations above, we will repay at least U Sh 100 billion of verified
pension arrears each year starting 2007/08. Government will announce a
payment schedule based on a priority ordering (by age of pensioner, widows
etc.). This timed approach recognizes the importance attached to honoring
pensioners but also our budgetary realities.

15.
Government will make an effort to avoid the accumulation of new arrears
through strict budget discipline and timely payment of pensions and wages. In addition,
implementation of CCS/IFMS will be enforced and strengthened. To this end, the
Government will:
•

enforce the strategy that was recently adopted by Cabinet. The Ministry of
Finance will also submit to Cabinet a paper restating the policy that requires
arrears accumulated in 2005/06 be paid out of spending ministry funds already
allocated for 2006/07;

•

continue to submit to Cabinet quarterly CCS reports prepared by the Treasury
Inspectorate, including details of ministries’ arrears; and

•

allocate sufficient funds for verified pension obligations.

With the help of the above measures, we will reduce the stock of CCS arrears accumulated
since end-June 2004 to a level of U Sh 25 billion by end-June 2007. These margins will
allow for unanticipated nonpayment of some commitments incurred for technical reasons.
16.
The Government has taken steps to address the problem of government tax on
its procurement. A special account has been set up in the BOU that will be used to make
government tax payments to the URA. The Government will ensure that sufficient funds are

42

allocated to this account, and will address any remaining problems of government tax
compliance as needed.
17.
The Government is embarking on public sector pay reform. The Ministry of
Public Service has produced a plan to revise public sector pay scales, to be implemented
when resources permit. Higher pay for government scientists and researchers is also under
review to retain them in Uganda The Ministry of Public service is also reviewing public
pensions, with due attention to the longer-term budgetary and financial market implications.
As with pay reform, changes in the public pension system will depend on the availability of
resources. To avoid new pension arrears, the authorities will verify the amount of pension
payments due and prepare a review of pension payment and accounting systems by May
2007.
18.
The Government will strengthen mechanisms to ensure value-for-money in the
implementation of public projects by strengthening the monitoring and evaluation
functions, as well as service delivery. Consequently, the government will prepare a detailed
plan to enhance the effectiveness of spending and service delivery.
19.
The reform process in URA will continue. In the coming years, the URA will
further increase domestic revenue collection, including by improving taxpayer registration;
centralization of data on custom, VAT, and income tax payers; more frequent audits of tax
compliance; and interconnectivity and sharing of information with countries in the region
about incoming trade traffic.
20.
The Government is reviewing investment incentives. Under consideration are
Export Processing Zones (EPZs) as implemented in neighboring countries and a reduction in
the corporate tax rate. Any new policy will be designed in line with the following principles:
(i) avoid a significant erosion of the tax base so that our objective of increasing the tax to
GDP ratio is achieved; (ii) cease granting discretionary tax preferences; (iii) implementation
will take place as budgetary resources permit and taking into account the URA’s capacity to
monitor compliance; (iv) work with EAC partners to harmonize tax incentives to the extent
possible so that mutually damaging tax competition is avoided.
B. DECENTRALIZATION
21.
The effective implementation of the fiscal decentralization strategy (FDS) is
intended to improve government services. The Government is currently strengthening the
public expenditure management systems at the subnational level, including IFMS
implementation and roll-out programs for local governments.

43

22.
We are currently considering ways to strengthen local government finances.
Abolition of the graduated tax, which was a key revenue source for local governments, has
been compensated by mainly by additional transfers from central government. Some urban
areas are collecting a local property tax to supplement central government transfers. The
Government is looking at other options, including ways to tax consumption, but the scope for
locally generated revenue in rural areas will remain limited until farmers are lifted out of
subsistence agriculture.
C. MONETARY AND FINANCIAL SECTOR POLICIES
23.
The authorities are committed to keeping annual average underlying inflation
below 5 percent through the reserve money targeting framework. For the remainder of
2006/07, the BOU will monitor base money closely in view of the recent increase in demand
for currency associated with increased use of the shilling for transactions purposes in the
neighboring countries. The BOU will continue to manage liquidity using an appropriate
instrument mix. Subject to the conditions in the foreign exchange market, BOU will continue
to use sales of foreign exchange to sterilize donor inflows.
24.
The BOU is pursuing the tools needed for a future inflation targeting
framework. A quarterly GDP index is under development by UBOS, as well as a new
measure of underlying (core) inflation that would more accurately capture inflationary
trends. The new CPI index will be monitored for a transition period of six months before it is
published. The BOU will also start producing on a six monthly basis a monetary conditions
report that would relate current economic trends to monetary operations and the inflation
target.
25.
The Government remains committed to a market-based financial system. All
deposit banks, excluding Post Bank of Uganda (PBU), have been privatized and, with the
establishment of a strong regulatory framework, we have a solid banking system that is
providing expanding credit to the private sector. We have recently licensed five micro
finance deposit-taking institutions (MDI) that are bringing services to smaller enterprises and
individuals who were not being served by the commercial banks.
26.
To further promote the availability of financial services and lowering borrowing
costs, several initiatives are planned. The recently established credit reference bureau
should help making loans more available. The effectiveness of the credit bureau will be
enhanced with the expected introduction of the national identity cards in 2007/08. Further,
the Government intends to implement the remaining key recommendations of the Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update, including:

44

•

strengthening the corporate insolvency regime, including the submission to
cabinet by end-June 2007 of new insolvency legislation that gives creditors the
right to commence bankruptcy procedures;

•

strengthening institutional capacity of the commercial court and of Official
Receiver; and

•

addressing deficiencies in the land and company registries.

27.
Improving the availability of financial services in rural areas is an important
objective. Such services are being provided by member owned Savings and Credit
Cooperatives (SACCOs), but we are concerned that they are not adequately supervised and
lack basic accounting skills. To safeguard member deposits in these institutions, we are
considering options to regulate SACCOs. In the meantime, we will ask Postbank Uganda
(PBU) to assist by bolstering accounting capabilities of SACCOs. Aside from this limited
assistance, we expect SACCOs will be self-supporting, and any lending to SACCOs for on
lending will be based on existing initiatives and resources already allocated in the 2006/07
budget and in the MTEF. We will ensure that these actions are consistent with the existing
regulatory and supervisory framework as contained in the Financial Institutions Act 2004 and
its implementing regulations.
28.
Further development of the nonbank financial sector will make long-term loans
more available for housing and business expansion. Over time, long-term capital might
also be used to finance infrastructure projects. Government has approved a plan to strengthen
the Uganda Development Bank (UDB) so it can be operated along commercial principles,
including providing loans that carry market-based interest rates. Government will not
interfere with or direct activities of the UDB. We also plan to restructure the legal and
regulatory framework for insurance and private pension companies, as these are the natural
source of long-term credit. The new supervisory body, which will be established before endDecember 2007, would cover insurance and pension companies, development banks
(including UDB), the NSSF, and any financial institution not under the statutory supervision
of the BOU. The new environment will ensure that pensions and other savings entrusted to
these companies are prudently managed.
D. OTHER STRUCTURAL REFORMS
29.
The Government is addressing the shortage in power generation with urgency.
The Government is currently finalizing the bid process and financing arrangements for the
Bujagali hydropower project and intends to start the planning process for the construction of
a second hydropower project at Karuma. Until the Bujagali plant becomes operational in
2010/11, our generating capacity will be increased through more expensive thermal power

45

generation. With the end users covering only part of the higher costs of this intermediate
measure, the Government will continue subsidizing the power sector to allow for a more
gradual increase in electricity tariffs. However, all subsidies will expire after the
commissioning of the Bujagali plant. The investments in the power sector will be financed as
follows:
•

The envisaged near-term measures to expand thermal power generation would
cause an annual revenue shortfall in the power sector of about US$120 through
2010/11, assuming that oil prices stay at current levels and electricity tariffs at
pre-June 2006 levels. The revenue shortfall would be financed by a combination
of higher tariffs and direct government support, of which a part will be provided
by the World Bank. The average tariff was increased by 37 percent in June 2006
and by about 42 percent in November 2006 (a completed prior action). These
adjustments are in line with the ERA tariff path that is consistent with a fully
funded electricity sector and the approved 2006/07 budget.

•

The Bujagali hydropower plant is expected to be financed through a combination
of private and public funds. The Government’s contribution will be (i) loan
guarantees of about US$400 million issued to the commercial lenders; and
(ii) construct the transmission line linking the project to the existing grid (a
US$50 million investment to be financed by the African Development Bank).
The final agreements for the project are expected to be signed early 2007.

•

With respect to the Karuma hydropower plant, the financing arrangements are
yet to be finalized. The cost of the project is estimated at about US$400 million.
Financing options include a combination of (i) a reallocation within
development spending; (ii) additional donor support; and (iii) use of the Energy
Fund and other government deposits.

Commercially viable oil reserves have recently been discovered in Uganda. The
Government is implementing internationally recognized accounting, auditing, and financial
reporting procedures in the development and production stages. The Government is
committed to manage these resources transparently and consistent with macroeconomic
stability.
III. MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC POLICIES
30.
Fiscal space has been provided in the medium term to finance investments in
infrastructure, including the Karuma hydropower project. The fiscal policy framework
aims therefore to reduce further the fiscal deficit, excluding grants and energy-related
spending, and increase domestic revenue. This strategy will help to crowd-in the private

46

sector, and thereby provide a boost to export and private investment performance. The
success of this strategy will depend on strong annual increases in government revenues,
notably through an improvement in tax administration, coupled with a better allocation and
efficiency of expenditures. In line with the MTEF, the Government will target an increase in
domestic revenue of 1.5 percent of GDP during the three-year program.
31.
The Government is committed to avoiding the accumulation of an unsustainable
debt burden over the medium term. To this end, the Government recently adopted
guidelines on external debt management. These guidelines establish clear procedures for
contracting, managing, and monitoring external debt according to best practices and selecting
high productivity projects. The recent implementation of the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) resulted in a sharp decrease of Uganda’s external debt. The Government
will continue to pursue prudent fiscal and monetary policies and exercise caution in
contracting external debt by using grants and then concessional loans. Nonconcessional
borrowing or loan guarantees will be limited to the power sector.

APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT III
UGANDA: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
A. Introduction
1.
This memorandum defines the targets described in the memorandum of economic
and financial policies (MEFP) for the first two years of the July 2006–June 2009 financial
program that would be supported by the IMF Policy Support Instrument (PSI), and sets
forth the reporting requirements under the instrument.
B. Base Money
2.
Base money is defined as the sum of currency issued by Bank of Uganda (BOU)
and the commercial banks’ deposits in the BOU. The commercial bank deposits include
the statutory required reserves and excess reserves held at the BOU and are net of the
deposits of closed banks at the BOU and Development Finance Funds (DFF) contributed
by commercial banks held at the BOU. The base money limits will be cumulative changes
from the daily average of June 2006 to the daily average of December 2006, March 2007
and June 2007, and cumulative changes from the daily average of June 2007 to the daily
average of June 2008.
C. Net Claims on the Central Government by the Banking System
3.
Net claims on the central government (NCG) by the banking system is defined as
the difference between the outstanding amount of bank credits to the central government
and the central government's deposits with the banking system, excluding deposits in
administered accounts and project accounts with the banking system, including the
central bank. Credits comprise bank loans and advances to the government and holdings
of government securities and promissory notes. Central government’s deposits with the
banking system include the full amount of IMF MDRI. NCG will be calculated based on
data from balance sheets of the monetary authority and commercial banks as per the
monetary survey. The quarterly limits on the change in NCG by the banking system will
be cumulative beginning end-June in the previous fiscal year.
D. Net International Reserves of the Bank of Uganda
4.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the BOU are defined for program monitoring
purpose as reserve assets of the BOU net of short-term external liabilities of the BOU.
Reserve assets are defined as external assets readily available to, and controlled by, the
BOU and exclude pledged or otherwise encumbered external assets, including, but not
limited to, assets used as collateral or guarantees for third-party liabilities. Short-term
external liabilities are defined as liabilities to nonresidents, of original maturities less than
one year, contracted by the BOU and include outstanding IMF purchases and loans.

50

5.
For program-monitoring purposes, reserve assets and short-term liabilities
(excluding liabilities to the IMF) at the end of each test period will be calculated in U.S.
dollars by converting reserve assets measured in Uganda shillings, as reported by the
BOU, using the end-month Uganda shilling per U.S. dollar exchange rate. The U.S. dollar
value of outstanding purchases and loans from the IMF will be calculated by converting
the outstanding SDR amount reported by the Finance Department of the IMF using the
U.S. dollar per SDR exchange rate at the end of each quarter.
E. Ceiling on Domestic Budgetary Arrears of the Central Government
6.
The stock of domestic payment arrears under the Commitment Controls System
(CCS) will be monitored on a quarterly basis. Domestic payments arrears under the CCS
are defined as the sum of all bills that have been received by a central government
spending unit or line ministry delivered in that quarter, and for which payment has not
been made within 30 days under the recurrent expenditure budget (including rents and
utilities) or the development expenditure budget. For the purpose of program monitoring,
the monthly CCS reports, which will include arrears accumulated at IFMIS and nonIFMIS sites, prepared by the Treasury Inspectorate will be used to monitor arrears.
Arrears can be cleared in cash or through debt swaps.
7.
The payments of pre-CCS, non-CCS, and CCS arrears accumulated up to endJune 2004 (“group A arrears”) are covered by specific budget allocations for 2006/07 and
2007/08. The program ceiling on the stock of CCS arrears only covers accumulation of
arrears after end-June 2004 (“group B arrears”). According to the verified report prepared
by the Internal Audit Office, this stock of arrears is estimated to U Sh 27 billion as of
June 2005.
F. Adjusters
8.
The NIR target is based on program assumptions regarding budget support,
assistance provided under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), and external debt-service payments. The NCG
target, in addition to being based on the aforementioned assumptions, is also based on
assumptions regarding domestic nonbank financing of central government fiscal
operations.
9.
The Uganda shilling equivalent of budget support (grants and loans) plus HIPC
Initiative assistance in the form of grants on a cumulative basis from July 1 of the fiscal
year is presented under Schedule A. The ceiling on the cumulative increase in NCG will
be adjusted downward (upward), and the floor on the cumulative increase in NIR of the
BOU will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount by which budget support,
grants and loans, plus HIPC Initiative and MDRI assistance, exceeds (falls short of) the
projected amounts.

G. External Borrowing Contracted or Guaranteed by the Central Government,
Statutory Bodies, or the Bank of Uganda, and Arrears
13.
The assessment criterion on short-term debt refers to contracting or guaranteeing
external debt with original maturity of one year or less by the government or the Bank of
Uganda. Excluded from this assessment criterion are normal import-related credits. The
definition of “debt” is set out in paragraph 17.
14.
The program includes a ceiling on new nonconcessional borrowing with
maturities greater than one year contracted or guaranteed by the government, statutory
bodies, or the BOU.10 Nonconcessional borrowing is defined as loans with a grant
element of less than 35 percent, calculated using average commercial interest rates
10

Contraction is defined as approval by a resolution of Parliament as required in Section 20(3) of the Public
Finance and Accountability Act, 2003

53

references (CIRRs) published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). In assessing the level of concessionality, the 10-year average
CIRRs should be used to discount loans with maturities of at least 15 years, while the 6month average CIRRs should be used for loans with shorter maturities. To both the 10year and 6-month averages, the following margins for differing payment periods should
be added: 0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years; 1 percent for 15–19
years; 1.15 percent for 20–25 years; and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more. The ceiling on
nonconcessional external borrowing or guarantees is to be observed on a continuous
basis. The coverage of borrowing includes financial leases and other instruments giving
rise to external liabilities, contingent or otherwise, on nonconcessional terms. Excluded
from the limits are changes in indebtedness resulting from refinancing credits and
rescheduling operations, and credits extended by the IMF. For the purposes of the
program, arrangements to pay over time obligations arising from judicial awards to
external creditors that have not complied with the HIPC Initiative do not constitute
nonconcessional external borrowing. For the purposes of the program, the Bujagali
project is defined as the hydroelectric dam and related equipment located at the dam site.
15.
The definition of debt, for the purposes of the limit, is set out in point 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt (Executive Board’s
Decision No. 12274-(00/85), August 24, 2000). It not only applies to the debt as defined
in Point 9 of the Executive Board decision, but also to commitments contracted or
guaranteed for which value has not been received. The definition of debt set forth in No. 9
of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund
Arrangements reads as follows:
(a) For the purpose of this guideline, the term "debt" will be understood
to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a
contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of
assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to
make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or
services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge
the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts
can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows: (i) loans,
i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of
an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future
(including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers'
credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully
collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the
buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements); (ii) suppliers' credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier
permits the obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on
which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases,
i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has

54

the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are
usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while
the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the
guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of
all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or
maintenance of the property. (b) Under the definition of debt set out in
point 9(a) above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages
arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation
that constitutes debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not
considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not
give rise to debt.
16.
The ceiling on the accumulation of new external payments arrears is zero. This
limit, which is to be observed on a continuous basis, applies to the change in the stock of
overdue payments on debt contracted or guaranteed by the government, the BOU, and
statutory bodies11 from their level at end-June 2006. It comprises those external arrears
reported by the Trade and External Debt Department of the BOU, the Macro Department
of the Ministry of Finance that cannot be rescheduled because they were disbursed after
the Paris Club cutoff date.
H. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements
17.
The authorities will inform the IMF staff in writing at least ten business days
(excluding legal holidays in Uganda or in the United States) prior to making any changes
in economic and financial policies that could affect the outcome of the financial program.
Such policies include but are not limited to customs and tax laws (including tax rates,
exemptions, allowances, and thresholds), wage policy, and financial support to public and
private enterprises. The authorities will similarly inform the IMF staff of any
nonconcessional external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government, the BOU, or
any statutory bodies, and any accumulation of new external payments arrears on the debt
contracted or guaranteed by these entities. The authorities will on a regular basis submit
information to IMF staff with the frequency and submission time lag as indicated in
Table 1. The information should be mailed electronically to AFRUGA746@IMF.ORG .

11

This definition is consistent with the coverage of public sector borrowing defined by the Fund (includes
the debt of the general government, monetary authorities, and entities that are public corporations which are
subject to the control by government units, defined as the ability to determine general corporate policy or by
at least 50 percent government ownership).

Safeguards Assessments

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Uganda (BoU) was subject
to a safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement, which was approved
on September 13, 2002. Since that assessment, the BoU has strengthened the safeguards
framework, including timely finalization and publication of the financial statements,
establishing a functioning audit committee, regularly reconciling monetary data, and
formalizing the follow-up of implementation of internal and external audit
recommendations. The authorities requested an update of the safeguards assessment in
the context of the PSI. A mission took place in September 2006; staff determined that the
BOU has strengthened its safeguards framework in most areas
X. Exchange Rate Arrangement
The official exchange rate is determined on the interbank market for foreign exchange.
As of October 31, 2006, the official exchange rate was U Sh 1,819.8 per U.S. dollar. The
exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions. Uganda is classified as an independently floating
exchange rate regime.
XI. Article IV Consultation
The Executive Board concluded the last Article IV consultation on February 14, 2005.
The next Article IV consultation with Uganda will be held on the 24-month cycle, subject
to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.
In February and April 2001, joint World Bank/Fund missions visited Kampala as part of
the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). A final report was provided to the
authorities in November 2001, and an MFD mission discussed the report with the
authorities during the Article IV consultation discussion in November 2002, and the
Financial System Stability Assessment was prepared for Board discussion in February
2003. In November 2004, a joint World Bank/Fund missions visited Kampala for a FSAP
update.

60

XII. Policy Support Instrument (PSI)
Uganda initiated a 16-month PSI with the Fund in January 2006.
XIII. Technical Assistance
Uganda has received extensive technical assistance from the Fund in recent years.4
An FAD mission visited Kampala in April 1998 to advise the authorities on public
service pension reform issues, and another mission visited Kampala in September 1998 to
assist the authorities in improving customs administration procedures. A resident advisor
in the area of local government budgeting began a six-month assignment in August 1998,
which was subsequently extended to October 1999. An FAD resident advisor on
budgeting and commitment control commenced a six-month assignment in November
1998, which was extended until June 2002. In October 2000, an FAD mission visited
Kampala to provide technical assistance in tax policy and administration. A joint
Bank/Fund TA mission visited Kampala in October 2003 to help harmonize tax
investment incentives among the member countries of the EAC. An FAD TA mission on
tax administration also visited Uganda in October 2004 to develop a comprehensive
reform plan for the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA), followed by visits in April 2005
and April–May 2006. Two FAD resident advisors (coordinated through AFRITAC-East)
are currently in the field assisting the implementation of a CCS at the local government
level and the Fiscal Decentralization Strategy.
A STA multisector statistics mission visited Kampala in December 1998 to conduct a
comprehensive assessment of Uganda’s macroeconomic statistics, including data
compilation and dissemination, and to provide recommendations for improvements.
Follow-up STA missions in national accounts and money and banking statistics visited
Kampala in March–April 2000 to examine the status of implementation of the previous
recommendations. A STA mission on government financial statistics (GFS) visited
Uganda in December 2001 to assist authorities in improving fiscal reporting by
establishing regular reporting systems that are aligned with the GFS Manual 2001, as
well as ensuring consistency within monetary sector data for the government. A followup mission on GFS visited Uganda in May 2003. A mission visited Uganda during
February–March 2002 to review balance of payment statistics and the progress in
implementing the recommendations of the multisector mission of 1998 and of the national
accounts mission of 2000 with respect to the measurement of goods imports. A follow-up
mission on balance of payments statistics visited Uganda in August 2003. Uganda is
participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and its metadata were
initially posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board in May 2000. A
STA mission was in Uganda during February 2005 to prepare a data ROSC.
4

For a description of technical assistance provided prior to 1998, see the staff report for Uganda’s request
for a three-year arrangement under the PRGF (Country Report No. 02/213).

61

Since the 2001 FSAP, MFD’s TA to Uganda has focused on liquidity management,
exchange rate intervention, central bank accounting and auditing, and banking
supervision. The authorities have effectively used TA advice on these topics, and they
have made good use of an MFD resident advisor, who took up her initial appointment in
mid-July 2001. The advisor was fully integrated into the supervision function and has
been involved in all aspects of the work, including participating in on-site examinations.
Her contract was extended through July 2004, and the authorities are now in the process
of selecting a new MFD resident advisor to follow up on the progress made so far. MFD
has fielded two TA missions (July 2001 and January 2002) to assist the authorities with
liquidity management and address the problems of interest rate volatility and exchange
rate interventions. The BOU has started implementing the recommendations made in the
report, and now clearly separates sterilization operations and liquidity management;
however, they are still having problems with interest rate and exchange rate volatility and
have requested follow-up TA in this area. In March and September–October 2002, MFD
provided TA to improve central bank accounting and the Bank of Uganda’s accounting
manual. A TA evaluation visit was conducted in June 2003, and an MFD mission
following up on monetary and exchange rate operations, public debt, and liquidity
management was conducted in March 2004. An FSAP update mission was conducted in
November 2004 and focused on access, outreach, and stability issues, which also updated
progress made since the last FSAP. Finally, a TA mission on enhancing the effectiveness
of monetary policy implementation and developing financial markets was conducted in
August 2005.
XIV. Future Technical Assistance Priorities
The priorities for Fund technical assistance in the next few years will be in the areas of
tax administration, public expenditure management, especially control and monitoring of
public arrears at both central and local government levels, monetary and exchange rate
management, bank supervision, national accounts statistics, reporting standards for
government finance statistics, monetary and balance of payments statistical reporting,
central bank accounting, and audit and debt management.
XV. Resident Representative
The Fund has maintained a resident representative in Uganda since July 1982.

62

APPENDIX III—UGANDA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUp
(As of August 15, 2006)
I. PARTNERSHIP IN UGANDA’S DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
1.
Uganda’s development strategy is based on the revised Poverty Eradication Action
Plan (PEAP)1 launched in May 2005. This medium-term national planning framework guides
government policy both at the sectoral and district level and has been used as the basis for
Uganda’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper presented to the Boards of the World Bank and
IMF in May 2000. The revised PEAP, along with a Joint-Staff Advisory Note were presented
to the Boards of the World Bank and IMF in June 2005.
2.
The revised PEAP aims at accelerating economic growth, reducing poverty and
inequality, and improving human development. It has five pillars: (i) economic management;
(ii) production, competitiveness and income; (iii) security, conflict-resolution, and disaster
management; (iv) good governance; and (v) human development.
3.
The Fund and the Bank support the government of Uganda to implement the revised
PEAP. In February 2006, the Fund’s support to Uganda changed into a Policy Support
Instrument (PSI), following completion of the second three-year arrangement under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility. Under the PSI, the Fund continues to support
macroeconomic and financial sector stability, which falls under the first pillar in the revised
PEAP. In addition, the Fund addresses structural issues in tax administration, budget
management, local government finances, financial sector deepening, and development of
statistics systems. On the other hand, the Bank is supporting the implementation of revised
PEAP through structural and sectoral reforms. The Bank’s support comprises budget and
project support, with an equal emphasis on analytic work and technical assistance.
II. BANK GROUP STRATEGY
5.
The World Bank's assistance to Uganda is elaborated in the Uganda Joint Assistance
Strategy (UJAS). The UJAS is a direct response to the Government of Uganda’s revised
PEAP, and puts into practice the principles of the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.
The strategy was prepared in 2005 by the World Bank and a group of six development
partners, including the African Development Bank, the UK’s Department for International
Development, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Because it represents the core
strategy of the development partners for 2005–09, other partners are encouraged to join.
1

The PEAP, first prepared in 1997 is a dynamic document and was revised in 2000 and 2004.

63

Consequently, Austria, Denmark, the European Commission and Ireland have signed up to the
strategy. The UJAS was approved by the Bank’s Board in January 2006.
6.
Within the UJAS, the Bank emphasizes direct budget support by financing the PEAP
through annual Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs). The first Poverty reduction
Support Credit (PRSC1) for Uganda was approved by the Bank’s Board in May 2001. Since
then, the country has received four more PRSCs. The fifth PRSC for US$135 million was
approved by the Bank’s Board on January 17, 2006 and was the first to support the revised
PEAP. Whereas previous PRSCs were for $150 million, PRSC5 was reduced by 10 percent to
reflect the Bank’s concerns about expenditure overruns in the public administration budget.
For future PRSCs, the Bank will work with government to ensure that such overruns do not
escalate into fiscal indiscipline.
7.
Another form of direct budget support is debt relief. In addition to the Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) initiatives2, Uganda is eligible for 100 percent debt relief under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MIDRI) approved by the World Bank Board on March 28,
2006. The initiative, which became effective July 01, 2006, will cancel Uganda's IDA debt
amounting to US $ 2.7 billion.
8.
Specific Bank support to the five pillars of the revised PEAP, through a combination of
lending and analytical activities, is outlined in paragraphs 9-15.
9.
PEAP/PRSP Pillar 1—Economic Management: Consistent with the objective of
macro stability with rapid private sector-led growth, the Bank’s activities under this pillar aim
to support government to broaden the domestic revenue base, strengthen public expenditure
and budgetary management, streamline the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system to
facilitate gradual fiscal decentralization, enhance the results orientation of sector expenditure
programs, strengthen monitoring and evaluation, and maintain external debt at sustainable
levels. In addition, the Bank supports the development of a legal and regulatory framework for
pensions, capital markets and the insurance sector to increase access to term finance.
10.
PEAP/PRSP Pillar 2—Enhancing production, competitiveness, and incomes:
Under this pillar, the Bank’s activities aim to promote an efficient and competitive private
sector by improving the investment climate; and to increase efficiency in agricultural, fisheries
and forestry production while preserving environmental sustainability. The Bank is, therefore,
supporting government to improve the investment climate to achieve four main objectives:
(i) strengthening the policy and regulatory environment (i.e. the medium term competitiveness
2

64

strategy, investment code, export processing zone law, new companies act); (ii) building
infrastructure (e.g. industrial park and power generation stations); (iii) strengthening
institutions (e.g., Uganda Investment Authority, commercial courts, land registry, etc.); and
(iv) supporting small and medium term enterprises through business development services and
increased access to finance.
11.
The Bank’s support for agricultural production is through a demand-driven National
Agricultural Advisory Services Project and the second Agricultural Research and Training
Project. The second Lake Victoria Environmental Protection project, the second Protected
Areas Management and Sustainable Use project and the second Environmental Management
and Capacity Building project, also support the sector to address sustainability issues.
Furthermore, the PRSCs support the implementations of government’s plan for modernization
of agriculture, from which several undertakings are prior actions.
12.
The Bank also supports infrastructure development, in particular power, roads and
other utilities. In the power sector, the Fourth Power project aims to increase power supply and
strengthen capacity to manage reform, while the Energy for Rural Transformation project
intends to develop Uganda’s rural energy and information technology. Further, the Bank will
support both the proposed thermal generation extension to address short term capacity deficits
and the $600 million Private Power Generation (Bujagali) project through private public
partnerships. In the road sector, the Bank supports the government’s ten-year Road
Development Program through a series of road sector projects. The reform of other utilities and
divestiture of the remaining public enterprises have been supported by the Privatization and
Utility Sector Reform Project. On a regional basis, the Bank advises on implementation of the
Nile Basin Initiative.
13.
PEAP/PRSP Pillar 3—Security Conflict-Resolution and Disaster Management. To
reduce regional disparities, the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF) targets the
poor districts of northern and eastern Uganda, which are yet to benefited from economic
reform and liberalization. Once the conflict ends, the Bank will scale-up NUSAF to include
reconstruction works. Furthermore, the Bank is undertaking analytical work on the North
including: development of a peace, recovery and development plan, risk and vulnerability
assessment, public expenditure review, land-use PSIA, and concept note on development and
productivity in the North.
14.
PEAP/PRSP Pillar 4—Good Governance. The Bank supports the government’s
efforts to increase efficiency of commercial justice courts; to improve governance, especially
to fight corruption through increased accountability and transparency; and to implement broadbased public sector reform. This support is through the PRSCs, in which a variety of crosscutting public sector management reforms are implemented. These include reforms in public

65

procurement, financial management, public sector pay, payroll and personnel management,
and anti-corruption legislation. Work on financial accountability through the second Economic
and Financial Management Project and Local Government Development Project (LGDP)
complements these efforts. Furthermore, the Public Service Performance Enhancement project
aims at transforming the public service to make it affordable, efficient and accountable.
15.
PEAP/PRSP Pillar 5—Human Development. The Bank supports the government’s
efforts to improve access to, and quality of, education, healthcare, and water and sanitation
services, primarily through the PRSCs work within sector programs. In addition, the Bank’s
HIV/AIDs Control Project supports local initiatives to provide prevention, treatment, and care.
Support under this pillar is critical to furthering Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
III. BANK PORTFOLIO
16.
As of June 30, 2006, Uganda’s portfolio included 22 Bank-supported projects, with
total net commitments of US$1,044 million. US$601 million of this amount was not yet
disbursed.
17.
For the fiscal year 2006/07, projects in the pipeline include PRSC6 (US$150 million),
Thermal Power Generation project (US$75 million), Kampala Institutional and Infrastructure
Development project (US$ 32 million), Private Power Generation project (US$55 million),
Local Government Service Delivery (US$100 million), second Lake Victoria project
(US$ 40million), and Kampala Solid Waste Management project(US$4.0 million). In fiscal
year 2005/06, PRSC5(US $135 million), Public Service Enhancement Program
(US $ 70 million), the East African Trade and Transport facilitation project(US$ 27 million),
Millennium Science Initiative Project (US$10 million) were approved by the Board. In fiscal
year 2004/05, PRSC 5 (US$150 million grant), Road Development Program Phase 3
(US$107.6 million, of which US$40 million is grant), and Private Sector Export
Competitiveness Project Phase 2 (US$70 million), totaling US$327.6 million, were approved
by the IDA Board.
IV. BANK-FUND COLLABORATION IN SPECIFIC AREAS
18.
The IMF and World Bank staffs collaborate their support to the government’s reforms.
Specific areas of this collaboration include:
•

Poverty reduction strategy paper - The Bank and Fund are assisting government to
implement its poverty reduction strategy. The staffs of the two institutions prepare joint
assessments of the Poverty Reduction Status Paper(PRSP) or the PRSP progress
reports.

66

•

Debt sustainability analysis - The staffs of the Bank and Fund continue collaborating
on issues related to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries and the Multilateral Debt
Relief initiatives and prepare joint debt sustainability analysis(DSA) for the country.
The Uganda DSA, last updated in November 2005, will be updated during 2006/07.

•

Public expenditure management - The Bank, Fund, and other donors support
government’s institutional and policy reforms to improve public expenditure
management. The Fund is leading the dialogue on fiscal policy, while the Bank is
focusing on strategic expenditure allocation and efficiency of public expenditures
through public expenditure reviews and PRSC dialogue. The staffs of the two
institutions prepare annual reports on the HIPC Initiative poverty-reducing spending
and evaluate the quality of public expenditure management in Uganda. The Bank and
other donors support the implementation of the action plan for the Country Integrated
Financial Assessment report prepared in 2004/05.

•

Financial sector reform - The Bank and Fund completed a Financial Sector
Assessment Program update in March 2005. This joint assessment forms the basis for
Bank and Fund support to government implement additional financial sector reforms.
In addition to PRSCs dialogue, the Bank will support these reforms through a demanddriven capacity building component of the Public Service Capacity Enhancement
Project. The work is closely coordinated with the Fund PSI support, which focuses on
enhancing supervisory capacity for the financial sector and selected aspects of pension
reform.

•

Trade reforms - The Bank and Fund are working closely to assist Uganda in
establishing a pro-growth trade framework. Both institutions are involved in the
dialogue on trade reforms in the context of the East African Community. In 2005/06,
the Bank completed a diagnostic trade integrated study. The Bank will support the
implementation of measures identified in the study to address both external and internal
constraints to trade. Such efforts will supplement those in the East African Trade and
Transport Facilitation project, which becomes effective in 2006/07.

Questions may be referred to Dino Merotto, Country Economist, Tel. (202) 458-1987.

67
APPENDIX IV—UGANDA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Uganda participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS); its metadata were
initially posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board in May 2000. Partial
updates of real and external sector metadata were completed in August 2005.
An STA mission visited Uganda in February 2005 to prepare a data ROSC and the results
were published in July 2006. It assessed data compilation and dissemination practices against
international standards in national accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of
payments statistics; the monetary and financial statistics were not assessed.
Real sector statistics
The 2005 data ROSC mission found that the national accounts do not follow up-to-date
international standards and have a limited scope, but do use international classifications and
a generally adequate base for recording. The mission recommended undertaking an
agricultural census supplemented with annual sample surveys and an economy-wide business
survey at least every five years, supplemented with annual sample surveys. Compilation of
the consumer price index conforms to international standards, but is of limited scope; the
mission recommended expansion of coverage to rural areas, along with updating the
reference and weight base to 2003–04. No wholesale or producer price indices or labor
market information are produced. Technical assistance in real sector statistics is provided
through the regional center (Africa Regional Technical Assistance Center East, AFRITAC
East).
Government finance statistics
The 2001 Government Finance Statistics (GFS) technical assistance mission discussed
several data classification issues with the Ministry of Finance and proposed a summary
framework for reporting according to the GFS Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) framework. A
2003 follow-up mission identified some weaknesses in the proposed new chart of accounts.
A revised chart of accounts was implemented for use by all budgetary central government
and local government units from July 1, 2004. Uganda commenced reporting GFS data
compiled according to the GFSM 2001 framework for the 2004 GFS Yearbook. However,
data coverage is limited to the budgetary central government and local government accounts
and excludes the activities of extrabudgetary central government units and the National
Social Security Fund. The data ROSC mission echoed these findings and recommended
migration to the GFSM 2001.
Monetary and financial statistics
In February 2006, a monetary and financial statistics mission found that Uganda’s monetary
statistics are basically sound from the point of view of data integrity and timeliness.

68
However, there are a number of areas where improvements are needed to align the data with
the recommendations of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
The detailed balance sheet of the Bank of Uganda (BOU) is well designed for producing the
analytical data; however, (1) reverse repos between the BOU and commercial banks are not
classified as advances to banks, (2) there is some inconsistency among departments in the
BOU in determining which foreign assets belong in reserve assets; (3) loans and advances
are presented net of provisions for loans losses; (4) the proper classification of many
positions of the Development Finance Department is difficult because the main classification
used in the accounts is the original source of funds, rather than which unit the BOU has a
claim on or liability; and (5) the economic and accounting nature of administered and
internally managed funds of the BOU is unclear.
The principal issue with regard to the quality of the data of other depository corporations
(ODCs) is the exclusion of two classes of depository corporations from the monetary survey.
At present, the monetary survey covers the balances of the BOU and the commercial banks
only. However, there are also seven credit institutions and four microfinance institutions that
accept deposits. The 2006 mission, therefore, recommended that the depository corporations
sector be defined to include these deposit-taking corporations, and that their deposits be
included in the monetary aggregates.
The mission developed a detailed draft of the Standardized Report Form (SRF) for the BOU.
This included recommended classifications for all items in the BOU balance sheet, and
annotated commentary on these items. With respect to the SRF for ODCs, the mission
reviewed a draft of the new report for collection of data from ODCs, and suggested further
revisions that were necessary for compilation of data in accordance with the MFSM.
External sector statistics
The ROSC mission found that the balance of payments statistics broadly follow the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5), but that there are some departures from
recommended definitions, scope, and classifications. The mission urged completion of the
conversion to the BPM5 and the development of new source data and estimation techniques
in the following areas: exports of freight and imports of passenger transportation,
compensation of employees, direct investment abroad, portfolio investment and financial
derivatives. International trade data could be improved by incorporation of results from the
Survey of Informal Cross-Border Trade and greater use of trade partner country data sources.

APPENDIX V—UGANDA: JOINT BANK-FUND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
Having achieved debt sustainability, the authorities are planning to address long-overdue
infrastructure constraints aiming at reaching high economic growth. The Joint DSA assesses
the challenges and trade-offs of increasing public investment and maintaining the hardachieved debt sustainability.
1.
Uganda has achieved debt sustainability by implementing sound macroeconomic
policies and receiving debt relief. The HIPC and MDRI debt relief have improved
Uganda’s debt sustainability outlook substantially by leading to a drastic reduction in
Uganda’s debt burden indicators (see Box 1)2. Thus, all debt burden indicators are below
their policy-dependent thresholds: Uganda’s NPV of debt-to-exports ratio will decrease to
31 percent in 2006/07 from 179 percent in 2004/05 while the debt service to export ratio will
sharply decline to 4 percent in 2006/07 from 16 percent in 2004/05. Uganda’s NPV debt-toGDP ratio will be reduced to 5 percent in 2006/07 from 24 percent in 2004/05.
2.
Uganda’s current risk of debt distress is low, and based on this fact the
authorities are planning to address infrastructure constraints. The authorities are
planning to build the Bujagali hydropower plant to help address power shortage constraints,
as it will contribute to a steady and secure supply of energy while strengthening private
sector confidence. The authorities are still negotiating with a private consortium the terms,
conditions, and guarantees for financing Bujagali. The Government intends to start the
planning process for the construction of a second hydropower project at Karuma.
3.
The Joint DSA assesses an increase in investments for hydroelectric power in a
four-year period between 2007/08 and 2010/11. The DSA assumes that the government
contracts or guarantees debt on commercial terms up to US$400 million. The DSA assumes
that the government would finance by borrowing or providing guarantees on commercial
terms with annual average disbursements of about 0.8 percent of GDP. Thus, the baseline
scenario shows the impact of partial public financing of the construction of infrastructure on
commercial terms. Debt indicators would be lower if a greater proportion of these
investments were financed on concessional terms. In addition, it is assumed that multilateral
and bilateral official debt would be contracted on concessional terms.

1

During the review mission, the staff discussed with the authorities the basic assumptions of the scenario shown
in this appendix, and its implications for debt accumulation and debt management strategy. Prospective oil
production has not been incorporating in the DSA, as the scale of production needs to be determined (Box 3).

2

The AfDF will deliver its share of debt relief by end-2006.

71
I. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS3
4.
Under the baseline scenario, Uganda’s debt burden indicators are below their
policy-dependent thresholds during the projection period. The NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio
is projected to increase to 13 percent in 2016/17, a level that is well below its policydependent threshold of 50 percent, while dropping to 10 percent by the end of the projection
period. Uganda’s NPV of debt-to-exports ratio in 2016/17 will stand at 87 percent, below its
policy-dependent debt burden threshold of 200 percent. Debt service is manageable through
the projection period, reflecting the delivery of HIPC and MDRI assistance. Debt service
payments will be at their peak of 6 percent of exports in 2013/14.
Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth averages 6.3 percent between 2006/07 and 2026/27, higher than its ten-year historical
average by 0.5 percent and lower than the Government’s projection of 7 percent, recognizing the current
constraints imposed by the power shortage. Higher investment in energy and roads is expected to lead to
subsequent increase in production.
Exports of goods and services are projected to grow about 8 percent on average between 2006/07 and
2026/27, driven largely by an increase in the export volume of non-traditional exports and some higher
volume increase in fish and maize, and cotton and coffee resulting from recovering plantation areas.
The current account deficit (excluding interest payments) in terms of GDP will be above its historical
average of 4.5 percent by about 3 percent of GDP between 2006/07-2011/12 on the account of higher
imports related to the construction of Bujagali, and is projected to decrease to an average of 6.2 percent
thereafter.
Fiscal policy. Tax revenues are assumed to increase gradually from 13 percent of GDP 2004/05 to 15
percent of GDP in 2012/13 and to 16 percent in 2015/16. With grants tapering off to 3 percent of GDP,
noninterest expenditures are projected initially to decline to about 17.5 percent of GDP and then to
increase to about 19 percent of GDP, consistent with a primary balance close to zero in the outer years.
Official external loan financing is projected to amount to US$590 million on average throughout the
entire projection period. The DSA assumes that IDA will support Uganda through the projection period
with lending operations.

5.
Macroeconomic shocks would worsen Uganda’s NPV of debt-to-exports ratio
significantly. If exports grow less by one standard deviation in 2007/2009, Uganda’s NPV of
debt-to-exports ratio would increase to 147 percent in 2011/12. Thus, an export shock and
low growth performance would have a significant impact on debt sustainability, as it would
put the Ugandan economy at a high indebtedness level for a prolonged period of time.

3

Uganda’s policies and institutions rank as a “strong performer” according to the World Bank’s Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). Debt burden thresholds for strong performers are NPV of debt to
GDP ratio of 50 percent, NPV of debt-to-exports ratio of 200 percent, NPV of debt to revenue ratio of
300 percent, debt service to exports ratio of 25 percent, and debt service to revenue ratio of 35 percent.

72
Uganda’s NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio and debt service ratio would nonetheless remain below
their policy-dependent thresholds.
6.
An alternative scenario has been developed to reflect higher government
investment in infrastructure. For illustrative purposes, this scenario assumes additional
new borrowing of US$1.5 billion during the first decade, and US$3.5 billion for the 20-year
period projection, over and above what is assumed in the baseline through a blend of
concessional and nonconcessional financing. Under this scenario, Uganda’s NPV of debt-toexports ratio would be higher than in the baseline scenario by 31 percentage points to
118 percent in 2016/17. If these investments coincided with a shock to exports, this ratio
would rise further to 184 percent. These results points to the need of scaling up donor
support to finance infrastructure projects until a steady high economic growth materializes.

7.
Contracting commercial debt should be approached with caution. While
Uganda’s debt situation is currently robust, the use of nonconcessional debt would add to
Uganda’s external debt burden and should be based on a careful selection of objectives and
infrastructure projects to minimize debt risks related to external shocks. Overall, the
authorities would have to weigh the costs and benefits of nonconcessional borrowing.
International community support in providing concessional resources remains critical.
II. FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
8.
The fiscal DSA is based on the assumption of continued fiscal consolidation,
though initially at a more moderate place due to the power crisis, and on a gradual

73
tapering off of grant inflows. Specifically, it is assumed that emergency budget spending on
the energy crisis will amount to about 3 percent of GDP cumulatively in the next three years,
and that grants will continue to decline from 6½ percent of GDP in FY 2005/06, before
stabilizing at 3 percent of GDP. Domestic budget revenues are projected to increase
gradually to 16 percent of GDP, in line with the authorities’ policy objective. After a spike
related to the energy crisis, noninterest expenditures will decline moderately as a percent of
GDP, but then will increase again to about 19 percent of GDP, in line with projected
improvement in domestic revenue collection, with primary balance close to zero.
9.
Under the baseline scenario, the NPV of public debt is projected to increase
gradually after a sharp decline resulting from MDRI. It will reach about 20 percent of
GDP by the middle of the next decade, and then decline gradually. Debt-service indicators
remain manageable, with debt-service peaking at about 10 percent of budget revenues.
10.
Uganda’s public debt remains sustainable under alternative scenarios. Even
under the extreme stress test, the NPV of public debt reaches only about 30 percent of GDP
in 2016/17, and then declines continuously. Similarly, the stress tests do not indicate any
debt service problems.
III. CONCLUSION
11.
The DSA analysis shows that Uganda’s public debt remains sustainable under
the baseline scenario. Uganda’s public debt has been reduced significantly as a result of the
MDRI, and with a prudent borrowing strategy and the continuation of the stability-oriented
fiscal policy, debt should remain comfortably low during the projected period. While the
alternative scenario shows that Uganda can adopt a higher investment program, caution on
borrowing is warranted and concessional financing remains essential.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 07/8
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 25, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Uganda
On December 15, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Uganda.1
Background
Uganda’s macroeconomic performance over the past 15 years has been exceptional. Per capita
GDP growth exceeded the average in sub-Saharan Africa and international reserves were
rebuilt following the earlier period of civil unrest. Sound macroeconomic policies contained debt
and brought about price stability. Most markets were liberalized, and the banking system and
state-owned enterprises were privatized. Poverty rates came down, and social spending was
increased. In recent years, however, per capita growth has tapered off. This, together with
volatile terms of trade and increasing income inequalities, has had a negative effect on poverty
reduction.
An acute electricity crisis threatens Uganda’s macroeconomic performance. The regional
drought in 2005/06 reduced Uganda’s already inadequate hydropower-generating capacity,
resulting in a production gap of nearly one-half of demand. In consequence, many businesses
and consumers were forced to rely on high-cost thermal generators. Manufacturing and highvalue agriculture, most affected by power cuts, and profits in these industries, are being
squeezed. While measured real GDP growth in 2005/06 (5½ percent) remained relatively high,
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

81
the electricity crisis pushed nonfood inflation slightly above the 5 percent target, and the trade
deficit widened because of higher oil prices and diesel fuel import volumes for thermal power
generation. The wider deficit drove down the reserve import cover to about 5½ months at end2005/06, but financing was not a concern because net donor support remained at close to
10 percent of GDP. Debt relief, through the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), will
augment the government’s resource envelope in the short and medium term and improve debt
sustainability.
Starting in February 2006, Uganda’s economic program—based on the Poverty Eradication
Action Plan launched in May 2005—has been supported by the IMF’s Policy Support Instrument
(PSI). Fiscal developments in 2005/06 were broadly in line with the program’s consolidation
objective. Monetary policy management, with its continued focus on using foreign exchange
sales as the primary liquidity sterilization tool, helped interest rates to decline further. Base
money was within the program ceiling and the stock of net international reserves of the Bank of
Uganda exceeded the program floor by a large margin. On the structural front, progress was
made in the repayment of arrears and in preparing guidelines on contracting, managing, and
monitoring external debt. Reporting of domestic arrears under the commitment control system
remains a problem, but should improve as teething problems with the new computerized system
are resolved and as efforts to enforce existing rules are strengthened.
The authorities have requested a new three-year PSI in support of their near- and medium-term
policies. The authorities’ main objectives are to sustain macroeconomic stability while tackling
the ongoing electricity crisis and addressing other infrastructure deficiencies to alleviate existing
constraints on growth. Other structural measures under the program will be aimed to enhance
financial intermediation and to improve management of domestic arrears and debt.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities’ sound macroeconomic management which, together with
structural reforms and substantial donor assistance, have supported Uganda’s long record of
high economic growth and poverty reduction. Directors noted the broadly satisfactory
performance of the economy under the PSI. However, concerns were expressed about the
slippage in clearing domestic arrears, and Directors welcomed the steps being taken to resolve
them.
Directors observed that Uganda continues to face important challenges. Per capita growth has
tapered off in recent years and the country remains heavily reliant on donor support while facing
severe capacity constraints. Directors underscored that scaling up investment in infrastructure,
particularly in the energy sector, deepening the financial sector, and strengthening governance
and institutions are key to restoring high, sustainable income growth. In this connection,
Directors welcomed the authorities’ emphasis on infrastructure in their economic program
for 2006/07 and the medium term. They noted that in addressing Uganda’s infrastructure
bottlenecks, careful attention must be paid to financing and macroeconomic considerations.
Infrastructure projects should be financed mainly through grants, domestic savings, and
concessional borrowing. Directors supported the cautious approach outlined in the authorities’

82
proposed debt strategy, which strikes an appropriate balance between the need to borrow to
address infrastructure needs and recognition of the risk of a rapid debt buildup.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ strategy of continued fiscal consolidation in line with
Uganda’s Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. They supported continued tax revenue
mobilization, including by way of further efficiency gains through the ongoing restructuring of the
Uganda Revenue Authority. Directors urged caution in introducing tax incentives to attract
investments and called for conserving scarce tax resources to help provide for improvements in
infrastructure. Fiscal consolidation will also require a continued focus on strengthening
expenditure management, including in the local governments.
Directors agreed that Uganda’s independently floating exchange rate regime continues to
provide an appropriate framework for macroeconomic management. They supported the Bank of
Uganda’s continuing emphasis on foreign exchange sales for liquidity management. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ work on new supervision and legal arrangements to strengthen the
banking sector. They underscored the need to develop sources for long-term capital and noted
the effort to promote financial services in rural areas, however, they cautioned against directed
lending by the government in support of these initiatives.
Looking ahead, Directors emphasized that the authorities’ goals of sustained growth and poverty
reduction would require a firm commitment to implementing the planned reforms in the public
finances, infrastructure, and the financial system. In addition, it will be essential to strengthen
governance and efforts against corruption as part of measures needed to improve the
environment for private sector participation. Directors welcomed Uganda’s efforts to advance
regional integration. The recently established East African Community (EAC) customs union
should promote regional trade and provide a forum for discussion of trade policies and
advancement of regional financial integration.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Press Release No. 06/281
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Completes the First Review under the Policy Support Instrument
for Uganda and Approves a New Three-Year Policy Support Instrument
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the first
review under a 16-month Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Uganda. The PSI was
approved on January 24, 2006 (see Press Release No. 06/14).
The Executive Board also agreed to Uganda’s request to replace the current 16-month PSI
with a new three-year PSI, to support their near-and medium-term policies. The new program
includes structural measures to spur private sector activity, lower business costs, and improve
Uganda's competitiveness. Macroeconomic policies would continue to emphasize stability
and sound management of aid flows. Uganda remains a strong candidate for a PSI with its
longstanding track record of prudent monetary policies, ample foreign exchange reserves,
and low external debt, particularly after the recent Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI).
The IMF's framework for PSIs is designed for low-income countries that may not need IMF
financial assistance, but still seek close cooperation with the IMF in preparation and
endorsement of their policy frameworks. PSI-supported programs are based on countryowned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process involving civil society
and development partners. This is intended to ensure that PSI-supported programs are
consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural and social
policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. Members' performance under a PSI is reviewed
semi-annually, irrespective of the status of the program (see Public Information Notice No.
05/145).
Following the Executive Board discussion, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“Sound macroeconomic management, structural reforms, and substantial donor assistance
supported Uganda’s long record of high economic growth and poverty reduction. Per capita
growth, however, has tapered off in recent years. To maintain high, sustainable per capita

85
growth, there is a need to scale up investment in infrastructure, deepen the financial sector,
and continue to strengthen governance.
“In addressing Uganda’s infrastructure bottlenecks, careful attention must be paid to
financing and macroeconomic considerations. Infrastructure projects need to be well
planned and financed to the extent possible through grant scaling up, domestic savings, and
concessional borrowing.
“Uganda’s financial sector needs deepening to build on recent improvements in the banking
sector. The government is developing new supervision and legal arrangements for the
provision of long-term capital and is beginning to promote financial services in rural areas.
To sustain these initiatives, it will be important for the government to avoid directed
lending.
Sustaining the country’s fiscal performance will require further efforts to boost revenues and
strengthen expenditure management. In this context, caution in the government’s efforts to
introduce tax incentives to attract investments is warranted. The way forward for Uganda
would be to use the country’s scarce resources to improve its infrastructure.
As regards structural reforms, the authorities are encouraged to press ahead with their
ambitious agenda, covering the public finances, the financial system, and governance. In
addition, the recently established East African Community (EAC) customs union should
help promote regional trade and provide a forum for discussion of trade policies and
advancement of regional integration.
“The first scheduled review under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) is completed. As
envisaged, the current 16-month PSI is being replaced by a three-year PSI. The latter is
based on the approved 2006/07 budget, the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, and
Uganda’s Poverty Eradication Action Plan. The program—which meets the standard of
upper credit tranche conditionality—aims at maintaining macroeconomic stability through
continued prudent fiscal, monetary, and exchange policies, while preserving debt
sustainability. As in the past, these would set the basis for private sector-led growth and
continued poverty reduction,” Mr. Kato said.

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Executive Director for Uganda
and Godwill Efiong Ukpong, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
December 15, 2006
1.
The Ugandan authorities express appreciation to the Executive Board and
Management of the Fund for the continued engagement with the country and support of their
comprehensive policy agenda. They also thank staff for preparing a balanced and instructive
report on the 2006 Article IV Consultation and on the performance of the Ugandan economy
under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI). They note the analysis and comments in the staff
report and are broadly in agreement with its conclusions and recommendations.
Recent Macroeconomic Developments and Performance
2.
The Ugandan authorities have maintained a long record of strong macroeconomic
performance and structural reform, a factor which has underpinned GDP growth of
5.5 percent in 2005/06 in spite of severe drought and heightened hydro-based electricity
crisis, which significantly constrained agricultural and industrial production. Similarly, sound
monetary policy has helped check inflation, with underlying inflation remaining at single
digits against a backdrop of high prices of oil and diesel fuel for thermal power generation.
The authorities have also been successful in maintaining fiscal discipline in 2005/06, despite
spending pressure arising from high energy costs and elections early in 2006, while the level
of official international reserves accumulated could cover 5.5 months of imports. The
successful conclusion of the Presidential elections bodes well for the strengthening of
governance, while peace talks with the rebels are at an advanced stage.
3.
The gains from the authorities’ sound economic management notwithstanding, a
number of challenges still face the Ugandan economy. These include (i) sustaining
macroeconomic stability, (ii) stimulating further growth to accelerate poverty reduction,
(iii) strengthening infrastructure development, (iv) improving governance and institutions,
and (v) removing remaining administrative bottlenecks for private investment. The
authorities are fully aware of these challenges and remain committed to maintaining
macroeconomic stability and accelerating market-based reforms. They are already taking
relevant measures to address identified constraints to growth, including the use of diesel
generators on a temporary basis to help solve the problem of inadequate electricity
generation and distribution while sourcing long-term funds to complete the building of two
dams; revamping road networks to facilitate the movement of goods and services;
encouraging financial deepening and lending to the rural poor; and investigating financial
mismanagement and restructuring the Ugandan Revenue Authority (URA) to further improve
governance.
Performance under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI)
4.
In spite of the afore-mentioned challenges, the macroeconomic objectives under the
PSI were achieved, with all quantitative assessment criteria for end-June 2006 met. The
indicative target on minimum expenditures under the Poverty Action Fund was also reached,

87
but public administration spending exceeded the ceiling by 0.2 percent of GDP owing largely
to unanticipated election costs. The reported domestic arrears under the Commitment Control
System (CCS) were above the indicated target. There was, however, an improvement as
initial teething problems of computerization of the system were solved. The assessment
criterion on repayment of old arrears was met, but the strategy paper for avoiding domestic
arrears was submitted with delay as it became more ambitious than originally planned, while
provisions for arrears payment in 2006/07 budget have been doubled. Progress was also
made in meeting the structural benchmarks, including completion of budget contingency
regulations, and preparation of guidelines on contracting and monitoring external debt.
5.
Fiscal developments were broadly in line with the program and the consolidation
objective. At the same time, prudent monetary policy kept base money growth below the
program ceiling, while the stock of net international reserves of the Bank of Uganda (BOU)
exceeded the program floor by a large margin. Credit to the private sector increased
significantly (28 percent), while strong prudential oversight of the banking system kept the
level of nonperforming loans low. Against the backdrop of their firm commitment to reforms
and resolute actions already taken to address the slippages relative to some indicative targets,
the authorities request waivers for the nonobservance of assessment criteria on (i) delayed
submission of a new arrears strategy and (ii) the provision for domestic arrears repayment in
2006/ 07 because of the imperative to address first a severe drought-induced electricity crisis.
Macroeconomic Policies for 2006/07 and the Medium-Term Policy Challenges
6.
A major objective of the Ugandan economic reform program is to maintain
macroeconomic stability through the implementation of prudent fiscal and monetary policies
and market-based reforms in order to meet the medium-term challenge of sustaining
economic growth at a rate consistent with significant poverty reduction. As outlined in the
country’s Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP), sustaining higher growth would depend
on finding ways to scale up transportation infrastructure and utilities, improve access to rural
finance, and remove barriers to investment, and continuous focus on education to strengthen
the labor force. As a result of the installation of more electricity generation capacity,
financial sector reforms with new supportive measures to build a more dynamic financial
sector serving a wider group of private enterprises, macroeconomic conditions are expected
to improve in 2006/07. Real GDP growth is therefore, projected at 6.25 percent, and
underlying inflation at 6 percent, reflecting increases in energy-related prices. In line with the
PEAP, the medium-term framework (baseline- which anticipates further macroeconomic
improvements) projects an annual GDP growth of 6-7 percent and an inflation rate of
4-5percent.
7.
The authorities are aware of the medium term risks associated with the selection and
implementation of infrastructure projects as well as with respect to rapid debt buildup and
more government intervention in the economy. They are, therefore committed to taking
appropriate actions to manage risks effectively, while correcting for market failures as
warranted.

88
Fiscal Policy and Public Sector Reforms
8.
The 2006/07 government budget aims at continued fiscal consolidation in line with
the country’s Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), but at an appropriate slower
pace than originally contemplated owing to electricity crisis. The overall fiscal deficit
(excluding grants) is projected at over 1 percent of GDP, but would remain unchanged
compared with the 2005/06, excluding spending on the energy crisis. Tax revenue is
estimated to increase by 0.4 percentage points of GDP on account of efficiency gains arising
from the modernization of the Ugandan Revenue Authority (URA) and implementation of
new measures introduced in the 2006/07 budget, including excise taxes and fees. The
government has also decided to address further the problem of tax system reform and public
procurement to help boost tax compliance and revenue. In this regard, the authorities
consider staff caution against unguarded introduction of tax incentives to attract investment
as appropriate, given the associated revenue loss. Improved public expenditure management
is being entrenched, including at sub-national levels. At the federal level, items of
expenditure are being provided for in the budget, including salary increase for primary school
teachers, one-time spending for hosting the Commonwealth Heads of Governments meeting
in October 2007, and doubling of domestic arrears clearance to 0.8 percent of GDP.
9.
Furthermore, existing initiatives to prevent new arrears have been strengthened
through reliance on strict discipline and punitive actions against accounting officers violating
the Commitment Control System (CCS). On the whole, while MDRI debt relief has
potentially given the country room to borrow externally, prudent fiscal policies have kept
domestic debt low and the government’s draft debt strategy envisages a cautious approach to
new borrowing to avoid future debt distress.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
10.
The authorities’ monetary program will continue to target base money with a view to
bringing underlying inflation back to 5 percent or below by 2007/08, compared to an
expected inflation outturn of close to 6 percent in 2006/07 owing to higher energy prices. The
independently floating exchange rate regime of the BOU continues to provide an appropriate
framework for macroeconomic management. The BOU will continue to employ a mix of
foreign exchange sales and open market operations to sterilize foreign exchange inflows. In
order to deepen the financial sector and help develop sources for long-term capital, following
the completion of restructuring of banks, the monetary authority is working on new
supervision and legal arrangements for the sector. The restructured Ugandan Development
Bank (UDB) will also be operating on commercial principles. The government is expected to
implement its decision to assist member-owned savings societies with technical support to
bring savings accounts and eventually loans to underserved rural areas. The authorities agree
with staff advice on the need to refrain from direct lending that would undermine these
banking and financial institutions.

89
Other Structural Reforms and Policies
11.
The authorities have been implementing far-reaching reforms which have so far
yielded many positive results. Some of the ongoing structural reform policies aim at ensuring
probity and improved governance and thus include quarterly publication of a “shame list” of
violators of the CCS; budgetary allocation for public utility bills and prepayment system; and
prevention of new and recurrent pension arrears by fully budgeting for them. On the
revamping of infrastructure, the authorities are working to secure financing from the World
Bank to complete the construction of the Bujagali dam, while planning carefully for the
Karuma dam, including possible financing through grants, domestic savings and concessional
loans. The authorities are committed, subject to resource constraint, to the promotion of
regional integration by revamping railways and roads and improving communication
infrastructure to facilitate trade and create better conditions for the private sector to serve as
the engine of growth of the economy.
12.
My authorities appreciate staff’s effort to examine some very pertinent issues
affecting investment inflows, credit to the private sector and trade in the East African
countries of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania in their selected issues paper. The issues raised are
very important, given their fundamental policy implications. However, this paper could have
benefited more, if staff had shared their findings with the authorities of the three countries
before making their final conclusions and presenting this paper to the Board. Therefore, we
are not in a position to comment on both the findings and recommendations in the paper, and
reserve the right of the authorities of the three countries in accordance with the Fund’s
deletion and publication policy.
Conclusion
13.
The Ugandan authorities have demonstrated strong commitment to the
implementation of sound macroeconomic and structural reforms to improve economic
management and induce high growth for poverty reduction and attainment of the MDGs.
Going forward, the government budget strategy aims at continued fiscal consolidation in line
with MTEF in order to sustain macroeconomic stability, enhance competitiveness and create
a favorable environment for private sector-led growth. The success of the strategy will
depend largely on the capacity of government to generate more revenue and effectively focus
on priority spending, including the financing of infrastructure development to support
investment and growth. Ongoing tax reforms and the discovery of oil during the year are
expected to significantly enhance revenue generation in the medium term. The authorities are
using the financial resources from the MDRI to facilitate the achievement of the PEAP
objectives and MDGs in a manner consistent with their fiscal and monetary policies. They
are committed to exercising caution in contracting external debt by resorting to grants and
concessional loans. They are also committed to avoiding the accumulation of unsustainable
debt to maintain debt sustainability. Given their commitment and resolve to continue to
implement the PSI program effectively for the benefit of their people, the authorities count
on sustained support of the international community, including the Fund, to strengthen their
efforts to address the challenges facing the economy. They, therefore, request for waivers for
non-observance of an assessment criterion and delayed observance of another as well as

90
approval of the request for a new three-year PSI.
