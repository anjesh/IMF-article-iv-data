STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 18, 2011

KEY POINTS
Context. The economy recovered rapidly in 2010 from the effects of the global
recession. Policies were tightened given the closing output gap and higher inflation,
with use of macro-prudential instruments to confront capital inflows and credit growth.
A new government, led by President Humala, took office in July 2011, promising more
social inclusion and continued macroeconomic stability, and creating some uncertainty
in the private sector.
Prospects. Activity is expected to decelerate in 2011–12 to slightly below trend
(estimated at 6 percent) while inflation declines towards the target and the external
current account deficit remains contained. Short-term risks are markedly to the
downside given global uncertainty. Once international turbulence subsides, strong
growth prospects and abundant international liquidity could increase capital inflows.
Near-term policy challenges. Fiscal policy focus on undertaking the capital
expenditures budgeted for 2011 (unexpectedly low in the first half of the year) is
appropriate. The small fiscal expansion planned for 2012 seems warranted. Monetary
policy can be kept on hold until there is more clarity with respect to the global
economy. Peru has significant space and buffers to confront worsening external
conditions, but policies should consider that alternative scenarios are also highly
uncertain in scope and duration.
Medium-term policy challenges. Macroeconomic stability, growth potential, and
social inclusion could be strengthened by adopting an ambitious reform agenda,
including: (i) revenue mobilization to cover higher social spending; (ii) strengthening
the fiscal framework; (iii) advancing with prudential regulations; and (iv) enhancing
competitiveness, and further developing domestic capital markets.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Peru had a stellar macroeconomic
performance over the past decade.
Following a period of low growth in 1998–
2001 related to a financial crisis and global
turmoil in the aftermath of the Asian crisis,
Peru began a period of ambitious structural
reforms and prudent macroeconomic
management, which—together with positive
terms of trade and sizable direct foreign
investment—helped them build buffers,
strengthen fundamentals, and boost growth
potential. As a result, per-capita income almost
tripled in the decade 2001–11 to US$5,700.
During the same period, public debt as a
percent of GDP fell by more than one-half to
about 20 percent, while real GDP growth
accelerated to 5¾ percent on average per
annum (the highest 10-year growth period
observed in Peru’s history) and the annual
inflation rate fell to 2¼ percent on average
(the lowest in Latin America).
2.
With strong fundamentals and a
skillful macroeconomic response, the
economy emerged practically unscathed
from the 2008–09 global crisis. The
authorities managed to implement significant
monetary and fiscal policy stimuli, which
avoided a credit crunch, supported economic
activity, and sustained employment. The
central bank (BCRP) dropped its policy rate by
525 basis points to 1¼ percent in 2009 (onefifth of the rate at the beginning of the year),
and the Ministry of Economy and Finance
(MEF) implemented a stimulus package that
generated a fiscal impulse of over 1½ percent
of GDP in 2009. However, real GDP growth
decelerated to 1 percent in 2009 (the lowest in
a decade).

3.
After a rapid economic recovery, the
economy is expected to decelerate on the
heels of tighter policies and the political
process. Following the policy response of
2009, real GDP expanded rapidly and grew
8¾ percent in 2010, one of the highest in the
region, driven by private domestic demand.
The recovery has closed a small output gap,
propped by significant macroeconomic policy
stimuli, a quick turnaround of terms of trade
and favorable external financial conditions,
with renewed capital inflows. Credit growth
recovered rapidly helped by unimpaired
private sector balance sheets. The external
current account deficit was moderated by
positive terms of trade. The economy grew at
7½ percent in the first eight months of 2011,
on strong private consumption and investment
and despite a sharp decline in public
investment and construction. More recently,
lingering political uncertainties and concerns
about the global outlook are expected to slow
down private demand by year-end.

Supply shocks and strong economic
activity led to higher inflation. Inflation fell
to its lowest level in a decade to ¼ of a
percent in 2009, but rebounded to 2 percent
by end-2010 as demand picked up. It further
increased to 4¼ percent in October 2011
(3½ percent for core inflation), above the
target band of 1–3 percent, due mostly to
supply shocks and some demand pressures.
Non-fuel non-food inflation (at 2⅓ percent in
October 2011 (yoy) has remained within the
target band. As supply shocks are absorbed
and the output gap hovers around zero,
inflation is expected to return to the target.
Inflation expectations for 2012 remain wellanchored on account of the strong inflation
targeting framework and the expectation of
weaker economic activity.

overheating signs, the government began in
2011 exiting the stimulus, with the political
process exacerbating expenditure restriction.
The fiscal position switched to an annualized
fiscal surplus of about 5½ percent of GDP in
the first half of 2011 (2½ percent in the first
half of 2010) as revenues remained buoyant
despite tax cuts and expenditures were
restrained due to low implementation of
investment projects at the sub-national level
(related to the political cycle).2 This help
increase the Fiscal Stabilization Fund to
3⅓ percent of GDP. Under-execution of public
investment projects persisted in the third
quarter of 2011, prompting the authorities to
adopt measures (of over ½ percent of GDP) to
foster capital execution (still within the 2011
budget limits).

Tax collections have improved by an average of
1 percent of GDP a year in 2010-11 helped by strong
economic activity, positive terms of trade, and more
recently a revised framework for mining taxation.
However, several measures in 2011 eroded the tax
base, including a reduction in the VAT rate (by
1 percentage point), the financial transaction tax and
import duties.

Monetary policy has also been
tightened and is in a wait-and-see state.
Following an aggressive easing of monetary
policy during 2009, a tightening cycle began in
mid-2010 as demand recovered, with the
policy rate increasing a total of 300 basis
points to 4¼ percent by May 2011, close to
the neutral stance. Since then, the central bank
has remained on hold in light of the uncertain
global economic outlook. Credit growth has
stayed at about 20 percent in 2010–11, with
foreign currency credit surpassing growth in
domestic currency. To enhance liquidity
management, the monetary tightening was
complemented with active hikes in reserve
requirements.3

The financial sector remains sound,

the use of modern prudential instruments.
Financial soundness indicators did not
deteriorate significantly during the 2008–09
crisis and continue improving—largely due to
limited cross-border linkages, good
supervision, and healthy balance sheets. The
non-performing loan ratio remains low
(1½ percent by mid-2011) and well–
provisioned. With the strong economic
rebound, dynamic provisioning was activated
in September 2010; and higher capital
requirements were implemented in July 2010
to account for credit risks in foreign currency,
the economic cycle and concentration risks
(Box 1). Recent stress tests show that the
system as a whole is able to withstand severe
shocks, although under some difficult
scenarios a few small banks might need capital
injections. Financial dollarization remains high;
with credit in foreign currency at about
45 percent and increasing due to low interest
rates on foreign currency loans and
appreciation expectations of the Nuevo Sol.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

The BCRP raised gradually marginal reserve
requirements for domestic currency deposits in the
second half of 2010 to 25 percent for residents (from
zero) and to 120 percent for nonresident financial
entities (from 35 percent). For foreign currency
deposits, the marginal reserve requirements increased
to 55 percent (from 30 percent). During 2011, the
BCRP resorted to increases in the average reserve
requirements (with a cumulative hike of 100 basis
points).

8.
Commodity prices and capital
inflows have supported a strong balance of
payments. As other emerging market
economies, Peru received ample private capital
inflows in 2010. The current account switched
to a deficit of 1½ percent of GDP in 2010
despite a strengthening in the terms of trade
as import growth and profit remittances
rebounded and private investment expanded.
The financial account registered some of the
largest private capital inflows in recorded
history; about 9 percent of GDP (including
errors and omissions). Consequently, the
overall balance reached a surplus of about
7½ percent of GDP in 2010. The current
account deficit is expected to widen to
2½ percent of GDP in 2011 due to higher
profit remittances of foreign mining firms and
a weakening in private savings. Capital inflows

Box 1. Peru: Macro-prudential Measures on Banks
Peru has been very proactive in the use of macroprudential instruments complementing macro policies. In
addition to using different reserve requirements (see
Appendix 2 from IMF Country Report No. 10/98), the
authorities are well-advanced in implementing
recommendations in the spirit of Basel III regarding capital and
liquidity requirements.

According to the SBS calculations, the additional capital
buffer ranges from 2.4 to 6.4 percent (see chart). The SBS
envisages a phased implementation, starting with 40 percent
of the capital buffer by July 2012 and then gradual increments
of 15 pp annually until July 2016.

In the context of a highly dollarized economy, prudential
measures to manage FX risks were issued or modified. In
July 2010, Peru implemented an additional capital requirement
on the FX exposure (of 2½ percent of their foreign exchange
credit exposure) to help financial institutions internalize FX
credit risks from lending to un-hedged borrowers. In January
2011, the SBS imposed limits on the net derivative position to
financial institutions of either 40 percent of assets or
S/.400 million, whichever is the highest. The limits were
tightened to 30 percent or S/.350 million in October 2011. In
2011, banks’ long net FX position has also been reduced to
60 percent of net equity (from 75 percent).
The SBS is working on a proposal for strengthen liquidity
requirements aligned with Basel III:



Current minimum liquidity ratios in national and
foreign currency (8 and 20 percent respectively) will
increase to 10 and 25 percent when there is liability
concentration (debt from 20 major depositor accounts for
at least 25 percent of total liabilities). Financial institutions
need also to report both liquidity ratios adjusted for
borrowed funding (interbank, overnight, reserve
requirements and public funds from Banco de la Nación);
and for foreign exchange forward position.



A Liquidity core ratio (LCR) and a net stable funding
ratio (NSFR). The LCR, with a minimum of 100 percent
for domestic and foreign currencies, is to be phased in—
with 80 percent for 2013, 90 percent for 2014, and
100 percent from 2015 onwards. Most institutions already
fulfill the requirement; except for finance companies and
some municipal saving banks. The SBS does not impose a
minimum NSFR, but request institutions to have an
internal limit. Regulation is expected to be approved by
end-2011.

A capital requirement for market concentration, that
applies to financial institutions with assets-to-GDP ratio higher
than 3 percent. The capital add-on increases with a lower
credit rating for the institution. The regulation allows the SBS
to request additional capital for market risk that could result
from interconnectedness or substitutability of the financial
institution.

In July 2010, the SBS implemented additional capital
requirements for financial institutions. The additional
capital buffer has the following components:
A countercyclical capital requirement, which is
activated or deactivated according to the dynamic
provisioning activation rule, based on GDP growth. The
requirement takes into account default probabilities
during a recession period and expected losses by type of
loan.

Box 2. Peru: Recent Developments in Mineral Taxation
Reforms in mineral taxation were a priority in the new
administration program. Peru’s mining sector (mineral and
hydrocarbon) represents 11 percent of GDP; 70 percent of
total export (of which mineral accounted for 61 percent); and
20 percent of total fiscal revenues (3.5 percent of GDP) in
2010. Fiscal revenue from mining (i.e., copper, gold, lead,
zinc, iron and tin) exceeded that from crude oil in around
2004, accounting for slightly more than 60 percent of the
total revenue from mining.
The mining taxation reform, approved in September,
2011, would increase progressiveness and public
revenues, while preserving competitiveness of the sector.
Peru’s mineral taxation regime comprised mainly of
corporate income tax and royalties based on sales value (1–
3 percent) introduced under the 2004 Mining Royalties Law.
The new reforms include: (i) new royalties based on operating
profits of 1 to 12 percent to replace the sales–based royalties,
for companies with no stability contracts with the
government; (ii) a new special mining tax (IEM)—as revenue
for the central government—levied on a sliding scale
between 2 to 8.4 percent of operating margins applicable to
companies with no tax stability contracts; and (iii) a special
(voluntary) levy (GEM) of 4 to 13 percent of profits on the
extraction of mineral resources targeting companies holding
stability contracts.

contracts were offered to mining companies to ensure a stable
legal, tax and administrative framework to attract
multinational mining companies in the mid 1990s. Companies
that signed stability contracts pay an additional 2 percent in
income tax as an extra charge. Under the voluntary
contribution scheme—introduced for regional development in
2006, the amount transferred could be up to 3.75 percent of
profits after tax (2.75 percent for the local fund and 1 percent
to the regional government fund). During 2007–10, resources
transfer from these companies amounted to S/.2 billion.
The new regime increases the expected government
revenue. The new measures are expected to raise additional
US$1 billion annually (about 0.5 percent of GDP, at current
commodity prices) which will help fund infrastructure and
social gaps. If commodity prices increase further, revenues
would increase proportionally more than in the past.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
Activity is expected to decelerate on
the heels of tighter policies and a weaker
external outlook. GDP growth is expected to
reach 6¾ percent in 2011, driven by private
consumption and inventory building, closing
the output gap by year-end. Inflation is
projected at 3¾ percent in 2011 (eop). Going
forward, lingering uncertainties and concerns
about the global outlook are expected to slow
down investment and consumption growth.
Real GDP growth is projected at 5¼ percent in
2012, mostly due to lower external demand,
while inflation would decline to 2½ percent.
The external current account deficit remains
relatively stable at around 2½ percent of GDP
next year as the strong terms of trade
continue. Over the medium term, staff projects
economic growth at around potential
(6 percent), a stable current account deficit
(around 2½ percent of GDP), and headline
inflation at the target.
13
Downside risks from the global
economy and political uncertainties
dominate in the short term. While external
risks are more prominent, domestic concerns
are also important:


External risks. Unsettled conditions in
Europe and the United States have had a
limited impact on the economy so far.
However, subpar global growth in the next
couple of years could materialize, with
severe adverse consequences, probably for
a longer period than the 2008–09 global
financial crisis. Peru could feel the pinch
through lower terms of trade and adverse
financial conditions as global risk aversion
surges. The risk of contagion from the

European crisis through the presence of
Spanish banks appears limited despite a
large presence in the system (about ¼ of
the assets of the banking system), not only
because they have a strong liquidity
position and balance sheet and a heavy
reliance on deposit funding, but also
because of its specific ownership structure
for the largest bank (with 50 percent being
local investors), and strict prudential
regulations. Still, over the medium term,
conditions conducive to high global
liquidity bode well for further capital
inflows, with risks of fuelling a boom.


Domestic risks. The private sector has
reacted positively to the appointment of
cabinet members and the handling of the
revised framework for mining taxation.
However, uncertainties on the overall
direction of economic policy have not fully
disappeared. It might take some time to
enhance credibility and change
perceptions. There are also lingering
concerns about a new labor market law in
Congress that could raise labor costs,
reduce labor flexibility and lessen
competitiveness. In addition, the revised
framework for mining taxation includes a
“consultation clause” (with local
communities) that has not been codified
and some fear it could create conflict with
mining companies, discouraging
investment.

Growth and macro-stability have contributed
to reducing poverty and income inequality in
the past 10 years. Peru’s economic performance
has been one of the strongest among the LA6
countries in the region, with growth in PPP based
real GDP per capita averaged 6 percent in 2000–
09. Poverty, as measured by the international
benchmark of the share of population living with
less than $2 per day, was reduced by half during
2001–09. Income inequality has also reduced
steadily with the Gini coefficient declining to
46 percent in 2010. However, inequalities in Peru
are still prevalent particularly with respects to
gender and ethnicity.

Despite some achievements, large regional
disparities persist. According to the national
definition, 23 percent of Peruvians in rural areas
were still living in extreme poverty and 54 percent
living in poverty in 2010 and rural poverty remains
very high particularly in the highlands. Urban
poverty was lower at 19 percent.
Raising more resources to increase social
expenditure and further enhancing the
efficiency of social spending through better
targeted social programs are necessary to
achieve more social inclusive growth. In this
context, the authorities are prioritizing its social
programs to place greater focus on the 800
poorest districts through the household targeting
system. In addition, increasing the efficiency of
public investments would reduce the regional
gaps in physical and human capitals and bring
about greater redistribution over the medium
term.

CHALLENGES AND POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on managing effectively the challenging external conditions, including the scope,
timing and sequencing of policies as well as possible enhancements of the macroeconomic framework.
Achieving more social inclusive growth would need additional revenue mobilization to cover
supplementary well-targeted social programs. As mentioned in previous Article IV consultation reports,
high growth will require enhancing competitiveness and innovation, improving the business climate,
investing in human capital and infrastructure, and further developing domestic capital markets while
properly regulating the financial system.

A. Near-Term Macroeconomic Management
14.
Policies in the short-run are
consistent with cementing macroeconomic
stability and promoting growth. The main
policy challenge is to ensure a timely and
flexible implementation of policies to confront
changing domestic economic conditions in an
external environment of heightened
uncertainty.

Policy for 2011. The authorities adopted
measures to foster budget capital
execution in the second half of 2011. Staff
welcomed those efforts and estimated that
the fiscal position would switch to a
surplus of 2¼ percent of GDP in 2011
(compared with a fiscal deficit of 1 percent
included in the 2011 budget), with an
estimated withdrawal of stimulus of about
2½ percent of GDP. The tighter-thanenvisaged policy stance was useful in
reducing overheating concerns and
rebuilding fiscal buffers.

Policies for 2012. The authorities

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

PERU

partly reversed the tight expenditure levels
expected for 2011 and aimed at reducing
the surplus to about 1 percent of GDP.
Staff supported the overall expenditure
proposals in the 2012 budget (especially
the higher social spending). Policies would
entail a fiscal impulse of ¾ percent of GDP
in 2012, which would be adequate as it
came at a moment of expected softer
activity.


Communication. Staff suggested that the
changes and rationale of fiscal policy in the
second half of 2011 and those proposed in
the 2012 budget need to be clearly
communicated to prevent
misunderstanding of the overall fiscal
stance.



Tail risks. In the event of a relapse in
global growth, the authorities noted that
there was room to provide additional
policy stimulus to limit the fallout. Staff
and authorities concurred that the
uncertain nature and duration of the
external shock makes advisable a careful
and gradual implementation of the policy
response to avoid a premature use of
buffers.



Medium-term. The authorities aim at
achieving structural fiscal balance over the
medium term, while staff favors
maintaining moderate structural surpluses
of around 1 percent of GDP to strengthen
fiscal buffers. Structural surpluses would
put Peru in a stronger position to deal with
future shocks. This is particularly important
given current volatile international
environment, the reliance on nonrenewable natural resources, sizable

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

contingent government liabilities,5 and the
vulnerability to natural disasters and global
warming.
16.
Monetary policy should remain
nimble and react to changes in the outlook.
Given the expected moderation in inflationary
pressures (as oil price increases moderate) and
firmly-anchored inflation expectations, staff
concurred with the authorities that the central
bank could pause and continue assessing
domestic and external conditions before
deciding the course of monetary policy in the
short term. If prospects of lower growth and
inflation materialize, e.g., given global
developments, the central bank has space to
loosen policy rates and reserve requirements.
In the event of strongly deteriorated global
conditions, staff recommended the use of
active monetary policy (within the logic of
inflation targeting) and automatic stabilizers in
the budget as a first line of defense (which
worked well in the past), ahead of any
meaningful discretionary fiscal stimulus; the
authorities did not disagree with the use of
active monetary and fiscal policies under these
conditions. Staff also supported the
authorities’ intentions to use foreign exchange
intervention if disruptions materialize in the
foreign exchange market due to a worsening
in external conditions, including the pullout of
external credit lines in case of an extreme
event. In the unlikely scenario of experiencing
growth faster than potential and further
inflationary pressures, staff would favor a
tightening of the policy stance.

The external position is expected to
remain solid. The current account deficit is
expected to remain at the same level of
2½ percent of GDP, while capital inflows are
expected to ease, generating a moderate
reserve accumulation. In the event of another
global recession, the effect would feed
through mainly the trade channel as a sharp
decline in the commodity prices would lower
Peru’s mineral exports. The impact on financial
channel is likely to be less significant as banks

fundamentals, staff and authorities
discussed the merits of varying degree of
exchange rate flexibility. Staff exchange rate
assessment (CGER) suggests that on average,
Peru’s exchange rate is in line with its
fundamentals (Box 4). The authorities agreed
with that assessment, and reiterated that they
are prepared to accommodate changes in the
exchange rate dictated by changes in
fundamentals. They noted that the objective of
their foreign exchange intervention policy has
been to mitigate excessive exchange rate
volatility and its potential destabilizing effects
on balance sheets of banks and households in
the context of a dollarized economy. Staff
agreed with that representation but believed
that additional exchange rate flexibility,
gradually introduced, could be useful for the
private sector to strengthen their ability to
assess foreign exchange risk and foster dedollarization. For instance, the market for
mortgages denominated in U.S. dollars seems
to be expanding rapidly on the premise that
dollar financing is cheaper than local currency
financing. The authorities considered that the
current degree of flexibility has worked fine,
being able to confront the global uncertainties
and variable capital flows and terms of trade.

Box 4. Peru: Exchange Rate Assessment
The Nuevo Sol has remained the most stable
currency among the LA6 countries amid strong
capital inflows. Peru’s real effective exchange rate
(REER) appreciated in the first half of 2010; and
weakened during the subsequent period up to April
2011 in part due to currency interventions. Overall,
the Nuevo Sol strengthened by 4 percent in real
effective terms from end-2009 to September 2011.
Staff’s estimates suggest that the Nuevo Sol is in
line with fundamentals. Panel data CGER estimates
showed that, on average, the real exchange rate is
not misaligned. The macroeconomic balance
approach indicates an overvaluation of 10 percent;
while the external stability and the equilibrium
exchange rate approaches indicate that the exchange
rate is undervalued (by 1 and 16 percent respectively)
Finally, an alternative estimate of the equilibrium real
exchange rate, following a behavioral approach that
is Peru-specific, suggests a slight overvaluation of
1 percent.
The underlying current account deficit is
estimated at around 1 percent of GDP in 2012.
The adjustments to the projected current account
(2½ percent of GDP in 2012) take into account
several factors, including the effects of closing the
domestic and trading partners’ output gaps over the
medium term, mineral and hydrocarbon prices falling
to their respective long-term levels, and lower
commodity prices translating into lower profit
remittances (Table). Similarly, the underlying current
account deficit is estimated at a lower 1½ percent of
GDP in 2016. This contrasts with the current account
norm of -¾ percent of GDP according to the
macroeconomic balance (MB) approach; while the
net foreign assets (NFA) stabilizing CA is estimated at
-2½ percent of GDP.

B. Medium-Term Institutional Strengthening
19.
Staff welcomed the authorities’
plan to strengthen tax administration to
cover spending needs over the medium
term. Tax collections are low compared with
other emerging markets in terms of revenue
mobilization (at 15 percent of GDP) and tax
effort (i.e., the ratio of actual revenues to
potential). The government set the goal of
raising tax revenues to 18 percent of GDP by
2016. The authorities successfully moved with
the revised framework for mining taxation,
with due consideration to competitiveness.
However, staff projected fiscal pressure to
stabilize around 16 percent of GDP. Thus,
achieving the government’s objective would
entail sustained efficiency gains of ½ percent
each year, which may prove challenging
despite welcome plans to strengthen the tax
collection agency (SUNAT) to reduce tax
evasion. In particular, SUNAT requires:
(i) investing in new technologies and
equipment; (ii) enhancing administrative and
financial independence from the Ministry of
Finance; (iii) hiring efficient public servants;
and (iv) adopting an integrated institutional
strategy for the medium and long runs. If
administrative efforts to enhance tax
collections encounter limitations, tax policy
measures could be considered in due course
(i.e., reversing the 1 percentage point
reduction in the VAT rate and scaling back
preferential treatments). 6 7
6

In addition, consideration could be given to
strengthen the framework for subsidies to target the
poorest segments of the population, including the
GLP subsidy. Against this background, the authorities
recently eliminated the subsidy on gasoline.
7

Tax evasion was one of the major sources of
proceeds of crime identified in the Fund staff
assessment of Peru’s Anti-Money Laundering/

20.
Strengthening the fiscal framework
would solidify macroeconomic stability.
Building on the success of Peru’s Fiscal
Responsibility and Transparency Law (FRTL) in
reducing public debt, staff suggested that the
focus of the fiscal framework could shift to
prevent procyclicality of fiscal policy—e.g., by
including taxes within the fiscal rule or other
fiscal norm—to increasing predictability, and
to build buffers by saving most of the
extraordinary revenues coming from the
extraction of natural resources. Accordingly,
staff welcomed the authorities plan to
incorporate a structural approach as an
additional instrument of guidance for fiscal
policy. Staff supported the authorities’ plan of
keeping the current FRTL and redefining its
main parameters with limits on (current and
capital) expenditures and escape clauses. Staff
and the authorities agreed that further work is
needed to precisely underpin an agreed
methodology for structural calculations, in
addition to medium term targets. A structural
approach would help saving abnormal
revenues reducing “Dutch Disease” risks in
case commodity prices increase further by
saving windfall revenue gains.
21.
The prudential framework is in line
with new international proposals, and
banks are well positioned to implement
them. Once global turmoil subsides,
abundant international liquidity could raise
capital inflows and risk fuelling a credit boom.
The authorities took steps to incorporate the
FSAP recommendations (Box 5), including:

conducted at the request of the SBS.

Box 5. Peru: Financial Sector Assessment Update1
Peru’s financial sector is comparatively small, with
uneven levels of development across subsectors, and
characterized by large, complex, and systemically
important financial institutions. The largest segments are
banks and pension funds with assets mounting to
40 percent and 20 percent of GDP respectively.
Financial institutions are highly profitable and well
capitalized, and banks are likely to withstand severe
shocks. Key risks for banks are consumer credit and
deposit concentration, as well as maturity mismatches.
Bank regulation and supervision are of high quality,
although there is room to strengthen supervision by better
balancing qualitative judgment and rules-based standards,
and by making on-site supervision more intrusive,
particularly for the larger banks.

complete the yield curve; and review regulatory
requirements for issuers.



Progress so far



Oversight. Various projects, including a draft law, are
under discussion in order to bring holdings of
conglomerates into the regulatory perimeter and to
assess the contribution of affiliates to overall group
risk. In this context, the SBS is evaluating the
effectiveness of its management as well as the
resource need for increasing the number and caliber
of SBS on-site inspection staff. With regard to
consolidated supervision, the SBS is working on
incorporating the risk stemming from operating
within a conglomerate into its risk assessment matrix.
An attempt to bring credit cooperatives under the
supervision of the SBS has not progressed so far, but
the SBS hopes to re-launch this project. The SBS is
working toward removing the pre-authorization of
instruments on which pension funds could invest,
shifting toward ex-post monitoring and supervision.



Safety nets. A mechanism for liquidity assistance to
smaller institutions via a trust fund has been
introduced to facilitate central bank’s liquidity
injection for institutions under stress. The SBS is also
working on draft legislation that would facilitate crisis
management in systemic situations.



Securities Regulator. The new Superintendencia de
Mercado de Valores (SMV)–replacing CONASEV–has
operational and budgetary independence, and
provides legal protection to its staff. The SMV is
working on fostering the issuance of venture capital
and by medium-size firms and to reduce the legal
cost of debtors’ first issuance.



Pension funds. In July 2011, the legal limit on
investments abroad for pension funds was increased
to 50 percent (from 30 percent). The operational limit,
set by the central bank, stands currently at 30 percent.

Main FSSA Recommendations





Oversight. For banks, recommendations focus on
(i) the need to strengthen consolidated supervision
and regulate holdings; (ii) increase the number and
caliber of SBS’ on-site inspection staff; (iii) develop
benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of
management; and (iv) tighten regulations on related
party and intra-group transactions. The credit
cooperatives should be supervised by the SBS and
they should be members of the deposit insurance
fund (FSD). For pension funds, staff recommended to
eliminate requirement for the SBS to pre-authorize
issuers and instruments in which AFPs can invest after
introducing a risk-based supervision framework;
update the mortality tables for annuities; and increase
investment limit in foreign assets to 50 percent.
Safety nets. Despite being well designed, a resolution
regime for systemic situations is needed, and the
deposit insurance fund (FSD) could be increased by
raising fees and/or reducing coverage.



Macroprudential framework. Better institutional
coordination of macroprudential policy across
agencies would help improve the monitoring of
systemic risk, policy formulation and response.



Securities regulation. Provide CONASEV with strong
independence, including authority over its own
budget and administrative matters, and legal
protection against suits similar to SBS staff.



Capital market development. Main
recommendations focus on introducing a
comprehensive program to support the development
of local venture industry and private equity firms;

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Payments system. Financial infrastructure is modern
and efficient, but the explicit allowance for unwinding
of payment and securities transfer instructions could
be abolished to guarantee finality. Consider more
geographically distant production and back-up
processing for systemically important payment
systems.



New capital requirements. These take
into account credit risk stemming from
foreign exchange mismatches, the
economic cycle and concentration risks.
Some of the large banks are already
compliant with the capital add-ons. Staff
welcomed steps taken to implement
liquidity requirements in line with Basel III.
The authorities noted that they would
likely implement regulation in line with
Basel III ahead of the international
schedule, starting in July 2012.



Stock market regulator. Staff
commended the authorities for
establishing the Stock Market
Superintendence, providing operational
and budgetary independence to the
previous CONASEV.



Balance sheets. In addition, the authorities
are working on steps to gather information
about corporate sector balance sheet
beyond listed companies. Staff noted that
this would be a good opportunity to
request information on foreign exchange
mismatches.



Conglomerates. Staff welcomed efforts to
enhance supervision of conglomerates, via
higher risk assessment



Pension funds. The superintendence of
banks (SBS) is working on an initiative that
eliminates the requirement to preauthorize issues and instruments for
pension fund investments.



Systemic banks. Consideration could be
given to enacting a special resolution
regime for systemic situations. The
authorities considered the current
framework (based on consultations and
emergency decrees) to be mostly adequate

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

and saw difficulties in defining all
contingencies ex-ante.


Other. Consideration could also be given
to retaking the initiative to include
cooperatives under the SBS supervision;
increasing the number and caliber of the
SBS’ staff allocated to inspections and
achieving a better balance between
qualitative and quantitative elements in
risk-based supervision.

22.
Further coordination in the conduct
of macro-prudential policy would assist in
managing systemic risks more effectively. The
mission commended the authorities for being
active in the implementation of macroprudential instruments, but noted that the
institutional coordination among government
agencies could be strengthened as it is
currently done on a voluntary basis. A more
formal institutional setup would enhance
analysis, mandates, accountability, and
coordination across institutions. Staff noted
that it would also facilitate monitoring
systemic risks more effectively, and design
macro-prudential instruments in a more
coordinated manner. As a first step, enhancing
information sharing will facilitate a better
understanding of systemic macro-financial
linkages.
23.
Given the importance of
maintaining high growth, efforts should be
made to cement the business climate. While
Peru compares relatively well with other
counties in the region, staff encouraged the
authorities to take additional measures to
enhance competitiveness. According to the
World Bank’s “doing business indicators”,
Peru’s relative strength lies in protecting
investors ease of getting credit, and registering
property. However, it still lags behind in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 23

subcategory rankings such as enforcing
contracts, resolving insolvency, dealing with
construction permits, ease of paying taxes, and
getting electricity.
24.
Additional reforms are needed in
support of small and medium enterprises to
enhance competitiveness and growth
prospects. While the economy benefited
greatly from the growth of mining and related
sectors due to the commodity price boom, the
economy still comprises largely of small and
medium enterprises and informal employment.
Over the past decades, there has been limited
progress in providing support to businesses in
improving management, innovation and
quality standard. In this context, the authorities
initiated structural reforms to facilitate
technical assistance to small and medium
enterprises with a view to reduce costs and

enhance their productivity by creating a
certified network of providers to support firms
to deal with technology and business
innovation issues.

C. Poverty Alleviation and Social Inclusion
25.
Sustaining poverty alleviation and
achieving more social inclusive growth
would require improvements in targeted
social programs. Despite advances in
reducing poverty (thanks to strong economic
performance and rising employment
opportunities), large regional disparities
persist. The authorities prioritized social
programs to place greater focus on the 800
poorest districts through the household
targeting system. Other key measures include
expanding successful social programs, such as
Juntos, the cash transfer program to additional
districts, and increasing the coverage of
targeted programs for elderly in extreme
poverty through Pension 65. In addition,
increasing the efficiency of public expenditures
in education and infrastructure would reduce
the regional gaps in physical and human
capitals and bring about greater redistribution

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

over the medium term. The authorities are well
aware of the risks posed by increasing regional
disparities, in part due to differences in
resource endowment. The revised framework
for mining taxation aims at addressing this
problem.
26.
Additional social spending will need
to be carefully calibrated. While Peru lags
behind other countries with comparable
income level in health and education
expenditures, any increases in social spending
will require skillful implementation to ensure
the fiscal position is not compromised. Staff
supported the authorities’ effort to expand
social programs within the expenditure
envelop available in the 2012 budget, as well
as efforts to increase social spending over the
medium term as revenues are strengthened.

PERU

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
The policy mix seems broadly
adequate to maintain macro stability and
foster growth. The main challenge is to
ensure a timely and flexible implementation of
policies to confront changing domestic
economic conditions in an external
environment of heightened uncertainty.
28.
The 2012 budget proposal seems
appropriate. Efforts to reinvigorate public
spending in the second half of 2011 are
welcome as the fiscal stance was becoming
somewhat tight. Still, there will be a higherthan-expected surplus for 2011. The proposed
2012 budget, which aims at a surplus of
1 percent of GDP and entails a structural
expansion of ¾ percent of GDP, is broadly
adequate as activity is expected to be softer.
Additional short-term social spending can be
accommodated within the expenditure limits
established by the 2012 budget.
29.
Given the uncertain external
environment, monetary policy can remain
on hold. In view of the expected fall in
inflationary pressures (as the impact of higher
oil and food prices is absorbed) and the
previous tightening in monetary policy, Staff
supports the central bank decision to keep
policy rates unchanged, at least until a clearer
picture on the global outlook emerges. The
authorities should continue monitoring private
credit developments and ensuring risks remain
contained.
30.
Against a background of heightened
risks to the global outlook, policies should
remain flexible. Peru’s solid fundamentals
and scope for policy response are likely to
mitigate the effects of a weak world economy.

As a first line of defense, and consistent with
the functioning of an inflation targeting
regime, monetary policy could be eased as
inflation prospects decline and the output gap
widens, while fiscal policy activates automatic
stabilizers. Against the background of
potential global financial volatility, some
foreign exchange support would be warranted.
Reserve requirements may be loosen if
liquidity conditions become stressed or if
domestic credit decelerates too rapidly.
31.
Should tail risks in global conditions
materialize, additional policy stimulus could
be deployed to limit the fallout. The buildup
of buffers in the last few years suggests there
is space to implement a sizable policy
response. Yet, the uncertainty about the nature
and duration of the external shock makes
advisable a gradual use of these buffers. The
central bank has the capacity to inject
considerable liquidity and cut rates more
aggressively if external financial conditions
deteriorate (although potential pressures in
the foreign exchange market could become a
constraint). As with the fiscal stimulus
implemented in 2009, infrastructure and
maintenance projects can prove effective to
help sustain domestic demand and
employment. Under this scenario, the policy
response would only help mitigate the shock,
with economic activity likely being below
potential in the short term. Therefore, it will be
important to design and communicate clearly
the authorities’ strategy and objectives, and
ensure continuity in the policy framework.
32.
Giving more weight to structural
measures to anchor fiscal policy would help
cementing macroeconomic stability. This

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 25

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

PERU

approach helps reducing procyclicality risks,
enhances predictability, and accumulates fiscal
buffers. Staff sees merits of targeting
moderate structural overall balances of
1 percent of GDP in the medium-term to cope
with the volatile global environment,
contingent liabilities, and Peru’s vulnerability
to natural disasters. In the short-term, current
FRTL parameters could be calibrated to
maintain a relatively stable structural result,
with limits to expenditure growth, unless a
discretionary fiscal reaction is called for.
33.
Tax mobilization efforts will be key
to the sustainability of the social agenda.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ plans to
strengthen tax administration to increase the
tax ratio to 18 percent of GDP by 2016 to
provide additional resources to cover
increasing social programs and public
investments in the medium-term. The approval
of the revised mining taxation framework, with
due consideration for competitiveness in the
sector, is a welcome first step. Staff also
welcomes the authorities’ efforts to reduce tax
evasion, but warns that in the event these
efforts did not yield the expected results, tax
measures could be considered.
34.
Going forward, Peru’s improved
fundamentals will foster further dedollarization, allowing the exchange rate to
play a larger role as shock absorber. Staff
believes that some additional exchange rate
flexibility, gradually implemented, is important
for the private sector to strengthen its ability
to assess foreign exchange risk, and may
contribute to de-dollarize. Financial
dollarization remains high and has actually
increased in some segments given low
international interest rates and appreciation
expectations. A gradual increase in exchange
rate flexibility would foster the development of

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

hedging instruments and private sector
awareness about managing currency risk,
thereby allowing the exchange rate to play a
larger role as a shock absorber.
35.
The financial sector is strong, and
the prudential framework is ahead in the
implementation of proposed international
standards. Peru’s financial sector remains
sound, profitable and well-capitalized. Most
prudential regulations aligned with Basel III will
be applied ahead of the internationally-agreed
schedule, with banks well positioned to
implement them. Monitoring corporate
balance sheets, including foreign exchange
and derivative positions, will be critical to
assess vulnerabilities. Formalizing an
institutional setup for macro-prudential
policies would facilitate monitoring systemic
risks more effectively, and enhance analysis
and coordination across institutions.
36.
Peru’s bright economic prospects
will benefit from an ambitious reform
agenda to maintain high potential growth.
Staff concurs with the view that growth will
need to be increasingly driven by higher
productivity over the medium term. Key pillars
to ensure high growth include: (i) enhancing
competitiveness by boosting human capital
and infrastructure and maintaining labor
market flexibility; (ii) improving the business
climate to foster investment and innovation
(including enhancing formality); and (iii) further
developing the local capital markets to
facilitate investment and better allocate
savings.
37.
Staff proposes that Peru remains on
the 12-month consultation cycle.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ANNEX I. PERU: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Peru’s public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected
to decline under the baseline debt scenario
to below 20 percent of GDP. Public sector
gross debt has been declining as a share of
GDP from 47.1 percent in 2003 to 24.6 percent
in 2010. Currency risks have also declined
significantly in recent years, with the foreign
currency share in total public debt declining
from 80 percent in 2000 to 57 percent in 2010.
High real GDP growth and overall fiscal
surpluses averaging 1.7 percent of GDP (2000–
10) have contributed to debt consolidation. In
the medium term, real GDP growth will
average 6 percent a year in 2011–16
underpinned by domestic demand dynamics
and external demand supported by high
commodity prices. In this context, overall fiscal
surpluses are projected to average 1.4 percent
of GDP. Under the baseline scenario, Peru’s
public sector debt stock (including CRPAOs)
would decline further from 21.3 percent of
GDP at end-2011, to 17.3 percent of GDP by
2016.
External debt is projected to decline further
to about 20 percent of GDP. Following a
decade of a continuously improving external
position, Peru’s external debt has been on a
downward trajectory, declining by half to
27.4 percent of GDP in 2010 from 52.7 percent
of GDP in 2000. The baseline scenario projects
total external debt to decline further by about
5 percentage points of GDP from 26.1 percent
at end-2011 to 20.8 percent by 2016 (of which

public external debt would decline from
11.7 percent of GDP to 7 percent of GDP over
the same period).
Peru’s external and public sector debt ratios
are robust to alternative assumptions about
underlying macroeconomic variables.
Sensitivity tests based on 10-year historical
standard deviations for GDP growth, interest
rates and noninterest current account shocks
(such as in the terms of trade) show that they
would have a moderate adverse impact on
external and public indebtedness.
However, external and public debt ratios
remain sensitive to large and permanent
exchange rate shocks despite the increasing
share of public sector debt in domestic
currency. Under a one-off 30 percent real
depreciation of the exchange rate, the external
and public debt ratios would increase by about
9 and 5 percentage points, respectively above
the baseline projections over the medium
term. CGER estimates, however, indicate that
the Nuevo Sol is not misaligned.
A contingent liabilities shock to the public
sector of 10 percent of GDP would increase
public debt by a similar amount over the
medium term. The public debt ratio would
rise sharply in the short run and decline over
the medium term. By 2016, the debt ratio
would remain 9.2 percentage points above the
baseline scenario.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar
terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency
(e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).

4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP)

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Exchange Arrangements

Peru maintains a unified, floating exchange
rate. On September 30, 2011, the average of
interbank buying and selling rates was
2.77 Nuevos Soles per U.S. dollar. The
exchange system is free of restrictions, except
2

for those maintained solely for the
preservation of national or international
security, and which have been notified to the
Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision
No. 144-(52/51). Those restrictions are
maintain pursuant to UN Security Council
Resolutions 1267 (October 15, 1999) and 1373
(September 28, 2001). The central government
maintains external payments arrears to
unguaranteed suppliers, some of whom are in
discussions with the government, while the
rest have not been located. Peru has
maintained a clearing arrangement with
Malaysia since 1991.

FSAP and ROSCs

Several joint Fund-Bank missions visited Lima
in the period September 2000–January 2001 to
conduct an FSAP for Peru. The corresponding
Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA)
report was discussed by the Executive Board
on March 12, 2001. A follow-up FSAP mission
was concluded in February 2005. More recently,
the Executive Board, on April 20, 2011, took
note of the staff’s analysis and
recommendations in the report on Peru’s
FSAP-Update. In October 2002, an FAD
mission conducted a Fiscal ROSC for Peru (IMF
Country Report No. 04/109, 4/16/04), while an
STA mission conducted a Data ROSC for Peru
in February 2003 (IMF Country Report
No. 03/332, 10/24/03).

ANNEX II. WORLD BANK RELATIONS
(As of September 30, 2011)

A. Bank Group Strategy
The World Bank Group support to Peru is
defined in the Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) approved by the Board on December 19,
2006. The strategy supports the government’s
developmental goals with emphasis on
inclusive growth and poverty reduction. The
agenda includes programs addressing fiscal,
national competitiveness, infrastructure and
social-sector needs. The country strategy
underscores partnerships, flexibility and results
orientation in public expenditure. The CPS
projects financial assistance of up to
US$3.5 billion between July 2007 and June
2011 and envisages a flexible lending program.
The strategy includes development policy
lending operations in the fiscal, social, and
environmental sectors.
The CPS Progress Report discussed by the
Board on February 17, 2009 showed progress
in the areas of fiscal management, sustained
economic growth, and poverty reduction. New
government priorities have been included in
the Bank’s program in response to changing
circumstances. The Bank responded rapidly to
the Government’s request of contingent credit
lines to mitigate potential effects of the
developing global crisis, with US$1.36 billion in
DPL-DDOs during FY 09. In addition, two
investment lending operations in transport
infrastructure and water and sanitation sector,
and a CAT DDO were included in the program
during the preparation of the CPS Progress
Report. While the Program adjusted
accordingly to the Government’s financial

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

needs, the overall medium term vision of the
CPS continues to be relevant for Peru.
Peru’s current lending portfolio includes
19 active projects with a commitment of
US$1.9 billion and an undisbursed balance of
US$1.5 billion. The portfolio includes thirteen
investment loans, four DPL/DDOs and two GEF
grants. The areas covered by the existing
portfolio are economic policy, environment,
social protection, transport infrastructure,
water resources, among others.
The Board approved ten new operations in
FY 11, the last year of the current CPS, for a
total commitment of US$524 million. These
comprised the Third Environmental DPL
(US$75 million), Fourth Fiscal Management
and Competitiveness DPL (US$100 million),
Third Results and Accountability in Social
Sectors DPL (US$50 million), first CAT DDO
(US$100 million), Irrigation in Sierra
(US$20 million), Second Justice Improvement
(US$20 million), Rural Water and Sanitation
Program Additional Financing (US$30 million),
Results in Nutrition (US$25 million), Lima
Optimization of Water Systems
(US$54.5 million), and Second Rural
Electrification Project (US$50 million).
The next CPS for the period FY2012−16 is
expected to be presented to the Board in
March 2012. The team has started the
consultation process with the civil society—
including NGOs and religious institutions—,
the private sector and the academia at the

PERU

central and regional level. The formal
consultation with the new government
administration is expected to be held in
November–December 2011.
In addition, the Bank has an extensive program
of analytical and advisory activities for
FY 12−14, including both economic and sector
work and non-lending technical assistance.
The economic and sector work covers areas
such as public expenditure, infrastructure, gas
development strategy, decentralization, labor

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

markets, social sectors, climate change, and
housing and municipal financing.
Finally, the Bank’s TF portfolio (currently over
US$27 million) has been also expanding
significantly. The majority of TFs complements
other WB support in the current core
engagement areas of this CPS by providing
valuable AAA and technical assistance. They
support the harmonization and alignment of
funding from various development partners
behind core government programs.

B. Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas
Tax Reform and Fiscal Decentralization.
Fund staff has taken the lead in assisting in the
design of tax reform. Jointly with the World
Bank and IDB, staff has worked on drafting
laws and regulations for fiscal decentralization.
The World Bank has also focused on the
design and implementation of decentralization
of the social sectors and pro-poor spending
policies.
Financial Sector. A joint FSAP was completed
in May 2001. Follow up technical assistance to
implement FSAP recommendations has been
given by both institutions. Joint FSAP updates
were completed in June 2005 and April 2011.

Public Sector Management. Bank-Fund
collaboration has focused in the area of results
based budgeting, the implementation of a
Treasury Single Account and modernization of
budget processes, institutions and information
systems.
Customs Administration Modernization: A
needs assessment mission was undertaken
together with the IMF to develop an action
plan for modernizing customs administration.
The joint team presented a technical report to
SUNAT.

ANNEX III. RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
A. Country Strategy
Peru’s current Country Strategy (2007−2011)
continues the thrust of Bank assistance in
areas relating to competitiveness, social
development, and modernization of the State,
and reflects wide-ranging discussions of
policies with the Government and with
Peruvian society to identify the constraints the
country faces in achieving its development
objectives.
IDB supports Peru’s development agenda by
deepening the country’s sustainable
economic growth and generating greater
opportunities for the majority of Peruvians,
through efforts grouped into the following
three strategic pillars: (i) strengthening Peru’s
participation in the global economy and
enhancing competitiveness; (ii) promoting
social development and economic inclusion;
and (iii) deepening the reform of the State
and improving public sector management.
More recently, government demands for IDB
interventions have been linked to

environmental sustainability. These operations
have been grouped in what may be called the
“green cluster”, including interventions in
water and sanitation, solid waste, energy,
climate change, natural disasters and
agriculture.
The IDB and Peru are in the final phase of
drafting a new country strategy covering the
period from 2012−2016. Under the new
country strategy, the IDB projects to be
flexible adapting the financial envelope to the
financial needs of the country. The new
2012−2016 Bank’s country strategy with Peru,
will probably agree on making sustainable
growth and poverty-inequality reduction as
main objectives of their strategic
engagement. In the pursuit of these
objectives, the Bank will align its actions with
those in Peru’s National Plans and the policy
road map depicting the actions of the
incoming administration.

B. Lending
As of September 9, 2011, the Bank’s portfolio
of active, public sector operations consisted of
28 loans for a total amount of US$681,
76 million, of which US$443.78 million
(65 percent) had been disbursed. The public
sector lending program for 2011 comprises
five policy-based loans for US$125 million and
five investment loans for US$196 million, and
one contingent loan for natural disaster

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

emergencies for US$100 million, seven of them
pending approval.
Regarding private sector operations, the
Structured Corporate Finance Department’s
(SCF) portfolio in execution consists of seven
operations amounting to US$249 million and a
guarantee mechanism for Continental Bank for
US$100 million, the IIC 2011 portfolio has
approved US$25.6 million primarily in

PERU

manufacture and financial services, and the
Opportunities for the Majority (OMJ)
department portfolio consists of four
operations amounting US$20 million, focused
on housing improvement and microenterprise
financing. In addition, OMJ has two regional
operations for US$5 million, which also benefit
to Peru, both in the agriculture sector.
As of September 2011, disbursement
projections for SCF & OMJ total US$79 million.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

As of September, private sector lending for
2011 includes three SCF projects for
US$174 million, in infrastructure and financial
markets, two OMJ operations for
US$13 million, in education and mobile
banking. MIF has five projects in pipeline for
US$8.7 million and the IIC has five operations
for US$31 million, focused on livestock and
poultry, textiles, leather clothing, utilities and
infrastructure.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

PERU

ANNEX IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
Macroeconomic statistics are broadly
adequate for policy formulation and
surveillance. Peru subscribes to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). A data
ROSC was prepared and published in 2003.
Despite progress in recent years, there is scope
for improvement in the following areas:
(i) coordination among the agencies that
compile official statistics to avoid duplication
of efforts and confusion among users;
(ii) implementing a new benchmark and base

year for GDP; (iii) expanding the coverage of
the wholesale price index to include mining, oil
and gas extraction, electricity and water, public
transportation, and communication;
(iv) finalizing the migration to the standardized
report forms for monetary data, with the
introduction of report forms for the central
bank, other depository corporations, and other
financial corporations; and (v) expanding the
scope of data sources for compiling financial
flows of individual residents.

A. Real Sector and Prices
The authorities published a revised GDP series
in 2000. The series used the 1994 benchmark
estimates as the base year, and included inputoutput tables. However, due to limited
availability of periodic source data, estimates
after 1994 are largely based on extrapolation
techniques. The lack of current detailed tables
for supply and use hampers the reconciliation
of discrepancies. As a result, changes in
inventories are mainly determined as a
residual. Although the quarterly accounts have
benefited from some improvements in the
timeliness of monthly production indices,
coverage is still very limited. The National
Statistics Office (INEI) is working on a new
national account series implementing the 1993
SNA and using 2007 as the base year. Four
national accounts statistics missions visited the
country in November 2008, May 2009,
September 2009, and September 2010. The
missions are assisting the authorities in
compiling the complete set of national
accounts by institutional sectors, and in
developing the sequence of accounts of

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

nonfinancial corporations. More technical
assistance will be needed in the coming years.
At the present time, the official measure of
inflation for Peru is the CPI for Metropolitan
Lima, compiled and published by INEI.
However, a new law issued in 2009 requires
the INEI to compile a new national level CPI
that will serve as the official CPI for Peru in the
future. Starting in January 2010, the
Metropolitan Lima CPI has been compiled
using updated weights based on the 2008/09
Encuesta Nacional de Presupuestos Familiares
(ENAPREF). Since January 2011, city level
indices have been compiled and disseminated
for the 24 departmental capitals and another
large urban area using weights from the
2008/09 ENAPREF and a methodology
matching that employed for the Metropolitan
Lima CPI. However, a corresponding national
level CPI has not been disseminated. It is
planned that the new national level CPI, which
will become the official measure of inflation for
Peru, will be disseminated in February 2012
starting with the January 2012 index. An STA
mission on the CPI was conducted in May 2–

PERU

13, 2011 to evaluate the methodology of the
new national CPI index.
As concerns the WPI, statistical techniques
used to compile the index generally follow
international standards. The weights for the
WPI are outdated, and were derived from
the 1994 input-output table and other reports
and publications of relevant ministries.
The authorities monitor labor market
developments using four indicators: open

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

unemployment, underemployment,
employment, and remunerations. The quality
of the indicators has improved over recent
years. Monthly wage data for the Metropolitan
area of Lima is timely, but for other areas come
with a relatively long delay; the nationwide
unemployment and underemployment
situation is surveyed quarterly; and monthly
employment indices for the private sector and
the government are available and are relatively
timely.

B. Fiscal Sector
The Central Bank compiles government finance
statistics (GFS) following the GFSM2011, for
the general government and its subsectors.
Data for all subsectors are reported on a cash
basis and financial assets and liabilities are
reported at face value. The authorities have
not yet sent to the Fund information on the
components of expenditures by function. The
coverage of published national budget data is
narrower than the fiscal statistics prepared for
the combined public sector. The new budget

aligned to GFSM 2001 was used for the 2009
budget processing. However, there are still
problems of coordination of GFS compiling
units in the Ministry of Finance and in the
central bank. The authorities report data for
publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) using the GFSM
2001. No high frequency data is reported for
publication in International Financial Statistics
(IFS).

C. Monetary Sector
The central bank (BCRP) compiles and
publishes the analytical accounts of the central
bank, depository corporations, and financial
corporations broadly in line with the
methodology recommended by the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual. The main
discrepancies are the exclusion of the deposits
of other financial corporations, state and local
governments, and public nonfinancial
corporations from the definition of broad
money; and valuation of some financial
instruments at cost rather than at market
prices. At the request of the authorities, a
mission visited the country in January 2007 to
assist with the migration to the new

standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting
monetary data to the IMF. The mission
finalized the SRF for the central bank,
recommending improvements in the
classification and sectorization of some
accounts. A follow-up mission took place in
September 2008. The mission completed the
work on the SRF for the central bank and
developed a bridge table linking the source
data reported by banks to the BCRP to the
report form 2SR (other depository
corporations). The mission identified
shortcomings in the management of the
database that generate the accounts of the
other depository corporations sector at the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

PERU

BCRP. Although the two technical assistant
missions finalized the groundwork for the
migration to the SRFs, the BCRP has not yet
started reporting monetary data using the
SRFs. No set date is foreseen for the migration
to the SRFs.

In June 2011, the country started reporting
data and metadata for financial soundness
indicators (FSIs) with a quarterly frequency.
Latest data received correspond to the second
quarter of 2011.

D. External Sector
The BCRP prepares quarterly data on the
balance of payments and international
investment position largely in line with the
recommendations of the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Data are
reported to the Fund for publication in the IFS
and the Balance of Payments Statistics
Yearbook. Departures from BPM5 include the
lack of coverage of assets held abroad and
land acquisition abroad by residents; and not
recording on an accrual basis some external
debt transactions.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The BCRP has been reporting since
August 2001 weekly data on international
reserves in accordance with the Operational
Guidelines for Data Template on International
Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity. Since
August 2006, the BCRP is including the full
amount of the liquidity requirements in the
reserve template both under official reserve
assets and as a contingent net drain (as
specified in Section III of the Data Template).
Peru disseminates quarterly data on external
debt with an eight week lag on the National
Summary Data Page with a hyperlink to the
Fund’s website.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Peru
On December, 05, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Peru, and considered and endorsed the staff
appraisal without a meeting on a lapse-of-time basis.1 2
Background
The Peruvian economy emerged largely unscathed from the 2008–09 global crisis supported by
strong fundamentals and proactive macroeconomic response. Real Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) expanded rapidly at 8.75 percent in 2010, one of the highest in the region, driven by
private domestic demand. The recovery was propped by significant macroeconomic policy
stimuli, a quick turnaround of terms of trade and favorable external financial conditions, with
renewed capital inflows. Inflation, after falling to 0.25 percent in 2009, rebounded to 2 percent
by end-2010 as demand picked up, the center of the target band of 1–3 percent. A new
government, led by President Ollanta Humala, took office in July 2011, promising more social
inclusion and continued macroeconomic stability.
Activity is expected to decelerate on the heels of tighter policies and a weaker external demand.
Real GDP growth is expected to reach 6.75 percent in 2011, driven mainly by private
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

consumption. Inflation is projected at 3.75 percent at end-2011, due mostly to supply shocks but
also some demand pressures. Credit growth has stayed at about 20 percent in 2010–11.The
financial sector remains sound, profitable and well-capitalized, assisted by the authorities’ active
use of prudential instruments.
The outlook is for continued albeit lower growth with short-term risks titled markedly to the
downside given global uncertainty. Real GDP growth is projected at 5.25 percent in 2012,
slightly below trend (estimated at 6 percent), mostly due to softer external demand conditions,
while inflation would decline to 2.5 percent. Inflation expectations for 2012 remain well-anchored
on account of the strong inflation targeting framework. The external current account deficit
would remain stable at around 2.5 percent of GDP next year as the strong terms of trade
continue. Once international turbulence subsides, strong growth prospects in Peru and
abundant international liquidity could increase capital inflows.
On the policy front, macroeconomic policies have focused on limiting overheating risks. The
government began unwinding the previous fiscal stimulus in 2011. The fiscal position switched
to an annualized fiscal surplus of about 5.5 percent of GDP in the first half of 2011 as revenues
remained buoyant despite tax cuts, and expenditures were restrained due to low
implementation of investment projects at the sub-national level and the presidential elections.
Monetary policy has been tightened as demand recovered, with the policy rate increasing a total
of 300 basis points to 4.25 percent between mid-2010 and May 2011. This was complemented
with active hikes in reserve requirements. Since then, the central bank has remained on hold in
light of the uncertain global economic outlook.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2011 Article IV consultation with Peru, Executive Directors endorsed staff’s
appraisal, as follows:
The policy mix seems broadly adequate to maintain macro stability and foster growth. The main
challenge is to ensure a timely and flexible implementation of policies to confront changing
domestic economic conditions in an external environment of heightened uncertainty.
The 2012 budget proposal seems appropriate. Efforts to reinvigorate public spending in the
second half of 2011 are welcome as the fiscal stance was becoming somewhat tight. Still, there
will be a higher-than-expected surplus for 2011. The proposed 2012 budget, which aims at a
surplus of 1 percent of GDP and entails a structural expansion of 0.75 percent of GDP, is
broadly adequate as activity is expected to be softer. Additional short-term social spending can
be accommodated within the expenditure limits established by the 2012 budget.
Given the uncertain external environment, monetary policy can remain on hold. In view of the
expected fall in inflationary pressures (as the impact of higher oil and food prices is absorbed)
and the previous tightening in monetary policy, staff supports the central bank decision to keep

3

policy rates unchanged, at least until a clearer picture on the global outlook emerges. The
authorities should continue monitoring private credit developments and ensuring risks remain
contained.
Against a background of heightened risks to the global outlook, policies should remain flexible.
Peru’s solid fundamentals and scope for policy response are likely to mitigate the effects of a
weak world economy. As a first line of defense, and consistent with the functioning of an
inflation targeting regime, monetary policy could be eased as inflation prospects decline and the
output gap widens, while fiscal policy activates automatic stabilizers. Against the background of
potential global financial volatility, some foreign exchange support would be warranted. Reserve
requirements may be loosen if liquidity conditions become stressed or if domestic credit
decelerates too rapidly.
Should tail risks in global conditions materialize, additional policy stimulus could be deployed to
limit the fallout. The buildup of buffers in the last few years suggests there is space to
implement a sizable policy response. Yet, the uncertainty about the nature and duration of the
external shock makes advisable a gradual use of these buffers. The central bank has the
capacity to inject considerable liquidity and cut rates more aggressively if external financial
conditions deteriorate (although potential pressures in the foreign exchange market could
become a constraint). As with the fiscal stimulus implemented in 2009, infrastructure and
maintenance projects can prove effective to help sustain domestic demand and employment.
Under this scenario, the policy response would only help mitigate the shock, with economic
activity likely being below potential in the short term. Therefore, it will be important to design and
communicate clearly the authorities’ strategy and objectives, and ensure continuity in the policy
framework.
Giving more weight to structural measures to anchor fiscal policy would help cementing
macroeconomic stability. This approach helps reducing procyclicality risks, enhances
predictability, and accumulates fiscal buffers. Staff sees merits of targeting moderate structural
overall balances of 1 percent of GDP in the medium-term to cope with the volatile global
environment, contingent liabilities, and Peru’s vulnerability to natural disasters. In the shortterm, current Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law parameters could be calibrated to
maintain a relatively stable structural result, with limits to expenditure growth, unless a
discretionary fiscal reaction is called for.
Tax mobilization efforts will be key to the sustainability of the social agenda. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ plans to strengthen tax administration to increase the tax ratio to 18 percent of GDP
by 2016 to provide additional resources to cover increasing social programs and public
investments in the medium-term. The approval of the revised mining taxation framework, with
due consideration for competitiveness in the sector, is a welcome first step. Staff also welcomes
the authorities’ efforts to reduce tax evasion, but warns that in the event these efforts did not
yield the expected results, tax measures could be considered.

4

Going forward, Peru’s improved fundamentals will foster further de-dollarization, allowing the
exchange rate to play a larger role as shock absorber. Staff believes that some additional
exchange rate flexibility, gradually implemented, is important for the private sector to strengthen
its ability to assess foreign exchange risk, and may contribute to de-dollarize. Financial
dollarization remains high and has actually increased in some segments given low international
interest rates and appreciation expectations. A gradual increase in exchange rate flexibility
would foster the development of hedging instruments and private sector awareness about
managing currency risk, thereby allowing the exchange rate to play a larger role as a shock
absorber.
The financial sector is strong, and the prudential framework is ahead in the implementation of
proposed international standards. Peru’s financial sector remains sound, profitable and wellcapitalized. Most prudential regulations aligned with Basel III will be applied ahead of the
internationally-agreed schedule, with banks well positioned to implement them. Monitoring
corporate balance sheets, including foreign exchange and derivative positions, will be critical to
assess vulnerabilities. Formalizing an institutional setup for macro-prudential policies would
facilitate monitoring systemic risks more effectively, and enhance analysis and coordination
across institutions.
Peru’s bright economic prospects will benefit from an ambitious reform agenda to maintain high
potential growth. Staff concurs with the view that growth will need to be increasingly driven by
higher productivity over the medium term. Key pillars to ensure high growth include:
(i) enhancing competitiveness by boosting human capital and infrastructure and maintaining
labor market flexibility; (ii) improving the business climate to foster investment and innovation
(including enhancing formality); and (iii) further developing the local capital markets to facilitate
investment and better allocate savings.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
