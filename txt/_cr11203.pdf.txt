SPILLOVER REPORT – 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 22, 2011

KEY POINTS
Issues. Spillover reports explore the external effects of policies in systemic economies,
focusing on concerns raised by key partners. Foreign officials appreciated the boost to
world growth from U.S. stimulus but were concerned over unintended consequences.
Loose U.S. monetary policies could fuel unsustainable capital flows and commodity
prices; high U.S. government deficits create tail risks of a generalized bond shock; and
laws and rule changes passed ahead of Basel III could foster financial sector arbitrage
Findings. The main messages flowing from staff analysis are:


Short-term U.S. spillovers on growth abroad are uniquely large, mainly
reflecting the pivotal role of U.S. markets in global asset price discovery. While
U.S. trade is important, outside of close neighbors it is the global bellwether nature
of U.S. bond and equity markets that generates the majority of spillovers.



U.S. macroeconomic stimulus likely supported foreign activity more in 2009
than in 2010. Facing global turmoil, 2009 initiatives calmed markets. In the less
fraught 2010 environment similar policies produced a less favorable response.



Looking forward:


With QE2 having limited spillovers, its fully anticipated ending will have even
less effects. The main monetary exit risk is that expectations of monetary
tightening would reverse earlier capital flows to other countries.



Spillovers from credible and gradual fiscal consolidation are limited and
ambiguously signed, while those from the tail risk of a potential loss of
confidence in U.S. debt sustainability are universally large and negative.



Robust supervision of U.S.-based (not necessarily U.S.-owned) investment
banks can reduce risks of negative global spillovers via dollar funding markets.



Overall, U.S. and foreign goals may be better aligned for fiscal and financial
policies, given a common interest in limiting globally important tail risks, than
for monetary policies, where low interest rates facilitate financial risk-taking.

Approved By

Tamim Bayoumi and
Rodrigo Valdés

This report was prepared by a staff team comprising Tamim Bayoumi
(head), Ashok Bhatia, Edouard Vidon, and Francis Vitek (all SPR),
Martin Sommer (WHD), Alasdair Scott and Hui Tong (RES), and Andy
Jobst (MCM). Additional inputs were provided by Trung Bui, Sean
Cogliardi, and Manju Ismael (all SPR).

SPILLOVER REPORTS
Spillover reports examine the external effects of policies in five systemic economies (the “S5”):
China, the Euro Area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The mere existence of
external effects does not imply that policy modification or collective action is needed—that
depends on many factors, including the presence of economic externalities. The aim is to
stimulate discussion, providing a global perspective for policy advice in Article IV discussions and
input to the Fund’s broader multilateral surveillance.
In each case, key partners are asked about outward spillovers from the economy in question, on
the basis of which staff choose issues for analysis. To facilitate candor, spillover reports do not cite
who raises a specific issue. For this report, those consulted were officials and analysts from the
other S5 and from selected emerging markets—Brazil, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Korea,
Mexico, Poland, Russia, Singapore, and Thailand.
This report does not try to capture the totality of U.S. influence on the world economy. Rather, it
focuses on a few forward-looking issues raised by partners, brings to bear relevant analysis, and
describes the reactions of the U.S. authorities. Technical papers underlying the analysis can be
found in a companion Selected Issues paper (www.imf.org). A separate report will summarize the
cross-cutting themes emerging from discussions with the S5.

SETTING THE SCENE: THE SIZE AND SOURCES OF U.S.

scarce for major global banks and quasi-banks dependent on dollar wholesale funding. With credit
to households, firms, and importers suddenly curtailed, confidence collapsed alongside private
spending. This led to the deepest and most synchronized world recession since the 1930s, consistent
with research finding that U.S. growth spillovers are large and transmitted mainly via financial
channels.
2.

Simulations involving “standard” international links typically report small U.S. growth

spillovers. Standard macroeconomic models focus mainly on links via exports and imports, which
depend on activity and exchange
rates (the latter driven by interest
rate

differentials),

as

as

spillovers are generally limited as
bilateral trade and portfolio links
are fairly small, particularly across
systemic countries whose size and
diversity tends to make them
relatively closed to external trade. U.S. trade is a major driver of activity only in Canada and Mexico,

immediate neighbors and signatories to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well
as the Caribbean and Central America.
3.

U.S. markets are central to global asset pricing, an aspect not well captured in

conventional policy simulations. The United States accounts for about one-third of both global
stock and bond market capitalization. However, the true importance of U.S. markets is captured by
turnover—they represent close to two-thirds of equity and government bond market turnover in the
S5. Deep markets and the accompanying vast volume of market analysis mean that, despite the
strong domestic orientation of U.S. markets, U.S. financial assets are bellwethers for global prices.
Consistent with this central role in global price discovery, numerous studies have found that U.S.
news is a major driver of foreign asset prices, while foreign events have only weak effects on U.S.
asset prices.
4.

These financial market ties are a major conduit spreading the impact of U.S. policies

abroad. Analysis using different techniques consistently finds that a change in U.S. bond yields has a
significant impact on yields in
other countries and the ratio
for equity price changes is
larger still (Selected Issues,
Chapters

1–3).

While

spirits” associated with private

asset prices on a standard macroeconomic model generates larger and more plausible international
spillovers.
5.

Beyond close neighbors, spillovers via global asset prices are estimated to typically

dominate trade channels. The relative importance of these two channels can be assessed by
comparing outcomes from a standard macroeconomic model with those from the same model with
typical international bond and equity price associations superimposed. Results across a mix of
shocks indicate that spillovers via financial market channels typically dominate beyond close
neighbors or countries with extensive capital controls (China and, in bond markets, India). For most

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

UNITED STATES

G20 countries, a one percentage point increase in U.S. growth is estimated to raise growth by
around half a percentage point, with some three-quarters of the impact coming via asset prices. By
contrast, overall Canadian and Mexican growth spillovers are estimated at more like four-fifths of a
percent, with trade channels accounting for two-thirds of the total. During the crisis, the impact of
disruptions in U.S. wholesale funding on global banking added a further layer to spillovers via
financial channels, explaining the virulence of cross-border effects at the time.
6.

The critical role of financial prices in spillovers underscores the importance of the

macroeconomic and financial environment. Given the forward-looking nature of asset markets,
spillovers will in part
depend

upon

the

factors prompting the
policy change and the
overall environment in
which

the

policy

change takes place. As

significantly over time.
In what follows, event studies—which have been applied by others to identify the domestic impacts
of U.S. policies over the crisis—are used to assess international impacts (Selected Issues, Chapter 2).
While such analysis by its nature measures only initial financial market responses, it provides a
powerful tool for considering potential asset price linkages associated with specific policy decisions.
7.

Some senior U.S. officials were sympathetic to staff analysis, while others were less

convinced on the size and sources of spillovers. Some senior officials agreed that spillovers
appear to travel largely through financial market prices adding that uncertainty about the reasons
for these asset price correlations implied equal uncertainty about the underlying channels of
transmission. Other senior officials, pointing to factors such as global risk-aversion, were less
convinced that financial market connections (which in any case could reflect real sector behavior)
predominated in the transmission of shocks, and pointed to the lower estimates of U.S. spillovers in
Chapter 4 of the Spring 2007 World Economic Outlook. Officials also noted that while U.S. policies
inevitably created positive and negative spillovers, this did not imply that the U.S. should counteract
such effects. Staff agreed, noting that one goal of spillover reports was to support analysis by other
countries of changes to the global environment.

UNITED STATES 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

BACKGROUND: MAPPING THE LINKAGES
A. Direct Financial Ties
8.

The pivotal role of dollar markets in the global economy is reflected in the

composition of U.S. net international liabilities, the largest in the world. Reflecting the dollar’s
status as the main global reserve asset, the United States has massive net bond debt, worth almost
10 percent of global GDP and implying relatively large wealth spillovers. The net debt ratio has
almost doubled since 2000, with foreign official holdings of U.S. Treasuries ballooning from half to
three-quarters of the total. U.S. gross bond liabilities of 13 percent of global GDP comprise about
equal quantities of government and private debt, plus a large amount of quasi-government
“agency” bonds dominated by the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. By contrast, the
United States has a positive net asset position in equities and foreign direct investment.
9.

Bilateral portfolio links are strongest for major reserve holders and financial centers,

focused on public and private bonds, respectively:


Net holdings of U.S. bonds are particularly large (over 5 percent of GDP) in some major reserveholding emerging markets—most notably China. Demand for reserves has helped lower U.S.
yields (see the China Spillover Report).



Financial centers such as the United Kingdom hold large amounts of (mainly private) U.S. debt.
However, this is offset by large reciprocal U.S. holdings of foreign assets.



Foreign holdings of U.S. equities and U.S. holdings of foreign equities are both large. This is
particularly true in advanced economies (given deep markets that allow more scope for portfolio
allocation) and the Americas (given proximity).



The stock of U.S. foreign direct investment is large in close neighbors (reflecting trade links) and
other English-speaking advanced economies. Foreign direct investment flows, however, are
increasingly focused on emerging markets and low income countries.

B. Trade Relationships
10.

The United States plays an important, but not predominant, role in global trade. U.S.

trade is second to Euro area trade in value, and is only slightly larger than that of China, whose
smaller economic size is offset by higher trade openness. The limited role played by the United
States in global trade partly reflects its relatively low level of export compared to other systemic
countries, reflected in the huge U.S. trade deficit and large trade surpluses of China and Japan. U.S.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

UNITED STATES

imports, conversely, are around the same size as those of the Euro area and larger than those of the
other systemic economies.
11.

Bilateral spillovers from U.S. real activity and competitiveness are largest for

neighboring countries:


U.S. activity and trade volumes. For trade volumes in goods and services, the strongest spillovers
are on NAFTA countries, Central America, and Asia. These estimates adjust for international
supply chains (see Selected Issues. Chapters 5–6, and the China and Japan Spillover Reports).



U.S. activity and the terms of trade. Spillovers are largest for the Middle East, Africa, and some oil
producers. Higher U.S. activity mainly boosts global demand and prices of cyclically sensitive
commodities such as fuels and metals.



Competitiveness. The bilateral effects of dollar fluctuations tend to diminish with distance. Dollar
appreciation increases output in NAFTA members and parts of Central America, as well as in Asia
and parts of South America (Selected Issues, Chapter 5 discusses the impact on trade
composition).

12.

Low income countries’ linkages with the United States vary across regions. Workers’

remittances are important inflows to Central America (they also matter for Mexico), while tourism
and financial services are crucial for many countries in the Caribbean. By contrast, links with low
income African countries come mainly via commodity prices, while in the case of Asia demand for
basic manufactured goods (such as textiles) matters most.

C. Asset Price Links
13.

A percentage point rise in the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield is associated with

significant global market effects that have changed dramatically over the crisis (Figure 1).
Before the crisis typical relationships were:


Foreign bond yields. Advanced economy bond yields typically rose by 0.4 percentage points, the
effect being larger for Australia and Canada and lower for Japan. Most emerging market dollar
bond yields showed a larger rise—more like 0.8 percentage points—except in China and India
where capital controls prevented any significant impact.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

2011 SPILLOVER REPORT



UNITED STATES

Exchange rates. A nominal depreciation against the dollar of 1–2 percent in financially open
economies, but little impact on emerging markets with managed exchange rates. This resulted in
nominal effective appreciation in countries with managed rates, and depreciations elsewhere.



A fall in commodity prices and little effect on global risk appetite. The commodity effect was
particularly important for growth prospects in emerging markets that are commodity producers.



These associations were consistent with markets identifying increases in U.S. yields with higher U.S.
growth prospects and expected monetary tightening. The dollar typically appreciated as capital
flowed from other countries to the United States.

14.

Post-crisis, rising Treasury yields became associated with better global financial

sentiment and capital outflows from the United States. With abundant liquidity providing
incentives to invest spare cash and the zero federal funds rate allowing cheap dollar funding, safe
haven considerations (or the converse) came to dominate market responses. In contrast to the precrisis norm, rising U.S. yields was associated with improvements in global risk appetite, increases in
commodity prices, higher equity valuations, and depreciations of the dollar (except against other
low-interest-rate currencies also used for cheap funding such as the yen). The pre-crisis positive link
between Treasury and emerging market yields disappeared, possibly because capital inflows to
emerging markets associated with better global prospects offset the usual upward pressure on local
bond yields.
15.

The timing of the return to more typical asset price relationships, and the nature of

the “new normal,” is a key uncertainty in assessing future policy spillovers. While there is no
strong evidence of such a reversion at this point, rising U.S. Treasury yields should at some point
again become more an indicator of future monetary policy tightening than of better global market
sentiment. At that point, capital would likely flow back into the United States in response to higher
Treasury yields, rather than away from it—although (as event studies suggest) correlations among
bond yields may also be less tight post-crisis because of changing perceptions of relative fiscal risks
between emerging and advanced economies.

D. Global Liquidity
16.

Deep asset and money markets that channel liquidity globally largely explain the

central U.S. role in financial intermediation and the virulence of crisis spillovers:

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT



U.S. assets dominate collateralized credit markets. The short-term nature of secured lending and
repurchase agreements explains why many banks quickly found it difficult and increasingly
costly to obtain term dollar funding as collateral and counterparty risks rose over the crisis.



The United States also has the largest global pension, mutual fund, and insurance industries given
its wealth and limited social safety net relative to other advanced economies. This “real money”
investor base is central to the U.S. arm’s-length, bond-based financing model.



Dollar wholesale funding is further boosted by the fact that large money market mutual funds are
an intrinsically U.S. phenomenon. Their systemic role was confirmed by the Treasury’s guarantee
program after a fund “broke the buck” during the crisis.



Strains in dollar funding over the crisis were partly relieved by swap arrangements between the
Fed and other central banks. The continuing importance of this channel is underlined by the
latest extension of these swap arrangements through August 2012.

17.

The importance of dollar wholesale funding explains the heavy foreign presence in the

U.S. banking system despite the domestic focus of U.S. markets. Foreign banks have some
$5.4 trillion of assets in the United States versus U.S. banks’ $2.5 trillion of assets abroad, the largest
difference in the world. Most other advanced-economy banks have major U.S. operations, while U.S.
commercial banks tend to be more engaged in emerging markets (Selected Issues, Chapter 7).
18.

Pension and mutual fund outflows from the United States are larger and more

diversified than inflows, again reflecting the role of New York in wholesale funding. Large
gross inflows and outflows from and to offshore centers such as the Cayman Islands reflect the
complex financial engineering and book-entry practices prevalent in modern financial markets.
However, the United States is also a significant net supplier of funds to countries as diverse as Brazil,
Egypt, and India, underscoring the global reach of its role as a financial intermediary (see the U.K.
Spillover Report for a related discussion of the role of London as an international financial center).

MOTIVATION: VIEWS OF OTHER AUTHORITIES ON U.S.
POLICY SPILLOVERS
19.

The support to global demand provided by U.S. policies was generally welcomed by

foreign officials. While acknowledging the benefits of macroeconomic policies supporting U.S.
growth, concern was often voiced that U.S. policies and those of other systemic economies were
designed only to solve their own domestic difficulties, and could cause problems elsewhere. In

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

UNITED STATES

particular, U.S. policy slippages could lead to further capital inflows, spikes in inflation, and risked a
hard landing for foreign growth.
20.


Monetary policy was generally seen as the main area that gave rise to spillovers:
Several authorities were concerned that ample global liquidity had raised commodity prices and
fed into inflation, which could become entrenched. Several interlocutors ascribed these
developments to quantitative easing, sometimes arguing that the 2010 easing (“QE2”) was more
important than Chinese demand in stoking commodity prices. By contrast, authorities in one
country made a point of stating they did not believe U.S. monetary policy had an impact on
commodity prices.



Currency strength and strong capital inflows in some countries were often seen as partly the result
of QE2. U.S. monetary policy was described as an important push factor for capital flows, while
pull factors were also acknowledged to have had a role.



Views on the appropriate countervailing policies were mixed. Some authorities saw exchange rate
flexibility/appreciation as the best tool to address capital inflows, and resisting appreciation as
only leading to higher flows. Authorities in several economies with restrictions on the capital
account, however, mentioned that they did not receive massive capital inflows as a result of QE2.
Others saw U.S. monetary policy as counteracting their own exchange rate strategy, and in some
cases new capital restrictions were seen as having helped dampen flows.



Some were concerned that the unwinding of QE2 and/or U.S. policy rate hikes could trigger
damaging capital flow reversals. As returns on investment picked up in the United States and
other advanced economies, funds would be diverted back to the source markets. Furthermore,
monetary policy in some countries might have become more synchronized with that of the
United States, exacerbating spillovers: when the U.S. tightens, others would also see the need to
tighten further.

21.

Fiscal policies in advanced countries with unsustainable current deficits, including the

United States, were often described as having raised global tail risks. Concern was expressed
over the possibility of a market reassessment of U.S. fiscal sustainability which could lead to a rapid
deterioration in global financing conditions, capital flows, and possibly the value of the dollar:


Global bond yields could rise rapidly if markets demanded higher premiums against fiscal risks (as
well as possible inflation concerns). Other countries could face a sudden stop in capital inflows
given increased U.S. financing needs.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT



Fiscal risks were also described as complicating the task of rebalancing the growth model of some
countries. Such rebalancing might have to be undertaken against the background of weak
foreign demand and financial conditions, volatile currency and capital flows, and questions
about the safety of dollar denominated foreign assets.

22.


U.S. financial sector policies were also cited as a potential source of spillovers:
Authorities in some countries noted the importance of better supervisory cooperation. They
observed that if financial channels dominate in transmitting spillovers, then better regulatory
and supervisory cooperation may be at least as important as macroeconomic policy
coordination, the current focus of international efforts.



The Dodd–Frank Act in particular was seen as potentially having spillover effects via regulatory
arbitrage, although the channels were uncertain. Authorities in one country also expressed
concern that a commitment to not bail out systemic financial institutions could be disruptive if
carried out bluntly or time-inconsistently.



Limited supervision of money market funds, upon which many non-U.S. banks depend for
wholesale funding, was seen as adding fragility to the global financial system. Potential spillovers
from deleveraging of U.S. financial institutions affected by, say, new losses on commercial
property were also mentioned as a risk.

ANALYSIS: POLICY SPILLOVERS
23.

Further fiscal stimulus and QE in 2010 have increased the likelihood of negative

spillovers when macroeconomic policy support is reversed. With policy options diminishing and
further delay of fiscal consolidation increasingly problematic, deficit reduction could occur more
abruptly than earlier envisaged. This would improve U.S. saving, reduce global imbalances and real
interest rates, and lower the risk that concerns about the long-term fiscal path will lead to a rapid
increase in bond yields. However, it will also dampen U.S. growth and could delay monetary
tightening. When it comes, such tightening is likely to reverse some capital flows to emerging
markets with open capital accounts by reducing interest rate differentials, particularly if it occurs at a
faster-than-anticipated pace. Meanwhile, implementation of the Dodd–Frank Act could put further
pressure on bank credit, including cross-border lending.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13

2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

UNITED STATES

A. Monetary Policy: Quantitative Easing and Future Rate Hikes
24.

Concerns over monetary policy spillovers currently focus on the global impact of the

end of quantitative easing and eventual Fed rate hikes at some point in the future. While fiscal
policy operates on U.S. aggregate demand directly, with financial market effects as a by-product
partly offsetting the impact on growth, monetary policy acts primarily through financial markets and
hence international asset price linkages will normally amplify spillovers. This may be even more true
currently, as very low interest rates may increase incentives to take financial risks. Spillovers from
unexpected potential global asset price shifts reinforce the case for clear communication of future
monetary policy intentions.
25.

Estimated asset price spillovers of QE1 announcements are larger than pre-crisis

monetary policy messages, while QE2 announcement spillovers appear generally smaller
(Figure 2, top panel). Event studies were used to estimate the response of foreign asset prices per
unit impact on U.S. 10-year bond yields and equity prices:


Both sets of easing announcements were associated with declines in foreign bond yields, but the
response seems to have been notably larger for QE1. A similar pattern emerges for appreciation in
dollar exchange rates and higher U.S. inflation expectations.



Unlike QE1 or pre-crisis policy announcements, QE2 announcements do not appear to be
associated with a short-term improvement in global financial conditions. This is true for the VIX
(i.e., global risk appetite), oil and nonoil commodity prices, and global equity prices. This
divergence appears to largely explain the more muted effects of QE2 on foreign bond
yields/dollar exchange rates.



These asset price responses were generally similar to pre-crisis monetary policy announcements
and significantly different from “typical” post-crisis ones. Event studies of policy announcements
involve a range of identifying assumptions. Yet the abnormal foreign asset price knock-ons
uncovered suggests that this approach may provide a reasonable, albeit imprecise, estimate of
global financial market effects.



Vector autoregressions fitted to weekly data find that quantitative easing announcements were
associated with higher capital inflows to emerging market bond and equity funds (Selected Issues,
Chapter 8). Actual Fed purchases of securities (i.e., implementation of the announcements) did
not appear to affect such inflows.

2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

26.

UNITED STATES

Growth spillovers from U.S. monetary policy were assessed by incorporating estimated

asset price linkages from event studies into macro model simulations. Policy simulations were
used to illustrate how estimated short-term impacts of policy announcements on asset prices (based
on event studies) could percolate into activity. Pre-crisis spillovers were calculated by incorporating
into a macroeconomic model estimated knock-ons between U.S. monetary policy (via U.S. asset
prices) and foreign bond yields, equity prices, and exchange rates. The results suggest somewhat
larger growth spillovers (per percentage point change in U.S bond yields) than those from the
generic shock reported in Section I, with the main channel being via bond yields (Figure 2, middle
panel and Selected Issues, Chapter 9).
27.

Growth spillovers from QE1 announcements are also estimated to have been larger

than pre-crisis monetary policy spillovers would suggest, and those from QE2 smaller (Figure
2, bottom panel). This ordering of the size of spillovers holds across a wide range of economies,
reflecting the more positive international financial market knock-ons estimated for QE1 than for
QE2. Analysis of the latter is complicated by the marked improvement in global financial conditions
not long after Chairman Bernanke’s August 2010 speech at Jackson Hole announcing QE2. Extensive
analysis fails to establish a link between QE2 announcements and this development. However, if
larger spillovers of the type estimated for QE1 are assumed, it is important that the full array of
effects—on risk aversion, exchange rates, and commodity prices—be jointly considered, rather than
focusing on some and not others.
28.

Looking forward, some reversal of inflows to emerging markets is likely when markets

start expecting monetary tightening over the near future. With the end of QE2 having been fully
anticipated, its impact has likely already been absorbed by markets. By contrast, when the Fed
eventually starts to prepare to tighten policies, including by draining liquidity, it could cause a jump
in Treasury yields and sharper capital outflows from emerging markets, particularly if the move was
unexpected. This is because such a shift would be the precursor to future rate hikes (or swift balance
sheet unwinding) thereby signaling smaller interest rate differentials and either greater confidence
in the U.S. expansion or rising inflationary pressures (see also Chapter 3 of the Spring 2011 World
Economic Outlook).
29.

The monetary policy dilemmas facing emerging markets are generally more acute than

for advanced economies. Limited market depth makes emerging market financial conditions
particularly susceptible to changing capital flows. Against a background of diverse monetary
regimes, spillovers from U.S. monetary policy in any one country depend partly on exchange rate
policies elsewhere, as the benefits (costs) to foreign activity of a dollar appreciation (depreciation)
will be amplified if a close trading partner fixes to the dollar. This helps explain why exchange rate
volatility versus the dollar tends to be regional, with much lower volatility in Asia and the Middle

Senior Fed officials were qualitatively comfortable with staff views on spillover

channels from QE2 but less concerned about capital flow reversals. Regarding the impact of
eventual monetary exit, emerging market capital flows were seen as mainly involving a structural
component rather than a cyclical component that could be reversed, so that U.S. monetary
tightening shouldn’t constitute an untoward shock. In a market environment where the “winds had
shifted”, they felt that reactions of some authorities to QE2 may well have reflected strong cyclical
positions that made the boost to global activity less attractive than was true at the time of QE1.
Officials stressed that the FOMC was fully committed to be as transparent as possible, and agreed
that good communication would make for a smoother exit from the zero bound.

B. Fiscal Policy: Stimulus and Consolidation
31.

Concerns over fiscal spillovers are largely focused on the risks from a loss of market

confidence in the U.S. fiscal policy trajectory. In principle, fiscal consolidation creates permanent
positive growth spillovers via lower global real interest rates as well as short-term negative spillovers
via losses in U.S. activity. In order to assess the net spillover effects from U.S. fiscal policy, a multi-

UNITED STATES

pronged approach was used, combining standard regression analysis; macroeconomic model
simulations allowing for various degrees of credibility and financial linkages; and event studies
focusing on the possible impact of key fiscal policy announcements on the relationship between U.S.
Treasury yields and foreign asset prices.
32.

The long-term impact of U.S. fiscal consolidation on foreign output is positive as lower

U.S. government debt and higher saving reduce global real interest rates. Staff regression
analysis finds that each percentage point reduction in the U.S. general government debt-to-GDP
ratio lowers global real interest rates by 3–4 basis points over the long run, consistent with the
prevailing literature (Selected Issues, Chapter 10). Macroeconomic model simulations then suggest
that the long-term boost to foreign potential output from a 10 basis point permanent reduction in
global real interest rates is a fairly uniform 0.1 percent (Figure 3, top panel). Importantly, this would
also help rebalance global demand by reducing the U.S. current account deficit.
33.

The short-term impact on foreign activity from a typical pre-crisis fiscal consolidation

is estimated to be generally small and its sign uncertain (Figure 3 middle panel, and Selected
Issues, Chapter 11). While results vary somewhat with assumptions about the size, speed, credibility,
and composition of the package as well as the monetary policy response to it, for a generic fiscal
stimulus the following general observations can be made:


For close trading partners such as Canada and Mexico short-term losses through trade generally
dominate. This also holds for countries with extensive capital controls, most notably China and
(for bond markets) India.



Elsewhere, the net impact is generally small and ambiguous. Using the foreign bond yield and
exchange rate co-movements implied by a generic pre-crisis budget announcement, the net
impact on output is found to be relatively limited.



Nonetheless, there are significant implications for trade and the composition of demand. Although
the net effects on foreign output are small relative to the impact on U.S. output, this conceals a
significant shift between external and domestic demand, at least for countries with flexible
exchange rates.

34.

The 2009 fiscal stimulus is estimated to have led to larger-than-expected support to

foreign activity while, if anything, the 2010 package likely had the opposite effect. Event
studies find that the estimated spillover from U.S. to foreign bond yields in response to stimulus
announcements in 2009 was generally more limited than would have been expected given pre-crisis
experiences. Illustrative policy simulations of a generic fiscal package generate correspondingly

more-positive growth spillovers. Conversely, the relatively strong estimated bond market links after
the 2010 stimulus announcement imply less benign spillovers. This underlines the importance of
market sentiment in understanding global effects: in 2009, facing the risk of a Depression, U.S. fiscal
expansion may well have led to a lowering of foreign bond risk premiums that largely offset the
crowding out from higher U.S. government debt; by 2010, this effect appears to have reversed. It
also emphasizes the importance of adopting a clear medium-term fiscal framework.
35.

Looking ahead, a gradual, credible U.S. deficit reduction is unlikely to have major

growth spillovers, particularly compared to those from a loss of fiscal credibility (Figure 3,
bottom panel). Measured, well articulated, and credible fiscal consolidation that culminates in a
major reduction in U.S. government debt as a ratio to GDP would likely provide positive net
spillovers to the rest of the world in the short-run via lower bond yields than otherwise—
notwithstanding their current low levels in the United States and some foreign economies—
although a less credible adjustment could generate more generalized short-term output losses
abroad. Gradual consolidation also reduces the tail risk of a global bond market event where
investors would lose confidence in the ability of the United States to respond decisively to its
looming fiscal challenges. Such a loss in confidence would generate major negative spillovers to the
rest of the world given the role of U.S. government bond yields as global benchmarks.
36.

Senior officials generally agreed on the importance of having a credible fiscal path to

avoid crowding out and head-off tensions on U.S. and possibly global interest rates. They were
less optimistic, however, on the short-run benefits of consolidation, as crowding out was not
thought to be currently operative given low credit demand and bond yields. They cautioned that the
negative short-run impact (including on foreign economies) from severe and frontloaded U.S. fiscal
tightening could plausibly be large.

C. Financial Policy: Investment Banking and the Dodd-Frank Act
37.

Disruptions in U.S. financial markets after the Lehman bust created major negative

growth spillovers and exposed flaws in U.S. financial oversight. Regulators had made a sharp
distinction between banks, subject to prudential supervision and special resolution procedures and
with access to Fed liquidity, and nonbanks (notably investment banks, also known as broker-dealers)
where supervision was focused on market conduct and official liquidity/resolution were not
available. In response to the chaos in wholesale funding markets after the collapse of Lehman,
access to Fed liquidity support was rapidly widened to include major investment banks, money
market funds, and selected foreign central banks.
38.

U.S. wholesale funds are generally channeled to the global banking system via major

investment banks as well as money market mutual funds. In addition to U.S.-owned broker-

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

dealers (such as Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Citigroup Global Markets that have become or already
were part of bank holding companies) several large northern European banks have U.S. operations
deeply involved in investment banking. These include Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, and
UBS. In addition to the much simpler U.S. money market funds—which just on-lend short-term
funds—investment banks are the arteries that connect the global banking system to U.S. securities
and wholesale funding, often through the more internationalized U.K. markets (see the U.K. Spillover
Report). Their systemic role was confirmed by the Fed’s emergency lending actions during the crisis.
39.

Wholesale funding uncertainties likely explain why co-movements of major U.S. and

European bank equity returns have become much tighter since the crisis (Figure 4, top panel).
Banking spillovers are measured using “beta” coefficients that estimate how excess equity returns of
major foreign commercial and investment banks (i.e., bank stock returns relative to the overall
market) react to U.S. bank excess returns. Before the crisis, only the major Swiss banks had a beta of
over one-quarter. After the crisis, this was also true of major U.K., German, French, and Italian
banks—especially investment banks. The dependence of European banks on U.S. wholesale funding
provides a potential conduit for a European financial shock to affect the rest of the world (see the
Euro area Spillover Report).
40.

Dollar markets stretch well beyond U.S. borders, reinforcing spillovers while limiting

the impact of U.S. regulatory choices. This reflects the global role of the dollar as a reserve
currency and liquid store of value. Pre-crisis, U.S. regulations were often circumvented by investment
banks moving trades to less-regulated markets; for example, looser U.K. rules on collateral
“rehypothecation” drove some prime-brokerage business to London (see the U.K. Spillover Report).
More generally, financial centers tend to have complementary strengths, e.g., New York’s deep
securities markets and London’s derivatives focus and internationalism. Indeed, the nexus between
the U.S. and U.K. dollar markets is symbolized by the fact that the world’s most important private
short-term dollar interest rate—the London inter-bank offered rate or LIBOR—is determined in
London and only three of the 16 banks on the panel are U.S.-based.
Consistent with the crisis experience, significant spillovers are estimated to come from
widespread U.S. wholesale funding disruption. Such disruption crystallized after Lehman’s failure
caused counterparty risks on other banks to jump on fears of a systemic crisis. This is illustrated by
simulations using data on cross-border loans between U.S. and foreign-based banks to calibrate the
knock-ons from disruptions in U.S. wholesale funding costs on foreign funding costs. The same
model also provides estimates of the (potentially significant) growth spillovers of U.S. regulatory
capital top-ups for systemic players mandated by the Dodd–Frank Act (Selected Issues, Chapter 12).
In that case, however, costs must be viewed against the gains from greater financial stability.

41.

The U.S. structural response to these pressures was embodied in the July 2010 Dodd–

Frank Act, the biggest reform of U.S. financial regulations since the 1930s. As elaborated in last
year’s U.S. Financial Assessment Program (FSAP), the Act strengthens the Fed’s consolidated
supervisory powers over bank holding companies (which now include all major U.S.-owned brokerdealers) but retains an element of “deference” to the securities and futures regulators. It establishes
a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) that makes the regulatory perimeter dynamic by
permitting any financial firm to be designated as systemic and brought under Fed oversight. The
Fed may only lend to systemic nonbanks in extremis, however, with “Volcker rules” separating retail
banking from more risky proprietary trading. The Act also creates a resolution mechanism for
systemic holding companies.

options (Selected Issues, Chapter 13). The positive relationship over the crisis between risks to
individual banks and systemic risk seems to have flattened after the Act was passed, consistent with
its core objective—thereby containing spillovers.
43.

A signal moment in the regulatory reform process appears to have been President

Obama’s speech on financial regulation in January 2010. The speech provoked a major market
response, with negative excess returns on bank equity simultaneously in the United States and much
of Europe (Figure 4, middle panel). More than the specifics, it would appear that the speech
telegraphed U.S. seriousness on tightening financial regulations, with the market reaction confirming
perceptions of U.S. leadership and expectations that similar regulatory stringency would follow in
other jurisdictions. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the impact on banking systems

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 23

2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

UNITED STATES

outside of Europe, that were more highly capitalized and less dependent on wholesale funding, was
considerably more muted.
44.

Market responses to subsequent Dodd–Frank announcements, however, may raise

concerns about regulatory arbitrage between the United States and Europe. Announcements
that led to increases (decreases) in excess returns on major U.S. banks are estimated to have led to
oppositely signed excess returns on major U.K. and Swiss banks (Figure 4, bottom panel). Such
opposing movements could indicate that markets may have seen these regulations as changing the
relative competitive position of U.S. and European banks, rather than promulgating internationally
consistent policy initiatives.
45.

Going forward, decisions by the Oversight Council and proactive supervision by the

Fed will matter deeply for international financial stability. Given the importance of U.S.
wholesale funding for foreign banks and the role of U.S.-based investment banks as conduits,
Council decisions on which institutions to designate as systemic will be key. Strong international
links—which could rebound back onto U.S. financial stability—strengthen the case for designating
all U.S.- and foreign-owned major investment banks as systemic and putting them under Fed
umbrella supervision. Inside the perimeter, the equally difficult challenge will be to successfully
prudentially supervise investment banks with highly malleable balance sheets. This may test the
effectiveness of the FSOC, as the systemic overseer, to coordinate across specialized regulators.
46.

Ideally, U.S. rules governing trading and funding activities will be closely synchronized

with other major international financial centers—especially the United Kingdom. In practice,
however, regulatory coordination seems strongest in the commercial banking context. New U.S.
regulations risk pushing trading activities to less regulated sectors or jurisdictions. Already, major
European investment banks have dissolved their U.S. bank holding companies to avoid higher
capital requirements, while Volcker rules have led to the spin-off of trading activities to unregulated
entities with strong but implicit links to regulated affiliates.
47.

The authorities underlined that U.S. financial regulatory reform was geared toward

achieving international consistency on big-picture issues. With capital standards being left to
Basel, U.S. law is meant to augment the framework through systemic surcharges and responsibility
fees, which were seen as examples of U.S. leadership. Some U.S.-specific measures, such as the
Volcker rules, were not necessarily meant to be adopted by others. Large investment banks would
be designated as systemic nonbanks and subjected to the same scrutiny as large bank holding
companies. Nevertheless, regulatory arbitrage is recognized as a reality necessitating coordination
through the Financial Stability Board.

CONCLUSIONS
48.

The size of the U.S. economy and, in particular, the global dominance of its financial

markets create uniquely large policy spillovers. Beyond close neighbors, these come largely
through links associated with global financial asset prices, which directly affect financial conditions
abroad and seep into domestic activity everywhere. These spillovers strengthen the case for clear
communication of U.S. policies and for better-defined medium-term fiscal policy framework.
49.

Concerns that the end of QE2 could lead to a rapid reversal of emerging market capital

flows appear overblown. Markets reacted to quantitative easing announcements, with little or no
additional impact from actual purchases of assets. The fully anticipated end to QE2 seems unlikely to
provoke much market reaction. Emerging market capital flows are more likely to reverse as it
becomes apparent that the Fed will hike rates in the foreseeable future, signaling smaller interest
rate differentials and confidence in the U.S. expansion and/or fears about inflation.
50.

A credible plan for a gradual U.S. fiscal consolidation would likely have limited short-

term spillovers and substantial longer-term benefits. A gradual and credible consolidation would
raise U.S. national saving, lowering global real interest rates and imbalances over the medium-term.
Beyond close neighbors, negative spillovers from lower U.S. activity would likely be largely if not
completely offset by improved global financial market sentiment given the high level of U.S.
government deficits and debt.
51.

The risk of major spillovers from a freeze in dollar wholesale funding reinforces the

case for strong implementation of Dodd–Frank rules. Given the central role of U.S.-based (but
not necessarily U.S.-owned) investment banks in funneling dollar liquidity to the rest of the world,
stronger U.S. prudential supervision of these entities—preferably in concert with supervisors in other
major financial centers given the geographic mobility of trading activity—would help contain
renewed spillovers through this channel.
52.

Overall, U.S. and foreign goals appear better aligned for U.S. fiscal and financial

policies than for monetary policies. Fiscal consolidation and sounder financial regulation help
avoid global tail risks. While there may be disagreements about the pace and details of
implementation, all countries have a stake in a successful outcome. Monetary policy is more
complex. While spillovers from QE2 appear limited, low short-term interest rates and abundant
liquidity partly work by increasing incentives to take financial risks. This may be helpful for other
countries in a similar cyclical position, but can be more problematic for those with open capital
markets that have already shaken off the crisis and where investment opportunities are more
plentiful. These other countries, however, also have macroeconomic tools to steer their economies.

I. U.S. FINANCIAL SPILLOVERS: TYPICAL ADVANCED COUNTRY RESPONSES1
Endogenous estimates of spillovers from bond and equity price shocks across the United
States onto other systemically important economies are reported. Changes in U.S. market
prices are found to be the dominant source of global financial market spillovers, although
UK bond markets and Euro area equity markets also generate mild non-U.S. spillovers.
The analysis relies on end-of-week data for nominal long-term sovereign bond yields
and equity prices from 2000 through 2009 for the United States, the Euro area, Japan,
and the United Kingdom. These economies were chosen because of their importance in the
global economy and in financial markets. China—the remaining systemic country—was not
included in the analysis as its markets are still forming and its extensive capital controls limit
market spillovers. Euro area bond yields were proxied by German yields, while Euro area
equity prices were measured by the FTSEurofirst 300 index. A weekly frequency was chosen
as more relevant for macroeconomic analysis and avoiding the complications due to missing
data and overlapping trading hours at the daily frequency.
The estimation procedure endogenously estimates asset price spillovers. Linkages across
the four systemic bond yields and (separately) equity prices were identified using an
adaptation of the methodology due to Rigobon (2003).2 A structural vector auto regression
(VAR) was estimated in which contemporaneous correlations of shocks across asset prices
are identified by comparing the variance-covariance matrices in periods of high and low
volatility. In essence, a period t is assigned to be highly volatile if the observed normalized
error is x times of the overall sample standard deviation. To improve robustness, x is
incrementally increasing from 0.65 to 2. The analysis focuses on the international linkages
within each asset classes, thus bond yields and equity returns are considered separately.3
Outward spillovers from shocks to U.S. bond and stock markets are positive and large,
pointing to the role of the U.S. as the driver of global financial asset pricing. Financial
market spillovers are measured by cumulative changes in government long-term yields and
stock market indices over the 4-week period after a shock. Spillovers from U.S. market
shocks are larger than those of others systemic markets in both absolute and relative terms
(Figure 1.1). In the bond markets, estimation results show that a typical one-standarddeviation shock to U.S. 10-year yields (about 12 bps) leads to an increase of between 4 and

Ehrmann, Fratzscher, and Rigobon (2005) find that the strongest financial spillovers between the U.S. and the
Euro area take places within asset classes and indirect spillovers across domestic markets can magnify these
spillovers. However, due to the number of countries considered in this analysis, a VAR that encompasses both
within- and cross-markets linkages is less practical and its inference power is reduced substantially.

8 bps in foreign yields, implying spillover multipliers of 0.33 to 0.66: the smallest of these
are in Japan, and the largest in the Euro area. By contrast, inward spillovers to U.S. bond
yields are tiny (Figure 1.2). Similarly, outward spillovers from U.S. stock market shocks
have multipliers ranging from 0.5 (in Japan) to 0.8 (in Euro Area and the U.K.); whereas
shocks from other systemic equity markets have almost no impact on the S&P 500.

II. U.S. FINANCIAL SPILLOVERS: POLICY ANNOUNCEMENTS4
Event studies are used to estimate financial spillovers from U.S. policy announcements. The
impact on foreign asset prices has varied. The announcement that the Administration
supported tighter regulation of banks led to a generalized fall in European bank shares
relative to local equity markets. For other aspects of the Dodd-Frank legislation, however,
falls in U.S. bank equity prices were accompanied by increases in U.K. and Swiss major
bank valuations. Turning to macro policies, 2008/9 fiscal and monetary stimulus packages
generally supported foreign activity, while the impact of 2010 stimulus is less clear.
This chapter reports event studies that analyze the impact of U.S. financial, fiscal, and
monetary policies on foreign asset prices across a range of G20 countries. The analysis
looks first at “typical” responses of key foreign financial market prices to changes in U.S.
asset prices. Given this baseline, the analysis then examines whether the responses to various
types of U.S. policy announcements vary from this norm. A major complicating factor in this
analysis is that financial market linkages appear to have shifted dramatically at the onset of
the crisis. Hence, there are two “typical” relationships (pre- and post-crisis) to which policy
responses since the crisis can be compared.
For U.S. financial policies the analysis involves comparing the response of foreign bank
excess returns to its U.S. equivalent. Bank excess returns are defined as the difference
between changes in major bank equity prices to the local equity market, and measure the
market assessment of the change in the relative valuation of major banks compared to the
market as a whole.
For fiscal and monetary policies the main analysis examines the response of foreign
bond yields and exchange rates to changes in yields on the U.S. 10-year note. The
response of the 10-year yield is known to be a useful measure of the impact of fiscal
policies—which change the level of U.S. government borrowing and debt—and for U.S.
monetary policies (pre-crisis, changes in the yield on the 10-year note were found to be a
good measure of the unexpected element in U.S. monetary policy). Knock-on from these
yields to foreign yields and dollar/nominal effective exchange rates are a major potential
spillover to the rest of the world.
The specification for the event study regressions is based on a CAPM model with the
United States assumed to be the “market”. Hence, for example, foreign bond yields are
regressed on Treasury yields (plus other variables), with the coefficient on Treasury yields
being interpreted as the dependence of foreign yields on U.S. ones (the market “beta”). A
post-crisis dummy is included in the regression as many of these underlying relationships
appear to have shifted after early 2007 (results are robust to other plausible dates). Dummy

variables are also included on dates of policy announcements, with policies being regarded as
having a significant impact on foreign asset prices if the market response on days of
announcements is significantly different from the typical response indicated by the beta.
More specifically, the estimated equation was:
Δyit = αi + (βi+νi postcrisisit + γ’EVENTSit) ΔUS asset priceit + εit,
where yit is the foreign or global variable of interest (as discussed earlier, foreign excess bank
returns, foreign bond yields, or dollar exchange rates), postcrisisit is a dummy variable for the
period from the start of 2007 until the end of the sample, EVENTSit is a matrix of dummy
variables singling out policy announcements, and US asset priceit is the U.S. variable of
interest (U.S. bank excess returns or 10-year Treasury yields).
Responses to events were measured using the (time-zone adjusted) market response on
the day of the announcement. The short one-day window used in the baseline results
(which has also become typical in event studies of U.S. monetary policy over the crisis) was
used given the sheer number of shocks that were occurring over the crisis and post-crisis
period: a longer window increases the risk of conflating identified events with other
developments. Estimates using 2-, 5-, and 10-day windows produce similar results.
Results for announcements of the Dodd-Frank Act are summarized in Table 2.1. Links
between U.S. and European bank excess returns were transformed by the crisis. Pre-crisis,
only the Swiss beta exceeded 25 percent, implying that in all other cases a one percent U.S.
bank excess return was associated with less than ¼ percent in excess returns abroad. By
contrast, the post-crisis beta coefficient reported in the third column suggest that on a typical
post-crisis day some 60 percent of excess returns across major U.S. banks spillover to Swiss
banks, 50 percent to U.K. and German banks, and 40 30, and 20 percent to French, Italian,
and Spanish banks, respectively. This involves a major increase from the pre-crisis betas,
which is statistically significant except for Switzerland and Spain. By contrast, for nonEuropean banking systems post-crisis changes in already small betas are insignificant.
Spillovers from U.S. financial regulation depends on the issue being addressed:


The January 21, 2010 Obama speech backing a tough banking regulation lowered
U.S. and most European bank equity prices. The negative excess returns of the Swiss,
U.K., and German and French bank stocks were actually larger than those for U.S.
banks. The abnormal response largely reflects anticipation of tougher future domestic
bank regulation after the lead set by the United States.



Other Dodd-Frank announcements of tighter- (softer-) than-expected U.S. bank
regulation (hurt) bank excess returns in core European financial systems. The
impact is most concentrated in the Swiss and U.K. banks, suggesting that the
announced regulations were seen as putting U.S. banks at a competitive disadvantage

7
compared to counterparts in major European financial markets. This suggests that
markets may have perceived the potential for regulatory arbitrage.
Results for the impact of monetary and fiscal policies are summarized in Tables 2.2 and
2.3. Table 2.2 reports results of regressions linking changes in foreign bond yields to changes
in U.S. 10-year note yields. Table 2.3 reports changes in dollar exchange rates associated
with changes in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields. Results are reported for 6 country groupings:
Japan (singled out for its different post-crisis exchange rate responses); advanced country
commodity exporters (Australia and Canada); Korea and European advanced countries (Euro
area, Switzerland, and the U.K.); China (whose dollar peg and extensive capital controls set it
apart); financially open emerging markets (Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey); and
emerging markets which have less open financial systems (Indonesia and Russia). India is
included with China for bond analysis (given its capital controls on these instruments) but
with Russia and Indonesia for exchange rate and equity analysis.
Bilateral links between U.S. yields and those in emerging markets dissipated after the
crisis to these countries. Before 2007, a rise in U.S. bond yields had a pass-through of some
70 percent for financially open emerging market economies, slightly less for India and
Russia, and no link for China, the latter presumably reflecting capital controls. The results in
Table 2.2 suggest that these emerging market links basically disappeared after the crisis. By
contrast, links between U.S. yields and those of advanced economies with deeper financial
markets remained relatively constant over the crisis. The pre-crisis relationship whereby a
one-percentage point rise in U.S. yields led to a 40 basis point rise in European/Korean yields
and a 15 basis point rise in Japanese yields appears unaffected by the crisis. The link between
advanced commodity exporters yields and U.S. yields did fall modestly, from two-thirds to
one-half.
Results for “normal” policy announcements suggest that pre-crisis spillovers from U.S.
yields were largely driven by expectations about U.S. monetary policy. Budget
announcements appear to have no significant differential impact on foreign bond yields,
likely reflecting the fact that they were largely anticipated. Of considerably more interest is
the fact that pre-crisis FOMC announcements also did not show significant differential
impacts. This suggests that pre-crisis spillovers from U.S. bond yields largely reflected
shifting expectations about U.S. monetary policy. When the Fed Funds rate hit the lower
bound and the Fed vowed to keep it there for a considerable time, however, rises in bond
yields seem to have become proxies for U.S. and global risk aversion/growth prospects,
hence the lowering of the link with emerging market.
Shifts in the relationship with foreign exchange rates also suggest changes in the
information contained in U.S. yields and resulting capital flows (Table 2.3). Before the
crisis, rising U.S. 10-year yields were associated with significant depreciations against the
dollar in advanced economies and financially open emerging markets, consistent with a
generalized dollar appreciation from an expected tightening of U.S. monetary policies. By

8
contrast, there was no significant change for China, with its dollar peg, or Indonesia and
Russia, with their more managed exchange rates. Post-crisis, however, increases in U.S.
yields led to large appreciations in emerging markets, especially financially open ones, as
well as advanced economy commodity exporters. By contrast, the yen depreciated by even
more against the dollar when US yields rose, likely reflecting its status as a safe haven and a
vehicle currency for “carry trades”. U.S. yields had little impact on dollar exchange rates in
advanced Europe and Korea. These shifts are consistent with the view that post-crisis higher
U.S. yields led to capital flows into emerging markets and commodity producers and out of
advanced economies with low interest rates—especially Japan.
Results for announcements of the fiscal stimulus packages (in Tables 2.2-2.3) suggest
that the impact varies depending on the degree of financial turmoil. Fiscal stimulus
typically increases Treasury yields, so that positive relationships imply higher foreign yields
and negative foreign spillovers:


The 2009 package seems to have led to a delinking of European and Korean bond
yields, suggesting negative financial market spillovers were tempered.



The 2010 package seems to have been accompanied by larger-than-normal increases
in foreign yields and appreciation across a range of foreign currencies, suggesting
larger-than-typical negative asset market spillovers.

These shifting relationships can plausibly be linked to changing perceptions of financial
conditions. In 2009, when the world was engulfed in financial turmoil, fiscal stimulus led to
little change in yields as the reduction in global lower risk premiums offset the rise in yields
from anticipated higher U.S. debt. In 2010, when financial markets were in a more orderly
state, concerns about rising U.S. debt may have led to tighter links across global yields.
QE1 seems to have had much more positive impacts on foreign financial conditions
than QE2. In contrast to fiscal stimulus, QE works through lowering Treasury yields, and
hence tight positive links to Treasury yields imply positive spillovers to the rest of the world:


Post-crisis FOMC meetings without QE announcements have negative coefficient on
emerging market bond yields and larger-than-usual currency appreciations. This is
consistent with the view that greater optimism on U.S. growth, which drives up U.S.
bond yields, led to capital outflows to emerging markets



QE1 announcements and related declines in US bond yields were also associated
with large reductions in emerging market yields and currency appreciations (Tables
2.2 and 2.3). These emerging market responses seem to have boosted foreign demand
and capital outflows.



QE2 announcements had more muted effects on foreign markets than QE1 ones.

III. U.S. FINANCIAL SPILLOVERS: EMERGING MARKET BOND SPREADS5
To establish the potential effects of U.S. policy on foreign bond spreads, the relationship is
examined between emerging market spreads and global “push” factors (i.e. U.S. interest
rates and proxies for market pricing of risk) and country-specific “pull” factors (indicators
of domestic creditworthiness). The results indicate a clear and significant relationship
between spreads and the market price of risk. The link between U.S. policy interest rates and
emerging market spreads is less clear. From both a statistical and an economic point of
view, the better link is between spreads and long-term U.S. Treasury yields. In short, U.S.
policies seem to affect emerging market spreads through their impact on financial risk and
on U.S. long-term interest rates.
Panel regressions are run from 2000q1 to 2010q2 of emerging market spreads on
nominal U.S. interest rates, indicators of market risk, S&P long-term country credit
ratings and macroeconomic indicators of demand, solvency, and liquidity, such as GDP
growth, inflation, money multipliers, credit to GDP, and trade balances. More
specifically, fixed-effect panel regressions are run of (the logs or log differences of) JP
Morgan EMBI stripped spreads on:6


Foreign rates: U.S. Treasury yields (constant maturity), LIBOR, the Fed funds rate,
and Fed funds futures (1 month and 3 month);



Market risk: VIX or High Yield Spreads (difference between yields to maturity of
AAA and Baa corporate bonds);



Credit risk: Standard and Poors long-term credit outlook ratings (converted to linear
and quadratic scales, with a binary dummy for junk vs non-junk ratings);



Determinants of domestic risk: Macroeconomic indicators of the business cycle,
liquidity and solvency.7

The results indicate that push factors play a significant role in emerging market bond
spreads. U.S. interest rates and global risk measures explain over half of the variation
in spreads.8,9 EM spreads move one-for-one with the U.S. high yield spread (a proxy for

risk).10 Depending on the specification used, a 100 basis point decrease in yields on 10-year
Treasuries would be associated with a 60–115 basis point reduction in EM spreads.
The relationship between EM spreads and U.S. short rates (including Fed funds rate
and futures) is only sometimes significant and most often negative (depending on other
conditioning variables used). This negative coefficient on U.S. short-term interest rates and
the consistently positive coefficients on U.S. long-term yields could indicate “carry-trade”
type effects, but the restriction of including only the term premium is rejected. Results from
rolling regressions of rates and spreads at daily frequency show that the coefficients on U.S.
short-term interest rates are unstable (they fluctuate between negative and positive values).
Our preferred model is therefore to think of U.S. monetary policy having effects on longterm U.S. Treasury yields, which are then associated with changes in spreads.
Such a result has an interesting implication. Whereas many other studies focus on the
effect of U.S. monetary policy, the strong association with longer-term results suggests that
other policies could have an effect on spreads and net funding rates. Most obviously,
unconventional monetary policy measures designed to reduce longer-term rates will have
implications for spreads. Fiscal policy decisions could affect term premiums, with
consequent implications for spreads.11

9

Of the macroeconomic indicators, only growth and inflation are consistently significant, but ratings are
consistently significant.
10

The high-yield spread fits the data slightly better, but is highly correlated with the VIX at daily and quarterly
frequencies.
11

There is also the possibility that U.S. policy actions, to the extent that they increase or reduce market
uncertainty, could also have an effect on spreads via the market price of risk.

IV. U.S. GROWTH SPILLOVERS: TYPICAL RESPONSES12
Business cycle spillovers from U.S. growth shocks via international trade and financial
linkages are analyzed using a refined version of the structural G-20 macroeconometric
model reported in Vitek (2010).13Financial links are found to be important for spillovers.
A. Spillovers from U.S. Shocks Abstracting from Asset Price Links
On average, the peak impulse responses of output in the rest of the world to real and
financial shocks in the U.S. are increasing with geographical proximity (Figure 4.1). The
highest dependence is exhibited by Canada and Mexico, reflecting their strong trade and
financial linkages, followed by Saudi Arabia, reflecting its strong exchange rate and
commodity price linkages.
Figure 4.1: Average Peak Impulse
Responses of Output to Shocks in the U.S.

Spillovers from U.S. real and financial shocks in the U.S. to other systemic economies
are somewhat stronger than the reverse impact (Figure 4.2). This reflects the relatively
large economic size of the United States, together with its extensive international trade and
widely-held financial assets.

B. Spillovers from U.S. Shocks Accounting for Asset Price Links
Asset price links in international bond and equity markets are accounted for by adding
correlated term and equity risk premium shocks (Figure 4.3). Across bond markets,
correlation coefficients with respect to the United States are assumed in the range from 0.16
to 0.66 for other advanced economies, and from 0.00 to 0.69 for emerging economies. Across
stock markets, assumed correlation coefficients are 0.48 to 0.76 for other advanced
economies, and 0.00 to 0.87 for emerging economies. These assumptions are based on an
event study analysis of international financial market co-movements (reported in Chapter II).

Accounting for asset price links amplifies spillovers substantially, while reducing their
international variability (Figure 4.4). For economies with strong trade linkages with the
United States, in particular Canada and Mexico, the contribution of international bond and
stock market contagion is modest. In contrast, for economies with weak trade linkages the
contribution of international bond and stock market contagion is dominant.

V. U.S. TRADE SPILLOVERS: SUPPLY CHAIN EFFECTS14
Notwithstanding its important role in global trade, the United States is particularly highly
integrated as a hub of the NAFTA supply chain, suggesting a significant role for outward
spillovers through trade to NAFTA partners. China is also gaining importance as a major
trading partner and contributor of foreign value added in U.S. gross exports, suggesting
additional potential for outward spillovers through U.S. import demand.
The United States remains a major player in global and regional trade. Notwithstanding
a shrinking share in global trade due to rising integration of rapidly growing emerging market
economies such as China, the United States remains a major trade partner at the global level,
accounting for about 11 percent of global trade (exports plus imports). The United States is
also an important regional trading partner. Exports to NAFTA members (Canada and
Mexico) account for the highest share of total U.S. exports (about 37 percent at their peak
before the crisis). The United States is also the largest trading partner for Canada and
Mexico, accounting for about two-thirds of overall trade in each country in 2010. Trade with
China is also rising in importance, especially on the import side.
The United States is an upstream hub in the NAFTA supply chain. This is seen in the
limited share of imported content in its exports and the higher share of indirect exports that
are sent to third countries. Mexico, on the other hand, is downstream, reflecting specialized
duty free assembly plants that use imported intermediates and re-export final goods back to
the United States. Indeed, the NAFTA supply chain is distinct from the Asian supply chain
along two key features: (i) NAFTA is highly concentrated on one regional powerhouse;
unlike the Asian supply chain where inputs for the downstream country cross the borders of
several countries (including the hub, Japan), almost all of the foreign value added in
Mexico’s exports is directly imported from the hub (the United States); and (ii) a significant
amount of U.S. value added is shipped back home after further processing abroad, which is
not the case for Japan; Mexico is therefore significantly more reliant on U.S. demand than a
similarly downstream Asian country such as China would be on Japan’s.

The United States is an important source of imported inputs in NAFTA countries’
exports. Staff estimates based on OECD input-output tables for 1995 and 2005 suggest that
the share of foreign content in U.S. gross exports has increased slightly—from 9.5 percent in
1995 to 12.3 percent in 2005 (Figure 5.1).15 The United States is an important source of
foreign value added (FVA) in the gross exports of Canada and Mexico (accounting for about
a 20 percent and 30 percent of overall FVA, respectively), while the latter account for about a
fifth of overall FVA in U.S. gross exports in 2005.
Notwithstanding strong regional integration through NAFTA, China’s contribution to
U.S. manufacturing exports exceeds Mexico’s. U.S. exports are dominated by high and
medium-high technology products, destined mostly to the region. Foreign content is highest
in medium-low technology manufacturing exports, followed by medium-high and high
technology manufacturing products (Figure 5.2). Importantly, whereas both Canada and
Mexico broadly maintained their shares in total FVA in U.S. manufacturing exports (at about
17 percent and 10 percent, respectively), between 1995 and 2005, China more than doubled
its share in FVA in U.S. manufacturing exports (to more than 11 percent in 2005). The
increase in China’s share in overall FVA of U.S. exports was mostly accounted for by growth
in the high technology sector, where its share rose from 7 percent in 1995 to about 24 percent
15

Staff’s results using OECD input-output tables differ from those of Koopman and others (2010) reported in
Table 1. Koopman relies on GTAP data which separately identifies exports from processing zones and are
therefore accounted for differently.

in 2005. This suggests that China may be rapidly catching up with NAFTA partners in terms
of contribution to U.S. exports of high-technology goods, with broader spillover implications
through U.S. demand.

VI. U.S. TRADE SPILLOVERS: TYPICAL RESPONSE TO U.S. ACTIVITY16
The impact of a change in US imports on global activity is estimated taking account of supply
chain effects. More specifically, in addition to the direct impact on bilateral trading partners,
the knock-on effects through the global trade system are included by taking into account
trade interconnectedness. Results show that the impact is largest for NAFTA and East Asia.
Methodology
Focusing on non-oil and non-commodity trade channels, a matrix of bilateral
manufacturing and services exports as a share of each country GDP is constructed.
Elements a(i,j) of this A matrix each measure the importance of bilateral manufacturing and
services exports to j in terms of country i’s GDP, and are obtained as:
a(i,j) = αM(i)*λX (i)*τ(i)*BXW(i,j) with a(i,i) = - αM(i)*λM (i)*τ(i)
where BXW is the matrix of bilateral export weights, αM the vector of country specific shares
of manufactures and services in total non-oil trade, λX (λM) the vector of country specific
shares of exports (imports) in manufacturing and services trade and τ the vector of country
specific ratio of total non-oil trade (import plus exports) to GDP.
If other countries’ imports remain unchanged, the non-diagonal elements of this A
matrix measure the impact of a single country’s increased imports on each partners’
GDP. This only measures the direct (first round) impact of a trade shock: if only country j
expands its imports by 1 percent, the impact on any country i (through manufacturing exports
to j) will be a(i,j) percent of GDP. However, each country’s position in the global supply
chain requires it to increase its own imports in order to meet increasing demand for its own
exports. Assuming that the elasticity of total imports to manufacturing exports is the same in
all cases and equal to 1 for simplicity (keeping constant import to GDP ratios). As country i
exports more, it will in turn increase its total imports from the rest of the world by a(i,i).
Assessing the total impact thus requires adding to the direct impact the infinite sum of second
I A
I
A I A .
round effects, etc. This geometric sum is given by ∑∞ A
As an illustrative example suppose a 3 country world economy where the U.S. imports
from each of the 2 other countries (EA and CN). Both EA and CN export more to the US
than to each other. But EA and CN have different shares of manufacturing exports in total
trade, and different degrees of trade openness. Denoting w(i) = αM(i)*λX or M (i) the share of
manufacturing/services exports or imports in non-oil trade, let’s assume:

Suppose that the U.S. expands by 1 percent and its total imports increase by 1 percent. In the
first round, EA and CN accrued manufacturing exports to the U.S. raise their own GDP
according to the relative weight of these bilateral exports:
0.5*0.60*2/3 = 0.20 percent of EA’s GDP and 0.6*0.67*2/3 ~ 0.27 percent of CN’s GDP.
Recall that the change in EA and CN GDP translates with unit elasticity into a change in EA
and CN total imports from their respective partners. As a consequence, in the second round:
EA and CN increase imports from partners by 0.20*0.50*0.60 and 0.27*0.60*0.67
respectively; all countries exports to the EA and CN increase in line with the first round
expansion of the EA and CN, multiplied by bilateral export weights, etc.
The following heat map, based on the latest REER weights dataset and average trade
openness over the last 10 years, shows the total impact of a U.S. import shock on
partners’ non-commodity net exports, as a percentage of GDP (Figure 6.1). Results being
sensitive to elasticity assumptions, the map should be read as showing growth impacts in
relative terms. The impact is highest for NAFTA partners (Canada and Mexico) and for
South-East Asia, especially (notably) China.

VII. U.S. FINANCIAL SPILLOVERS: CROSSBORDER LINKAGES17
Splicing macro and micro data from various sources, the key, globally systemic financial
sectors are surveyed, focusing on: asset size; banking vs. fund management; commercial vs.
investment banking; and foreign operations in the United States.


Asset size of Euro area, U.S., U.K., and Japanese financial sectors (Figure 7.1). The
Euro area financial system is the largest, and the U.S. financial system the most
complex/diverse, the latter with large and distinct investment banking and money fund
segments. Data on universal banks (for non-U.S. jurisdictions) are from the GFSR’s
Statistical Appendix; on (U.S.) insured depositories and investment banks (including
holding companies) from the Fed’s Flow of Funds; and on (all) funds from Lipper.



Overall foreign bank claims on the United States (Figure 7.2). Bank claims on the
United States are dominated by Northern European, Japanese, and Canadian banks, with
the majority originated by foreign branches and subsidiaries in the United States.
Country-level data on bank claims and overall data on dollar claims by foreign banking
offices in the United States are from the BIS; firm-level data on U.S. claims (proxied by
total assets) of foreign-owned U.S. large bank holding companies (BHCs in the top-50)
and foreign-owned U.S. primary dealers are from the Fed’s Bank Holding Company
Performance Reports and SEC filings, respectively.



Bank claims on the United States by country (Figure 7.3). U.K., German, and Irish
bank claims on the United States are dominated by large BHCs focused on investment
banking (defined as large foreign BHCs with above-median ratios of noninterest income
to total income), and Swiss claims are dominated by two large U.S. primary dealers
(engaged predominantly in investment banking activities). Canadian claims are held
mostly by large BHCs focused on commercial banking, and the firm-level composition of
Japanese, French, Dutch and Spanish claims remaining mostly unidentified (suggesting a
higher share of direct crossborder lending perhaps). Data sources as in previous figure.



Role of U.S. large BHC subsidiaries of foreign banks (Figures 7.4 to 7.5). In all but
two cases (BNP Paribas and Bank of Nova Scotia) activities of U.S. large BHC
subsidiaries are more focused on investment banking (proxied by the ratio of noninterest
income to total income) than the rest of the group; U.S. BHC assets vary from over onethird of group assets (Allied Irish) to under 3 percent (BNP Paribas), with a weighted
average share of 11 percent. Data on BHCs are from the BHC Performance Reports and
on global parent groups from MCMFA.

VIII. U.S. MONETARY POLICY SPILLOVERS:
QUANTITATIVE EASING AND CAPITAL FLOWS INTO EMERGING MARKETS18
The effects of the Fed’s quantitative easing (QE) announcements and actual purchase
operations on capital flows into emerging markets (EMs) are investigated using a VAR on
weekly data. QE1 and QE2 announcements seem to have affected such capital flows, while
actual Fed net asset purchases did not.
A vector autoregression (VAR) analysis is conducted looking at the impact of
quantitative easing on capital inflows into emerging markets. Weekly data from 2003
were collected on Fed purchases of assets (broken down into Treasury, Agency, and
mortgage backed securities—the latter a
good proxy for QE1 operations), flows
into EM bond and equity mutual funds
(divided between equity and bond
flows), as well as oil and nonoil
commodity prices and global risk
aversion (proxied by the VIX). The Fed
and mutual fund series (shown in the text
chart) all end on Wednesdays, so other
financial variables (commodity prices,
the VIX) were also defined as of
Wednesday close. In addition, the VAR
included QE 1 and 2 announcements using the same dates as Chapter II. Most of these are
FOMC announcements, which by chance normally also occur on Wednesday afternoons.
These dates are moved to the following week as they occur right at the end of the weekly
period (results using the announcement week are similar).
The baseline specification is a VAR with the following ordering: Fed net asset
purchases, dummies for QE1 and (separately) QE2 announcements dates, and net flows
into EM funds. This was considered to be the most plausible line of causation. The analysis
is also extended to look at the role of global risk aversion and commodity prices both as a
conduit for Fed actions as well as an independent driver of EM capital flows.
Reflecting limited degrees of freedom, formal tests for the appropriate number of lags
in the VAR varied from very short (when degrees of freedom were included in the test)
to quite long when they were not. A relatively long lag was chosen—6 weeks to be precise.
The lag length has limited effects on the results, although it does tend to increase the
significance of QE2 announcements over the longer term.

28
Findings
Fed announcements of QE seem to have a positive impact in driving net flows to EM
but actual Fed asset purchases do not (Figure 8.1). The top left panel of the Figure
indicates that Fed purchases of assets did not have a significant impact on EM capital flows
over time. By contrast, QE1 and QE2 announcements are found to be significant on impact.
The long-term impact diverges, with QE1 announcement effects becoming smaller and
insignificant while cumulative capital flows in response to QE2 announcements grow over
time and remain (marginally) significant. The extended VAR shows similar responses.
EM flows respond to the decline in global risk aversion and higher commodity prices
when global market conditions are added to the VAR (Figure 8.2). Global market
conditions were included by adding (changes in) the VIX and in oil prices in the VAR,
(ordered after Fed purchases and announcements and before flows to EM funds). Impulse
responses show a self-reinforcing relationship between declines in the VIX and increases in
oil prices, both of which significantly contribute to flows to EMs. Results using (nonoil)
commodity prices show a different linkage between global risk aversion and commodity
prices but generate similar positive impacts on EM inflows.
Flows into equity market funds explain the positive response of EM flows to increases in
oil prices. By separately analyzing inflows into EM bond and equity funds, the results
indicate higher oil (and nonoil commodity) prices have driven larger flows into equity funds,
but have little impact on bond flows.
The effects of Fed QE announcements and asset purchases on oil prices and global risk
aversion have the expected sign but are not statistically significant (Figure 8.3). Fed
purchases have a (marginally) significant positive impact on oil price when MBS purchases
are included, suggesting that the response of oil prices is a feature of QE1 operations, while
the (small) decline in the VIX seems to be associated to non-MBS purchases, i.e. to both QE
programs. Responses of the VIX and oil prices to QE announcements generally have the
expected sign but are not significant except for the immediate impact of QE1 announcements
on the VIX. This impact could be related to the unanticipated nature of the first QE program,
which was intended to alleviate the financial markets stresses at the height of the global
crisis. Further analysis is required in order to ascertain whether Fed operations have been
successful at decreasing perceived market risks.

IX. U.S. GROWTH SPILLOVERS: MONETARY POLICY19
Spillovers from a variety of U.S. monetary policy measures are analyzed using a refined
version of the structural macroeconometric model of the G-20 documented in Vitek (2010).20
Spillovers are found to be large and mainly conveyed through asset price links.
A. Spillovers from U.S. Monetary Stimulus
This section analyzes spillovers from conventional and unconventional monetary
stimulus measures in the United States. The conventional monetary stimulus measure
under consideration is an unanticipated reduction in the nominal policy interest rate, while
the unconventional monetary stimulus measures are quantitative easing programs, namely
QE1 and QE2. The calibration of our scenarios is based on an event study analysis of the
international bond, stock, and foreign exchange market impacts of these monetary stimulus
measures.

the currencies of other advanced economies by 0.9 to 1.2 percent with respect to the dollar,
and of emerging economies by zero to 1.1 percent. Under this scenario, we estimate peak
output gains of 0.3 percent in the U.S., of 0.1 to 0.3 percent in other advanced economies,
and of around zero to 0.2 percent in emerging economies. The transmission of these output
gains is estimated to occur primarily via the bond markets.

rate risk premium shocks appreciate the currencies of other advanced economies by zero to

These foreign financial spillover effects are small compared to typical monetary policy event
even given the smaller change in U.S. bond yields compared to the scenario discussed earlier.
Under this scenario, we estimate peak output gains of 0.1 percent in the U.S., of close to
zero percent in other advanced economies, and of close to zero to 0.1 percent in emerging
economies. The transmission is estimated to occur primarily via the bond markets.

B. Spillovers from Delayed Withdrawal of U.S. Monetary Stimulus
This section analyzes spillovers from delayed withdrawal of monetary stimulus in the
United States. These scenarios formalize the monetary policy strategy for escaping from a
liquidity trap recommended by Eggertson and Woodford (2003).21 They argue that by
credibly committing to extend a zero interest rate policy beyond the time at which its
monetary policy rule prescribes a positive setting, the central bank can stimulate the economy
out of a liquidity trap. Essentially, by committing to reduce future short term real interest
rates, the central bank is committing to generating an economic boom once the economy is
out of the liquidity trap, raising expected future inflation and lowering the current long term
real interest rate.

smaller spillovers than would result from sequences of internationally correlated risk
premium shocks calibrated to match the international financial market impacts of U.S.
monetary policy announcements.

X. U.S. FISCAL SPILLOVERS: GLOBAL FINANCING CONDITIONS22
Spillovers from U.S. fiscal policy outcomes to financial conditions in the rest of the world are
analyzed. Holding other factors constant, the direct estimated effect of a one percentage
point increase in the U.S. federal debt ratio (excluding Fed holdings) on sovereign spreads is
about 2 basis points, with a stronger effect in emerging markets.

The analysis is based on annual
panel regressions using localcurrency sovereign bond yields
from 41 countries over 1990–
2010. The regression results
suggest that an increase in the
U.S. federal debt tends to be in the
long term associated with an
increase in the sovereign
borrowing costs in both emerging
markets and advanced economies,
pointing to a global negative
portfolio balance effect from
expansionary U.S. fiscal policy.

The panel regressions include a comprehensive set of global and local determinants of
borrowing spreads. The regressors can be divided into three groups: (1) U.S. policies and
outcomes, including the publicly-held federal debt (excluding the Federal Reserve holdings
of Treasuries), as a share of either U.S. or global GDP, growth, and yield on the 10-year
Treasury bond; (2) local policies and outcomes such as public debt, growth, and inflation
differential vis-à-vis the United States; and (3) other controls including foreign exchange
reserves, current account balance, quality of political institutions, volatility, global cycle,
financial openness, and the depth of financial markets.
The regression results suggest that higher U.S. federal debt is in the long run associated
with higher borrowing costs in both emerging markets and advanced economies.23 The
estimated effect of U.S. federal debt on global sovereign spreads is statistically and
economically significant (Table 10.1). Holding other factors constant, the direct estimated
effect of a one percentage point increase in the U.S. federal debt ratio (excluding the Fed
holdings) on sovereign spreads is about 2 basis points, with a stronger effect in emerging

markets. The findings remain broadly unchanged in alternative regression specifications
including direct measures of expectations about debt, growth, and inflation, or time dummies
and regional and other factors. Of course, the U.S. fiscal policy can affect global borrowing
costs through other channels—in particular, by raising the Treasury yields, and possibly also
by elevating market volatility (as captured by the VIX). Laubach (2009) estimates the
elasticity of the long-term Treasury yields to a prospective one percentage point increase in
the federal debt at about 3 basis points. While the upward pressure on U.S. yields is not
apparent at the moment due to weak private demand and safe haven flows, such pressures are
expected to resume in the future as the economy recovers (Celasun and Sommer, 2010).
Adding the estimate of pass-through from long-term Treasury yields into spreads to the direct
effect estimated by Laubach, the overall increase in local borrowing costs could eventually
be some 5 basis points per an additional percentage point of U.S. federal debt. This is
significant given the projected increase in the U.S. public federal debt from 36 percent of
GDP before the crisis to 70 percent of GDP this year. However, the numerical estimate of
spillovers should be interpreted with much caution and a case could be made that the
estimate presents an upper bound—with the U.S. debt levels significantly higher than in the
past, investors may attach lower “convenience value” to their Treasury holdings and the
foreign lending rates could therefore increase by less than suggested by the regression
results.24
Strong domestic policies and institutions can reduce borrowing costs and (eventual)
negative spillovers from the rapidly-increasing U.S. public debt. Indeed, emerging market
funding costs have fallen significantly over the past couple of decades reflecting improved
policies and institutions. Going forward, extending such gains would help offset funding
pressures due to higher U.S. debt ratios. For example, the regression results suggest that
reducing the local public debt ratio by 10 percent of GDP lowers the borrowing spread by
10–100 basis points depending on the context. Meanwhile, improving institutional quality (as
measured by the ICRG Composite Index) by 1 standard deviation of cross-country
experiences could reduce the borrowing spread by 60–100 basis points. The panel
regressions also provide some tentative evidence that countries with good policies and
institutions are somewhat less sensitive to the negative spillovers from higher U.S. debt
(Table 10.2). This would be consistent with the well-established fact that lower quality
borrowers tend to be affected more by funding pressures in global financial markets. In sum,
the analysis reinforces the call for early agreement on a comprehensive U.S. medium-term
fiscal consolidation plan in light of the potentially negative domestic and global effects of
rising U.S. debt.

24

A similar argument was made by Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2008) who found a negative
correlation between the size of U.S. federal debt and the spread between U.S. corporate and Treasury yields.

XI. U.S. GROWTH SPILLOVERS: FISCAL POLICY
Spillovers from projected fiscal consolidation in the United States are estimated using two
alternative models: the Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal (GIMF) model, and a
structural macroeconometric model of the G-20. It also presents simulation results for U.S.
sovereign debt crisis scenarios generated with the G-20 model. There are significant longterm gains in output from consolidation while the short-term losses are generally small.
A. Spillovers from U.S. Fiscal Consolidation: Analysis Using GIMF25
U.S. fiscal policy can affect output in other countries both by its effects on trade and by
its effect on world interest rates. Analysis using the GIMF model suggests that the stimulus
measures in 2009 and 2010 raised demand in

Short-run output spillovers from fiscal tightening in the United States to other countries
are uniformly negative, but relatively small in size. GDP in other regions falls by a
fraction of the fall in U.S. GDP, and recovers more quickly. There are two main reasons for

Sommer (WHD).

GIMF is a multi-country structural model covering the global economy. In each region, households, firms and
fiscal and monetary policy authorities interact in goods and labor markets, with implications for prices, interest
rates, exchange rates, and external balances. For the purpose of these exercises, the model is noticeable for its
detailed fiscal structure, having several different types of government expenditures and taxes, and its nonRicardian behavior.

27
28

See, for example, the October 2010 World Economic Outlook and the references contained therein.

In addition to these fiscal shocks, nominal interest rates are fixed in the US and euro area for the first year,
mimicking the current scenario of rates at the lower nominal bound.

38
such a result. First, without any other shocks, the scenario focuses on trade linkages and not
financial linkages; outside of Canada and Mexico, the direct trade impact is relatively small.
Second, domestic demand in other regions responds rapidly to higher anticipated income as a
consequence of lower interest rates.
Long-run spillovers from fiscal consolidation are uniformly positive. A fiscal
consolidation that permanently reduces public debt causes real interest rates to fall and output
to rise. Because the U.S. economy is large in capital markets, world interest rates also fall,
with a positive impact on output in other regions.

There are significant implications for trade and the composition of demand. Although
the net effects on output for other countries are small relative to the impact on U.S. output,
there are nonetheless important effects on trade and domestic demand in other countries. The
composition of output in the United States shifts away from domestic toward external
demand. The converse holds for other countries. Hence, although other countries benefit
from lower interest rates, trade balances deteriorate to accommodate U.S. fiscal
consolidation.29

29

The shocks are run under the assumption that nominal exchange rates in all other countries are free floating.
Hence the burden of the necessary real exchange rate adjustments is taken up by nominal rates instead of goods
prices and wages.

39
Variations on these scenarios illustrate a number of points:


Spillovers are less severe when fiscal policies are anticipated and credible. Private
agents anticipate the long-run benefits; consumption and investment start to improve
much earlier. Consequently, spillovers to other regions are smaller, with less pressure
on external rebalancing and capital flows.



The balance between short-run costs and long-run benefits depends on how efficiently
the deficit reduction is directed. The long-run effect depends on incentives to increase
supply; in the model, lower labor or capital income taxes are more effective than, say,
reducing (lump-sum) transfers exclusively, or reducing public consumption. In the
short run, output falls by less in a scenario in which the same overall improvement in
primary balances is financed by lump-sum taxes, for example.



Spillovers to other countries are less severe when monetary policy is able to
accommodate domestic fiscal consolidation. If U.S. nominal policy rates were able to
fall, the effects are less severe, because there is less excess supply in the domestic
economy that has to be exported and because U.S. private demand for other regions’
goods is supported.



A “front-loaded” fiscal adjustment that achieves the same debt reduction but is more
aggressive from the start has a larger short-run cost to U.S. aggregate demand.
Consequently, the negative spillovers onto demand in other regions are more severe,
and the dollar depreciation and swings in the trade balance are larger.



Spillovers could be affected by changes in risk premia, in addition to trade channels.
Simulations suggest that if market concern over U.S. public debt were elevated, a
front-loaded fiscal consolidation might have less of a negative effect on U.S. and
world demand to the extent that it reduced risk premia. The reverse also applies: a
consolidation that is not viewed as credible or effective at securing sustainable public
balances could have a negative effect on risk premia. It is difficult to say how large
the increases in interest rates could be, but simulations suggest that plausible changes
in risk premia can have larger effects than those seen when focusing on trade linkages
alone.

40
B. Fiscal Consolidation Scenarios: G-20 Model Simulation Results30
This section analyzes spillovers from projected fiscal consolidation in the United States.
This analysis is based on scenarios simulated with a refined version of the structural
macroeconometric model of the G-20 documented in Vitek (2010).31 Our baseline scenario
abstracts from any decline in long term nominal interest rates as a result from U.S. fiscal
consolidation, while our alternative scenario accounts for the possibility of such declines, to
varying degrees worldwide. Both scenarios abstract from monetary policy stabilization
worldwide in order to isolate the effect of fiscal policy.

that the long term nominal interest
rate in the U.S. declines by 39 basis points by 2014, we estimate a cumulative output loss of
1.3 percent. The calibration of this scenario is based on Laubach (2009), who estimates that a
one percent reduction in the ratio of government debt to output is associated with a 3 to
4 basis point decline in the long term nominal interest rate.32

Projected U.S. fiscal consolidation is estimated to generate variable spillovers to the rest
of the world. Under our baseline scenario, estimated cumulative output losses for other
advanced economies range from 0.1 to 1.4 percent over the period 2011–2016, while for
emerging economies they range from 0.1 to 1.0 percent. Our alternative scenario assumes
that 16 to 66 percent of the declines in the long term nominal interest rate in the U.S. pass
through to other advanced economies while zero to 69 percent pass through to emerging
economies, based on an event study analysis of the international bond market impacts of

fiscal policy announcements (see Chapter II). Under this scenario, estimated cumulative
output effects for other advanced economies range from a loss of 0.5 percent to a gain of
0.4 percent, while for emerging economies they range from a loss of 0.2 percent to a gain of
0.6 percent. Under both scenarios, estimated cumulative output losses in the rest of the world
are generally increasing with the degree of trade integration with the United States.
C. Sovereign Debt Crisis Scenarios: G-20 Model Simulation Results33
This section presents simulation results for sovereign debt crisis scenarios originating in
the United States featuring alternative degrees of financial market contagion. These
simulation results are generated with a refined version of the structural macroeconometric
model of the G-20 documented in Vitek (2010).34
Our first scenario features a sovereign debt crisis contained within the United States. A
sudden loss of confidence in fiscal sustainability there is represented by a positive term
premium shock which in isolation would raise its long term nominal interest rate by
450 basis points on impact. Heightened risk aversion also afflicts the U.S. stock market, an
effect represented by a positive equity risk premium shock which in isolation would reduce
equity prices by 60 percent on impact. Finally, loss of confidence by households and firms
causes them to postpone their consumption and investment expenditures, decreasing
domestic demand by 1 percent, while a fiscal consolidation reaction by the government
reduces it by a further 2 percent. This contained sovereign debt crisis is estimated to generate
weighted average peak output losses of 4.4 percent in the United States, of 0.5 percent in
other advanced economies, and of 0.7 percent in emerging economies.
Under our second scenario, heightened U.S. risk aversion spreads to bond and stock
markets worldwide. This scenario augments our first scenario with term premium shocks
which raise long term nominal interest rates in all other advanced economies by 180 basis
points, and all emerging economies by 270 basis points. In addition, equity risk premium
shocks reduce equity prices in all other advanced economies by 30 percent, and all emerging
economies by 45 percent. Finally, loss of confidence decreases domestic demand in all other
economies by 1 percent, while fiscal consolidation reactions reduce it by a further 1 percent
in other advanced economies. This contagious sovereign debt crisis is estimated to generate
weighted average peak output losses of 4.9 percent in the United States, of 3.6 percent in
other advanced economies, and of 3.5 percent in emerging economies.

42
Our third scenario combines bond and stock market collapses worldwide with a run on
the dollar. This scenario augments our second scenario with exchange rate risk premium
shocks which in isolation would depreciate the dollar by 30 percent in nominal effective
terms on impact. The implied real effective appreciation pressure on other currencies is
disinflationary, raising the scope for monetary policy loosening to mitigate output losses in
affected economies. This contagious sovereign debt crisis is estimated to generate weighted
average peak output losses of 4.6 percent in the United States, of 3.5 percent in other
advanced economies, and of 3.2 percent in emerging economies.
Under our fourth scenario, heightened risk aversion afflicts bond and stock markets
worldwide and there is a flight to quality. This scenario augments our second scenario
with exchange rate risk premium shocks which in isolation would appreciate the dollar by
15 percent in nominal effective terms on impact. The implied real effective depreciation
pressure on other currencies is inflationary, reducing the scope for monetary policy loosening
to mitigate output losses in affected economies. This contagious sovereign debt crisis is
estimated to generate weighted average peak output losses of 5.1 percent in the United States,
of 3.7 percent in other advanced economies, and of 3.7 percent in emerging economies.

XII. U.S. FINANCIAL SPILLOVERS: RAISING U.S. CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS35
Spillovers from a regulatory increase in capital adequacy requirements in the United States
are analyzed. Under our baseline scenario, it is estimated that a binding one percentage
point increase in U.S. capital adequacy requirements would generate substantial spillovers.
The focus of this chapter is on the transitional costs of higher capital requirements, as
opposed to the permanent net benefits accruing from less frequent and severe banking crises.
This analysis is based on scenarios simulated with an extended and refined version of the
structural macroeconometric model of the world economy, disaggregated into its fifteen
largest national economies, documented in Vitek (2009).36 These scenarios abstract from
monetary policy stabilization and assume that the macroeconomic effects of this regulatory
measure are transmitted exclusively via a permanent increase in the spread between
commercial bank lending and deposit rates. Under our baseline scenario, the extent to which
this interest rate spread increases varies across economies in proportion to the ratio of credit
provided by commercial banks incorporated in the United States to total credit. Our
alternative scenario abstracts from this cross-border bank lending channel.

These output losses primarily reflect reduced export demand from the United States,
mitigated by real effective currency depreciations in the rest of the world.

XIII. U.S. FINANCIAL SPILLOVERS: BANKING SYSTEM RISKS38
The potential for spillover effects arising from U.S. banking sector vulnerabilities to large
shocks remains a key concern for maintaining financial stability amid the impact of more
stringent regulatory standards. U.S. policy measures have helped reduce the link between
individual and system-wide risks in the banking sector, with positive spillovers abroad.
A. Examining the Potential Spillover of Systemic Risk
The analysis compares the relationship between individual and systemic (solvency) risk
of major banks in Europe and the United States during the credit crisis.39 The systemic
risk is defined as the joint default risk among all sample banks in each jurisdiction based on
the multivariate distribution (MGEV) of joint CDS spread movements defined by a nonparametric dependence function.40 This dependence measure is combined with the marginal
distributions of these individual CDS spread movements, which are assumed to be
generalized extreme value (GEV). In contrast, individual risk is defined as the average
default risk weighted by the total assets of sample banks in each jurisdiction.
Two types of credit default swap (CDS) prices are used in this analysis as a measure of
solvency risk: (i) the actual one-year CDS spread (obtained from proprietary data providers
(Bloomberg and MarkIt)) as well as (ii) the fair value (or “synthetic”) CDS spreads over a
one-year risk horizon (extracted from equity prices via an advanced version of contingent
claims analysis, or CCA).41. The latter CDS spreads are generally higher than the actual CDS
spreads, which reflect only the residual solvency risk of banks due to implicit or explicit
government guarantees as a result of being systemically important.
The analysis finds that both systemic and individual risk culminated in the first quarter
of 2009. This was followed by a persistent decline in individual risk until end-2009, and an

eventual stabilization of system-wide risk at an elevated level in the wake of U.S. policy
announcements (Figures 13.1–13.4). Systemic risk subsequently declined in anticipation of a
series of U.S. policy measures in early 2010, such as the announcement of the “Volcker
Rule” on restricted proprietary trading and the proposed imposition of a financial crisis
responsibility tax. These policy measures consolidated a trend towards lower systemic risk in
the U.S. banking sector. The interaction between individual and systemic risk was similar in
both the United States and Europe, with the exception of a slower decline of systemic risk (if
measured by synthetic CDS) in Europe during the first half of 2010.
More importantly, the slope of the relationship between individual and systemic risk
appears to have flattened over time. Analysis of this relationship is complicated by periods
in which the expected positive relationship between individual and system risk does not hold.
However, there appear to be three periods of relative stability: (i) from the Lehman collapse
to June 2009; (ii) from July 2009 through the announcement of Volcker rule (January 2010);
and (iii) after the announcement of the Volker rule. As can be seen in Figures 13.1 and 13.2,
the usually positive relationship between U.S. banks’ individual risk and systemic risk
flattened after the announcement of the Volcker rule. A similar pattern seems to be true for
European banks, suggesting positive spillovers.
B. Examining the Tail Dependence between U.S. and European Banking Sector
Risks – Dynamic Dependence Structure Model (DDS)
This section assesses the potential for such vulnerabilities to spillover to European banks
(based on the DDS model to quantify the dependence structure).42 The analysis finds that
cross-border linkages of banking sector risk have increased dramatically during the credit
crisis, especially for very large increases of default risk until mid-2009. After a noticeable
decline during the first half of 2010 amid lower systemic risk in the U.S. banking sector,
spillover effects have reemerged in the wake of persistent turmoil in the European periphery.
In this analysis, the DDS model – based on the concept of multivariate extreme value
theory (EVT) – is used to assess the potential for spillovers effects from joint banking
sector distress (“tail risk”) in Europe and the United States. It shows whether extreme
cross-border linkages exist and how these might change over time, acknowledging that large
shocks are transmitted differently than small shocks. These linkages are measured as
dependence values,43 which are calculated iteratively as central estimates on daily

42

The sample of banks is the same as in Section A.

Conventional correlation coefficients are seriously misleading in the presence of skewed distributions and
high volatility, mainly because they detect only linear dependence between two variables whose marginal
distributions are assumed to be distributed normally – an ideal assumption rarely encountered in practice.

fair value one-year credit default swap (CDS) spreads (extracted from equity prices via an
advanced version of CCA) since the onset of the credit crisis and during the European
sovereign crisis.
The dependence value between banks in Europe and the United States is derived after
calculating the joint default risk among all sample banks within each jurisdiction. The
multivariate distribution (MGEV) of joint CDS spread movements of all sample banks in
Europe and the United States is estimated separately before the magnitude of bilateral
linkages between the banking sectors in Europe and the United States are determined. The
dependence structure is derived using the same methodology as in Section A. Based on the
joint changes in CDS spreads of European and U.S. banks, the bilateral dependence measure
is derived.45

This framework was also used to assess spillover effects of U.S. policy announcements
during the credit crisis on banking sector risks in both the United States and Europe.

This measure is better suited to analyzing joint tail risks, because it links the univariate marginal distributions
of multiple asset prices in a way that formally captures both their linear and non-linear dependence over time.

To this effect, the DDS model is adapted to an event study framework using a sliding
window of three months and daily updating to examine changes in the dependence measure
in both banking sectors in response to significant U.S. policy announcements.
Examining the dependence at varying magnitudes of shocks over time illustrates the
dynamic characteristics of potential tail risk between the United States and Europe. The
analysis finds that cross-border linkages of banking sector risk have increased dramatically
during the credit crisis, especially for very large increases of default risk until mid-2009.
Until the end of 2009, the potential for spillovers was also more pronounced for declines in
market-perceived solvency risk (i.e., lower CDS spreads) – but such declines were much
smaller than increases during 2009.
After having waned over the first half of 2010 (see Section A above), spillover risks
reemerged in the wake of persistent turmoil in the European periphery. Spillover effects
from solvency shocks in the banking sector stabilized briefly during mid-2010 amid lower
levels of systemic risk. While system-wide default risk in the U.S. banking sector appears to
have leveled off over time, during the last months of 2010, however, cross-border linkages to
European peers exhibit growing susceptibility to common shocks and almost reached credit
crisis levels in January 2011.
