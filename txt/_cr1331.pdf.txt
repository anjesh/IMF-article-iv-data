STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 25, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context. Dominica’s strong fiscal policy response shored up the economy during the
past three years, helping it recover above its pre-crisis peak. However, anemic domestic
and external demand are likely to slow the near-term recovery, adding to pressures on
the already weakened fiscal position and financial system. Weak demand contributed
to a large reduction in the current account deficit and low inflation.
Fiscal consolidation. While conditions are not ideal for unwinding the fiscal policy
stimulus, determined policy action is needed to reverse the upward dynamics of debt
and steer it towards the union-wide 60 percent of GDP target by 2020. Authorities’
intended return to their long-standing primary surplus target would put the debt
target well within reach, but will require a notable adjustment effort that should focus
on streamlining current spending. A revamped public financial management framework
would help underpin the sustainability of the adjustment.
Strengthening the financial sector. Pockets of vulnerability in the financial system
need to be decisively addressed to ensure continued stability. Regulatory and
supervisory reforms should improve the framework for dealing with financial institution
weaknesses, by aligning prudential norms with international best practice, introducing
prompt corrective action, and strengthening safety nets.
Structural reforms. As the fiscal stimulus is withdrawn, the prospects for meaningful
growth will hinge on how bold and successful structural reforms are in boosting
competitiveness and private investment. Reforms should aim at narrowing the
infrastructure gap, facilitating the development of property markets, improving the
business environment for the private sector, and easing access to finance. Policies
should also aim at supporting a shift of productive resources towards the tradable
sector, the main viable growth driver going forward.

BACKDROP
1.
Dominica has faced two major challenges during the past two decades: weak
competitiveness and low potential growth. Over the past twenty years, its GDP growth averaged
2⅓ percent—compared to over 3½ percent in the wider Caribbean and non-Asian emerging
markets. While many Caribbean countries adjusted to the loss of preferential access to European
agricultural markets in the mid-1980s through a relative diversification of their economies (to
tourism, mainly), Dominica’s transition towards hospitality-based industries has been more difficult
than elsewhere in the region―reflecting weak infrastructure, limited air access, and a dearth of
sandy beaches―but it has successfully developed an offshore medical education sector. As a result,
the structure of Dominica’s economy is unique for the Eastern Caribbean region: the contribution of
tourism industries to total output is more modest relative to other ECCU members, agriculture
remains large, and offshore medical schools boost the share of the education industry relative to
other ECCU members. Going forward, the authorities have embarked on promising geothermal
energy explorations that have the potential to substantially improve economic performance in
Dominica by ensuring energy self-sufficiency, significantly reducing electricity and fuel import costs,
and potentially exporting electricity to neighboring islands. However, competitiveness for now
remains weak because of high input costs, lack of economies of scale, and low productivity.

While less affected by the global crisis than many of its peers, Dominica’s recovery
remains fragile. Following a shallow recession in 2009, growth has averaged about 1 percent in
2010–11. The shallowness of the recession reflected largely two factors: (i) limited spillovers from
economic stress in advanced markets due to the relatively modest size of Dominica’s tourism

industry (Box 1 and Figure 1); and (ii) the authorities’
ability to deploy a significant fiscal policy stimulus
following the buildup of solid policy buffers during the
past decade.1 The weak recovery reflects anemic
domestic demand, low tourist arrivals,2 and closure of
some manufacturing operations. Employment
conditions remain strained: the unemployment rate,
most recently recorded at 10 percent in 2009, remains
high, and about five percent of the labor force were
discouraged workers. 3

In addition to these economic challenges, the country has been facing more frequent
natural disasters. Dominica, along with other Caribbean islands, is already prone to natural
disasters, and tropical storms are becoming increasingly disruptive due to more frequent flooding,
given the country’s very mountainous terrain. Flood-related damages to roads and bridges—not
covered by the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF)4—are putting significant
strains on the already stretched budgets. The authorities have tapped the Fund’s emergency
financing three times between 2008 and 2012 to deal with the aftermath of major natural disasters
(hurricanes Omar and Dean, and severe flooding more recently), and have relatively limited space
left for further emergency drawings: as of September 2012, borrowing under emergency programs
stands at about 71¼ percent of Dominica’s quota, compared to a limit of 100 percent.5
4.
Context of past surveillance. During the last Article IV (considered on a lapse-of-time
basis) and at the time the most recent RCF drawing, Fund advice focused on the need to rebuild
fiscal buffers and improve the fiscal policy framework, to remain vigilant against financial stability
risks, and to address underlying structural vulnerabilities to enhance competitiveness and growth.
The authorities fully share these objectives, although fiscal consolidation efforts have been thwarted
by continued economic weakness.

1

After a debt crisis in 2001–02, a major fiscal retrenchment took place in the context of IMF-supported programs.
Primary surpluses averaging 4 percent of GDP during 2004–09 and the debt restructuring in 2004–05, contributed to
the decline in debt from 100 percent of GDP in 2002 to 63 percent in mid-2010.

2

In addition to reduced stayover arrivals, cruiseship tourism―on which the country preponderantly relies―has
suffered a setback with the cancellation of all cruiseship calls during the bulk of 2011.

3

Official statistics include discouraged workers in the unemployment and labor force numbers, reporting the
unemployment rate at 14 percent in 2009. Currently, labor force data are collected decennially, as a part of the
census, and at infrequent intervals when a country poverty assessment is undertaken by the Caribbean Development
Bank (latest in 2009). The authorities have completed a census in 2011, but the full results are not yet available.

4

This insurance facility, launched with sponsorship from the World Bank, covers only major hurricanes or
earthquakes, with a relatively small payout.

5

In early 2012, the authorities accessed the IMF’s Rapid Credit Facility (25 percent of quota, US$3.2 million or
0.7 percent of GDP), which covered about 40 percent of the flood-related spending to date, with the rest covered by
grants (38 percent) and other multilateral and bilateral financing (24 percent).

Box 1: Dominica and the Global Economy
The structure of Dominica’s economy renders it less sensitive to spillovers from the world business cycle.

conditions.
Because of the nature of Dominica’s international linkages, local developments tend to influence
economic performance relatively more than regional or global ones. In particular, growth in Dominica
shows only little correlation with that of advanced economies, significantly less than other ECCU countries that
show a tight relationship during most of the past two decades (see chart below and to the left, which shows the
percentages of common variation over rolling 15-year periods between Dominica’s growth and that of other
economies). A closer relationship between growth in Dominica and the rest of the ECCU appears to have existed
during the mid 1990s, but has since dissipated. Regression analysis is consistent with these findings (see chart
below and to the right, which shows the estimated contributions to Dominica’s annual real GDP growth due to
regional, advanced economy, and domestic factors). The estimates confirm that most of the growth in
Dominica―about 55-60 percent over the past two decades― is explained by country-specific factors rather than
direct impact of global or regional developments. They also suggest that regional developments, including
common shocks, matter about twice as much for Dominica’s economy than developments in large economies: a
1 percentage point decline in ECCU growth would reduce Dominica’s growth by about 0.4 percentage points,
while a similar decline in advanced economies would lower growth by about 0.2 percentage points. However,
growth in the other ECCU countries has a much closer relation to advanced economies, suggesting the
possibility of indirect second-round effects of advanced country developments on Dominica’s economic
performance.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
5.
Economic activity appears to be losing further momentum. Real activity expanded by
1 percent in 2011 (at market prices6), supported by major public sector works and a recovery in
agriculture following the 2010 droughts. With some of these factors no longer in play in 2012,
short−term indicators point to a likely slowdown in activity (Figure 2). Construction is slowing with
the winding up of large public infrastructure projects. Banana production, still a major sector of the
Dominican economy, has been affected by the outbreak of a banana leaf disease and, despite the
authorities’ swift action to contain the contamination, production is likely to contract by close to
15 percent. Tourism indicators also point to a

The authorities have recently developed a series for real GDP measured at market prices (the most common
measure in international practice), which is used throughout this report and which differs from the factor price GDP

Price pressures remain subdued on low imported inflation and limited pass-through of
world commodity prices. Consumer price inflation hovered between -½ and 2½ percent year-onyear over the past eighteen months, and was just 0.6 percent as of June 2012. While food prices
have been rising, averaging some 3¼ percent during 2012, the close relationship between world and
Dominican food prices appears to have weakened, and a large portion of the recent international
food price increase has not passed through to domestic prices due in part to a strong crop outturn
in 2011 following droughts the previous year. In

Weak activity and supportive policies have taken a toll on the fiscal position. Since the
beginning of the crisis, the central government’s primary balance weakened by 5 percentage points,
to a deficit of 2.9 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2011 (that ended in June 2012) (Figure 5). Higher
social and infrastructure spending to support the economy and deal with the aftermath of natural
disasters have been the main contributors to this deterioration. However, FY2011 saw the first
significant drop in tax revenues (1½ percentage points of GDP). The mission welcomed the prompt
action taken by the authorities to restrain current spending and contain the ensuing deterioration in
the fiscal position, but these efforts―along with

continued provisioning for impaired loans and exposures to the failed regional insurance group
CL Financial,11 along with diminishing interest income, have generated losses in a large part of the

The floor is mandatory only for banks, but―through competition pressures―is applied by credit unions as well. It
imposes a notable cost on financing institutions in the current financial environment because they invest their large
excess liquidity (that costs them at least 3 percent) into near-zero rate instruments and prevents rates from falling.

11

Dominica’s gross exposure, which totals 11½ percent of GDP, is concentrated in three subsidiaries of the group:
(i) CLICO Trinidad and Tobago (gross exposures of ¼ percent of GDP), which has recently been resolved and
long−term bonds have been issued to holders of its deposit-like obligations (“annuities”); (ii) CLICO Barbados
(exposures of 5¾ percent of GDP), which will be sold in its entirety (traditional insurance business and annuities)
once the ECCU and Barbados governments agree on how to cover its negative equity; and (iii) BAICO Trinidad and
Tobago (exposures of 5½ percent of GDP), whose traditional insurance business has been recently sold but whose
annuity obligations remain to be resolved, as agreement has not been reached on who will bear the losses. The bulk
of Dominica’s gross exposure (10½ percent of GDP) is in the annuities.

credit union sector, with assets amounting to almost 40 percent of GDP or about 20 percent of
financial sector assets—one of the largest levels in the world—the average ratio reflects the better
capitalized dominant credit union, while several smaller institutions remain poorly capitalized. In the
offshore banking sector, a bank has been recently intervened and is under liquidation following the
knock-on effect from the failure of its correspondent bank; the bank has no ties to the onshore
domestic system.

Despite the decline in tourist arrivals during 2010–11, a 2010 survey used by the authorities shows a 30 percent
increase in daily tourist spending for these years, which resulted in significant revisions to the tourism receipts in the
balance of payments for these years. This revision has put tourism receipts at historical highs (23.4 percent of GDP in
2011), raising issues whether the receipts are overstated. A subsequent survey, conducted in 2012, has found that
daily tourist expenditures have since fallen.
13

Commercial banks in Dominica have reduced significantly their exposure to the rest of the ECCU-area banks and
have received large inflows of deposits from elsewhere in ECCU during 2011, which have started to reverse in 2012.

Going forward, the balance of payments may be pressured by continued external
headwinds. The recent surge in commodity prices and some weakening in tourism receipts
(additional cancellations of cruise line calls in the winter season this year) will renew the pressures
on the balance of payments in the near term, with the current account deficit projected to
deteriorate slightly to 13⅓ percent of GDP in 2012. Over the medium term, the current account
deficit is anticipated to widen further with an expected weakening in inflows from the economic
citizenship program, but will remain within the range of 13–15½ percent of GDP. While FDI and
grants may still be able to finance the bulk of the deficit, public external borrowing is expected to
cover the remaining financing needs.
13.
Despite the recent improvement in the external position, a significant competitiveness
gap remains. While the external current account has so far been adequately financed, its
sustainability over the medium term is doubtful, as it would lead to a further deterioration in the
already large negative net foreign asset position (Box 2). Indeed, the external sustainability and the
macro-balance approaches of the IMF’s CGER methodology suggest that the current account deficit
remains above norms determined by fundamentals and by the need to stabilize the country’s net
foreign asset position, with a real exchange rate adjustment of about 20 percent required to align it
with the norms (Annex I). Weakening competitiveness is also apparent in rapidly declining market
shares of goods and services exports, and more recently the appreciation of the real effective
exchange rate (REER) along with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies.
14.
Risks to the macroeconomic outlook are tilted to the downside in the short term, but
to the upside in the medium term.


In the near term, the planned stoppage of flights from American Airlines―the only
non-regional carrier servicing the island―in the spring of 2013 is a threat to the further
development of the tourism industry, already burdened by lack of easy air access, and to the
balance of payments. A further slowdown in advanced economies could directly dampen
tourism receipts, FDI, and remittances, and even though this direct effect is estimated to be
small, larger spillovers are likely through confidence channels. Finally, there are non-negligible
downside risks from events that can adversely impact the balance of payments―such as a
higher commodity import bill, natural disasters, weaker tourism receipts, and lower inflows
through the economic citizenship program―which could lead to tighter monetary conditions
(given the quasi-currency board arrangement) and depress growth (Box 3).



In the medium term, the outlook for growth and the balance of payments could be
significantly more favorable should the benefits of geothermal energy development and/or
the planned opening of new tourism facilities have a larger impact than currently anticipated.
In the case of geothermal energy, preliminary results from explorations gauging Dominica’s
potential to produce and export geothermal energy have been positive, and the authorities
are planning to build a geothermal electricity plant over 2013–15 with capacity to fully cover
domestic energy consumption. An additional plant for the generation of geothermal energy
for export to neighboring islands may be built afterward. In addition to the direct effect on
growth, the authorities estimate that geothermal energy would reduce electricity

Box 2. Dominica’s Net Foreign Asset Position
Dominica has a large negative net foreign asset (NFA) position, albeit stronger than most of its
tourism-based Caribbean peers. Its NFA stood at -115 percent of GDP in 2011, compared to a median of
−31 percent of GDP for all countries in the world and a median of -219 percent of GDP for the rest of the
tourism-based Caribbean.1 Dominica’s NFA has improved substantially during the pre-crisis period, as a
result of an increase in non-bank sector assets as reported by the Bank for International Settlements.2 The
NFA position weakened post-crisis, however, with an increase in public sector external debt and a
deterioration in commercial banks’ net foreign asset position.

The main options available to improve Dominica’s net foreign asset position include a depreciation of
the real exchange rate to induce expenditure switching from non-tradables to tradables, expenditure
compression through fiscal adjustment to directly reduce domestic absorption, and finally structural
reforms to improve competitiveness. The latter option has significant benefits and should be undertaken
regardless of other policy choices.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
The financial crisis brought out the difficulties of managing currency union countries
through economic stress and has exposed policy and institutional challenges. Monetary policy
in the union has remained unchanged throughout the crisis―failing to import the significantly
eased U.S. monetary policy―and the real effective exchange rate has depreciated only moderately
given the hard peg to the U.S. dollar. Thus, fiscal policy has been the only tool to support economic
activity, but it is running against the constraints of high debt levels and limited access to markets.
The crisis also unveiled weaknesses in financial regulation and supervision―at the union level in the
case of banks and at country level in the case of other financial institutions.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The policy discussions therefore focused on ways to strengthen the fiscal position,
reduce vulnerabilities in the financial system, and improve growth prospects. The
unanticipated weakening in tax revenues brought to the fore the need to start unwinding the fiscal
stimulus and contain spending. Staff and the authorities agreed on the fiscal targets going forward,
and discussed options for expenditure savings and reforms to the public financial management
system to strengthen spending control and anchor near-term fiscal policies. In the financial sector,
the immediate challenge is to strengthen weaker nonbank financial institutions. With little policy
room to support growth, bold structural reforms are needed to close the competitiveness gap and
increase growth potential.

A. Fiscal Policies: Achieving the Consolidation Objectives
17.
Absent a strong and early policy response, this year’s budget targets may be out of
reach and financing pressures may emerge. The budget for FY2012 targets a primary deficit of
0.3 percent of GDP, close to the authorities’ commitment under the RCF request.14 The significant
adjustment implied by the budget (some 2½ percentage points of GDP) is predicated on current
spending restraint, increased nontax fees and import duties, and a sound recovery in revenues due
to robust assumed growth (close to 2 percent). The mission welcomed the authorities’ attempts to
restrain spending and strengthen revenues, but pointed out that in light of last year’s revenue
shortfall and the likely weaker-than-budgeted growth, the targets may be out of reach. Staff projects
that the primary deficit will likely narrow to only 2⅓ percent of GDP in FY2012. If these projections
materialize and if the anticipated below-the-line purchase of shares in the regional airline LIAT
(0.6 percent of GDP) goes through, a notable financing gap—about 2½ percent of GDP—might
open this fiscal year. The mission advised that early policy action is needed to prevent the widening
of the deficit and that consideration should be given to further financing sources to avoid potential
liquidity pressures. The authorities were more optimistic on the fiscal outlook for this year, but
expressed their readiness to further restrain current spending if budget shortfalls open up, and are
also considering further issuances on regional securities markets to cover remaining financing gaps.

14

Net of flood-related spending, the budgeted primary surplus is about 0.4 percent of GDP, close to the authorities’
commitment under the RCF (0.6 percent of GDP). Given last year’s revenue shortfall, however, the adjustment effort
required to achieve this target is about 2 percentage points of GDP larger than under the RCF.

Staff noted that fiscal policy is reaching its limits in terms of its ability to support
economic activity. Debt, while largely concessional, is over 70 percent of GDP, above what might
be considered prudent for a developing economy. Under current policies, staff projects that the
primary deficit will remain at 1¼ to 2 percent of GDP over the medium term, as the factors behind
the recent underperformance are assumed to persist, the receipts from the economic citizenship
program would not be sustained at the current high levels, but some post-flood rehabilitation works
would wind up.15 At these levels the deficit could

regional debt target by 2020.
19.
In staff’s view, the balance of risks to the fiscal outlook is broadly balanced. The
downside risks stem from: (i) ongoing public sector wage negotiations (covering ex-post the
FY2010–12 triennium); (ii) a faster than anticipated decline in receipts from the economic citizenship
program, which surged in the wake of the Arab Spring and masked the recent tax
underperformance; (iii) liquidity pressures from the potential need to take over debt servicing of
parastatal entities (some of which are running losses) or of the development bank (whose portfolio
suffers from large delinquencies)16; and (iv) contingent liabilities from the financial system.17 On the
upside, the eventual cyclical upturn may boost tax revenues to pre-crisis levels, especially if growth
surprises on the upside. While the authorities agreed that there are important downside risks, they
also believed that the upside risks would prevail as they are somewhat more optimistic about the
near-term growth outlook than staff.
20.
The authorities shared the staff view that fiscal policies need to focus on achieving
more favorable debt dynamics, while mitigating the adverse effects on the fragile recovery. The
discussion focused on the deficit targets, the pace and the composition of the adjustment:

15

Relative to previous reports, staff has relaxed the assumption that large infrastructure projects would not be
replaced as they wind up, in part because of the increased likelihood of new projects coming on stream, e.g. those
related to geothermal energy exploration.

16

The debts of these institutions are guaranteed by the government and already included in the debt statistics.

17

The face value of these contingent liabilities is estimated at 9–10 percent of GDP, but their expected cost is smaller
in light of the uncertainty about the extent to which the government would need to take them on.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

DOMINICA



Fiscal targets. The mission supported the recent policy shift from targeting a 2.4 percent
primary surplus every year to targeting it over the cycle. This target is more realistic and will
allow cyclical fluctuations to be absorbed by the fiscal balance rather than require policy
tightening.18 Under staff’s baseline projections, reaching the 2.4 percent primary surplus will
require an adjustment effort of 3½–4⅓ percentage points of GDP, depending on the speed of
the adjustment. The mission noted that expenditure restraint alone may not be sufficient to
generate a meaningful improvement in the fiscal position, and that specific and credible policy
measures to attain the primary surplus target need to be formulated.



Pace of adjustment. In light of the weaker fiscal outcomes and growth outlook for the near
term relative to the time of the RCF discussions, the adjustment path envisaged during the
RCF no longer seems feasible. The mission supported the authorities’ intent to return to their
primary surplus target by 2015–16, when the output gap is expected to be about closed. This
would reduce public debt to about 56½ percent of GDP by 2020, comfortably below the
regional target of 60 percent of GDP for that year even in the presence of shocks along the
path. Still, this will require an adjustment effort of some 4 percent of GDP (about
1⅓ percentage points of GDP during each of the next three years). While the adjustment could
temper growth in the short run, staff emphasized that the relatively high share of imported
goods in the consumption basket should limit its contractionary effect on domestic demand
and that the consolidation will also have significant long-term benefits in terms of
macroeconomic stability and improved competitiveness.

The fiscal tightening is assumed to reduce growth by 0.3-0.5 percentage
points per year during the consolidation period, based on staff simulations of a
DSGE model calibrated to ECCU countries, and consistent with empirical
estimates of fiscal multipliers for these economies .

In practice, to make this target operational in the absence of reliable data on the cyclical position of the economy,
the mission suggested that real spending be capped at or below potential GDP growth, while allowing revenues to
absorb cyclical fluctuations. This rule would ensure that―once the desired fiscal balance is achieved―it is broadly
maintained over the cycle.

Composition of the adjustment. The authorities concur that, with tax revenues relatively high
compared to peers, adjustment measures should aim to preserve productive investments and
targeted social spending, while focusing on: (i) streamlining current spending, especially on
the wage bill, non-essential goods and services, and untargeted social programs;19
(ii) improving the efficiency of capital spending by strengthening the capital budgeting
process, and moving public investment away from consumption-based support (e.g. house
renovation) or support for specific industries towards more productive infrastructure;
(iii) reconsidering the recent decision to leave the public pension age unchanged at 60 and
increase it to 65 to avoid paying pensions that

21.
A stronger public financial framework (PFM) will be critical in supporting the
adjustment efforts. The current framework was adopted in 1965 and last amended in 1994, and has
some weaknesses that make it difficult to control spending commitments and final fiscal outcomes.
The mission and the authorities agreed that reforming it in line with best international practice could
enhance the government’s ability to manage public finances and improve fiscal outcomes. The
reforms, which could be considered in the near term, could include the following:


Adopting Fiscal Responsibility Legislation to establish the principles of responsible fiscal
management and improve the quality of fiscal reporting. The principles could include, for
example: (i) the institutionalization of the objective of reducing debt to prudent levels;
(ii) providing guidance on how the government should reconcile current debt and deficit levels
with their longer-term objectives―60 percent of GDP debt ratio by 2020 and a 2.4 percent of
GDP primary surplus over the cycle―including rules that should guide fiscal policies until
these levels are achieved; and (iii) establishing the rule that will be followed once this level is
achieved. Increased transparency should involve continued efforts to improve the quality and

19

The recent cabinet decision to abandon plans for the introduction of a system of targeting and monitoring
beneficiaries of social programs, which was being developed with assistance from the World Bank, could set back
efforts to streamline social spending. The mission welcomed the authorities’ intention to continue improving the
current system of tracking beneficiaries and encouraged them to pursue an in-depth assessment of social programs
with a view to adopting a more systemic approach to the provision of social support, including potentially through a
gradual introduction of universal coverage to targeted groups as an alternative to currently overlapping programs.

frequency of financial reporting, especially in-year reporting, and requiring the production of
consolidated public sector accounts.


Strengthening control over spending commitments, as there is no mandated requirement to
report these commitments when they are entered into, thereby making it difficult to check
their consistency with budget appropriations. Meaningful penalties should also be imposed
when transactions are not reported in line with regulations.



Restricting the use of contingency warrants, which are issued throughout the year by the
government to authorize unbudgeted spending. These warrants are unfunded and allow a
significant amount of spending to bypass initial parliamentary scrutiny and competition with
other spending for the scarce fiscal resources. To strengthen the integrity of the budget,
public money should be allowed to be spent only if first authorized by parliament; a
contingency reserve for unforeseen or emergency spending should be explicitly budgeted to
serve as a cushion until a budget amendment can be passed; and the number of budget
amendments should be limited and should be allowed only after a mid-year review of the
outlook for the revenue, spending, and financing for the year as a whole.



Strengthening control over capital expenditure, by integrating donor-financed project spending
into the main transaction processing system.



Other amendments to the legislation could include: (i) institutionalizing the top-down budget
preparation process that was developed with recent assistance from CARTAC and applied for
the preparation of the FY2012/13 budget; (ii) mandating the internal audit function, as its
strengthening would minimize the risk of noncompliance; (iii) widening the scope of the PFM
and fiscal responsibility frameworks to the general government; and (iv) introducing
meaningful penalties for noncompliance with the provisions of the legislation.



Bringing to fruition other reform efforts already being pursued by the government, such as the
modernization of procurement legislation and the consolidation of the government accounts
into a Treasury single account to simplify cash management and save on overdraft costs.

B. Monetary and Financial Policies: Ensuring Continued Stability
22.
While monetary policy is fully dedicated to maintaining the hard peg to the
U.S. dollar, staff saw some scope for relaxing the policy stance, which is under the purview of
the Monetary Council.20 In particular, the 3 percent floor on savings deposits imposes a cost on the
financial system and the economy in an environment when most risk-free investments yield
near-zero rates. The elimination of this floor at this point in the cycle could help bring rates down
and provide a much needed boost to growth. The authorities took note of staff views and agreed to

20

DOMINICA

examine the issue within the auspices of the Monetary Council along with other governments in the
region.
23.
Staff expressed concerns on the outlook for the financial sector. Persistent economic
weakness and, in the credit union sector, the need for continued provisioning for exposures to the
failed regional insurance companies will depress loan performance, profits, and capitalization in the
near and medium term.21 Liquidity pressures in the weaker credit unions are likely to remain high
until these are resolved. In the absence of safety-net and lender-of-last-resort type arrangements for
the sector, these pressures may expose the financial system to confidence spillover risks, which are
already elevated given financial stress in the ECCU financial system outside Dominica. On the
positive side, efforts to consolidate the banking system across the ECCU may yield important
benefits in terms of increased efficiency, if done on a market basis.
24.
The authorities agreed that priority should be given to addressing weaknesses in
credit unions and strengthening the prudential and supervisory environment, but preferred a
more cautious approach. They noted the recent strengthening of the supervisory toolkit with the
approval of regionally harmonized insurance legislation that tightens capital and reporting
requirements; this follows the approval of similar legislation for credit unions in March 2011. Staff
concurred, but stressed the need for further forceful reforms:


Strengthening the credit unions. The mission advised a quick resolution to the credit unions
with compromised capital adequacy, and that a clear path to full capitalization should be
agreed on, monitored, and enforced by the Financial Services Unit (FSU).22 The authorities
noted that while they are engaging with the credit unions on ways to strengthen their
capitalization, the extent of their final losses and capital adequacy shortfalls will not be clear
until a regional solution for the failed insurance companies emerges. They also pointed to the
ongoing merger discussions among several credit unions. The mission urged earlier action,
since the capital shortfalls are large in some institutions and the ability to raise capital may be
already compromised by weakened income of credit union members. Finally, the mission
advised close monitoring of the liquidity position of the weaker institutions and developing
early contingency plans for dealing with liquidity shortages if these materialize.



Strengthening non-bank regulation and supervision. To strengthen FSU’s enforcement powers,
the mission advised: (i) legislative changes to introduce prompt corrective action for
supervisors, which would require automatic supervisory response to various degrees of credit
union distress; (ii) updating the credit union regulation to make it compatible with the revised
legislation; and (iii) introducing penalties for noncompliance with reporting requirements for

the development bank, among other needed revisions. The authorities agreed, but argued
that the additional discretion in taking regulatory action permitted under current laws allows
them a more calibrated and cautious response in the current vulnerable environment.


As members of the ECCB’s Monetary Council, the authorities have an important role to play in
efforts to strengthen the supervision and regulation of the banking system.23 Staff suggested
that these efforts focus on: (i) taking urgent action to enforce existing prudential norms or
decide on resolution strategies if banks are unable to comply; (ii) tightening provisioning
requirements, introducing prompt corrective action, and upgrading the legal framework for
bank resolution; and (iii) reconsidering the interest rate floor on saving deposits (discussed
above).



Deposit insurance. Given that the quasi-currency board arrangement in the ECCU limits the
lender of last resort function and fiscal resources to bail out banks or credit unions are very
limited, staff recommended that authorities pursue regional efforts to strengthen the
depositor safety net through preparations for the introduction of a deposit insurance scheme.
In addition to improved transparency, deposit insurance would help preserve confidence in
the banking system and reduce the risk of systemic banking sector stress. In coordination with
these efforts, a similar deposit insurance arrangement could be pursued for the credit unions,
given their prominent role in Dominica.

C. Growth and Competitiveness: Moving to a New Growth Strategy

Private Investment

25.
A new growth strategy, focused on enhancing private sector investment, is needed to
invigorate growth. Under the existing strategy, the public sector has long been an important driver
of growth. Public investment averaged 11 percent of GDP over the past decade (among the highest
in Western Hemisphere, but with limited growth dividends), while private investment was among the
lowest. As the authorities recognize, this is an

public transfers or tax incentives as has often been the case so far. Indeed, ensuring sustained future
growth--even if the full benefits of the potential geothermal energy sector are realized—would
require vigorous structural reforms to improve competitiveness and narrow the infrastructure gap.
Specifically, staff emphasized that the new growth strategy needs to focus on:


Fostering the development of the tradable sector, as the only viable growth driver given the
small size of Dominica’s domestic market. This can be achieved through measures to spur
productivity growth in the sector, together with higher external demand triggered by a real
exchange rate depreciation. The authorities agreed that among the policy options generally
available to achieve a real depreciation (nominal depreciation, fiscal adjustment and/or fiscal
devaluation24), fiscal adjustment is the most feasible, given that it is also needed to achieve a
sustainable medium-term fiscal position.



Focusing public investment on productive infrastructure and high-impact social programs to
boost employment. Dominica has a still large infrastructure gap, and there is room for
redirecting existing public investment towards road and other productive infrastructure
spending. Similarly, redirecting social expenditure from subsistence programs towards
schemes that are linked with employment and labor force participation would help create job
search incentives and reduce structural unemployment. The mission welcomed authorities’
recent budget initiatives to introduce pilot programs to graduate people from unemployment
to work and encouraged further efforts in this direction.



Removing structural impediments to competitiveness. While some of these impediments are
unavoidable given pervasive lack of economies of scale, structural reforms could help alleviate
remaining policy-induced bottlenecks.

26.
The authorities agreed with staff that structural reforms to improve the business
climate and reduce the cost of doing business should be stepped up. In addition to the likely
benefits from geothermal energy exploration already pursued by the authorities, there is scope for:


24

Facilitating the development of property markets, including by transitioning from property
transfer taxes towards recurrent property taxes, and creating a more level playing field for
domestic and foreign investors.25 These reforms could help improve labor mobility, attract
foreign investment, increase employment, and support an expansion of agriculture by allowing
inefficiently small or abandoned farms to be purchased and consolidated. The transition away
from property transfer taxes would in part be helped by the completion of ongoing land

A revenue neutral switch from payroll to consumption taxes.

25

There are no recurrent property taxes in Dominica in part because of deficiencies in property registration. Property
taxation relies instead on high transfer taxes applied when properties are sold (about 10 percent), with foreigners
charged an additional 10 percent in alien registration fees (on land holdings above three acres), both of which have a
cascading effect on property prices as properties are resold.

tenure reforms that aim at identifying all land holdings, developing a land registry, and
supporting a land development strategy. The authorities agreed with the desirability of
transitioning from transfer to recurrent property taxes, but believe the current system of
higher taxation of foreign investors is needed to prevent social dislocation.
Deepening free trade agreements to reduce the cost of international trade and input costs



Strengthening the functioning of labor markets, by updating existing legislation to remove
undue restrictions on working hours and improving labor statistics to help guide social and
labor market policies through a better diagnosis of the issues.



Developing credit markets and easing access to finance, through the setup of a credit registry
and facilitating collateral recovery. The development of a central credit registry would facilitate
bank lending decisions through easy access to credit information and increased ability to
identify and assess potential credit risks. The legislation regarding financial institutions’ rights
to seize collateral securing bad debts should be amended to accelerate the lengthy
procedures and heavy judicial involvement, and allow power-of-sale clauses in lending
agreements to permit easier sale of collateral on defaulted loans.

STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
Dominica’s economy faces a challenging recovery ahead. Economic activity has reached
pre-crisis levels, but short-term indicators and a weakening external environment do not bode well
for a strong recovery in the near future. Fiscal policies have provided support to the economy during
the post-crisis period, but will now need to address impending liquidity and sustainability
constraints. Over the medium term, without a change in the growth strategy, the economy could be
facing weak potential growth prospects.
28.
While conditions are not ideal for unwinding the fiscal stimulus, failing to do so risks
undermining fiscal sustainability. Although still moderate, current deficit levels are stoking
financing pressures given the country’s only recent access to regional bond markets, and are quickly
putting debt on an upward path. Staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to restrain spending in the
22

DOMINICA

face of weakening revenues, but believes that a more ambitious consolidation effort will be needed
to fend off liquidity and solvency risks. This effort should focus on streamlining current spending
and targeting public investment on productivity-enhancing infrastructure. The authorities’ intention
to achieve a 2.4 percent of GDP primary surplus within about 3 years would provide an appropriate
pace of consolidation, allowing them to comfortably achieve their debt target of 60 percent of GDP
by 2020, with some room to offset adverse shocks. However, clear consolidation plans need to be
formulated to make the authorities’ commitment to this target more credible. With the fiscal policy
framework now appropriately anchored on maintaining the primary surplus target over the cycle, a
rule establishing expenditure ceilings would stand a good chance of achieving fiscal discipline while
allowing automatic stabilizers to work.
29.
Lasting consolidation should be underpinned by a strengthened fiscal policy
framework. The approach could be two-pronged: (i) the overdue modernization of the current
PFM framework should be used to improve budgetary control over spending commitments and
capital project execution, as well as eliminate unfunded extra-budgetary spending mandates, all of
which would help strengthen fiscal discipline during the budget execution process; and (ii) introduce
fiscal responsibility legislation to guide fiscal policies toward its medium-term objectives, and
increase fiscal transparency across the public sector.
30.
Decisively addressing remaining vulnerabilities in the financial system would help
contain stability risks and aid the recovery. The main vulnerabilities are concentrated in the credit
union sector, and staff sees merit in taking early and decisive regulatory action to strengthen
undercapitalized institutions, before liquidity pressures materialize and risk undermining confidence
in the system. Although such pressures are not likely in the banking system, which remains very
liquid, action to bolster the capital base needs to be taken as well to ensure the system is in a
position to support the economic recovery. The regulatory and supervisory framework for bank and
nonbank financial institutions should be strengthened, including by aligning provisioning norms
with international practice and introducing a prompt corrective action regime to ensure adequate
supervisory response to financial sector weakness. Early preparations for the introduction of deposit
insurance schemes would permit their timely introduction once the financial system is restored to
health and would help address moral hazard concerns by transitioning from the current implicit
blanket government guarantees to explicit, but limited, guarantees, in the absence of financial safety
nets in the ECCU systems.
31.
There appears to be some room for easing the monetary stance, unchanged during the
past nine years. In the current environment of very low interest rates, reconsidering the interest
floor on savings deposits would reduce banks’ funding costs and likely lending rates, providing a
much needed support to the recovery.
32.
Bold structural reforms to boost competitiveness are the main policy lever available to
improve growth prospects. The authorities’ recent steps to harness geothermal energy potential
show significant promise, but there should be no let up in other reforms that would remove
structural bottlenecks and place Dominica in a better position to take advantage of a recovery in

global demand. These reforms include making space for productive public investment to narrow the
infrastructure gap and encourage labor force participation; facilitating the development of property
markets; improving the business environment for the private sector; and facilitating access to
finance, among others. Other policy options to improve competitiveness are predicated on a real
depreciation of the exchange rate to shift productive resources to the tradable sector, with fiscal
consolidation―if undertaken―able to generate such a real depreciation.

1/ In this report, the fiscal operations tables are presented for the first time in the GFSM 2001 format, with the view to ensure cross-country comparability in terms of
concepts and presentation. This resulted in the reclassification of certain items, causing fiscal data reported here to not be fully comparable to earlier reports.
2/ Fiscal year (July–June) basis. Figures shown for a given calendar year relate to the fiscal year beginning on July 1 of that year.
3/ Does not include grants that were received but not spent.
4/ Direct debt and debt of the parastatal entities guaranteed by the central government, excludes debt incurred under Petro Caribe arrangement with Venezuela (except
for the RCF columns).

ANNEX I. REAL EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE RATE AND
EXTERNAL COMPETITIVENESS
Recent indicators suggest that the long-standing challenges with external competitiveness
may be intensifying.
The real effective exchange rate (CPI-based) reversed its two-year long depreciation trend and
has been appreciating since August 2011 along with the strengthening of the US dollar vis-à-vis
the euro. Measured relative to Dominica’s tourism customers, however, the appreciation has
been larger over the past two years, since the tourism customer countries (mostly advanced
economies) had significantly lower inflation than Dominica’s other trading partners.

Dominica’s share in the exports of goods and services has also declined significantly. In the case
of goods, a number of manufacturing facilities have closed over the years, unable to cope with
the high costs of production, especially electricity. In tourism, stay-over arrivals have declined
over the past few years, potentially due to limited air access, and visitors from cruiseships have
plunged since the cancellation of cruiseship calls in the summer season of 2011. Reflecting these

developments, the Dominica’s share of tourist arrivals in the ECCU has fallen from a peak of
about 16½ percent in 2004 to 10.4 percent in 2012.
Traditional CGER methodologies suggest the existence of a significant current account gap,
pointing to an overvalued real effective exchange rate.
Two of the three methodologies point to a 4 to 4½ percent of GDP current account gap,
implying an overvaluation in the range of 18–21 percent.1 In particular, the macroeconomic
balance approach suggests that over the past four years the current account deficit has been
above the savings-investment norm determined by fundamentals, with the projected deficit over
the medium-term implying an overvaluation of 21 percent. The external stability approach
suggests that stabilizing Dominica’s net foreign asset position would require a real exchange
rate depreciation of about 18 percent relative

ANNEX II. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS: UPDATE
The fiscal outlook has deteriorated since the previous reports on weaker outturns and robust
investment projections, setting public debt on an upward path under unchanged policies. While the
risk of public external debt distress was maintained at “moderate”, the odds of a “high” risk of distress
are increasing as a result of the deterioration in debt dynamics and the ensuing breach of some debt
and debt service thresholds in the baseline and stress scenarios.
Background. The macroeconomic and fiscal outlook for Dominica has weakened relative to the
2011 Article IV consultations and the 2012 Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) arrangement. This reflects
signs of slowing economic activity in 2012 that is expected to affect the near-term outlook; weaker
fiscal outcomes in fiscal years 2010–11; and a weaker fiscal outlook in staff’s medium-term
projections due to a stronger public investment assumption. The assumptions used in the DSA are
as follows:
 Macroeconomic assumptions. Growth is projected
to slow to about ½ percent in 2012, and to pick
up only gradually over the medium term to a
potential of close to 2 percent. The potential
growth is similar to the one estimated in
previous reports, but the near-term prospects
are weaker in light of the faltering demand at
home and abroad. Inflation is projected to
remain around 2 percent over the near and
medium-term, similar to the previous reports.

Measured at factor costs.

 Fiscal assumptions. In staff’s baseline scenario, the primary balance improves somewhat over
the medium term, due to the compression in infrastructure spending with the winding down of
some of the post-flood rehabilitation work. A stronger improvement, however, is held back by
(i) a likely fading of non-tax receipts from the economic citizenship program, which surged in
recent years following unrest in the Middle East; and (ii) the new assumption that large ongoing
infrastructure projects would be replaced by new spending once they wind up rather than
reduce capital spending pro tanto, as in previous reports. Concessional lending and grants are
expected to continue playing a major role in financing the overall fiscal deficit in line with
Dominica’s long-standing policy, with the grant element of new external financing expected at
about 27 percent in the coming years, broadly in line with the previous assumptions. The
discount rate used to derive the net present value of debt stocks is set to 3 percent, compared
to 4 percent previously.

Public debt outlook. The debt outlook has deteriorated since the 2011 Article IV consultation and
the RCF request, reflecting both the weaker fiscal

position and the downward revision of the

reports. It increases from 70.2 percent of GDP in

FY2011 to above 80 percent by FY2020, away from
the ECCU target of 60 percent (Figure A1 and
40

surplus target of 2.4 percent of GDP—which is also

in line with historical primary surpluses achieved
over the past decade―would significantly improve
the debt outlook, setting it on a rapidly declining path and allowing the authorities to meet the
ECCU target even in the presence of plausible macroeconomic shocks.
External debt outlook. The outlook for the external debt, on the other hand, has improved notably
over the near and medium-term because of large revisions to the external current account balance,
which show a narrower deficit for 2010–11.1 As a result of these revisions, near-term external debt is
projected to be significantly lower than at the time of the RCF, although growing public debt will put
external indebtedness on an upward path over the long-term (Table A3). Bound tests show that
under the current baseline scenario one of the five thresholds applicable to public external debt is
breached (present value of debt-to-GDP), with the other ratios below the thresholds for the entire
projection horizon (Figure A2). Under alternative scenarios, the country appears vulnerable to the
possible deterioration in the terms of new borrowing, which leads to a breach of another threshold
(debt service to exports). In practice, however, the vulnerability is muted by the fact that most of the
financing is not on market terms and hence unlikely to be subject to term revisions.
Debt distress rating. Staff has maintained its assessment of a “moderate” risk of public external
debt distress, but the odds of a “high” risk of distress are increasing as a result of the deterioration
of the debt outlook, the breach of a threshold under the no-policy-change scenario (external public
debt-to-GDP ratio), although this is expected only in the long-term, and the breach of additional
thresholds under the stress scenarios (external public debt-to-GDP ratio and debt service to export
ratio).

1

A recent tourism expenditure survey by the authorities conducted in August 2010 and used to estimate tourism
receipts for the period 2010–11, found a 26 percent increase in tourism spending relative to the previous survey. This,
together with a revision in other service receipts, resulted in a 3½ percentage points of GDP reduction in the current
account deficit for 2010. This revision, and a less-than-anticipated impact of food and fuel prices on the balance of
payments, reduced the current account estimate for 2011 from 23½ percent of GDP at the time of the RCF request to

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement: Dominica is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union,
which has a common central bank (the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank) and currency (the Eastern
Caribbean dollar). Since July 1976, the Eastern Caribbean dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar
at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar. Dominica has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections
2, 3 and 4, and maintains an exchange rate free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.

VIII. Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), of which Dominica is a member, is subject to a full safeguards
assessment under a four year cycle. The most recent assessment was completed in
November 2011, and concluded that the ECCB continues to have appropriate control
mechanisms in place. Its control systems are well developed and supported by robust external
and internal audit mechanisms; the published financial statements are comprehensive; and
safeguards exist to protect the autonomy of the ECCB. Some improvements in the legal
framework and internal audit mechanism were recommended, including securing the hierarchy
of the ECCB Act in case of conflicting national or supranational regulations and enhancing ECCB
Board autonomy. The next assessment will take place in 2015.
IX. Article IV Consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board
on July 22, 2011 on a lapse of time basis; the relevant document is IMF Country Report No.
10/261. Dominica is on a 12-month cycle.
X. Technical Assistance: Dominica has received significant technical assistance from Caribbean
Regional Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC) and the IMF. Technical assistance missions
focused on tax reform, revenue administration, expenditure rationalization, financial sector, and
Public Financial Management (PFM):1/

The most recent assessment of Dominica’s AML/CFT regime has been conducted by the Caribbean

Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) in 2009.

Macroeconomic Programming and Analysis


In January 2011 and January 2012, CARTAC’s MAC Programme provided assistance to
the Macro Policy Unit, Ministry of Finance, to strengthen and update the medium-term
fiscal framework to feed into the budget preparation process.

FSAP: A joint IMF/World Bank team performed an assessment of the financial sector of the
member states of the ECCU, in two missions—September 1–19 and October 20–31, 2003. The
principal objective of the missions was to assist the authorities in assessing the development
needs and opportunities for the financial sector and identifying potential vulnerabilities of
financial institutions and markets to macroeconomic shocks, as well as the risks to
macroeconomic stability from weaknesses and shortcomings in the financial sector. A detailed
assessment of the AML/CFT regimes of Dominica was conducted in September 2003 by the
Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF). The Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA)
was discussed by the Executive Board on May 5, 2004, and subsequently published on the IMF’s
external website, including the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on
Banking Supervision.

ANNEX II. DOMINICA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD
BANK GROUP
The World Bank Group’s Management presented to its Board the Organization of the Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS) Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) on June 8, 2010. The RPS covers the
five year period July 2009—June 20141. In May 2012 a Progress Report on the OECS RPS has also
been presented to the Board, which confirmed that the interventions proposed under the RPS
remained valid and have targeted critical vulnerabilities that the countries face. These two papers set
forth the terms of engagement of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA) and the International Finance Corporation
(IFC) with the countries of the Eastern Caribbean, sub-regional organizations and other development
partners in pursuit of the following strategic objectives: (a) building resilience; and (b) enhancing
competitiveness and stimulating growth over the medium term.
To help build resilience, the Bank Group supports interventions aimed at promoting fiscal and debt
sustainability, protecting and improving human capital—particularly social safety nets, education
and health—and strengthening climate resilience.
To help enhance competitiveness and stimulate sustainable growth, it focuses its support on two
critical areas: strengthening the countries’ domestic financial sectors and improving access to quality
services to create more competitive business environments. The Strategy is aimed at providing
remedial measures to address the crippling effects of the global and regional crises, while
supporting key policy reforms that establish a platform for growth in the medium term.
The planned program of support will entail new commitments totaling up to about US$120 million
on IBRD terms for the six OECS countries over the RPS period (FY10–14) and up to US$73 million
(SDR 48 million) of IDA financing2 for the four OECS “blend” countries3.

A. Projects
Dominica participates in one active regional Bank’s project (EGRIP). The OECS E-Government for
Regional Integration Program (EGRIP) is a regional program (including Dominica, Grenada,
St. Lucia and St. / Vincent and the Grenadines) which was approved by the Board in May 2008,
including an US$2.3 million IDA Credit to Dominica. The program is designed to promote the
1

While the OECS comprises six independent countries and three British Overseas Territories, this Strategy
covers only the six independent countries, namely: Antigua and Barbuda; Dominica; Grenada; St. Kitts and
Nevis; Saint Lucia; and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Excepting St. Vincent and the Grenadines which did not
join IFC, all are members of the World Bank Group.

About SDR$ 33 million, as of September 7, 2012, for the remaining IDA-16 period.

efficiency, quality, and transparency of public services through the delivery of regionally integrated
e-government applications that take advantage of economies of scale. The program is structured in
phases. Phase 1 focuses on cross-sectoral e-government issues, as well as on specific applications in
the public finance area (including Public Financial Management, tax, customs and procurement), and
also includes an e-government pilot project in health (possibly together with preparatory and
complementary activities in other social and productive sectors). Subsequent phases are expected to
deepen the assistance provided under Phase 1, while expanding the program to cover other sectors,
in particular education, agriculture, and tourism, among others. The project is expected to close in
August 2013. As of today, the project has disbursed US$ 0.73 million, and the undisbursed balance
is US$ 1.57 million.
In June 2012, a World Bank team visited Dominica to carry out an identification and preparation
mission for a project currently in pipeline, a proposed Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project, which
would also benefit from the concessional resources of the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience
(PPCR).
Under the climate change pillar of the RPS, the Bank and IFC are engaging with Dominica to provide
advisory services for the exploitation of its geothermal resources. The objective is the identification
of a coordinated set of activities where the World Bank Group could bring its global expertise in
developing geothermal renewable resources that would complement the assistance being provided
by other development partners, taking into account the Government’s priorities.

B. Economic and Sector Work
The Bank has completed a series of analytical products relating to public expenditure, fiscal and
debt sustainability, growth and competitiveness, the financial sector, public sector management and
social protection. The ongoing dissemination of these reports represents a key instrument for policy
dialogue with the OECS governments, including Dominica.
The Bank’s program in Dominica is further supported by a comprehensive series of completed
analytical and advisory activities, including the following: “Towards a New Agenda for Growth”—
OECS growth and competitiveness study (2005); An OECS Skills Enhancement Policy Note (2006); a
Caribbean Air Transport Report (2006); a regional study on Crime, Violence, and Development:
Trends, Costs, and Policy Options in the Caribbean (2007); an OECS Private Sector Financing Study
(2008); the OECS Tourism Backward Linkages Study (2008); the report titled “Caribbean—
Accelerating Trade Integration: Policy Options for Sustained Growth, Job Creation and Poverty
Reduction” (2009); a study on the Nurse Labor & Education Markets in the English-Speaking
CARICOM: Issues and Options for Reform (2009); and Caribbean Regional Electricity Supply Options:
Toward Greater Security, Renewable and Resilience (2011).

ANNEX III. DOMINICA: RELATIONS WITH THE
CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (CDB)
(As of September 11, 2012)
The CDB has played a significant role in Dominica’s development process. Bank support has been
provided through the provision of investment loans and technical assistance grants, as well as
special economic stabilization loans during a crisis in 2003–2004. The Bank has also extensively
utilized its Basic Needs Trust Fund for poverty reduction interventions. These resources have gone
towards boosting the productive capacity of the economy, strengthening human resource
development and, in particular, improving economic management systems, expanding agricultural
output, improving critical economic infrastructure, upgrading ecotourism sites, promoting shelter
development and supporting development in the territory reserved for Dominica’s indigenous
people, the Kalinago. Disaster rehabilitation works have also been a frequent element of
interventions.
Total loans and grants approved over the period 1970–2011 amounted to USD212 million, making
Dominica the seventh largest beneficiary among the Bank’s 18 borrowing members. At end-2011,
CDB’s loan exposure to Dominica was USD74.1 million, which represented 11.2percent of CDB’s total
disbursed debt outstanding.
Following unusually high disbursements in 2003 and 2004, which represented CDB’s support to
Dominica during the crisis period, lending to the country stagnated, with net resource flows turning
negative from 2006 though 2008 (Table). This downtrend reflects some caution on the part of the
Dominican government to borrow after a debt restructuring in 2004, particularly as efforts to
maintain prudent fiscal policies and enhance debt sustainability have been facilitated by strong
inflows of grant resources in recent years. However, positive net resource flows from CDB to
Dominica have resumed since 2010, amid reduced grant inflows. Disbursements been high, mainly
reflecting the implementation of key interventions programmed in CDB’s Country Strategy Paper for
Dominica for the period 2010 to 2012, a line of credit for productive sector development and an
education enhancement project.

ANNEX IV. DOMINICA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision has notable shortcomings due to capacity constraints, but is broadly adequate for
surveillance. There are weaknesses in coverage, accuracy, frequency, and timeliness of data that
continue to hamper more effective economic analysis and policy formulation. Priority should be
given to compilation and dissemination of national accounts at a quarterly basis, and to tourism,
agriculture and labor statistics. Despite progress, significant weaknesses remain in the compilation
of fiscal accounts and the balance of payments. Dominica participates in the General Data
Dissemination System. However the metadata for national accounts, external sector and government
finance statistics have not been updated since December 2002.

A. Real Sector
Nominal GDP data are compiled using the production and the expenditure approaches only
annually. Beginning 2011, estimates are compiled using 2006 as the new base year. GDP estimates
are available about four months after the end of the year and are usually finalized with a two-year
lag. CPI data are compiled on a monthly basis. The weights are based on the 2008/09 Household
Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) with a base period June 2010.There is a program to develop
export and import price indices (XMPIs), but a shortage of staff working on price statistics limits
developments in CPI methodology and the likelihood that XMPIs will be developed in the near
future. Data on employment are limited and there are no official data on producer prices. A new
census was conducted in 2011, but detailed results have not yet been finalized

B. Government Finance
Statistical capacity problems affect the timely production of quality government finance statistics.
Monthly data can be obtained but they show some shortcomings. In particular, the data are subject
to frequent revisions stemming in part from omissions and misclassifications. Capital expenditure
data reported in the public sector investment program (PSIP) are not timely. Delays in the reporting
the PSIP data stem from reporting delays from line ministries. Ongoing initiatives to strengthen
expenditure management should help minimize the extent of this problem. A new automation
technology, mandatory for all ministries and suppliers of goods and services, was installed in all line
ministries in 2005 and is the basis for the reporting.
Although progress has been made in improving the measurement of the government debt, data
show shortcomings and are not tracked continuously. Very limited financing data are available. The
authorities do not provide consolidated nonfinancial public sector data. Data for the rest of the
public sector—Dominica Social Security and the public enterprises—are obtained directly from each
entity with frequent delays and omissions. No government finance data are reported to STA for
publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) or the Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
Yearbook.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DOMINICA

C. Monetary Statistics
Monetary statistics are compiled and reported to the Fund by the ECCB on a monthly basis based on
a standardized report adopted in 2006. The institutional coverage of monetary statistics needs to be
improved by including the accounts of mortgage companies, building societies, credit unions, and
insurance companies. The lack of data on credit unions is a serious shortcoming as the sector is
large in Dominica. In this respect, close coordination between the ECCB and the single regulatory
unit (which supervises financial corporations other than those licensed under the Banking Act) is
crucial.

D. Balance of Payments
Balance of payments data are compiled by the ECCB on an annual basis. Although recent data
comprise a more detailed breakdown of goods than in the past, in other areas they do not provide
sufficient detail to enable publication of the full classification used in the fifth edition of the Balance
of Payments Manual. Annual data up to 2011 are published in the IFS. In general, enhanced data
resources and better compilation procedures are needed to improve the accuracy and timeliness of
balance of payments statistics. Efforts should also be made to compile quarterly balance of
payments statistics and the annual international investment position statement, which is currently
unavailable owing to capacity constraints. However, the Fund’s Statistics Department is scheduled to
provide assistance to Dominica and the ECCB to collect the necessary information to produce IIP
data. To improve the quality of tourism data, the authorities are conducting a visitor expenditure
survey on a half yearly basis. Starting 2013, they plan to conduct the survey on a quarterly basis to
improve the availability of information in this area.

E. External Debt
The Ministry of Finance maintains a database on public and publicly-guaranteed external loans that
provides detailed and reasonably current information on disbursements, debt service, and debt
stocks, while the Treasury maintains the data on bonds placed abroad. Data from the two databases
are not consolidated, requiring further adjustments to measure total debt stock. In addition,
information on payments by creditor (actual and scheduled) should be available to the compilation
agencies at least on a monthly basis, in order to produce timely debt stock data. Data on private
external debt stocks are not available, other than from the monetary survey in the case of
commercial banks

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Dominica
On November 7, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Dominica.1
Background
The economic recovery continues, but is losing momentum. Over the past two years,
Dominica’s economy grew at a tepid rate of about 1 percent, supported by a notable fiscal
stimulus, and output recovered to its pre-crisis peak. The pace of activity has been decelerating
so far this year with weakening external and domestic demand, and staff forecasts growth of
about ½ percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2012. Weak demand has kept price
pressures subdued and, along with a recovery in service receipts, contributed to a significant
adjustment in the external current account deficit. While rising world food prices may contribute
to a modest pickup in inflation and weigh on the balance of payments in 2012, pressures are
expected to subside later next year. Downside risks to the near-term outlook have intensified
with heightened global uncertainty and the planned stoppage of flights from the only nonregional carrier servicing the island. Geothermal energy development or the opening of new
tourist facilities could strengthen the long-term outlook.
Weak growth and the earlier failure of regional insurance companies have weakened the
resilience of the financial sector in some areas. While the system as a whole remains highly

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

liquid, nonperforming loans and exposures to the failed insurance companies remain a drag on
financial sector’s income and capitalization, especially in the large credit union sector.
Monetary conditions have not eased meaningfully. With policy and lending rates stable
throughout the crisis―as monetary policy in the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union remains
fully committed to maintaining the hard peg to the U.S. dollar―Dominica has not benefited from
the significantly eased U.S. monetary policy rates. Moreover, the real effective exchange rate
has depreciated only moderately, strengthening recently with the appreciation of the U.S. dollar
vis-à-vis major currencies. Expansionary fiscal policy has thus been the only tool to support
economic activity, but strains on the fiscal position have been mounting with subdued growth
and the need to respond to natural disasters. The overall central government deficit widened to
about 4½ percent of GDP in fiscal year 2011–12 and pushed debt to over 70 percent of GDP,
almost 7 percentage points above pre-crisis levels. To meet the increasing financing
requirements, the authorities successfully launched a T-bill in the regional securities market for
the first time since the 2004–05 debt restructuring. With fiscal policies reaching the limits of their
ability to support economic activity, the authorities have budgeted a strong retrenchment for
fiscal year 2012–13, although weakening economic conditions may undermine its feasibility.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that supportive policies have helped the Dominican economy weather
the effects of the global financial crisis. However, worsening external and internal environments
have weakened the forward momentum and amplified risks to macroeconomic stability.
Continued prudent macroeconomic policies, enhanced vigilance in the financial sector, and
accelerated structural reforms remain key to stronger growth prospects.
Noting that the room for countercyclical fiscal support has narrowed considerably, Directors
welcomed the authorities’ intention to return gradually to their pre-crisis primary surplus target.
They agreed that the proposed pace of fiscal adjustment strikes a right balance between the
need to rebuild fiscal buffers over time and the need to support the flagging recovery. Directors
supported the authorities’ efforts to contain spending in the face of weakening revenues.
However, consolidation plans need to be clearly specified and additional measures may need to
be taken to achieve the fiscal targets by streamlining current expenditures and directing capital
spending to infrastructure and other productivity-enhancing investments.
Directors agreed that reinforcing the framework for public financial management should be an
important plank of the authorities’ fiscal strategy. Strengthening budget preparation and
execution and introducing fiscal responsibility legislation would underpin the government’s
ability to rationalize spending and provide an important fiscal anchor in the medium term.
Directors emphasized that maintaining financial stability is an immediate priority. They
encouraged the authorities to address pockets of vulnerability in credit unions to maintain
confidence in the financial system at large. Decisive action is also needed to upgrade
supervision, regulation, and the crisis management framework for all financial institutions,
including by tightening loan loss provisioning requirements. Directors agreed that a lower
interest rate floor on savings deposit would reduce banks’ funding costs and help support the

3

economic recovery. Achieving compliance with international standards against money
laundering and the financing of terrorism is also important.
Directors stressed that revamping the structural reform agenda is necessary to foster private
sector-led growth and boost competitiveness. They welcomed efforts to harness the country’s
geothermal energy potential, which could boost potential growth, and stressed the importance
of accelerating reforms to improve the investment and business environment, narrow the
infrastructure gap, and improve social outcomes.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
