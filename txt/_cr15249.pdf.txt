IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Norway
On September 4, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Norway.
The Norwegian economy performed well in 2014 despite the sharp fall in oil prices toward the
end of the year. Mainland (i.e. non-oil) GDP grew at 2.2 percent, with weaker investment
demand being offset by stronger government consumption. Unemployment stayed at a low level
in 2014, but has recently edged up to 4.5 percent in June according to the labor force survey. The
registered unemployment rate is lower at 2.9 percent in June and more stable, having risen only
0.1 percentage points since June 2014. Inflation has been stable and close to the 2.5 percent
target, helped by moderate wage growth. The exchange rate depreciated significantly in late
2014 and early 2015 with the decline in oil prices, pushing up prices of imported consumer
goods. Meanwhile, house prices are rising rapidly again, albeit with large regional dispersion.
The 2014 structural non-oil deficit was 2.9 percent of Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG)
assets and 5.8 percent of trend mainland GDP. This is below the deficit permitted under the
authorities’ fiscal policy rule, but it still implies a positive fiscal impulse due to strong growth in
GPFG assets. Banks’ profitability has been solid and banks have strengthened their capital ratios,
but reliance on wholesale funding continues. This makes banks vulnerable to turbulence in
global financial markets.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually

every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
The near term outlook has weakened due to lower oil prices. Mainland GDP growth is projected
to slow to 1.3 percent this year with weaker private investment and consumption as demand for
mainland inputs to offshore sector declines. Looking further ahead, the medium and longer term
presents challenges of managing a transition away from the oil-dependent growth model. With
oil investment expected to decline further, resources need to shift from supplying the oil and gas
sector and move toward other tradable sectors or exports of oil-related goods and services.
Unemployment will likely increase in the process, and common currency unit labor costs will
need to adjust downward from the current high level to facilitate this transition.
Downside risks remain. Deceleration of global demand or excess oil and gas supply could lead to
a protracted period of low oil prices, which would undercut growth through a further reduction in
the oil-related demand for mainland goods and services. A significant reduction in property
prices could also occur, which could depress private demand. In addition, there is the risk that
the expected decline in oil-related output in the mainland economy would not be offset by a pickup elsewhere in the mainland economy.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended Norway’s strong economic performance last year with steady
growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. However, they noted that the near-term outlook
has weakened, with lower oil prices and an ongoing slowdown in offshore investment, while
risks in the housing and financial sectors present a challenge. Directors urged vigilance and
prudent policies to safeguard growth and financial stability. They also highlighted the need for
reforms to raise productivity and transition away from the oil-dependent growth model.
Directors supported the current monetary policy stance, while urging a careful monitoring of
inflation and financial stability risks. They agreed that monetary policy should be the first line of
defense if growth turns out significantly weaker than projected, as long as inflation expectations
remain well anchored. They recommended the timely implementation of macroprudential

measures to contain rising household credit, in order to leave room for monetary policy to
support growth while pursuing the inflation target.
Directors noted that fiscal policy this year is broadly appropriate given the projected slowdown.
A number of Directors also considered that maintaining the fiscal impulse next year would be
appropriate in view of the risks to economic growth. Over the medium term, a more neutral
stance would be necessary to allow the shift of resources to other tradable industries.
Directors welcomed the recent recommendations of the commission on the fiscal rule, which
would help smooth the spending of oil revenues, and looked forward to the authorities’ adoption
of rules along those lines. Directors welcomed the conclusions of the FSAP update that the
Norwegian financial system is generally sound and well managed, and commended the
significant measures that the authorities have taken to address financial stability risks.
Nevertheless, they agreed that further measures are needed to reduce risks, including improving
liquidity stress tests, stricter loan-to-value, loan-to-income or debt service ratios, more frequent
comprehensive assessments of small banks, and strengthening the toolkit and funding
arrangements for bank resolution.
Directors emphasized the importance of further structural reforms to support the transition to a
new growth model and improve the efficiency of the economy. In particular, they saw merit in
reducing the preferential tax treatment for residential properties relative to productive
investments, as well as further reforms to the pension system and sickness and disability benefits.
They also stressed that investment in infrastructure, education, and research is key to raising
productivity. Lowering Norway’s extensive agricultural protection and subsidies and relaxing
unnecessary supply restrictions in the housing market would also be important.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 30, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context: The Norwegian economy grew steadily in 2014 despite the sharp fall in oil
prices. Nevertheless, the near term outlook has weakened, and the medium and longer
term present challenges related to shifting away from a growth model dependent on oiland gas-related demand.
Monetary policy: The current monetary policy stance is appropriately supportive.
Inflation has been relatively stable and close to the target. Lower wage growth this year
is likely to reduce the risk of imported prices spilling over to higher domestic inflation. If
growth turns out significantly weaker than currently projected, monetary policy should
be the first line of defense against economic weakness, provided that inflation
expectations are well-anchored.
Financial sector policy: The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update
concluded that the Norwegian financial system is generally sound and well managed.
Nevertheless, high house prices and household debt and banks’ reliance on wholesale
funding are areas of concern, and additional measures are needed to further mitigate
risks.
Fiscal policy: Fiscal policy is broadly appropriate this year in light of the projected
economic slowdown, but a shift to a neutral fiscal stance would be more appropriate in
the medium term on the basis of current projections. If growth is weaker than expected
in 2016, the authorities should allow automatic stabilizers to operate, but stop short of
using fiscal stimulus to replace what would seem to be declining oil-related demand in
the mainland economy. Any fiscal stimulus would also put appreciation pressures on the
exchange rate.
Structural reforms: Structural reforms would support the transition to a growth model
less reliant on oil- and gas-related demand and also further improve the efficiency of the
economy. More neutrality in the taxation of assets, agricultural policy reforms, reducing
the cost of new real estate construction, and further reforms to the pension system and
sickness and disability benefits would all help.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Economic Developments
1.
A sharp oil price drop materialized toward the end of 2014. Oil prices have recovered
somewhat in 2015, but remain about 40 percent lower than their peak in mid-2014. However, the
impact of the oil price drop on the real economy has been limited so far.
2.
The Norwegian economy grew steadily in 2014 despite the fall in oil prices. The
mainland economy grew at 2.2 percent—about the same rate as in the previous year. Weaker

Inflation has been relatively stable and
close to the 2.5 percent target. CPI inflation
excluding tax changes and energy products (CPIATE) averaged 2.3 percent during the first five
months of 2015. While inflation in domestically
produced consumer goods has been edging down,
imported consumer goods recorded strong price
growth in early 2015, partly reflecting the recent
exchange rate depreciation. Inflation expectations
remain well anchored (Figure 3), and nominal wage
growth slowed to 3.1 percent last year.

The exchange rate has depreciated
significantly with the decline in oil prices. The CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) is
about 13 percent below its 10-year historical average, reflecting the recent depreciation (Figure 4).
External Balance Assessments (EBA) suggest that exchange rate is now slightly undervalued (Box 1).
At the same time, the depreciation of the krone has offset some of the deterioration in unit labor
cost (ULC) competitiveness over recent years. The current account surplus narrowed in 2014, driven
mostly by declining oil and gas prices in the latter part of the year. However, the deficits on services
and non-oil goods trade also widened modestly (Figure 4).

5.
The housing market revived in 2014. House prices briefly leveled out in late 2013 but
started to rise again, growing at 7 percent in nominal terms in the first quarter of 2015. House price
developments vary considerably across regions, with the Oslo area recording relatively more robust
price growth while the Stavanger area where petroleum activity is concentrated showing more
subdued growth. Household debt continues to rise, reaching about 220 percent of disposable
income (Figure 5).
6.
The 2014 fiscal outturn entailed a positive fiscal impulse. However, the expansionary
fiscal stance was within the fiscal policy rule that targets a structural non-oil deficit equal to
4 percent of Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) assets. Debt sustainability is not an important
consideration (Annex I); gross public debt is about 30 percent of GDP and net financial assets are
about 250 percent of GDP.
7.
The budget is well insulated from oil and gas prices through the fiscal rule. However,
GPFG assets have been growing much faster than mainland GDP, and a transfer of even a constant
share of its assets implies a trend toward a positive fiscal impulse. Moreover, because the GPFG is
invested abroad, the decline in the krone exchange rate results in a large increase in the size of the
fund relative to GDP.

Banks’ profitability has been solid and banks have strengthened their capital ratios,
but reliance on wholesale funding continues. Roughly 60 percent of funding is wholesale
funding, more than half of it in foreign currency. This makes banks vulnerable to turbulence in
global financial markets.

B. Outlook and Risks
9.
The near term outlook has weakened due to lower oil prices. The impact of the oil price
decline on the mainland economy has been limited so far, and the fiscal position is almost fully
insulated from oil price volatility. Nevertheless, mainland GDP growth is projected to slow to
1.3 percent this year with weaker private investment and consumption as demand for mainland
inputs to the offshore sector declines. Mainland growth is projected to recover moderately next year
as private consumption rebounds in line with a modest increase in oil prices. Inflation is expected to
increase slightly as import prices rise with the exchange rate depreciation but stay below the
2.5 percent target. Unemployment is expected to rise further but remain at a relatively low level.
10.
The medium and longer term presents complex challenges and uncertainties,
particularly given lower oil prices and slowdown of offshore investment. Steadily increasing oil
and gas investment over the last decade has provided persistent demand stimulus to the
increasingly oil- and gas-focused mainland economy (see Annex III for the real sector links between
the offshore and mainland economies). However, investment flattened out last year and is expected
to decline significantly in the coming years, and

growth in the medium term with somewhat higher
unemployment in the transition process, and inflation that remains close to the target. However, this
is based on a scenario in which the sources of growth shift smoothly away from supplying the oil
and gas sector and move toward other tradable sectors of the economy or exports of oil-related
goods and services.
11.
There are downside risks to this central scenario (also see Box 2 for the Risk
Assessment Matrix).


Deceleration of global demand or excess oil and gas supply could lead to a protracted
period of low oil prices. This would undercut growth through a further reduction in the oil-

NORWAY

related demand for mainland goods and services. A deceleration in global demand could also
make it more difficult for non-oil and gas export industries to expand.


A significant reduction in property prices could occur. House prices rose rapidly over the last
decade and most estimates suggest that house prices are significantly overvalued. The recent
FSAP update finds that risks to financial stability are contained. However, with high household
debt, a large fall in house prices—for example, due to a slowdown in real income growth, higher
unemployment, or a large increase in interest rates—could depress private demand with adverse
consequences for retail trade, domestic services, construction and commercial real estate and
lenders to these sectors.



The expected decline in oil-related output in the mainland economy may not be offset by
a pick-up elsewhere in the mainland economy. Resources need to shift from oil-related to
non-oil related tradable sectors to realize the transformation, and labor market flexibility in
particular will be tested in the process. A less smooth transition might lead to further increase in
unemployment, with consequences for income and consumption.



Tighter or more volatile global financial conditions stemming from, for example, asymmetric
monetary policy exit or the re-emergence of sovereign and financial sector stress across the
Euro area could cause renewed stress in the global wholesale funding markets, leading to
liquidity strains for Norwegian banks that rely on wholesale funding.

Authorities’ views
12.
The authorities generally agreed with the risk assessment. They noted that the oil price
drop has curbed economic growth in some regions. Even though the impact of the oil price drop on
the macro economy has been limited so far, sustained lower oil prices will slow oil investment
further. The authorities stressed that a decline in oil investment was expected even before the recent
oil price fall, and the Norwegian economy will need to shift to a new growth model less dependent
on offshore activity in any event. In this regard, current fiscal and monetary policies are supportive
of the transition. The authorities agreed that high household debt is a risk but also noted that both
banks and households had increased buffers through higher capital and saving respectively.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Norway has a sound policy framework in place, but policymakers face a complicated task of
maintaining macroeconomic stability while facilitating the transition to a less oil-dependent economy.
Businesses in the mainland economy will need to adapt to lower demand from offshore activity, and
adjustments will need to take place sooner than previously anticipated if low oil prices persist. Policy
measures need to support structural adjustments, and fiscal policy in particular needs to strike the
delicate balance between maintaining macroeconomic stability and allowing market forces to operate
without inhibiting adjustment.

A. Monetary Policy: Maintaining Price Stability and Supporting Growth
13.
The Norges Bank cut the policy rate twice by a quarter point in December 2014 and
June 2015 bringing it to 1.00 percent. The rate was lowered in December to counter the risk of a
pronounced economic downturn, but the March and May 2015 decisions to hold the rate at
1¼ percent took into account relatively limited impacts of low oil prices on the economy so far as
well as financial stability concerns. Updated projections in June showed only slightly weaker output
(and an upward revision of petroleum investment in the medium-term), but inflation is now
projected to be lower and slightly below the inflation target for the year, and annual wage
settlements in May were very restrained and look likely to deliver a small real wage reduction over
the period of the wage settlement.
14.
The current monetary policy stance is appropriately supportive. Going forward,
monetary policy will need to balance different objectives. Inflation has been stable and close to the
target, and staff’s baseline forecast is for inflation to stay slightly below target this year and next. On
the one hand, the recent weakening of the Norwegian krone has exerted upward pressures on the
prices of imported consumer goods, and staff analysis suggests that the exchange rate pass-through
to imported prices in Norway—although limited—can be persistent.1 On the other hand, interest
rates in key trading partners are low or even negative, growth is moderating, and lower wage
growth this year—the spring 2015 wage agreements are likely to result in 2.7 percent growth in
nominal wages (y/y), down from 3.1 percent last year—is likely to reduce the risk of imported prices
spilling over to higher domestic inflation. In the scenario that growth turns out significantly weaker
than currently projected, monetary policy needs to be the first line of defense against economic
weakness, provided that inflation expectations are well anchored.
15.
Financial stability concerns, at the current juncture, need to be addressed primarily
through macroprudential policy. However, Norway’s inflation targeting framework contains an
element of mitigating the risk of the buildup of financial imbalances, and monetary policy could take
financial stability into account if macroprudential policies have limited effects. In such an event, any
increase in the policy rate would need to be gradual and balance the negative impact on growth
against that of a further buildup of financial sector risks. More generally, the current policy stance
implies a slightly negative real rate, but a negative real rate is unlikely to be sustainable or desirable
in the medium-term, and a gradual return to a normal (nominal) interest rate of about 4 percent—
corresponding to a normal real interest rate of about 1½ percent given the inflation target—is
needed over time.
Authorities’ views
16.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff assessment. They noted that the June
decision to lower the policy rate was based mainly on the assessment that growth prospects and the
1

forces driving inflation further ahead have weakened. To counter the risk that a lower interest rate
may fuel house price inflation and debt growth, the government has strengthened the guidelines on
mortgage loan-to-value limits by changing them into requirements as of July 1, 2015 (see Annex IV),
and increased the countercyclical capital buffer from 1 percent to 1½ percent from July 1, 2016.

B. Fiscal Policy: Facilitating Structural Adjustment
17.
The moderate fiscal expansion this year is broadly appropriate in light of the expected
economic slowdown due to the sharp and largely unanticipated decline in oil prices. The 2015
budget entails an expansionary fiscal stance with a non-oil structural deficit of 6.4 percent of trend
mainland GDP. This is estimated to be equivalent to 2.6 percent of the value of the GPFG, much less
than the full amount targeted under the fiscal rule (4 percent) but still implies a fiscal impulse of
about 0.6 percentage point.
18.
In the medium term, a shift to a broadly neutral fiscal stance would be more
appropriate on the basis of current projections. Should growth turn out weaker than projected in
2016, the authorities should allow automatic stabilizers to operate. However, fiscal stimulus cannot
substitute for lower structural demand, and therefore, the authorities should refrain from using
stimulus to offset any decline in demand that appears to be due to a drop in oil-related demand for
mainland goods and services. Replacing declining oil-related employment with public sector
employment would inhibit the necessary shift of resources from oil-related to other tradable
industries. Also, any fiscal stimulus would add appreciation pressures on the exchange rate.
19.
The government’s fiscal policy has generally been prudent with the non-oil structural
deficit maintained well below 4 percent of GPFG assets in recent years. However, the fact that
GPFG is growing much faster than the economy has allowed widening non-oil deficits as a share of
trend GDP. Also, as the size of GPFG grew, market returns, capital gains, and foreign exchange
valuation effects have replaced oil and gas income as both the main sources of annual growth in the
GPFG and the main contributors to its volatility. The staff took the view that this may call for

supplementary provisions for the fiscal rule. In particular, some consideration of smoothing over
asset price cycles and exchange rate volatility in addition to the business cycle would be in order.
Consideration should also be given to a more explicit approach to avoiding fiscal stimulus at times
when the economy is at or near potential. Staff stressed that proposals along these lines from the
Fiscal Rule Commission would be welcome.
Authorities’ view
20.
The authorities agreed that using fiscal stimulus to replace declining oil-related
demand in the mainland economy could inhibit the necessary shift of resources to other
tradable goods sectors. They emphasized that the 2015 budget takes into account this
consideration and strikes the right balance while supporting the economy. On the fiscal rule, the
government created a Commission to recommend modifications or supplementary provisions to the
fiscal rule because they were aware of the evolving pressures as the GPFG has grown. The
Commission’s report in mid-June 2015 recommended supplementary rules to (i) limit use of the
GPFG over the next 10–15 years to better align the peak use of the GPFG resources with the costs of
population aging; and (ii) set a limit on the fiscal impulse to 0.1–0.2 percent of mainland GDP (see
Annex V). They also noted that they were studying the recommendations of the Commission
carefully, and have issued a public consultation document soliciting input on the Commission’s
recommendations.

C. Financial Sector Policy: Addressing Stability Risks
21.
The FSAP update concluded that the Norwegian financial system is generally sound
and well managed (Figure 6). The authorities have taken significant measures to address financial
stability risk, including early implementation of the CRD IV. More recently, risk weights for residential
mortgages used in banks’ IRB models have been tightened. A countercyclical capital buffer of
1 percent took effect on July 1, 2015, and the buffer will be increased to 1½ percent from July 1,
2016. FSAP bank stress tests suggest that financial institutions’ capital needs in the face of severe
shocks would be nontrivial but manageable.
22.
Nevertheless, there are important challenges with a potential impact on financial
stability. High house prices and household debt and banks’ reliance on wholesale funding are areas
of concern. House prices remain elevated, and the household debt-to-disposable income ratio is
one of the highest among the OECD countries. To finance this, banks have relied extensively on
wholesale funding. In particular:


High household indebtedness makes households potentially vulnerable to house price and
income corrections and interest rate risks.2 Lower house prices or income could force
households to cut consumption sharply, negatively affecting retail businesses and construction,

2

See second chapter of Selected Issues Paper for household stress tests that assess household vulnerability
under various scenarios.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NORWAY

and creditors to these sectors. Staff’s empirical analysis suggests that a 10 percent decline in real
house prices could reduce private consumption by 0.9 percent in Norway (see Annex VI).
Although this is smaller than the estimated impact for other Nordic countries (e.g., 3.5 percent
for Denmark), the aggregate analysis ignores the distributional impact: the effect could be
substantially larger for younger families with more debt and fewer assets.


Banks are vulnerable to turbulence in foreign financial markets as 60 percent of wholesale
funding is from foreign sources. Reliance on wholesale funding in part reflects relatively small
domestic markets for liquid assets. Given the low stock of high-quality liquid assets
denominated in krone, Norges Bank has proposed that the Liquid Coverage Ratio (LCR)
requirement should be set at 60 percent in domestic currency and the total “all currency” LCR
requirement at 100 percent. The FSA has recently proposed that Norwegian SIFIs and other
large institutions shall fulfill a 100 percent LCR from January 1, 2016 while LCR should be phased
in for other institutions in line with the EU regulation. The FSA proposal does not specify LCR
requirements for individual currencies in the regulation. These proposals are currently under
consideration.

23.
In light of these concerns, continued vigilance and proactive efforts toward mitigating
systemic risks are warranted. Staff recommended further measures to reduce risks as follows (also
see Annex VII):


Bank stress tests: The authorities should improve data on cross-border ownership of bankissued unsecured and covered bonds, and resume regular monitoring of bank-to-bank direct
and indirect exposures. They should consider regional stress test exercises, as well as further
steps in liquidity monitoring, such as performing liquidity stress tests using the structure of cash
flows at various maturities.



Macroprudential policy: The authorities should take additional measures to contain systemic
risks from the growth of house prices and household indebtedness, including stricter LTV and
loan-to-income or debt service ratio to supplement the affordability test. The authorities have
recently adopted regulation on requirements for residential mortgage loans, which converts the
FSA’s existing guidelines into explicit requirements, taking effect on July 1, 2015. Staff noted that
this is in the right policy direction in the current context. They should also take additional
measures to contain risks related to banks’ wholesale funding; and improve the existing
institutional structure for macroprudential policies, including a transparent “comply or explain”
approach by decision-makers. Finally, they should consider greater delegation of decisionmaking powers over macroprudential instruments in due course to Norges Bank or the FSA.



Micro-supervision: They should ensure de jure operational independence of the FSA,
strengthen the FSA’s supervision of small banks through the conduct of more frequent
comprehensive assessments, and upgrade its approach to AML/CFT supervision.



Crisis management and bank resolution: They should initiate resolution planning for the
largest banks, including assessing impediments of resolvability, and make explicit delegations to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

the FSA regarding its role. They should also enhance the legal framework for resolution to
comply with the FSB Key Attributes with regard to certain areas including the resolution toolkit.
The Bank Guarantee Fund (BGF) should adopt policies specifying under what conditions board
members must recuse themselves, considering actual and prospective conflicts of interest.
Authorities’ view
24.
The authorities generally agreed with staff’s conclusions. They noted that FSAP
recommendations will be carefully examined in due course. On macroprudential policy, the
authorities noted that new measures to strengthen mortgage lending practices have been
implemented with effect from July 1, 2015 and that the countercyclical buffer will be increased to
1½ percent from July 1, 2016. The work for implementing the EU Banking Recovery and Resolution
Directive (BRRD) is underway, and the transposition of the BRRD into national law would address
some of the staff’s recommendations on the bank resolution framework. More generally, the
authorities stressed that measures such as countercyclical buffers should not be seen as a tool to
fine-tune financial cycles.

substantial reduction in real wage growth with a nominal increase in the national negotiations of
only 0.3 percent.
26.
More neutrality in the taxation of assets would help promote efficiency and support
the transition to a new growth model. A reduction in the extent to which the tax system promotes
housing rather than productive investment would help redeploy new investment toward tradable
industries that will need to replace oil- and gas-related industries as an engine of growth. This could
include less preferential tax treatment for residential properties. The 2015 budget took a step in this
direction by reducing the valuation discount for commercial property and second dwellings from
40 to 30 percent of market value. Staff welcomed the recent recommendations of the Tax
Commission to shift the tax burden toward indirect taxes and further reduce preferential tax
treatment for residential real estate relative to other assets.

in higher unemployment in the process.5 Further reforms to sickness and disability benefits would
help address these challenges and maintain the participation rate in the face of aging population. In
this context, staff welcomed the Productivity Commission’s focus on improved use of manpower
resources and took note of the authorities’ recent measure of replacing disability pensions with
disability benefits which are designed to create incentives to work while receiving disability benefits.
The Productivity Commission’s final report is expected to be presented early next year.

Other structural reforms would help improve efficiency. Restrictions on new real estate
construction have slowed the building of new units and raised the cost of housing; these policies are
currently under review, and staff would welcome new measures that could take some of the
pressure off of housing prices by relaxing unneeded supply restrictions. In addition, Norway’s
extremely high trade restrictions and subsidies in agriculture are diverting private and public

resources away from more productive sectors and raising the cost of living, particularly for lowerincome groups.
Authorities’ view
29.
The authorities agreed on the need to improve productivity and efficiency. They noted
that work is already underway in this area, including the work of the Productivity Commission which
will present its final report in early 2016. Regarding the labor market, the authorities stood ready to
take measures if necessary but at the same time cautioned against the unintended consequences of
locking in parts of the labor force and undermining the warranted structural shift of the economy to
the non-oil competitive industries.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
The Norwegian economy has so far seen limited impact from lower oil prices, but the
near term outlook has weakened. Economic growth held steady in 2014, with inflation close to
target, robust house price growth, and unemployment—although edging up—remaining at a low
level. The sharp depreciation of the krone improved competitiveness, and staff assessed the krone
to be moderately undervalued or close to its equilibrium level. Despite the solid performance last
year, lower oil prices and the ongoing slowdown in offshore investment are expected to put a drag
on mainland growth this year.
31.
The medium and longer term presents challenges of managing a transition away from
the oil-dependent growth model. These challenges have become more urgent with the recent
sharp decline in oil prices. After a decade of steadily providing demand stimulus to the mainland
economy, oil and gas investment has started to decline, and this trend is expected to accelerate in
the years ahead. Resources thus need to shift from supplying the oil and gas sector and move
toward other tradable sectors of the economy or exports of oil-related goods and services. To
facilitate this process, common currency unit labor costs will need to adjust downward from their
current high level, either through higher productivity growth or continued wage restraint for several
years.
32.
The current monetary policy stance is appropriately supportive. A challenge going
forward would be to manage the tensions across different objectives: while growth is moderating,
exchange rate depreciation has exerted upward pressures on imported prices, and overheating risks
in the housing market persist. If growth turns out significantly weaker than currently projected,
monetary policy needs to be the first line of defense against economic weakness, as long as inflation
expectations are well anchored. The prompt implementation of macroprudential measures to
contain rising household credit would leave room for monetary policy to more freely support
growth and pursue its inflation target.
33.
Fiscal policy is broadly appropriate this year given the projected slowdown, but should
shift to a more neutral stance in the medium term. If growth is weaker than expected in 2016,

14

NORWAY

the authorities should allow automatic stabilizers to operate but should stop short of using fiscal
stimulus to replace declining oil-related demand in the mainland economy, as that would inhibit the
necessary shift of resources from oil-related to other tradable industries. More generally,
supplementary provisions for the fiscal rule would be needed to limit the impact of the GPFG’s yearto-year asset return volatility on the fiscal position. The recommendations of the commission on the
fiscal rule would go a long way to addressing these concerns, and staff would welcome the
authorities’ adoption of rules along these lines after the public consultation.
34.
The FSAP update concluded that the Norwegian financial system is generally sound
and well managed, but further measures to reduce risks would be helpful. The authorities have
taken significant measures to address financial stability risks, including early implementation of the
CRD IV. However, additional measures in the area of (i) bank stress tests; (ii) macroprudential policy;
(iii) prudential supervision; and (iv) crisis management and bank resolution would reduce risks
further. Specifically, further steps in liquidity monitoring including improving liquidity stress tests,
stricter LTV, loan-to-income or debt service ratio to supplement the affordability test, more frequent
comprehensive assessments of small banks, and strengthening the toolkit and funding
arrangements for bank resolution would all be welcome.
35.
Structural reforms would support the transition to a new growth model and further
improve efficiency of the economy. Less preferential tax treatment for residential properties
relative to other assets, along the lines of the Tax Commission’s recommendations, would help
redeploy new investment toward other tradable industries. In addition, the pension reform needs to
be completed, and further reforms to sickness and disability benefits would prevent people from
dropping out of the labor market and maintain the participation rate in the face of aging
population. There is also scope for efficiency gains from lowering Norway’s extensive agricultural
protection and subsidies as well as relaxing unnecessary supply restrictions in the housing market.
36.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Norway be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. External Sector Assessment and Competitiveness
Norway’s external position in 2014 remains strong, despite unfavorable terms of trade movements. The
current account surplus narrowed to 11.8 percent of (mainland) GDP, driven by lower oil exports. Meanwhile, the
net international investment position (NIIP) increased to 213 percent of GDP (up from 160 percent in 2013),
benefiting from profitable foreign equity investment by the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) and the
depreciating exchange rate, even as the banking sector is a net external debtor. International reserves increased to
over 19 percent of GDP.
The IMF’s External Balance Assessment (EBA), using data up to March 2015, suggests a wide range of
estimates for misalignment of the Norwegian krone. The EBA analysis of the current account and the REER index
estimate that the krone is mildly undervalued relative to the

undervaluation. EBA estimates are based on data available in March

Staff judgment puts greater emphasis on the first two
estimates, in view of the uncertainty surrounding the REER level and ES approaches. Compared to the CA and
REER index analysis, the model fit of the REER level approach is substantially poorer for Norway. In addition, the ES
estimate of optimal current account level—estimated using the precautionary savings framework described in Bems
and de Carvalho Filho (2009)1 and applied for countries that are exporters of exhaustible resources—is subject to
considerable uncertainty coming from model and parameter assumptions, including those about the quantity and
price path of exhaustible resources. Thus, in both cases, staff considers the uncertainty too large for the REER gaps
estimated from these approaches to reflect the actual degree of misalignment.
While the CPI-based REER may be moderately undervalued, the ULC-based REER measure has been pointing
to worsening long-term cost competitiveness. Norway’s ULC-based REER has appreciated by over 50 percent
during the past two decades—although this has reversed somewhat due to the recent depreciation, and ULC
growth has been among the highest in the OECD. Much of this phenomenon is confined to the mining and utilities
industry (which includes oil and gas extraction as well as services activities incidental to oil and gas), where not only
strong wage growth but also declining productivity contribute to the rapid increase in unit labor cost. However,
despite the fiscal rule’s help in insulating the mainland’s non-oil sector from Dutch disease effects, productivity
growth in non-oil tradable sectors (e.g., manufacturing) has slowed and export shares have been on the decline.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the
view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is
meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent
or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.
Non mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex II. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF
Recommendations
Fund Policy Advice from 2014 Consultation
Macroprudential Policy:
Directors agreed that tighter capital standards
and loan-to-value limits on mortgages should
be maintained given the vulnerabilities
stemming from high house prices and
household debt and banks’ reliance on
wholesale funding, even if the housing market
softens further.

Authorities’ Actions
In addition to early implementation of the CRD
IV, more recently, risk weights for residential
mortgages used in banks’ IRB models have
been tightened. A countercyclical capital buffer
of 1 percent became effective from July 1,
2015, and will be increased to 1½ percent from
July 1, 2016. The current FSA guidelines on
residential mortgage lending were recently
converted to a regulation, which also take
effect on July 1, 2015.

Fiscal Policy:
While acknowledging the availability of
resources for additional investments, most
Directors saw merit in a more neutral fiscal
policy stance as long as the economy remains
near capacity.

The 2014 fiscal outturn implied a positive fiscal
impulse of 0.7 percent of GDP, and the 2015
budget also entails a positive fiscal impulse of
about 0.6 percent of GDP. However, in light of
the expected economic slowdown in 2015 this
is viewed by staff as broadly appropriate.

Structural Reforms:
Directors emphasized the importance of
further structural reforms to improve
productivity and competitiveness, and to
promote the non-oil economy. Priorities
include further reforms of the labor market,
pensions and public services, greater wage
differentiation across sectors, and reducing
protection and subsidies in agriculture.
Directors also recommended increased use of
cost-benefit analysis in the selection of
infrastructure projects, and a simpler income
tax system with fewer incentives for promoting
housing to encourage productive investment.

The authorities recently replaced disability
pensions with disability benefits to create
incentives to work while receiving disability
benefits. The Productivity Commission is
expected to present its final report in early
2016, with focus on improving the use of
manpower resources, among other reforms.

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The 2015 budget reduced the valuation
discount for commercial property and second
dwellings from 40 to 30 percent of market
value. The Tax Commission report
recommended measures to further reduce
preferential tax treatment for housing.

Annex III. Real Sector Links Between the Offshore and
Mainland Economies1
There are multiple real-sector linkages between the oil and gas sector and the real economy
on the mainland and abroad. The value of the income flows through these linkages is considerably
larger than the fiscal transfer from the GPFG to the budget, but they are more complicated and
harder to measure. Available data tend to capture either a subset of the various flows, also include
flows unrelated to oil and gas, or both.
Total expenditure by the oil and gas sector on goods and service is large. 2014 wages,
intermediate consumption (non wage, non-investment inputs), and investment were equal to 1.7,
2.6, and 8.7 percent of mainland GDP respectively for a total of 13 percent—a substantial increase
from 8.3 percent a decade earlier. However, the oil

supply and service from the offshore sector to the
mainland of about 8.5 percent of GDP in 2014. However, there is large uncertainty around this
estimate. Exports of oil-related goods and services probably something on the order of another 4
percent on some estimates.
Measuring mainland income from the offshore sector from the mainland supply side is even
more challenging. Goods and services supplied to the oil and gas industry do not map neatly into
standard industrial classification schemes. Instead, firms within individual industries have evolved to
produce goods and services for the offshore sector while remaining in the same industrial
classification as other firms that produce goods and services for other sectors. To get around this
problem, researchers at Statistics Norway used an input-output model approach to estimate not
only the initial gross revenues, but also the net impact on the Norwegian economy, taking into
account imported content and value added from other sectors indirectly. Results show that a wide
range of Norwegian industries have links to oil and gas, ranging from ship building and engineering,
manufacturing, to a variety of services industries (e.g., banking and insurance, IT services, retail). In
terms of employment, it is estimated that in 2014, about 240,000 workers—or 9 percent of the labor
force—may be directly or indirectly linked to oil and gas activity. As with GDP, exports of oil-related
goods and services would add to this figure.

Annex IV. Regulation on Mortgage Lending
On June 15, 2015, the Ministry of Finance adopted a regulation on requirements for residential
mortgage loans, based on current guidelines from the FSA. The regulation takes effect from
July 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016 (with possibility of extension), and has the following features:


The loan-to-value ratio on residential mortgage loans is capped at 85 percent.



Lenders should adopt a mortgage rate increase of 5 percentage points when stress testing a
borrower’s debt servicing capacity.



Lenders are required to demand repayments for residential mortgage loans with a loan-to-value
ratio above 70 percent.

The regulation allows for 10 percent of the volume of a lender’s approved loans per quarter to be
loans that do not meet the regulatory requirements above for debt-servicing capacity, loan-to-value
ratio or repayments.
The regulation will continuously be evaluated taking into account regional developments in the
housing market, household borrowing, and the impact on competition between lenders.

Annex V. Recommendations by Fiscal Rule Commission
On June 18, 2015, an expert commission tasked with how to apply the fiscal rule for use of oil
revenues delivered its report to the Minister of Finance. The commission was appointed on
October 17, 2014 with the mandate to consider supplementary provisions for the current fiscal
framework, taking into account the large year-to-year fluctuations in GPFG value, the interests of
future generations, and the various challenges facing the Norwegian economy in the short and long
term.
The commission makes three main recommendations:


When deviations from the 4 percent path are large, the government should plot an explicit
course to gradually return to the path. This will give fiscal policy an operational target in the
short and medium term. This is well in line with staff advice from the past.



The course should be based on a more gradual phasing in of oil revenues. A more gradual
increase in spending is better suited to uncertainty regarding GPFG future real return and
outlook for the economy, population aging, and declining offshore activity.



Additional rules can provide useful guidance when setting such a course. In particular, two
considered rules include (i) limited Fund withdrawal and (ii) gradual phasing-in. These rules allow
an extension of the period where the spending of oil revenues gradually increase (as a share of
GDP), and set a limit on the fiscal impulse to 0.1-0.2 percent of mainland GDP. They are not
designed, however, to replace discretion in setting fiscal policy, which must give consideration to
the business cycle, among other factors.

The Ministry of Finance will shortly issue a public consultation on the commission’s report.

Annex VI. The Impact of House Price Correction on
Consumption1
A Vector Auto-Regression (VAR) framework is used to assess the average impact of a house
price shock. Following Igan and Loungani (2012)2, the model includes four variables: GDP/private
consumption/residential investment, CPI, short-term interest rate, and house prices, and uses a
Cholesky identification scheme in which variable ordering is as listed. The model is estimated using
quarterly data for all four Nordic countries over 1986Q1–2014Q4.
Estimation results suggest that for Norway, a 10 percent decline in real house prices would
lead household consumption to fall by almost one percent on impact. The effect is relatively
short-lived, reaching cumulative 1½ percent after two quarters before rebounding. The impact on
residential investment is estimated to be larger, lasting about a year with a cumulative decline of 17
percent. Thus, if the past is any indication of the future, the aggregate consumption impact of a
potential house price turnaround in Norway would not be overly severe, perhaps due to the
availability of other household assets that can be drawn to avoid a drastic cutback in household
consumption. Nevertheless, the effect could be large for younger families with more debt and fewer
assets, which is not captured in this aggregate analysis. In addition, a house price shock now may
have larger real impact than in the past, especially given the high household debt burden.

The estimated macroeconomic impact of a house price correction appears milder for Norway
compared to Nordic peers. For example, in response to a 10 percent drop in house prices, the
maximum decline in private consumption in a given quarter is estimated at 0.9 percent in Norway,
compared to 2.1 percent in Sweden and 3.5 percent in Denmark. The cross-country heterogeneity in
responses is even more pronounced in the case of residential investment. Previous literature

suggests that mortgage market characteristics defining the ease of access to credit (e.g., typical
loan-to-value ratio, availability of mortgage equity withdrawal to finance consumption, prevalence
of variable vs. fixed rate mortgages) could be among factors explaining why economic activity in
some countries may be more vulnerable to declining house prices than in others.

Annex VII. FSAP Recommendations
Macroprudential policy: Take additional measures to contain systemic risks from the growth of
house prices and household indebtedness, including stricter LTV and amortization guidelines; take
additional measures to contain risks related to bank’s wholesale funding; improve the existing
institutional structure for macroprudential policies, including a transparent “comply or explain”
approach by decision-makers; and greater delegation of decision-making powers over
macroprudential instruments in due course to Norges Bank or the FSA.
Bank stress tests: Consider options to discourage cross-ownership of covered bonds; improve data
on cross-border ownership of bank-issued unsecured and covered bonds, and resume regular
monitoring of bank-to-bank direct and indirect exposures. Consider regional stress test exercises.
Consider further steps in liquidity monitoring, such as performing liquidity stress tests using the
structure of cash flows at various maturities.
Insurance stress tests: Continue to enhance the stress test framework for the insurance sector;
allocate more resources to the FSA to assess the liability side risks and validate models and
assumptions used in the bottom-up stress tests by insurance companies; achieve recapitalization of
weakly capitalized insurance companies in the current benign environment.
Micro-supervision: Enhance de jure operational independence, powers in particular regard to
corrective actions and sanctions, and supervisory resources of the FSA; strengthen the FSA’s
supervisory attention over small banks through conducting comprehensive assessment of them
more frequently; upgrade substantially the FSA’s supervisory approach towards the AML/CFT issues,
including by increasing the supervisory activities and providing guidance on the topic.
Financial market infrastructure (FMI): Strengthen operational risk management related to
outsourcing in systemically important payment systems.
Crisis management and bank resolution: Initiate resolution planning for the largest banks,
including assessing impediments to resolvability, and make explicit delegations to FSA regarding its
role; define expectations for the Norway-specific elements of recovery and resolution plans of
foreign bank subsidiaries and branches; enhance legal framework for resolution to comply with the
FSB Key Attributes with regard to certain areas including the resolution toolkit; the BGF should
adopt policies specifying under what conditions board members must recluse themselves,
considering actual and prospective conflicts of interest.

Statement by Mr. Groenn, Executive Director of Norway
September 4, 2015

On behalf of my Norwegian authorities, I would like to thank staff for well-written
reports on the Norwegian economy and the financial system. My authorities thank staff
for their engagement and are in general agreement with the analyses and policy
recommendations.
The analysis of current economic conditions and the forecasts in the staff report are
broadly in line with those of my authorities. The decline in the oil price has given a
significant slow-down in mainland sectors delivering to the petroleum sector, but so far
the impact on total activity and employment in the non-oil economy has been limited.
However, the economy faces important challenges and the outlook is subject to some key
risks.
My authorities are pleased to note the conclusion in the FSAP update that the Norwegian
financial system has coped well with the global financial crisis, while also
acknowledging that the prolonged period of low interest rates and high oil prices have
fueled credit and asset price growth leading to higher vulnerabilities.
Economic Developments and Main Challenges
The Norwegian non-oil economy grew on trend at around 2¼ percent both last year and
the year before. This year, growth is expected to weaken to around 1¼ percent, while
picking up again next year to just below trend growth. According to the Labor Force
survey, the unemployment rate stayed low in 2014 at 3½ percent, but has increased lately
to 4½ percent. The registered unemployment rate has remained more stable, currently just
below 3 percent of the labor force. This difference is partly due to an increased number of
young people searching for part-time employment beside studies and school.
Economic policy is supporting economic growth. Interest rates are at a historically low
level and fiscal policy is slightly expansionary. In addition, a weaker Norwegian krone
(12 percent depreciation over the last 12 months) and moderate wage settlements this
year have offset some of the deterioration in unit labor costs competitiveness over recent
years.
Norway experienced large terms of trade gains during the first 10-15 years of this
millennium. This fortunate development has turned. Currently, the oil price (Brent Blend)
is fluctuating around USD 50 per barrel, down from around 65 during the staff mission in
May and 110 a year ago. Norway’s revenues have fallen accordingly, although a stronger
dollar dampens the revenue fall in Norwegian kroner. Most of the decline is reflected in
lower public savings in the Government Pension Fund Global, and revenues of oil
companies have fallen as well. Oil companies and their suppliers have cut back on
investments and employment, curbing growth in the Norwegian mainland economy.
Already before the sharp fall in oil prices in 2014, petroleum investments were expected
to peak in the near future, and demand impulses from the petroleum sector to the
mainland economy were expected to decrease. The drop in the oil price accelerates and

reinforces this development and makes it even more important to succeed in managing a
smooth transition to a less oil-dependent growth model. According to my authorities’
most recent forecast, oil investments will fall this year and next year and the demand
from the petroleum sector will fall relative to the size of the mainland economy. The
decline in the coming 3-4 years is dampened somewhat by large investments in a new
field, Johan Sverdrup, the third largest field on the Norwegian continental shelf. Even so,
an important growth engine for the Norwegian economy has lost its momentum. Thus,
Norwegian businesses must adapt to the new situation in order to maintain growth. The
weaker Norwegian krone and a more moderate wage growth help, but the cost level is
still high compared to trading partners and productivity growth is still subdued.
High house prices and a high debt level among households represent other key challenges
to the economy. As recognized below, these pose a risk to financial stability. As pointed
out in the staff report, household debt continues to stay elevated at more than 200 percent
of disposable income. The debt burden is unevenly distributed, and young households are
vulnerable to adverse shocks. There is a risk that a fall in house prices can amplify or
trigger a downturn in the Norwegian economy.
Monetary policy
My authorities generally concur with staff’s assessment of monetary policy, which finds
the current monetary policy stance appropriately supportive. The key policy rate was
lowered by 25 basis points to 1 percent in June, a historically low level, and the Norges
Bank Executive Board’s assessment suggested that the key policy rate could be reduced
further in the course of the fall. Both the objective of keeping inflation close to target and
the aim of sustaining capacity utilization could imply a lower key policy rate. However,
the Bank’s Executive Board also pointed out that a lower interest rate could fuel house
price inflation and debt growth. Norway has a floating exchange rate. Due to lower oil
prices, a more uncertain growth outlook and a lower interest rate differential, the
Norwegian currency has depreciated considerably since the beginning of last year.
Fiscal policy
A continued low oil price will over time have a significant impact on Norway’s national
wealth and the room for maneuver in fiscal policy. Still, as noted in the report, the short
term impact on fiscal policy is limited. The Norwegian fiscal framework is designed to
insulate fiscal policy and the economy from the inherent volatility in petroleum prices. In
recent years, the Government Pension Fund Global has grown considerably, and
spending of oil money in line with the 4 percent path of the fiscal rule would not have
been consistent with a stable development in the economy. Spending in 2015 is estimated
at 2.6 percent of the Fund, i.e. well below the 4 percent path.
The staff’s report advices a more neutral fiscal policy in the medium term. Given the
abating non-oil economic activity, the rise in unemployment and the uncertain outlook
for 2016, the current circumstances might not be the right ones to make this move. A
continuation of a slightly expansionary fiscal policy, as in the last few years, may be
better adapted to the current economic situation. However, my authorities acknowledge
that fiscal policy cannot be the main tool to deal with a structural decline in the demand
from the Norwegian petroleum sector. A too expansionary fiscal policy could interrupt
and counteract the needed transition.

The upward tendency in unemployment, especially among young people, is of special
concern, and the Norwegian government has signaled new measures against this increase
that will be presented as part of the fiscal budget in early October. The Norwegian
government will also follow up on plans for increased spending on infrastructure,
education, and research. Such measures may facilitate necessary structural adjustments,
and support activity in the short term.
As noted in the staff report, the government last year appointed a Commission to consider
the application of the fiscal rule and to recommend modifications or supplementary
provisions. The Commission’s majority is of the view that phasing-in of petroleum
revenues has to be slower in the future than in the past, with a recommended fiscal
impulse of 0.1-0.2 per cent of non-oil GDP in a normal cyclical situation, compared to an
average of 0.33 in the years after the fiscal rule was introduced in 2001. The
Commission’s report was submitted for public consultation in July, and the government
will present its views on this issue to the Parliament next year.
Tax policy and structural reforms
My authorities place great emphasis on the growth-enhancing potential of structural
policy measures, and have since they came into position introduced several measures in
this regard. An important goal is to strengthen productivity and growth in both the private
and the public sector. A main strategy to achieve this is giving higher priority to lower
taxes, education, and investments in infrastructure.
In tax policy, focus has been on lowering taxes that hamper productivity and economic
growth. The relatively high corporate tax rate is an area of particular concern. As noted in
the staff report, a Tax Commission has recommended a significant reduction in this rate.
Its proposals also include adjustments in taxation of personal income and some balancing
measures. My authorities are currently in the process of evaluating the commission’s
report, and will summarize their plans for future tax reform in a white paper to the
Parliament this fall. In the forthcoming years my Government will continue to reduce
taxes.
As noted in the staff report, steps have been taken toward a more neutral taxation of
assets by reducing the valuation discount in the net wealth tax for commercial properties
and second dwellings. A significant reduction in tax incentives for home ownership is
however not on the government’s agenda.
As regards the labor market, the government has started technical discussions with the
social partners in order to explore the possibility of a comprehensive reform of
occupational pensions in the public sector next spring. It has also taken steps to soften
labor market regulations. Norwegian legislation on temporary contracts is today among
the strictest in the OECD area, but will be liberalized from 2016. Regulations on working
hours will be modified in order to make it easier for businesses to use overtime and
compressed work-week schedules.
Last year the government appointed a Productivity Commission. This Commission was
given a mandate to look into causes for the slowdown in productivity growth in Norway,
and to analyze the development in an international perspective. It was also asked to give

advice on where in the economy the government should implement measures, or adjust
policy, to increase productivity.
The Productivity Commission published its first report in February this year. It concluded
that although the Norwegian productivity level is high in an international perspective,
Norway performs only on average among OECD countries in the comparison of several
key factors for growth, including areas such as innovation, entrepreneurship and the level
of research in industries. The Commission points out that when the growth impulse from
the petroleum industry diminishes in the future, the Norwegian economy must improve
its performance in these areas to maintain a high income level.
The Government is in the process of assessing the advice from this first report. A second
report will be presented February 2016, and an overview of the government’s structural
policy is planned to be included the budget documents for 2016.
A productivity reform is implemented at the central government level, obliging all public
service providers to increase productivity by 0.5 percentage point per year.
A local government reform for simplification of the government system and
establishment of fewer and larger municipalities, which will then have enhanced
governance capacity and capability, will also be important for productivity in both the
private and the public sector.
Also, measures to increase efficiency in the agricultural sector, and to reduce costs and
shorten the planning process in the construction sector, have been introduced. To get
more out of the resources used in the transport sector, the government has taken steps to
establish a publicly owned company that will plan, build, operate, and maintain major
stretches of the road network.
Financial sector policy – Addressing stability risks
My Norwegian authorities are pleased to note the conclusion of staff’s assessment that
the Norwegian financial system is generally sound and well managed. My authorities
greatly appreciate receiving external views of this scope and detail on the Norwegian
financial system. The authorities broadly agree with the analyses in the FSSA, and will
carefully study the policy recommendations.
My authorities generally concur with staff’s assessment of the risks and vulnerabilities
associated with Norwegian households’ indebtedness, a possible house price reversal and
banks’ reliance on wholesale funding. Household debt is growing faster than household
incomes, and households will be vulnerable in the event of an income decline and higher
interest rates. Staff notes that the new requirements on banks’ residential mortgage
lending practices is a policy move in the right direction in the current context, and
recommends additional measures to contain systemic risks from the growth of house
prices and household indebtedness, including stricter LTV and LTI or debt ratio limits to
supplement the required affordability test. My authorities note that the new regulation
will be continuously evaluated in light of future developments. They are prepared to
make appropriate adjustments in the regulation as informed by the evaluation, including
imposing stricter limits and other requirements.
Norwegian banks must continue their efforts to strengthen their capital base, and assure
more robust funding and improved liquidity. Loan losses are still low, but banks should

be prepared for the possibility of increased losses in the next few years. My authorities
have addressed financial stability risks, i.a. through early implementation of new capital
requirements for banks (the CRD IV package), Pillar 2 add-ons and higher IRB risk
weights for residential mortgage lending for both domestic and foreign banks through
host country treatment. The Ministry of Finance announced in June this year that the
counter-cyclical buffer will be increased from today’s 1 percent to 1½ percent on June
30, 2016. Staff notes that authorities should continue to restrict dividend pay-outs in
weakly capitalized insurance undertakings and achieve recapitalization of these
undertakings. My authorities note that a new more risk-based solvency framework for
insurers (Solvency II) will enter into force in 2016 and require more capital in lifeinsurance undertakings. The solvency situation in insurance undertakings is monitored
closely.
Staff recommends improved liquidity monitoring and consideration of measures to
contain risks related to banks’ wholesale funding. My authorities note that the micro- and
macroprudential supervision of liquidity risks in Norwegian banks has improved
significantly since the international financial crisis, and that there are continuous efforts
to improve the systems and procedures in place to supervise and monitor such risks,
including through increased cooperation between the FSA and Norges Bank. Proposals
on the implementation of binding LCR requirements are currently under consideration,
and the authorities foresee to introduce such requirements next year.
Staff recommends that Norwegian authorities could improve institutional arrangements
for macroprudential policies, including introducing a transparent “comply or explain”
approach and greater delegation of decision-making powers over macroprudential
instruments in due course to Norges Bank or the FSA. The existing institutional structure
for macroprudential policies in Norway builds on a long tradition and clear division of
responsibilities, which has proven to deliver timely micro- and macroprudential
measures, with no signs of inaction bias. My authorities, however, take due note of staff’s
advice regarding possible reforms to further improve institutional arrangements for
macroprudential policies.
On the Norwegian crisis management and bank resolution arrangements, staff concludes
that they are generally well developed, but that more work is needed. My authorities note
that work is underway to revise our legal framework, and that this will encompass the
issues raised by staff. The revision includes, but is not limited to, an implementation of
the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive.
Staff concludes that Norway should ensure de jure operational independence of the FSA,
strengthen the FSA’s supervision of small banks through the conduct of more frequent
comprehensive assessments, and upgrade its approach to AML/CFT supervision. My
authorities note that a more intensive off-site monitoring of small banks has been
established, and that Norway’s AML/CTF regulation is under revision. Finally, on staff’s
conclusion on the operational independence of the FSA, my authorities note that the FSA
has operational independence in supervision. The issue of delegating further authority to
the FSA is subject to continuous assessment.
