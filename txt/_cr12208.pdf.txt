STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 10, 2012

KEY ISSUES
The Japanese economy is experiencing a domestic-led recovery, but the balance of
risks to the outlook is to the downside. Despite the cooling of the external
environment, growth is expected to reach almost 2½ percent in 2012 underpinned by
reconstruction spending and a pickup in private consumption. However, risks to the
outlook have shifted to the downside because of concerns about the turmoil in Europe
and the possibility of a sharper-than-expected slowdown in China.
Addressing the longer-term challenges posed by Japan’s very high public debt,
rapidly aging population, low growth, and deflation will require a broad set of
reforms. Key elements of a comprehensive policy package include:
 Securing fiscal consolidation. A fiscal adjustment of 10 percent of GDP over the next
decade is necessary to put the public-debt to GDP ratio firmly on a downward path. The
authorities’ planned increase in the consumption tax is a crucial step and would
demonstrate a commitment to fiscal reform. The planned increase, however, goes only
part of the way towards achieving this goal, and further consolidation is needed.
Consolidation should be designed to mitigate the near-term impact on growth, and
improve incentives to work and invest.
 Raising potential growth. Higher growth is essential to create more jobs, help reduce
public debt and improve resilience to shocks. Far-reaching reforms could raise activity by
removing barriers to employment of female and old-aged workers; boosting immigration;
deregulating the agriculture, electricity, and service sectors; and increasing the availability
of risk capital.
 Exiting deflation. Further easing of monetary policy would accelerate achievement of
the Bank of Japan’s new inflation goal of 1 percent. Enhanced communication of the
policy stance and framework would help achieve the goal. Monetary policy also needs the
support of structural reforms to boost confidence and raise domestic demand.
 Maintaining financial sector stability. While the Financial System Stability
Assessment (FSSA) finds that important steps have been taken to strengthen the financial
system since the 2003 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) assessment, it
recommends enhancing the monitoring of systemic risks, including from financial
institutions’ exposure to Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) and equities. The authorities
could strengthen their prudential framework, including by tightening banks’ large
exposure lending limits, raising capital requirements for domestic-oriented banks,
strengthening the solvency assessment for insurers, and improving the resolution
framework for nonbank financial institutions.

2012 ARTICLE IV STAFF REPORT

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
1.
The Japanese economy has shown
remarkable resilience and adaptability in
the aftermath of the March 2011 Great East
Japan earthquake. In addition to the
devastating human toll and destruction,
businesses and households had to grapple
with disruptions to supply-chains and a
reduction in electricity supply. All 54 nuclear
power plants—that supply about ¼ of Japan’s
electric power—were shut down for safety
inspection since the disaster. One plant has
recently been reopened and another is set to
reopen in coming weeks. Severe floods in
Thailand in late 2011 further weighed on the
recovery and affected Japan’s export sector
through supply linkages.
2.
Decisive action helped limit the
economic effects of these shocks. A
comprehensive reconstruction package was
approved by government, supply chains were

repaired within a few months, and impressive
efforts to conserve electricity limited the
disruption from the closure of nuclear power
plants.
3.
Beyond the short-term need to sustain
the recovery, Japan faces a number of
serious and interrelated longer term
challenges. Reducing the public debt burden
is a top priority, but this task is complicated by
low growth, persistent deflation, and a rapidly
aging population. The government’s plan to
raise the consumption tax is a crucial step
towards fiscal sustainability, but further
consolidation will be needed, accompanied by
structural measures to raise growth and
greater efforts to defeat deflation. This year’s
Article IV consultation focused on how to
address these challenges by undertaking a
comprehensive effort to take advantage of
synergies among policies.

RECOVERING FROM RECENT SHOCKS
A. Recent Developments
4.
Growth accelerated sharply in early
2012, helped primarily by domestic factors.
After contracting by ¾ percent in 2011
because of the earthquake and Thai floods,
real GDP grew at a brisk pace of 4¾ percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter of this year (text
figure, Figure 1, Table 1). Growth was boosted
by reconstruction spending, a pickup in
consumer spending (helped by government
subsidies
for
environmentally
friendly
automobiles) and inventory rebuilding after the
disruptions to the supply chain last year.
Private investment, however, declined in early
2012, following two quarters of recovery, with
business sentiment affected by rising
uncertainty over the global outlook, particularly
in the export-oriented manufacturing sector.
5.
Core inflation, excluding food and
energy, remained negative. At -0.6 percent in
May (y/y) core inflation was near the highest
level seen since the depth of the global
financial crisis in early 2009. Headline inflation
has moved into positive territory, reaching

0.2 percent in May (y/y), partly as a result of
higher fresh food prices.

Job growth remained sluggish.
Employment grew by about 1/3 percent in the
year to April 2012, but employment was still
about 3 percent below 2007 levels. The
unemployment
rate
fluctuated
around
4½ percent over the past year, but the
improvement in the ratio of job openings to
applications suggests that employment may
pick up gradually in the near term. Real
employee compensation remained relatively
flat over the past year.

7.
The trade balance moved into deficit
in 2011. Exports were disrupted because of
the earthquake, Thai floods, weak global
demand, and an appreciation of the yen (text
figure, Tables 2 and 3). At the same time,
imports continued to rise, driven by
reconstruction spending and higher energy
costs partly as a result of the closure of the
nuclear power plants. As a result, the deficit
widened to about 1 percent of GDP in the
fourth quarter of 2011, and Japan recorded its
first annual trade deficit since 1980. The trade
deficit remained at around 1 percent of GDP in
early 2012. The current account, however, was
still in surplus—at 1½-2 percent of GDP in
2011 and early 2012—thanks to a stable
income stream from large net foreign assets.

8.
The recent turmoil in Europe has led
to a flight to safety and impacted Japanese
financial markets. Since mid-2011, equity
prices have declined by about 10 percent and
yields on 10-year JGBs have fallen to near
historic lows of 80-85 basis points (Figure 2).
Over the same period, the yen has appreciated
by about 6 percent in nominal effective terms,
and appears moderately overvalued (see
section G).

higher energy costs from the shift to thermal
electricity generation and conservation efforts
over the summer are projected to detract
about ¼ percentage point from growth. The
recovery is forecast to slow in 2013 to 1½
percent, as reconstruction winds down. Over
the medium-term, growth is expected to
converge to staff’s estimated potential rate of
1 percent (Table 4).
10.
Inflation is forecast to remain near
zero over the next two years. The still wide
output gap (about 3 percent of GDP in early
2012) is expected to narrow only gradually and
not close until 2015/16. As a result, core
inflation (excluding food and energy prices) is
projected to rise slowly and turn slightly
positive by mid-2013. The projected decline in
commodity prices will likely keep headline
inflation near zero over the same period. Staff
forecast inflation to rise gradually over the
medium-term and reach 1 percent by 2017.
11.
Risks to the outlook have shifted
decidedly to the downside (Appendix 1). An
escalation of the European turmoil or a
sharper-than-expected slowing of the Chinese
economy would hurt Japanese exports and
growth. 1 Moreover, an intensification of the
flight to safety in financial markets could
further appreciate the yen, worsen the trade
balance, and depress equity prices and
business and consumer confidence. With the
closure of almost all nuclear power plants, an
unusually hot summer could disrupt economic

B. Outlook and Risks
9.
Growth in 2012 is likely to be driven
by reconstruction. Real GDP is expected to
expand by almost 2½ percent in 2012
supported by public reconstruction spending
of around 1½ percent of GDP and robust
consumer demand. Weak external demand,
especially in Europe, will weigh on the recovery
of exports and private investment. Moreover,

activity (Box 1). This risk would be mitigated,
however, by conservation efforts already being
taken. On the upside, a stronger-thanexpected recovery in Japanese consumer and
business sentiment would lift domestic
demand.
12.
Over the medium-term, the key
downside risks are the possibility of a
prolonged global economic downturn and
limited progress on structural reforms in
Japan. If these risks materialize, Japan could
continue to suffer from low growth and
deflation, a toxic mix that would worsen public
debt dynamics substantially. The debt
sustainability analysis (Appendix II) suggests
that severe shocks to growth, inflation and real
interest rates, coupled with limited fiscal
adjustment, could see public net debt rise to
over 300 percent of GDP by 2030.

The Authorities’ Views
13.
The authorities broadly agreed with
staff’s assessment, and expressed particular
concern about the possibility of a further
rise of the yen. While they considered that
the direct effects of a slowdown in Europe
would be manageable, they were more
worried about the knock-on effects to China. If
this was combined with a further appreciation
of the yen, it would hurt the profitability of

Box 1. What is the Outlook for Electricity Supply?1
Electricity supply problems appear to have
lessened. As a result of the the nuclear disaster last year,
all 54 reactors—accounting for one-quarter of total
electricity supply—were shut down for safety
inspections. Despite the lower supply capacity, electricity
problems this year are expected to be less severe than
last summer. This is because the economically important
Kanto region around Tokyo (accounting for 40 percent
of Japan’s GDP), has sufficient capacity to meet demand
due to an expansion of thermal power power plants, an
increase in tariffs, and continued conservation efforts.

restrictions on businesses, encouraged transfers from
surplus regions, and enhanced conservation efforts. The
recent re-opening of one nuclear reactor and the
planned reopening of another plant in coming weeks
will help fill much of the possible shortfall in Kansai.
Staff estimates real GDP growth in 2012 could be ¼
percentage point slower as a result of the energy
problems. Lower consumption and productivity,
combined with higher energy costs from the switch to
thermal electricity generation, could suppress activity.
Moreover, investment in energy-intensive sectors could
decline as production costs rise. Higher fuel imports will
also weigh on the trade balance and increase Japan’s
vulnerability to world energy price shocks (text figure).

The BoJ expects a stronger pick-up
of inflation than staff. While the BoJ’s and
staff’s growth projections are similar, their
estimate of the output gap in early 2012 is
smaller and they expect greater upward price
pressure than staff as the output gap closes in

Over the longer horizon, developing alternative
energy sources would help reduce vulnerabilities.
The government will publish a new energy plan over the
summer, which could include some deregulation of the
electricity sector to encourage more regional trading of
supply to address shortages. Moreover, targeted
subsidies and an increase in the carbon tax could give
corporates an incentive to conserve energy and increase
production of alternative energies.

coming years. 2 Also, the BoJ assumes that
commodity prices are likely to rise moderately
because of increased demand for food and
energy in relatively fast-growing emerging
economies. Therefore, the BOJ expects it will
likely be not too long before inflation reaches
1 percent under current policy settings.
2

The difference in the output gap estimates in early 2012
reflects staff’s higher potential growth (almost 1½ percent
per annum) prior to the crisis compared with the BoJ’s
estimate of about 1 percent. Staff analysis suggests that
narrowing the negative output gap by 1 percentage point of
GDP would raise the inflation rate by almost ¼ percent. The
authorities indicated that they estimate the effect to be
higher, but did not provide a precise figure.

C. Regaining Fiscal Sustainability

(Central government basis, in percent of GDP)

15.
Japan’s fiscal problems are deep
rooted. Net public debt has increased nearly
ten-fold over the last two decades to more
than 125 percent of GDP. As a result of
population aging, social security spending has
risen rapidly, while persistently weak growth
and deflation have depressed tax revenues
(text figure, Figure 3). Growth in other
spending has been relatively slow, with capital
spending having fallen substantially.

16.
Fiscal vulnerabilities are substantial.
Japan’s net public debt is higher than in
almost all other advanced countries, and unlike
in many other advanced countries is projected
to rise further. Even a relatively small increase
in the sovereign risk premium would make
fiscal consolidation more difficult, pose
challenges to financial institutions, harm
growth prospects in Japan, and could spill over
to global risk premia and growth (Box 2). In
this regard, Europe’s recent experience offers a
cautionary tale. Once market confidence is lost,
regaining it becomes very difficult. At the same
time, a large adjustment without growth is
extremely difficult to implement given
economic
and
political
constraints,
highlighting the need for forceful structural
reforms.

17.
Japan’s fiscal deficit is set to
increase in 2012, which staff considered
appropriate to support reconstruction and
the broader recovery. Capital and current
reconstruction
spending
equivalent
to
1½ percent of GDP in 2012 (as part of a multiyear reconstruction package of 4 percent of
GDP) will widen the fiscal deficit to about
10 percent of GDP in 2012, while the structural
primary deficit will rise slightly to 7½ percent
of GDP (text figure, Table 5).
18.
Staff welcomed the authorities’
intention to raise the consumption tax as
part of its consolidation plan. The Lower
House of the Diet has approved a tax bill that
would increase the consumption tax to 8
percent in April 2014 and 10 percent in
October 2015. The Upper House is now
considering the bill. Passage of the tax
legislation is crucial to demonstrate a
commitment to fiscal reform and sustain
investor confidence. Staff estimate that the
authorities’

consolidation
plan,
including the increase in the consumption tax,
withdrawal of the financial crisis stimulus, and
curbs to non-social security spending would
achieve a 5 percent of GDP adjustment and
reduce the primary deficit to 2½ percent of
GDP by 2020.

Box 2. Risks from a Sharp Increase in Government Bond Yields1
Despite the rise in public debt, JGB yields have
remained low and stable. The low yields are
attributable to an increase in risk aversion following the
global financial crisis and deflation. Ownership of JGBs is
dominated by domestic investors, who hold more than
90 percent of the outstanding stock and, in recent years,
have preferred to hold assets that are perceived as lowrisk, such as JGBs and bank deposits. Banks have, in turn,
held a growing share of their assets in JGBs, given
limited demand for credit. While these factors are
expected to persist for some time, the market’s
willingness and capacity to absorb new government
debt will diminish as population aging reduces saving
and the corporate sector’s risk appetite improves (see
WP/11/292). Without significant policy adjustment,
outstanding gross general government debt could reach
250 percent of GDP over the medium term. The stock
would likely exceed household savings in 5-10 years,
suggesting a need to turn more to the corporate sector
and foreign investors.
Even a moderate rise in yields would leave the fiscal
position extremely vulnerable. If JGB yields rose by
100 bps over the next 5 years, the long-term net public
debt-to-GDP ratio would remain high at 150 percent of
GDP, even after a 10 percentage points of GDP
adjustment in the structural fiscal balance. Failure to
implement a credible fiscal consolidation plan could
lead to sovereign downgrades and trigger similar
actions for financial institutions, which could eventually
erode confidence in the JGB market (text table).

Staff noted, however, that more
needs to be done to reduce debt. In the
absence of further adjustment, beyond the
authorities’ current plan, the public debt-toGDP ratio would continue to rise. The
authorities’ fiscal strategy recognizes the need
for further adjustment but no concrete policy
proposals, beyond current plans, have been
put forward as yet. Staff advised an additional
5 percent of GDP adjustment to achieve an
overall fiscal consolidation of 10 percent of
GDP over the next decade. This would achieve

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The IMF’s recent FSSA points out that growing risks
to fiscal sustainability have heightened concerns
about possible feedback to financial stability. The
JGB holdings of banks have risen substantially and
more than doubled since the global financial crisis (text
figure). Should a sharp rise of government bond yields
coincide with a broader growth shock (e.g., a global
downturn), financial stability might be challenged. In
such a scenario, asset prices would fall further and
borrowing costs rise, leading to a deterioration of
credit quality and a worse outcome for growth.

A sustained rise of government bond yields could
lower global output through a spillover to global
risk premia. Spillover analysis (see separate
background paper for the Spillover Report) shows that
a sharp rise in government bond yields could reduce
Japan’s output by 6-10 percent after 10 years, relative
to the baseline, depending on the extent of contagion
to global risk premia. The impact on global output
would be modest if the rise in Japanese government
bond yields was contained in Japan. However, if global
risk premia rose more substantially, in line with
estimates based on historical correlations, output could
fall by up to 1 percent in the United States and about
2-3 percent in Emerging Asia and the Euro area.

a primary surplus of about 3 percent of GDP by
the early 2020s and put the public-debt-toGDP ratio on a clear downward path. Staff
recommended that about half the adjustment
come from additional expenditure restraint of
2½ percent of GDP over the next decade, by
curbing growth in nominal spending. In
addition, adopting a clear timeframe for
further revenue increases beyond 2015 to
achieve the remaining adjustment would
bolster confidence in public finances.

Careful design of consolidation
measures could reduce the negative impact
on growth. Building on the proposed
consumption tax increase, staff advised a
broad range of reforms to contain social
security spending and improve incentives to
work and invest. While the design of an
appropriate fiscal package would need to take
a pragmatic approach, some elements could
include the following, many of which have
already been debated publicly (text table,
shaded column):
- Increasing the consumption tax to a uniform
rate of at least 15 percent, closer to the
average for OECD countries (text figure), as
it is a stable source of revenue in an aging
society, one of the least distortionary taxes,
and easy to administer.
- Cutting the corporate tax rate further,
beyond the
planned reduction to
35 percent in 2015, to improve incentives to
invest.
- Broadening the personal income tax base to
raise revenue and improve work incentives,
including by reducing the exemption for

The consolidation recommended by
staff would have a negative impact on real
GDP growth of about ½ percent annually in
the short-term. 3 The pace of consolidation
over the next 5-6 years under the staff’s
proposal is quicker than in most advanced
countries, which is needed to stabilize the
debt-to-GDP ratio given Japan’s large public
debt. Importantly, a commitment to fiscal
reform through pre-announced increases in
the consumption tax, could bring forward
household spending, limiting the near-term
impact of the tax increase. However, if the
consolidation was coupled with structural
reforms to support growth, it could boost
confidence and help raise private consumption
and investment over the longer-term.

deduction for dependent spouses.
- Reducing social security spending, including
by raising the pension retirement age to 67,
collecting contributions from dependent
spouses, and clawing back benefits from
wealthy retirees. 4 Some of these savings
could help fund a reduction in payroll taxes.
22.
Fiscal reforms would also need to
address equity concerns. Staff analysis
suggests that an increase in the consumption
tax and pension reforms would be fairer than
other measures in addressing the large
inequities between young and old generations
and that a delay in enacting fiscal reforms
would only serve to worsen intergenerational
equity (Box 3). Targeted transfers to lowerincome households could also be introduced
to address concerns about the regressive
nature of the consumption tax, rather than
adopting multiple tax rates that would reduce
its efficiency in raising revenue. The
introduction of a uniform tax identification
number could help raise revenue from highincome earners and better target transfers.
23.
The payoff of these reforms in the
form of a lower public-debt-to-GDP ratio
could be sizeable. By steadily improving the
fiscal balance over the course of a decade, staff
project net public debt to stabilize at around

similar to the authorities’ Growth Strategy
scenario, in which forceful structural reforms
together with increased confidence in fiscal
sustainability are assumed to lead to higher
real growth and inflation, and a depreciation of

This would push down the net public-debt-toGDP ratio to around 115 percent of GDP by

Box 3. Intergenerational Implications of Fiscal Consolidation in Japan1
Intergenerational resource inequality in Japan is
significant. The Cabinet Office estimated that based on
government policy in 2003, the present discounted
value (PDV) of the lifetime net burden (defined as any
payment to the government minus any services and
transfers from the government) for future generations
would be 50 million yen per household (about 10 times
household annual disposable income), and 100 million
yen heavier than for those aged 60 years or older.
Fiscal
consolidation
generally
worsens
intergenerational inequality further from current
levels. A fiscal adjustment typically aggravates
intergenerational resource imbalances as the young
would feel the decline in net benefits (as a result of an
adjustment) for a longer period. However, this does not
imply that a fiscal adjustment would make young and
future generations worse off because lack of fiscal
consolidation would eventually lead to an increase in
interest rates and lower pension benefits, which would
lower output and reduce welfare substantially.
Simulation
analysis
using
an
overlapping
generations (OLG) model shows that a fiscal
adjustment of 10 percentage points of GDP would
raise the lifetime net burden substantially for young
generations, but minimally for older generations.
For those aged 20–29, the net PDV burden from a
10 percentage point consolidation would be as much as
400 percent of current per household wage income
before taxes, with the total net burden reaching
1600 percent combined with the burden implied by
policy as of 2003 (text figure). Those aged 70 or higher,
however, would remain beneficiaries under the
government
transfer system even
with the
10 percentage point consolidation.

 Including social security spending reforms in a

consolidation package could help correct the
large intergenerational imbalance. This is because
older generations would have to bear the
immediate burden of these reforms. For example, if
a 1.5 percentage point of GDP adjustment (out of 10
points above) comes from social security spending
reforms (e.g., a targeted reduction in pension
benefits), that would reduce the burden for young
generations by 15 percent of current household
wage income (before taxes) relative to a scenario
without social security spending reforms. However,
relying excessively on social security spending
reforms could have serious welfare implications for
seniors. This argues for combining social security
spending reforms and revenue measures in a
consolidation package.

 Delaying fiscal adjustment could be costly and

worsen intergenerational resource inequality. For
example, delaying fiscal consolidation by 3 years
would require larger fiscal consolidation eventually
and raise the PDV lifetime burden for those
currently 20-29 years of age by 15-20 percentage
points of the current per household wage income
(before taxes). However, such a delay would reduce
the burden for older generations relative to a nodelay scenario (text figure). This highlights the
political
difficulty
of
implementing
fiscal
consolidation early as the share of old-aged people
is growing.

24.
To sustain a decade-long adjustment,
a more robust fiscal framework could
improve discipline and enhance public
understanding of the needed reforms.
Various options include adopting a mediumterm budget framework with a strict overall
spending limit and ministry-by-ministry
spending targets, while restricting the use of
supplementary budgets. Greater disclosure of
tax expenditures would also increase
transparency. Once fiscal consolidation is on
track, the authorities could also consider
adopting a legally-binding fiscal rule that
could target a primary surplus.
Authorities’ Views
25.
The
authorities
stressed
their
commitment to fiscal consolidation and see
the doubling of the consumption tax rate as
a critical first step. They broadly agreed with
staff advice on the need for further
consolidation beyond current plans. They
emphasized that their fiscal strategy is to halve
the primary deficit by FY2015 and achieve a
primary surplus by FY2020 at the latest, to
reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio over time.
26.
The authorities noted that they are
working toward concrete proposals to
achieve
this
adjustment,
and
are
considering a number of options including
some of those raised by staff. They were
cognizant of the need to address equity
concerns both between generations and for
low-income households. In this regard, they
acknowledged the importance of social
security reforms, especially to the public
pension. On the revenue side, before
considering a further reform in corporate
taxes, they wished first to examine such factors
as the impact of the corporate tax cut started
in FY2012 and international competitive
conditions.
27.
They saw the current fiscal
framework as effective in maintaining
discipline. The authorities stated that rigid
ministry-by-ministry medium-term spending
limits could weaken budget flexibility, and
referred to their experience with the 1997

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Fiscal Structural Reform Act, that included
limits by major spending category and was
suspended following the banking crisis. They
emphasized that their current rolling threeyear expenditure framework, with caps on
non-interest primary spending, was effective in
containing spending while allowing flexible
resource
allocation
across
expenditure
categories.

D. Structural Reforms to Raise
Growth
28.
Higher growth is essential to create
more jobs, reduce public debt and improve
resilience to shocks. While Japan had one of
the highest rates of productivity growth
among advanced economies over the past
decade, a decline in the working age
population and weak investment slowed
overall growth (Figure 4). Looking ahead, this
demographic effect will continue as the
population is expected to age quicker than in
most other countries (text figure).

International evidence shows that
bold and comprehensive reforms can
succeed in raising growth substantially. A
small number of advanced countries were able
to raise their potential growth rate on a
sustained basis by 1 percent (text table). In
several cases, the growth acceleration followed
a difficult economic period. Reforms were
often broad based and included increasing the
flexibility of the labor market, deregulating
product markets and services, and opening up
to foreign competition.

facilitated by introducing a uniform regular
employment contract which phases in

protection.
Increased
immigration could boost the labor force
and thereby raise growth. It may also have
an impact on inflation, including by raising
the demand for housing. The recently
introduced immigration “points-based”
system provides highly skilled foreign
professionals with preferential immigration
treatment and could be broadened to
include lower-skilled immigrants to meet
labor shortages in sectors such as longterm care for the old-aged and childcare,
which would also facilitate greater female
labor force participation.

In Japan, a far-reaching package of
reforms would be needed to achieve the
authorities’ goal of raising long-term GDP
growth to 2 percent. 6 Achieving such an
improvement in potential growth will be
challenging, in particular because Japan has
worse demographic headwinds than other
countries. Nonetheless, there is some “lowhanging fruit” in the labor market. Increasing
Japan’s female labor participation rates to the
G-7 average, raising old-age employment in
line with Japan’s long life expectancy, and
boosting the low level of immigration could
raise potential growth by a much as
½ percentage point (Figure 5).
Policy Issues and Staff’s Views
31.
Reforms should focus on the most
important constraints to growth. These
include the decline in the labor supply with
aging, low female labor force participation,
domestic sector regulations, and limited
availability of risk capital (text figure). A
package of structural policies should include
the following measures, many of which are
currently under consideration:
 Increasing the labor force. Female and oldaged employment could be encouraged by
further expanding childcare facilities
(including
through
deregulation)
eliminating
the
tax
deduction
for
dependent spouses, 7 and raising the
retirement age to above 65 years. Labor
market mobility and fairness could be

Stephan Danninger and Chad Steinberg (2012).

The tax deduction for dependent spouses with
annual income of less than 1.03 million yen
(US$13,500) is a disincentive for spouses to increase
their earnings beyond this level.

 Raising productivity further and encouraging
investment. Productivity in domestic sectors
could be increased by easing regulations
that limit the development of services, such
as health and old-age care, and by
reforming the electricity and agricultural
sectors.
While
Japan
is
becoming
increasingly integrated with Asia, it could
do more to tap into regional growth
momentum. This could include encouraging
FDI to help strengthen competitiveness and
aid specialization in high value products.8
Importantly, the authorities’ plan to pursue
high-quality free trade agreements with key

8

Stephan Danninger (2012).

JAPAN

Asian and European trading partners and
join the Trans Pacific Partnership could be
a catalyst for regional integration and
reforms in services and agriculture. At the
same time, wider multilateral trade
agreements should continue to be
pursued.
 Improving financial intermediation. While
credit conditions are accommodative at
present, structural impediments limit
funding for startups and dynamic small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),
which can be a particularly important
source of growth and new jobs. Scaling
down government-backed guarantees for
SME loans as the recovery takes hold,
phasing out the temporary SME Financing
Facilitation Act by March 2013, and
reducing the role of the government in
channeling credit (including by fully
privatizing Japan Post) would ensure a
level playing field and could improve the
availability of risk capital. The availability of
such financing could also be improved by
encouraging use of asset-based lending,
including for inventories and accounts
receivable. With further reform and
financial strengthening, public pension
funds could also become an additional
source of investment capital as in some
other countries. In addition, consideration
could be given to refocusing the public
asset management company to advance
SME restructuring.9
Authorities’ Views
32.
The authorities recognized that
structural reforms were vital to lift
potential growth, but noted that the
challenge may be more daunting than in
other countries. Rapid population aging
implied a trend decline in labor inputs, while
productivity growth was already very high,
limiting the scope for further improvements.
9

See Selected Issues “Financial Policies to Support
Growth” by Raphael Lam and Jongsoon Shin (2012).

2012 ARTICLE IV STAFF REPORT

The government’s Growth Strategy already
includes some measures to increase the labor
force by encouraging higher participation of
women, the young, and the aged. But officials
agreed that further measures were needed to
boost growth, including by promoting
employment of highly-skilled foreigners,
restructuring SMEs, and deregulating some
protected sectors, such as healthcare,
childcare, electricity, and agriculture. While
the authorities believed that financial sector
reforms could lead to a more efficient
allocation of capital, such reforms alone
would not raise growth much at present as
credit demand was low.

E. Defeating Deflation
33.
Japan’s history of deflation partly
explains its weak growth and worsening
debt dynamics. Mild deflation for over a
decade has contributed to lower private
investment and consumption by sustaining
high real interest rates and raising real levels
of debt. In addition, deflation has reduced tax
revenue, and made it more difficult to contain
real spending, which led to a rise in public
debt-to-GDP. An exit from deflation is
therefore essential to support the recovery
and to facilitate fiscal consolidation.
Policy Issues and Staff’s Views
34.
Staff emphasized that forceful
monetary easing should be a key element
of a comprehensive package of policies
needed to defeat deflation. As the
effectiveness of monetary policy is blunted by
an already very flat yield curve, structural
reforms will also be important to boost
confidence, raise domestic demand, and
thereby accelerate the closing of the output
gap. At the same time, strong action to
achieve fiscal consolidation over the mediumterm could help ease the way for additional
monetary accommodation.
35.
Staff welcomed recent measures
taken by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to
combat deflation. The adoption in February

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17

2012 ARTICLE IV STAFF REPORT

JAPAN

of a medium to long-term price stability goal
of 1 percent has helped clarify the objective of
monetary policy. In addition, the BoJ
expanded its Asset Purchase Program by ¥15
trillion this year in two steps and extended the
maturity of JGB purchases from 1–2 years to
1–3 years (text chart, text table). Together with
earlier commitments this is a sizeable
monetary expansion, totaling about 5 percent
of GDP over the next year.

Nevertheless, staff project inflation
to remain below the inflation goal for an
extended period. Even after accounting for
the recent easing, staff forecast inflation to
rise only to ½ percent in 2014 because of the
negative output gap, and to reach the goal of
1 percent by 2017. In addition, the much
needed fiscal consolidation would likely
dampen domestic demand in the near term,
pulling down core inflation. Heightened
uncertainty about the global outlook also
raises concerns about the likelihood of
achieving the inflation goal in coming years.
37.
Staff advised further monetary
easing. Notwithstanding the current difficult
environment for designing and implementing
monetary policy, additional effective easing
could be delivered. The asset purchase

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

program could be expanded substantially
beyond current plans to increase the
likelihood of achieving the 1 percent inflation
goal by end-2014, under staff’s baseline
economic outlook.10 This would help reduce
lending rates further. Moreover, such easing
could also raise inflation expectations and
help depreciate the exchange rate, which
would be important channels given the
current low interest rate environment that
blunts the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Extending
the
maturity
of
Japanese
Government Bond (JGB) purchases beyond
3 years could help reduce medium-term
lending rates further. In addition, purchases of
private assets, including corporate bonds,
equities, and highly-rated securitized SME
loans, could stimulate activity by boosting
asset prices.
38.
The BoJ could consider some
enhancements to its communication to
increase the effectiveness of monetary
policy. The BoJ could extend its inflation
forecast to 3 years or beyond to better guide
expectations. To underline its commitment to
achieving the inflation goal, the BoJ could
clarify further that it would be prepared to
react effectively to changes in its baseline
economic outlook. In addition, the BoJ could
emphasize that the current inflation goal of
1 percent is not considered a ceiling, and that
a higher inflation rate could be allowed when
food and energy prices rise temporarily or the
consumption tax rate is increased. Once
inflation gets closer to 1 percent, the BoJ
could consider an increase in the inflation
goal to create a larger buffer against
deflationary shocks.
Authorities’ Views
39.
The BoJ agreed that the recovery
was in train and believed that the current
policy stance was appropriate. They
emphasized that with their powerful easing of
10

from a structural VAR. See “Bank of Japan’s
Quantitative and Credit Easing: Are They Now More
Effective?” (WP 12/2).

JAPAN

monetary policy, including sizable asset
purchases, it will be likely not too long before
inflation reaches 1 percent in their baseline
outlook. The BoJ noted that monetary policy
alone
cannot
defeat
deflation,
and
emphasized that a combination of structural
reforms and powerful monetary easing would
contribute to raising growth and inflation
expectations, under the low interest rate
environment. The BoJ also cautioned that
further purchases of JGBs and other types of
financial assets would expose their balance
sheet to risk. Moreover, in the absence of
fiscal reforms further increases in JGB
purchases could be viewed as monetization of
the fiscal deficit and push interest rates up.
40.
The
BoJ
emphasized
the
effectiveness of their communication. They
noted that the clarification of their goal in
February and the Governor’s recent speeches
had been effective in guiding market
expectations. The BoJ explained that its
medium- to long-term inflation goal will be
regularly reviewed and going forward the BoJ
could consider raising its goal, as structural
reforms to strengthen growth potential
proceed, though such consideration depends
on how fast these reforms make progress. In
addition, they stressed that they would look
through temporary factors, such as an
increase of the consumption tax rate, when
assessing whether the policy stance was
appropriate to achieve the medium-term
inflation goal.
41.
The authorities shared staff’s view
that structural reforms are important to
defeat deflation. In that regard, a recently
established ministerial council laid out priority
areas for policies to combat deflation
including through regulatory and structural
reforms.

F. Responding to a Downside
Scenario

42.
If the outlook for growth worsens
sharply in the near term, staff noted that
further easing of monetary policy would be
advisable, beyond that recommended in

2012 ARTICLE IV STAFF REPORT

the baseline scenario. Fiscal policy could also
play a role, although it is constrained by the
limited fiscal space. While maintaining the
medium-term
fiscal
target,
automatic
stabilizers could be allowed to work and in
case of a severe downturn small and targeted
fiscal measures could be introduced, as long
as JGB yields remain low. However, staff
stressed that it would not be advisable to
delay legislation of the increase in the
consumption tax given its importance as a
signal of commitment to consolidation. If
financial markets were disrupted by
heightened global turmoil, the authorities
could consider providing additional liquidity
together with other tailored actions to
address market disruptions.
The Authorities’ Views
43.
The authorities broadly agreed with
staff’s advice. They emphasized that their
commitment to fiscal reform over the
medium-term was an essential stabilizing
factor that would provide markets with
confidence during a downturn. The BoJ
agreed that further easing of monetary policy
could play a role if the outlook for growth
worsened sharply.

G. Assessing External Stability
44.
Japan’s current account surplus
remains sizeable, while the yen has
appreciated significantly. The current
account surplus has narrowed from almost 5
percent of GDP in 2007, prior to the global
financial crisis, and is expected to be around
2¼ percent of GDP in 2012 (Figure 5). The yen
has appreciated in real effective terms by
27 percent since the Lehman event in late
2008, initially due to an unwinding of carry
trades and later as a result of safe haven flows
during periods of global financial distress.
45.
The authorities intervened during the
past year to counter volatility in exchange
rates. The intervention in Oct/Nov 2011 was
sizable (at about US$120 billion) and increased
foreign exchange reserves (excluding gold) to
US$1,258 billion by end-2012, in response to

a sharp appreciation of the yen as investors
sought a safe haven. Staff advised that Japan,
like other advanced economies, should allow
the market to determine the exchange rate,
although intervention could be used to
counter volatile or disorderly market
conditions.
46.
Japan’s external position appears
moderately weaker than that consistent
with underlying fundamentals. The current
account has averaged about 3 percent of GDP
over the last decade and is expected to
remain around 2 percent of GDP over the
medium-term, as population aging begins to
reduce private saving. After taking into
account desirable fiscal consolidation and
structural policies, the current account’s
normal level (“the norm”) is estimated by staff
to be around 3 to 4 percent of GDP, leaving
the gap between the current level and the
norm at around 1 to 2 percent of GDP
(Appendix III). This implies that the current
account position is moderately weaker than
suggested by the fundamentals (i.e, that the
yen is moderately overvalued from a mediumterm perspective).
47.
Assessing the current level of the
exchange rate against long-run averages
also suggests that the yen is moderately
overvalued. While the real effective exchange
rate (REER), measured using relative consumer
prices, is close to its 20-year average, it is
about 10-15 percent more appreciated than

Authorities’ Views
48.
The authorities expressed concern
about the yen’s volatility and disorderly
movements caused by speculation. They
agreed with staff that the yen was overvalued,
but believed that the overvaluation was
“substantial” rather than “moderate.” They
noted that safe-haven capital inflows had
likely led to an over-shooting of the exchange
rate. They emphasized that the REER had
appreciated sharply since the fall of 2008,
including a strengthening by about 40–
60 percent against the Euro and the Korean
won in real terms. In addition, they pointed
out that the economy faces the burden of
recovery from the severe earthquake, a
challenging fiscal situation, and a shift of the
trade balance into deficit.

H. Securing Financial Stability
49.
The financial system has weathered
recent shocks well, although strains from
the European debt crisis have risen. The
earthquake and spillovers from the Thai floods
led to significant economic disruptions but
had only a limited effect on financial stability.
Rising dollar funding costs in late 2011 were
contained through coordinated central bank
action, but costs have risen again in recent
weeks as a result of uncertainty in Europe
(Figure 6). Direct exposures of Japanese
financial institutions to peripheral European

countries are small (less than 1 percent of
banks’ total assets), but indirect exposures
through financial ties to core European
countries are significant (Box 4).

Policy Issues and Staff’s Views

2012 ARTICLE IV STAFF REPORT

Box 4. Potential Financial Spillovers from the European Debt Crisis1
A key downside risk for Japan, and Asia more
broadly, is an escalation of the Euro area
debt crisis. So far, deleveraging by European
banks has been orderly with only a modest
impact on credit conditions in Japan and the
region. Nonetheless, spillovers could intensify if
European banks come under pressure to reduce
their balance sheets to cope with high rollover
needs, weak economic growth, and the need to
strengthen their capital base (GFSR and REO
2012).
The FSSA highlighted several financial
spillover channels, including losses from
overseas exposures and funding pressures:
 Losses from overseas exposures of Japanese
financial institutions are likely to be limited, if
the crisis is contained to the peripheral
European countries. Japanese banks hold
about 12 percent of their assets as foreign
claims, of which about ¼ are on Europe. The
majority of banks’ claims on Europe are on the
nonfinancial sector (about 60 percent) in core
countries. While insurance companies invest
about 15–20 percent of their assets in foreign
securities, direct exposures to peripheral
European countries have been unwound and
the amount was negligible as of end-2011.
 The risks to the financial system in Japan,
however, would be more severe if the
European crisis impacted U.S. and U.K banks
or hit the claims on the nonfinancial sector in
core European countries. Assuming sizeable
credit and funding shocks (100 percent of loss
given default and 50 percent discount on
asset liquidation) on cross-border banking
claims and no policy response by country
authorities, such shocks would impair
substantially the tier 1 capital of Japanese
banks, based on network analysis prepared for
the FSAP update. Market distress correlation
measures also point to a rise of spillover risks
between Japanese financial institutions and

systemic U.S. and European
institutions during crisis periods.

financial

 U.S. dollar funding conditions are likely to
remain favorable for Japanese banks owing
to their large holdings of collateral needed
to access central bank facilities. However,
Japanese securities firms will need to
manage carefully their day-to-day dollar
liquidity because of their reliance on
wholesale market funding. In addition, some
foreign banks in Japan (especially European)
might face difficulties in meeting both their
yen and dollar funding needs locally, as was
observed in 2008-09.
The FSAP stress tests also assessed the impact
of a global recession scenario that could be
triggered by an intensification of the European
crisis. The tests suggest that, in the near term,
Japanese banks and insurers have the capacity to
withstand a severe global growth shock and losses
from foreign exposures. The banking sector
solvency tests, however, did not account for risks
from large exposures or the impact of adjusting
various support measures to SMEs. Moreover,
stress tests, by their nature, are partial analyses
and more severe tail risk scenarios, with feedback
from fiscal-financial sector linkages, could be
more detrimental to financial stability than
suggested by the tests.
On the upside, an orderly deleveraging by
European banks is providing opportunities for
Japanese financial institutions. They have been
expanding overseas, especially in the region, in
the face of weak domestic demand and the strong
yen. Cross-border exposures of Japanese banks
and insurance companies are rising (having
doubled since 2004 to reach US$2.7 trillion as of
December 2011 for banks), though are still
relatively low compared to U.S. and European
counterparts. An increasing role of Japanese
financial institutions in the region could help
mitigate the impact of a retreat of European
banks, particularly on syndicated loans and trade
finance.

banks to strengthen their capital positions and
building the resilience of insurers to shocks.
Moreover, Japan has a high level of
compliance
with
international
core
principles.11
51.
Nevertheless, financial institutions’
low core profitability and large holdings of
JGBs and equities raise some concerns
about financial stability. The FSAP stress
tests suggest that in the near term banks and
insurers would be resilient to severe economic
stress and moderate market shocks. However,
the key challenges banks face are to raise
profitability in a low growth environment,
while managing risk associated with their JGB
and equity holdings. Specifically:
 Despite the improvement in banks’ net
income during FY2011 as a result of large
trading gains, core profitability remains low,
with an average return on assets of only
0.3 percent due to a narrowing of the
interest margin (Table 6). This limits their
capacity to rebuild capital buffers after a
shock. Banks’ nonperforming loans ratio has
stayed low (at 3 percent of total loans in
early 2011), but the BoJ estimates that this
could rise by about 1 percentage point if
SMEs with restructured loans fail to improve
their business conditions.12
 Interest rate risk has increased since the
global financial crisis (text figure). Banks’
holdings of JGBs have grown to about onefifth of their assets, most of which are
available-for-sale securities (that are marked
to market prices) in the banking book.
Major banks that comprise over 40 percent
of total bank assets (text figure) have
contained their interest rate risk by holding
short maturities, averaging 2½ years. If

The core principles assessed included the Basel
Core Principles for banks, Insurance Core Principles
(ICP) for insurance companies, and International
Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO)
Principles and Objectives.
12
The SME Financing Facilitation Act introduced in
2009 was accompanied by a change in FSA’s
guidelines that relaxed the requirements for
classifying restructured loans as “normal,” thereby
understating the underlying credit risks.

Regional banks, however, hold longer

such a scenario. In the unlikely event of a
prolonged growth shock, combined with a
sharp rise in government bond yields,
financial stability might be challenged.

 Market risk from equities has declined but
is still sizable. Equity holdings by banks
(almost 40 percent of total capital) and
non-life insurers (20 percent of assets)
imply that they would face substantial
losses if stock prices fell sharply.
 Looking forward, the expansion of financial
institutions overseas, while welcome, would
present challenges to supervisors in
monitoring cross-border exposures.
52.
The authorities intend to implement
Basel III for internationally-active banks.
The FSAP update estimates that applying

JAPAN

immediately and in full the Basel III capital
definition for these banks, while keeping the
Basel II definition of RWA, would reduce their
Tier 1 capital ratios by about 2¼ percentage
points (from 12¾ percent in March 2011
under Basel II). Applying more prudent risk
weights (in line with the Basel III phase-in as of
September 2011) would further reduce the
ratio by about 1 percentage point for the
three mega banks. The ratio would still be
above the Basel III minimum requirement that
will rise to 6 percent by 2015.
53.
The FSSA recommended a number
of measures to improve the monitoring of
systemic risks and strengthen further the
financial stability framework, which require
timely attention and implementation. The
main recommendations, which are covered in
detail in the FSSA, are summarized below:
 Risk monitoring. Thematic risk assessments
could be put in place to monitor financial
institutions’ readiness to manage systemic
risks. The BoJ and Financial Services Agency
(FSA)
could
consider
formalizing
arrangements to intensify their information
sharing and oversight of systemically
relevant financial institutions, markets and
infrastructure. In addition, the recent
increase in cross-border activities by some
Japanese financial institutions requires
deeper collaboration between the FSA and
foreign supervisory authorities (for example
through an active use of Memoranda of
Understanding).
 Prudential framework. The authorities could
tighten large exposure limits on lending by
banks and raise capital requirements for
domestic-oriented banks. 13 These banks
could be encouraged to improve their
13

The domestic-oriented banks (mostly regional and
shinkin banks) account for about 40 percent of bank
assets and are currently subject to a capital
requirement of 4 percent of risk-weighted assets,
lower than their internationally-active peers. As of
June 2012, there is no plan to subject these banks to
Basel III requirements.

2012 ARTICLE IV STAFF REPORT

profitability so as to enhance their growth
supporting role and build their resilience to
shocks.
For
insurers,
the
solvency
assessment needs to be based on an
economic valuation by taking into account
the full time horizon of insurance contracts
(rather than just up to 10 years as required
under current regulations). In addition, steps
are needed to strengthen the supervision of
private pension funds, including by
requiring participants’ representation on the
boards of corporate pension plans and
establishing a mandatory guarantee fund for
defined benefit pensions.
 Crisis resolution. Improvements in the crisis
resolution framework should be explored to
ensure orderly resolution for systemicallyimportant nonbank financial institutions.
 Global regulatory reform agenda. The FSA
should review the adequacy of its skills and
resources given the workload involved in
implementing the global regulatory reform
agenda.
Authorities’ Views
54.
The authorities welcomed the main
findings of the FSSA and broadly agreed
with most recommendations. They noted
that they continue to monitor risks closely to
ensure financial stability, and continue to carry
out inspections and stress tests. These tests
include a rise in interest rates, although they
consider the risk of a sharp rise in government
bond yields to be remote. In the face of
overseas expansion by financial institutions,
the FSA also monitors closely cross-border
activities and the risks financial institutions
assume, and intends to develop closer ties
with supervisory agencies in the region. The
authorities also noted the potential adverse
impact on financial markets of some global
regulatory reforms. For instance, the
extraterritorial application of the Volcker rule
might lead to the withdrawal of foreign
institutions from market-making activities in
Japan and adversely affect liquidity and
pricing in the JGB market.

55.
The
authorities
considered
supervision and financial sector regulation
to be effective and strive to improve their
activities. Several initiatives are underway in
areas highlighted by the FSSA, including the
implementation of the new rules on Basel III
beginning in FY2013 in line with the timeline
announced by the G-20, and a review of the
large exposure limits by Japan’s Financial
System Council.14 They stated that the FSA
and the BoJ attach utmost importance to close
communication and coordination, and in
practice exchange information and discuss
regularly and frequently, and believed that
current practice is effective and most efficient
in dealing with financial stability issues flexibly.
The FSA was comfortable with the soundness
of domestic-oriented banks at present, but

will consider any further action, if and when
necessary. The FSA encouraged these financial
institutions to continuously improve their
capital
positions
through
enhanced
profitability and risk management, making use
of the Early Warning System and off-site
monitoring. In recent years, the FSA has
continued to increase its workforce and
budget despite an overall reduction in
government personnel and budget. Further
increases may need to be contemplated, while
efforts should be made to rationalize work
and improve overall efficiency. The authorities
were committed to working with the Financial
Stability Board on resolution regimes, and
address issues in an orderly manner, taking
into account discussions in the international
fora.

STAFF APPRAISAL
56.
Japan’s economy is set to recover
despite a worsening of the global outlook.
Reconstruction activity is likely to offset
headwinds
from
a
fragile
external
environment. Risks to this outlook are tilted to
the downside and primarily stem from the
possibility of an escalation of turmoil in Europe
and a sharper-than-expected slowing of the
Chinese economy. The risk of electricity
shortages from closure of most nuclear power
plants appears manageable.
57.
Reducing the public debt burden
will require fiscal adjustment of 10 percent
of GDP over a decade. Passage of legislation
to double the consumption tax rate to
10 percent by 2015 is a crucial step and would
demonstrate a commitment to fiscal reform.
Putting the public-debt-to-GDP ratio on a
clear downward path, however, will require an
additional 5 percent of GDP adjustment.
58.
This adjustment should be designed
to limit any adverse impact on growth and
14

established under the FSA, comprising academics and
professionals.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

equity. In particular, raising the consumption
tax would be less distortionary and fairer than
other taxes in addressing intergenerational
inequities. It would also provide room to cut
more distortionary taxes such as the corporate
tax. In addition, incentives to work could be
increased by eliminating the tax deduction for
dependent spouses and raising the pension
retirement age. At the same time, targeted
transfers to lower-income households could
be introduced to address concerns about the
regressive nature of the consumption tax.
Delaying fiscal adjustment could be costly and
would serve to worsen intergenerational equity.
59.
Speedy implementation of farreaching structural reforms is essential to
raise growth. Given Japan’s rapidly aging
population, reforms should focus on increasing
the labor force by raising incentives for women
and the old-aged to work and by boosting
immigration. Productivity in domestic sectors
could be increased by easing regulations.
Additionally, Japan could tap into regional
growth momentum further by entering highquality free trade agreements with key trading
partners,
including
the
Trans
Pacific
Partnership. Finally, financial intermediation
could be improved by reducing the role of the

JAPAN

government in channeling credit and by
increasing the availability of risk capital.
60.
Further monetary easing should be a
key element of a comprehensive package of
policies needed to defeat deflation.
Additional effective easing could be delivered
by expanding the BoJ’s asset purchase
program substantially beyond current plans, to
accelerate achievement of the 1 percent
inflation goal. In addition, communication
could be enhanced by emphasizing that the
inflation goal is not considered a ceiling, and
that a higher inflation rate could be allowed in
response to temporary price shocks.
61.
If the outlook for growth worsens
sharply, further easing of monetary policy
would
be
advisable
beyond
that
recommended in the baseline scenario.
Fiscal policy could also play a role through
automatic stabilizers, although it is constrained
by the limited fiscal space. It would not be
advisable to delay legislation of the increase in
the consumption tax.
62.
Japan’s external position appears
moderately weaker than that consistent
with medium term fundamentals. Following
a sizable appreciation of the yen since the
onset of the global financial crisis and a

2012 ARTICLE IV STAFF REPORT

narrowing of the current account surplus to
2 percent of GDP in 2011, the yen now appears
moderately overvalued from a medium-term
perspective.
63.
The financial system is stable and
could
be
further
strengthened
by
improving the monitoring of systemic risks
and bolstering the financial stability
framework. In this context, the FSSA
recommendations focus on three main areas.
Risk monitoring could be enhanced by putting
in place thematic risk assessments, especially
with regard to financial institutions’ sizable
holding of JGBs and equities. The prudential
framework could be improved, including by
tightening large exposure limits on lending by
banks, raising capital requirements for
domestic-oriented banks, and basing the
solvency assessment on a more refined
economic valuation for insurers. There is also
room for improving the crisis resolution
framework to ensure orderly resolution for
systemically-important
nonbank
financial
institutions.
64.
It is recommended that the next
Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Likelihood (Over next one
to three years)
High/Medium
An escalation of the European
turmoil combined with an
intensification of the flight to
safety in financial markets.

Impact and Policy Response
High
Exports would decline owing to weak global demand and
appreciation, depressing equity prices and business and
consumer confidence and lowering growth. A decline in
equity prices would raise market risk for banks and non-life
insurers. Dollar funding pressure could increase if the
turmoil spreads to other regions.
Policy response: Further easing of monetary policy would be
advisable. Fiscal policy could also play a role through
automatic stabilizers, although it is constrained by the
limited fiscal space. It would not be advisable to delay
legislation of the increase in the consumption tax.

2. A Hard Landing in
China

3. Increase in
Energy Costs and
Electricity
Shortages

4. Sharp rise in JGB
Yields

Low

High

A sharper-than-expected
slowing of the Chinese
economy.
Medium
Due to turmoil in the Middle
East, disrupting oil supplies; or
an unusually hot summer,
increasing
peak
electricity
demand; or nuclear plants
remaining closed for an
extended period.

Similar to the above.

Low
Due
to
difficulties
with
implementing a credible fiscal
consolidation
plan;
or
continued
slow
economic
growth and no progress on
structural reforms; or aging
reducing private saving and the
current account surplus over
the longer term.

High
A sharp increase in government bond yields would pose a
threat to fiscal sustainability. Given the large stock of debt,
even a modest rise in the interest rate-growth differential
from near historic lows (0 percent in 2012) could significantly
worsen debt dynamics and undermine market confidence,
reduce economic growth and worsen deflation. A more
severe tail risk scenario with feedback from fiscal-financial
sector linkages, could be more detrimental to financial
stability, including due to the large JGB holdings by financial
institutions, and potentially add to government liabilities.

Medium
Higher energy imports and costs would reduce production,
weaken the trade balance, hurt investor confidence and
increase the chances of a JGB shock. Potential growth could
be adversely affected by an extended closure of the nuclear
plants.
Policy response: Allow full pass-through of energy costs to
electricity prices. Medium-term vulnerabilities could be
reduced by encouraging alternative energy sources.

Policy response: Reinforce fiscal consolidation to regain
market confidence. The BoJ could also step in to address
temporary market volatility.
5. Protracted
Growth Slowdown
and Deflationary
Pressures

Medium
Possibly due to prolonged
global economic downturn and
limited progress on structural
reforms to boost growth.

Medium
Real GDP growth well below the baseline outlook and
continued deflation would worsen debt dynamics.

6. Faster Recovery

Medium
A faster than expected recovery
in Japanese consumer and
business sentiment would lift
domestic demand.

Medium
The output gap could close earlier than projected and
inflation could reach the BoJ’s goal faster, improving public
debt dynamics.
Policy response: Front loading fiscal consolidation to capture
the long-term benefits.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Policy response: Speedy implementation of structural
reforms, supported by aggressive monetary policy easing
and fiscal consolidation in a growth friendly way.

2012 ARTICLE IV STAFF REPORT

Appendix II. Japan: Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis
This appendix presents four scenarios: i) a no adjustment scenario; ii) the authorities’ current plan (staff
estiamte); iii) a policy adjustment scenario that would reduce the net-public-debt-to-GDP ratio to
125 percent (215 percent of GDP on a gross debt basis) by 2030; and iv) an upside scenario that could
see net public debt reduced to 115 pecent of GDP (205 percent of GDP on a gross debt basis) by 2030.
Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions. Both real GDP growth and the inflation rate are assumed to
converge to 1 percent over the long term. As a result, nominal GDP growth is around 2 percent per year
over the next 10 years. The nominal interest rate growth differential is assumed to converge to 1 percent
(pre-crisis average since 2000) over the long run. Consequently, the average nominal interest rate is
assumed to rise to 3 percent (compared to about 1 percent currently) over the long run.
No Adjustment Scenario. Without staff’s recommended adjustment, net debt (defined here as general
government net debt, including the social security fund) would rise to about 245 percent of GDP
(335 percent of GDP on a gross debt basis) by 2030. The no-adjustment scenario assumes expiration of
enacted stimulus (1 percent of GDP), a modest expenditure adjustment (1½ percent of GDP), and
unchanged tax policy (no increase in the consumption tax) between end-2011 and 2020, which altogether
improves the structural primary balance by 2½ percent of GDP over the next decade.
Authorities’ Current Plan. The authorities plan to
raise the consumption tax rate to 8 percent in 2014
and then 10 percent in 2015. This, together with the
expenditure adjustments outlined above, is
estimated to improve the structural primary balance
by 5 percent of GDP over the next decade. However,
the net public-debt-to-GDP ratio would fail to
stabilize and rise to around 200 percent of GDP (290
percent of GDP on a gross debt basis) by 2030.

1/ Net debt of the general government including the social security fund.
2/ No consumption tax increases are assumed.
3/ Consumption tax increases to 8 percent in 2014 and 10 percent in 2015 are assumed.
4/ Policy adjustment scenario assumes a 10 percentage points of GDP improvement (authorities' current
proposal +5.0 points) in the structural primary between end-2011 and 2020.

Policy Adjustment Scenario. Achieving debt
sustainability will require that Japan stabilize and put
its public-debt-to-GDP ratio firmly on a downward
path. To achieve this goal, the policy adjustment scenario assumes a 10 percent of GDP improvement of
the structural primary balance over the next decade (between end-2011 and 2020).1 This comprises a
withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus undertaken in response to the financial crisis (1 percent of GDP) plus
additional policy measures of 9 percent of GDP, of which 5 percentage points are assumed to come from
a gradual rise in the consumption tax starting in 20142 and 4 percentage points from other reforms (e.g.,
curbing the growth rate of nominal nonsocial security spending, limiting growth in social security
spending).
Sensitivity Analysis. The debt sustainability results are sensitive to macroeconomic assumptions. In
particular, a higher interest rate growth differential (than the baseline of 1 percent) would lead to a faster
pace of debt accumulation (see Table A1). However, even with a higher differential of 2 percent, the netpublic-debt-to-GDP ratio would still decline over the longer term in the Policy Adjustment scenario.
Depending on the size of the interest rate growth differential, returning the net-public-debt-to-GDP ratio
to its pre-crisis level by 2030 would require an adjustment of between 13–15½ percent of GDP.
1

Beyond 2020, the social security balance (defined as social security premiums minus benefits) is likely to worsen. To
maintain the 10 percentage point improvement in 2021 and after, a further adjustment would be needed.
2
More specifically, the adjustment scenario assumes a consumption tax increase by 10 percentage points cumulatively
(3 percentage points in 2014, 2 percentage points in 2015, 3 percentage points in 2016, and 2 percentage points in
2017).

Stochastic simulations with shocks to growth, inflation, and interest rates also show that debt dynamics
are sensitive to macroeconomics shocks (Figure A1). In case of severe macroeconomic shocks, the publicdebt-to-GDP ratio would continue to rise even under the staff’s policy adjustment scenario. However,
implementation of staff’s suggested policy adjustment would prevent debt from exploding in most cases
(Figure 1, right).

Contingent Liabilities. The debt position looks worse once contingent liabilities are taken into account.
Including government guaranteed bonds, broader general government net debt would be about 10
percentage points of GDP higher than otherwise. Including contingent liabilities associated with TEPCO
(Tokyo Electric Power Company)3 and regional banks would have a modest impact on debt figures (1-3
percentage points).

1/ Contingent liabilities associated with TEPCO and regional banks are assumed at 1.9 percent of GDP (9 trillion yen) and 0.75
percent of GDP, respectively. The latter is based on the maximum capital injection estimated in the 2012 FSAP update.

Upside Scenario. An upside scenario with higher real growth and inflation highlights the benefits of
higher nominal growth for debt dynamics.4 Under the upside scenario, the net-public-debt-to-GDP ratio
would decline to 115 percent of GDP (205 percent of GDP on a gross debt basis) by 2030—10 points
lower than under the baseline macroeconomic assumptions. Higher nominal GDP growth would continue
to reduce the debt ratio thanks to a higher denominator (nominal GDP) until the average nominal interest
rate catches up, and help reduce spending (in percent of GDP).
This scenario does not imply that a higher inflation rate alone could reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio
substantially. An increase in the inflation rate by 5 percentage points (relative to the baseline assumption)
could reduce the debt ratio at most by around 15 percentage points over the long run. This is because the
average nominal interest rate would catch up quickly within several years (the average debt maturity is
about 6 years). An even higher inflation rate (e.g., 10 percentage points or higher) could be damaging to
real economic activity.

TEPCO’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was hit by tsunami, which followed the March 2011 earthquake. TEPCO is
liable for compensation for residents who lived in the neighborhood of the plant. Compensation and related costs
paid directly by the government (¼ percent of GDP) are included in the scenario excluding contingent liabilities.
Maximum support to TEPCO of 1.9 percent of GDP (9 trillion yen) including a capital injection through the Nuclear
Damage Liability Facilitation Fund is counted as contingent liabilities.
4
The upside scenario assumes higher long-term growth rates of real GDP (2 percent) and GDP deflator (1½ percent).

2012 ARTICLE IV STAFF REPORT

JAPAN

Appendix III. Assessment of Japan’s External Sector
Staff’s external sector evaluation concludes that the exchange rate is moderately overvalued from a
medium-term perspective. This assessment is based on the following considerations:
 Current account. Japan’s current account surplus declined to 2 percent of GDP in 2011 (1½ percent in
cyclically-adjusted terms), because of a worsening of the trade balance as a result of external shocks
(earthquake, Thai floods, and yen appreciation). The current account is likely to improve in the near term,
but weaken over the medium term as private saving declines due to population aging, assuming
limited fiscal consolidation as in staff’s baseline forecast. The investment income account surplus (3
percent of GDP in 2011) is expected to remain sizable, supported by large net foreign assets (NFA) and
higher returns on assets than on liabilities. The current account has averaged about 3 percent of GDP
over the last decade and is expected to remain around 2 percent of GDP over the medium term without
policy adjustment.
The cyclically adjusted current account is estimated to be 1–2 percent of GDP weaker than the value
implied by fundamentals and desirable policies. After taking into account desirable fiscal consolidation
and structural policies, the current account consistent with fundamentals is estimated to be around 3 to
4 percent of GDP.
 Real exchange rate. The yen strengthened steadily throughout 2011, and has appreciated by about
27 percent in real terms since the Lehman collapse by February 2012, initially due to unwinding of the
carry trades and later due to safe haven flows. A part of the appreciation in 2011 was reversed in early
2012, helped by greater stability in global markets and monetary easing. Although from end- of the
reference period to end-May, Japan’s real effective exchange rate has risen again by about 4 percent.
On balance, the real exchange is estimated to be moderately overvalued (around 0 to 10 percent)
relative to medium-term fundamentals. The real effective exchange rate in March 2012 is close to its 20year average, using the relative consumer prices measure. However, using the relative unit labor cost
measure, the REER is about 10–15 percent higher than its 20-year average. This result is consistent with
the fact that Japan has been losing export market share since the mid-1990s, while its main competitors
have kept or increased their share, which suggests some overvaluation. Nevertheless, comparing the
exchange rate at present to the average of the past two decades may be misleading since it is highly
likely that current fundamentals of the Japanese economy are not as strong as its average level over the
last two decades due to population aging, significant increases in public debt and other factors.
 Capital account flows and measures. An important part of the capital flows in the mid-to late 2000s
was the yen carry trade and it’s unwinding after the Lehman shock. In addition, during 2010 and 2011
net capital inflows were fueled by safe haven effects into short-term government bills and money
market instruments. Japan has an open capital account. Safe haven flows imply limited vulnerabilities to
global financial instability.
 FX intervention and reserves. Reserves are much higher than other reserve asset issuers (about
20 percent of GDP) largely on legacy accumulation. The level of the yen is market determined. Isolated
foreign exchange market interventions during safe haven flows appear to have reduced short-term
exchange market volatility, while having ambiguous effects on the exchange rate level.
 Foreign asset and liability position. The net foreign asset position has risen from about 35 percent of
GDP ten years ago to over 50 percent of GDP in 2011. Modest further accumulation is expected to result
from current account surpluses over the next five years. But the ratio is likely to stabilize given a trend
decline in the current account surplus because aging will reduce saving. Most assets and liabilities are
portfolio equity and debt securities, rather than foreign direct investment. Vulnerabilities are limited as
Japan’s positive net position generates sizable investment income (that averaged about 3 percent of
GDP in the past five years) and offset the goods trade deficit.

2012 ARTICLE IV STAFF REPORT

Appendix IV. Japan: Main Recommendations of the 2011 Article IV Consultation
Fund Recommendations
Fiscal Policy:
Timely passage of an additional and more sizeable
supplementary budget, focused on revitalizing the
earthquake affected regions.

Commitment to fiscal reform to bring down public debt over
the medium term, including:
 a comprehensive tax reform, with a gradual increase in
the consumption tax over several years, yielding 5 percent
of GDP.
 freezing central government contributions to the public
pension system in nominal terms, including by raising the
pension retirement age, freezing nonsocial security
spending in nominal terms, and introducing an income
cap on social transfers.
 introduce a taxpayer identification system to allow for a
more effective targeting of social transfers.
Monetary Policy:
Further monetary easing to guard against deflation risks,
through purchases of longer maturity JGBs (3 years and
above).
Additional purchases of private assets, including corporate
bonds, commercial paper, ETFs, and securitized SME loans.
Extend some of the BoJ’s loan facilities.

Financial Sector Policy:
Withdraw emergency support measures for SMEs loans to
limit moral hazard risks and encourage proper risk
management towards SMEs, once the recovery is underway.
Encourage banks to monitor market risks closely and
continue to reduce their equity holding.
Promote more risk-based (as opposed to collateral-based)
lending and consolidation or restructuring of weak regional
banks.
Privatize Japan Post.
Growth Strategy
Boost employment through improving access to childcare by
easing the approval process for new facilities, raising the
mandatory retirement age, and introducing a new, more
flexible labor contract that gradually increases employment
protection.
Raise productivity through regional integration by joining the
Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP).
Promoting startups and restructuring SMEs by shortening the
time limit on public credit guarantees and giving some
preference for guarantees given to businesses in new
growth areas, and establishing asset management
companies to purchase distressed loans.

Policy Actions
The government passed supplementary budgets in 2011
to finance reconstruction spending, totaling 4 percent of
GDP, about 2/3 of which is to be financed by temporary
tax measures and 1/3 by expenditure reduction and non
tax revenues.
The government plans to double the consumption tax
rate to 10 percent by 2015 and submitted a tax reform bill
to the Diet at end March 2012. The bill was passed in the
Lower House of the Diet in late June 2012.
The government decided last year to cut the corporate
tax rate by 5 percentage points to 35 percent in FY2012,
though the special corporate tax for reconstruction is
added on to the rate until FY2014.
The government submitted a bill on the Social Security
and Tax Number System to the diet last February.

The BoJ adopted a medium to long-run price stability
goal of 1 percent for the time being and expanded its
Asset Purchase Program by ¥ 30 trillion (6% GDP) since
July 2011 to ¥70 trillion. The BoJ expanded private asset
purchases and the duration of the targeted JGBs (from 1–
2 years to 1–3 years). In addition, the BOJ extended its
loan facility to “Strengthen the Foundations of Growth,”
and introduced a special facility covering earthquake
related regions.
Measures on SME Financing facilitation were extended
one year, and special credit guarantees remain in place.
The FSA is focusing on strengthening risk management to
boost bank profitability.
The BoJ set up a new line of credit for asset-based
lending to encourage such lending.
The government intends to keep a one-third share in
Japan Post Holdings while selling the remaining twothirds as soon as possible.
The authorities plan to improve childcare services,
including by increasing childcare centers and providing
public financial support to small-scale childcare services.
They also highlighted job training and matching efforts to
raise employment of the young and elderly.
The authorities announced their intention to enter into
consultations toward participating in the TPP
negotiations.
SME restructuring. The authorities were generally
supportive of reforming the credit guarantee system.
However, altering the system would be difficult given the
need to promote reconstruction. They also supported
establishing asset management companies to facilitate
bank-led restructuring of earthquake related distressed
loans, but would first need to evaluate the scale of the
distressed loan problem.

August 4, 2011, by purchasing 4.5 trillion yen
worth of U.S. dollars, and second between
October 31 and November 4, 2011 by
purchasing 9.1 trillion yen worth of U.S. dollars.
The Ministry of Finance publishes foreign
exchange intervention information on its
website.The exchange system is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions,
with the exceptions of restrictions imposed
solely for the preservation of national or
international security that have been notified
to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board
Decision No. 144-(52/51).

assessment of its AML/CFT framework against
the AML/CFT standard by the Financial Action
Task Force (FATF) and the Asia/Pacific Group
(APG) in 2008. The mutual evaluation report
highlights significant deficiencies, notably with
respect to customer due diligence
requirements, the criminalization of terrorist
financing and the freezing of terrorist assets.
Japan reported to the FATF in 2010, 2011 and
2012 that measures are being taken to address
some of the deficiencies identified in its 2008
mutual evaluation report.
IX. Article IV Consultation:
The 2011 Article IV consultation discussions
were held during May 30–June 8, 2011; the
Executive Board discussed the Staff Report

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation
with Japan
On July 25, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Japan.1
Background
The Japanese economy has shown remarkable resilience and adaptability in the aftermath of
the March 2011 Great East Japan earthquake. In addition to the devastating human toll and
destruction, businesses and households had to grapple with disruptions to supply-chains,
reductions in electricity supply, and spillovers from severe floods in Thailand in late 2011, which
impacted Japan’s export sector.
Real GDP contracted by ¾ percent in 2011, because of the earthquake and Thai floods, but a
recovery is now underway. Real GDP grew at a brisk pace of 4¾ percent (seasonally adjusted
annual rate) in the first quarter boosted by reconstruction spending, a pickup in private
consumption, and inventory rebuilding. Headline inflation was negative at -0.2 percent (year-onyear) in June and core inflation, excluding food and energy, was also negative at -0.6 percent
(year-on year).

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The trade balance moved into deficit in 2011 (1/3 percent of GDP), the first annual deficit
recorded since 1980. Exports were impacted by the supply chain disruptions, weak global
demand and an appreciation of the yen. At the same time, imports have risen, driven by
reconstruction spending and higher energy costs following the closure of most nuclear power
plants. The trade balance remained in deficit in early 2012, but the current account balance
continued to record a surplus of about 1½–2 percent of GDP in 2011 and early 2012, because
of sizable investment income earnings.
The recent turmoil in Europe has led to a flight to safety and impacted Japanese financial
markets. Since mid-2011, equity prices have declined by about 15 percent and yields on 10year Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) have fallen to near historic lows of 70-80 basis
points. Over the same period, the yen has appreciated by about 8 percent in nominal effective
terms.
The Japanese economy is expected to expand by almost 2½ percent in 2012 helped by
substantial public reconstruction spending of around 1½ percent of GDP and recovering
consumer demand. Weak external demand is likely to weigh on exports and private investment.
The recovery is forecast to slow in 2013 to 1½ percent, as reconstruction winds down. Over the
medium-term, growth is expected to converge to around 1 percent as Japan’s aging population
slows potential growth.
Japan’s fiscal deficit is set to increase to about 10 percent of GDP in 2012, while the structural
primary deficit will rise slightly to 7½ percent of GDP. In an important step toward medium-term
fiscal consolidation, the Lower House of the Diet approved a tax bill in late June that would
increase the consumption tax to 8 percent in April 2014 and 10 percent in October 2015. The
Upper House is now considering the bill. If implemented and added to already planned
expenditure measures, the overall reduction in the structural fiscal deficit would be about
5 percent of GDP over the next decade.
The Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) recent actions strengthened its policy framework and supported the
recovery. The adoption in February of a medium to long-term price stability goal of 1 percent
has helped clarify the objective of monetary policy. In addition, the BoJ expanded its Asset
Purchase Program by ¥15 trillion this year in two steps and extended the maturity of JGB
purchases from 1–2 years to 1–3 years. Together with earlier commitments this is a sizeable
monetary expansion, totaling about 5 percent of GDP over the next year.
The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update found that important steps have
been taken to strengthen the financial system since the last assessment in 2003. In particular,
financial regulation and supervision has been effective in encouraging the large banks and
insurance companies to strengthen their capital positions and resilience to shocks. As a result,
while the global financial crisis, earthquake and spillovers from the Thai floods led to significant
economic disruptions, the impact on financial stability was limited.

3
Looking ahead, the FSAP stress tests suggest that in the near term banks and insurers would
be resilient to severe economic distress and moderate market shocks. However, the key
challenges financial institutions face in safeguarding financial stability are to raise profitability in
a low growth environment, while managing risk associated with their JGB and equity holdings.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, despite a worsening of the global outlook, the Japanese
economy is recovering, helped by reconstruction activity and private consumption. Directors
saw risks to the outlook tilted to the downside and primarily stemming from the possibility of a
further escalation of the crisis in Europe and a sharper than expected slowing of the Chinese
economy. Directors agreed that, beyond the short term, the main challenge is to reduce the
public debt burden in an environment of low growth and address continued deflation and the
impact of a rapidly aging population.
Directors stressed that reducing the public debt burden is a key policy priority and requires
sustained fiscal consolidation over the next decade. They welcomed passage by the Lower
House of the Diet of legislation to double the consumption tax rate to 10 percent by 2015, and
agreed that targeted transfers to lower income groups could be considered to address the
regressive nature of the tax. Directors also noted that additional fiscal consolidation measures,
designed so as to limit any adverse impact on growth, would be needed beyond 2015 to put the
public debt ratio firmly on a downward path. Of particular importance will be pension reform to
contain social security spending while balancing inter generational equity.
Directors underscored the importance of speedy implementation of far reaching structural
reforms to raise growth. Given the rapidly aging population, policies aimed at increasing
employment of women and older workers and facilitating immigration could have a large payoff.
Directors also saw scope for productivity improvements by easing regulation of the agriculture
and services sectors. Participation in additional free trade agreements would also help in this
regard.
Directors commended the Bank of Japan for the conduct of monetary policy during the past
year and the adoption of a 1 percent inflation goal. They generally supported further monetary
easing as part of a comprehensive package of policies to defeat deflation, particularly if the
growth outlook worsens, while acknowledging that the effectiveness of further easing is limited
in the very low interest rate environment. Directors also underscored the importance of
improved communication of policy intentions.
Directors took note of staff’s view that Japan’s external position is moderately weaker than that
consistent with medium term fundamentals and desirable policies. They considered that Japan
should continue to allow the exchange rate to be market determined, although intervention
could be used to counter volatile or disorderly market conditions.

4
Directors agreed with the findings of the recent Financial Sector Stability Assessment Update.
They noted that the financial system is stable and resilient to severe economic stress and
moderate market shocks. However, banks’ low profitability and large holdings of Japanese
government securities raise some concerns and should be monitored closely.
To safeguard financial sector stability, Directors saw scope to strengthen further systemic risk
monitoring and to improve the prudential framework, including by tightening large exposure
limits on bank lending, raising capital requirements for domestic oriented banks, and basing the
assessment of insurance companies’ solvency on a more refined economic valuation. Directors
also saw room to strengthen the crisis resolution framework for systemically important nonbank
financial institutions. Directors encouraged reforms to promote more market based credit
intermediation, including through a reduced role of government, to enhance the role of the
financial sector in supporting growth.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
