STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 14, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. The global financial crisis exposed significant external and internal
vulnerabilities, reflected in sharply lower growth. Sustained implementation of sound
macroeconomic policies and broad-based structural reforms is needed to complete
Serbia’s transition to robust growth and a stable macroeconomy.
Fiscal policy. Sizable medium-term fiscal adjustment is required to put public finances
on a sustainable footing. Without additional measures, the deficit would exceed
8 percent of GDP in 2013, significantly higher than budgeted. Additional measures
should thus be legislated in a supplemental 2013 budget to maintain a broadly neutral
fiscal stance this year. The adjustment should be buttressed by strengthening public
financial management (PFM).
Monetary policy. The inflation-targeting (IT) framework should be preserved. The
National Bank of Serbia (NBS) should gradually reduce the gap between the key policy
rate and the average reverse repo rate—the rate at which it absorbs liquidity—to send a
consistent signal about the monetary policy stance. Further easing of monetary
conditions should be kept on hold until fiscal adjustment is firmly on track.
Financial sector policy. The banking sector is broadly stable. Addressing the high stock
of nonperforming loans (NPLs) should help support credit growth. A viable business plan
for state-owned banks needs to be developed to address weaknesses in some banks.
Structural reforms. Sustained implementation of structural reforms—notably of public
enterprises, labor markets, and the business environment—is needed to bolster the
export sector and job creation, and raise potential growth.

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

CONTEXT
1.
Serbia's transition to a sustainable growth model and stable macroeconomy is
incomplete. Market-based reforms only began since 2000, nearly a full decade behind New
Member States (NMS) of the EU. Strong growth was achieved at the expense of a buildup of internal
and external imbalances (Figure 1), and many essential reforms remained unfinished. The global
financial crisis exposed Serbia’s unsustainable growth model and its key vulnerabilities: (i) an
overreliance on the nontradable sector, (ii) weak domestic savings and excessive external borrowing,
(iii) widespread euroization, and (iv) high and volatile inflation.
2.
While significant external adjustment has taken place in recent years, key economic
challenges remain. Robust growth has not taken off and economic activity is below pre-crisis levels
amid widespread structural rigidities. Unemployment of well over 20 percent is a major social
concern (Figure 2). Achieving low and stable inflation continues to be difficult. Fiscal and external
imbalances are large due to incomplete adjustment, partly reflecting uneven policy implementation
(Figure 3 and Box 1). This makes Serbia especially susceptible to shocks.
Box 1. Implementation of Past Fund Advice
While the authorities have actively engaged in policy dialogue with the Fund, implementation of
Fund advice has been uneven.

Fiscal policy. Prudent public wage and pension indexation rules were enacted in line with Fund
advice, but little progress was made in containing government employment and ad-hoc increases in public
wages. A pension reform passed in 2010 was less ambitious than initially designed. As a result, the mediumterm targets (in relation to GDP) for public wages and pensions set in 2010 are now well out of reach, and
key debt and deficit legal rules under the new fiscal responsibility framework, which was developed with
staff’s assistance, were breached in 2011-12.

Monetary and financial sector policy. In line with staff’s advice, the NBS embraced and improved its
relatively recent IT framework, including by forcefully reacting to deviations from the tolerance band,
streamlining reserve requirements, and encouraging “dinarization.” While staff’s advice for prudent
provisioning and liquidity buffers has been largely heeded, that for improving governance in small and
medium-sized domestic banks was not. Bottlenecks to NPL resolution that were pointed out by staff are
being addressed, albeit with some delay.

NBS independence. In line with staff’s advice, the authorities took steps towards restoring NBS
autonomy that was eroded as a result of amendments to the NBS Law in August 2012. They revoked an
amendment requiring parliamentary approval of NBS By-Laws, instituted changes aimed at staggering the
appointments of NBS officials, and improved access to courts for dismissed officials.

Structural reforms. Staff advice focused on (i) simplifying the business environment (some progress
was made in the area of product markets, but not labor markets), and (ii) privatization and reform of public
enterprises (stalled, partly because of weak financial environment for asset sales).

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
After a modest recovery in 2010–11, the economy slipped back into recession in 2012.
The contraction of 1¾ percent was due to extreme weather shocks, the suspension of operations of
a major steel plant, and weaknesses in euro area and regional activity. Yet CPI inflation of
12¼ percent at year-end well exceeded the NBS tolerance band, owing to a spike in food prices and
lagged effects of dinar depreciation, and the current account deficit widened to 10½ percent of GDP
in 2012. This, together with lower financial account inflows, led to a loss of foreign currency reserves
of almost 10 percent relative to end-2011 (Figure 4).

5.
Monetary policy tightening strived to compensate for fiscal slippages. A deterioration
in market confidence, strong dinar depreciation (13 percent in the first 8 months of 2012), and
inflationary pressures in the first half of 2012 prompted repeated NBS foreign exchange (FX)
interventions and monetary policy tightening (a 225 basis points increase in the key policy rate from
June 2012 to February 2013 and changes to reserve requirements). This has contributed to a
slowdown in domestic credit to the private sector, thus hampering the short-term recovery
(Figure 5).
6.
A better external financing environment improved market confidence (Figure 6). This
facilitated issuance of several Eurobonds and attracted large inflows into domestic dinar securities,
which reversed depreciation pressures from September 2012. Later in the year, the NBS resumed
mopping up excess dinar liquidity. Dinar appreciation pressures intensified through early May,
prompting NBS FX interventions.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
The authorities and staff agreed on the near-term outlook. GDP growth is expected to
reach 2 percent this year due to a rebound of agriculture and the successful launch of automobile
production by Fiat in 2012. Inflation is set to decelerate to 5 percent by year-end, below the upper
limit of the NBS’s inflation tolerance band (fixed at 4 +/–1½ percent) as base effects dissipate and
domestic demand remains weak.
8.

3 and Selected Issues Paper “External

investment inflows, leading to wider risk premia, exchange rate pressures and a drawdown of
reserves. Thus, potential growth would be limited to about 3 percent. Higher global risk aversion
would exacerbate external financing risks and lead to a faster drawdown of reserve buffers.



Rebalancing macroeconomic policies would improve the economic outlook. In the illustrative
adjustment scenario, sizeable fiscal consolidation would temporarily constrain GDP growth
(Figure 7, and Table 7). However, reducing macroeconomic imbalances and implementing
structural reforms would give rise to a virtuous circle of falling interest rates, lower exchange
rate volatility, a resumption of credit growth, increased FDI inflows, improved competitiveness,
and a higher long-run growth potential. The current account deficit would decline gradually to
sustainable levels.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: ACHIEVING MACROECONOMIC
STABILITY AND SUSTAINED GROWTH
Article IV discussions focused on rebalancing the policy mix by launching durable fiscal
adjustment and structural reforms needed to restore external sustainability and improve
Serbia’s growth potential.

A. Fiscal Policy: Restoring Public Debt Sustainability
9.
The authorities and staff agreed that the original 2013 budget target was out of reach.
The authorities pointed to lower-than-expected revenues across the board reflecting a still-soft
economy (affecting CIT and VAT), increased evasion on tobacco excises, and lower nontax revenues.
Staff also attributed the fiscal deterioration to weaker tax collection efforts, the impact of rushed
new tax legislation (e.g., a tax amnesty and several VAT breaks) that likely dented compliance, and
new unbudgeted spending initiatives, including direct government support to state enterprises and
road infrastructure projects. Payment of called guarantees and state-owned bank resolution costs
added to expenditure pressures. Without additional measures, staff projected the general
government deficit to widen to 8¾ percent of GDP, well beyond the authorities’ revised projection
of 6 percent of GDP. In staff’s view, additional fiscal risks stem from the planned issuance of
guarantees, the likely assumption of debt of several public enterprises, and other quasi-fiscal
operations. The authorities acknowledged some of the identified expenditure risks but were
confident that discretionary controls (discussed below) would be effective in containing spending
pressures. They also emphasized that the Budget System Law’s definition of the deficit excludes
bank resolution costs, arrears clearance, and the repayment of debt on called guarantees, and thus
helps explain the Ministry of Finance and Economy’s (MOFE) lower deficit projection.
10.
The authorities are introducing additional consolidation measures of some 1 percent
of GDP to contain the fiscal slippage in 2013. The government proposed broadly revenue neutral
wage tax and pension contribution rate adjustments that incentivize expenditure cuts at the local
government (LG) level (½ percent of GDP)1, and additional discretionary expenditure cuts of
1

This measure reduces LG’s wage tax revenues, thus incentivizing them to reduce spending given their limited ability
to borrow. Staff included these savings in their projections as this reform was legislated in May.

½ percent of GDP. Staff viewed the package as a significant step in the right direction (despite some
implementation risks), but called for further measures of 1 percent of GDP to achieve at least a
broadly neutral fiscal stance in structural terms in 2013, to be quickly legislated in a supplementary
budget. The authorities did not preclude the possibility of additional measures, but were inclined to
defer the supplementary budget until September arguing that the need for further policy action
could be assessed more precisely at that time.

For the medium term, there was agreement that sustained structural fiscal
consolidation was essential, but views differed on its size and pace. In staff’s view, absent
substantial additional adjustment, fiscal deficits would remain above sustainable levels and the trend
increase in public debt would not be halted, let alone reversed (Table 2). Staff’s illustrative
adjustment scenario suggests that cumulative fiscal measures of at least 5½ percent of GDP over
2014–2016 would be needed to put public debt on a downward path, reduce the overall fiscal deficit
under 3 percent by 2016, and return the debt stock to the end-2012 level by 2018 (Table 7). The
authorities regarded such consolidation as infeasible and instead emphasized faster economic
growth (underpinned by structural reform) and privatization receipts as the means to reduce public
debt. In the medium term, the authorities intend to stabilize debt below 60 percent of GDP, but
recognized the need for additional buffers and thus a lower debt ratio in the longer term. The
authorities stressed that the previous objective of reducing public debt below 45 percent of GDP by
2020 was not attainable, but indicated no immediate plans to change the legal debt ceiling. Staff
argued that public debt of 60 percent of GDP is too high as it would leave Serbia highly exposed to
adverse shocks, and saw the 45 percent of GDP debt target as an appropriate long-term anchor
beyond 2020.

12.
Curbing the sizeable spending on public wages and pensions was seen as key to fiscal
adjustment. Staff noted that given the rapid escalation of public wages in the past two years, a
multi-year freeze had the potential to yield meaningful and durable savings (Box 4), although
nominal wage cuts should not be ruled out given the magnitude of needed fiscal adjustment. In
addition, staff indicated that public sector employment needs to be strictly controlled and
discretionary bonuses eliminated. The authorities explained that wage and pension freezes were not
feasible, citing concerns about already weak domestic demand and possible social tensions. They,
however, indicated a willingness to consider revising the legal indexation formula by linking public
wage growth to one-half of the private wage bill growth. In their view, such a formula could deliver
fiscal savings while gradually reducing the excess of public over private wage levels. Staff cautioned
against rushed changes to the indexation methodology and recommended a temporary
suspension/modification of the existing mechanism pending more in depth analysis. Staff also
argued for ambitious parametric reforms to contain Serbia’s oversized public pension bill (Selected
Issues Paper “Pension Reform”). The authorities plan to very gradually increase the retirement age
by 2 years for men and women respectively, but were non-committal to staff’s recommendations to
unify retirement conditions for men and women and introduce meaningful actuarial penalties for
early retirement.

Staff stressed the overriding importance of expenditure control in all areas.
Expenditures that merit rationalization include agricultural subsidies, inefficient subsidy programs
(e.g., credit subsidies), and those social assistance benefits that are poorly targeted. The authorities
considered agricultural and economy subsidies an integral part of their economic revitalization
strategy and thus saw little scope for their reduction. Staff also recommended additional efforts to
reverse the amendments to the 2011 LG financing reform (Figure 8, Box 5, and Selected Issues Paper
“Has Sub-National Spending Added to Fiscal Pressures?”) beyond what the May wage/pension tax
rate reform package delivered. Staff advocated phasing out issuance of new guarantees, which have
a large role in public debt dynamics, and accelerating PFM reforms to underpin expenditure-based
adjustment and limit fiscal risks (Box 2).

The authorities and staff agreed that, given the already high tax burden, revenue
measures should concentrate on broadening the tax base. Staff advised eliminating numerous
costly tax exemptions and allowances (Selected Issues Paper “Corporate Income Tax and Other
Corporate Taxes”), streamlining items that qualify for the lower VAT rate, and eliminating VAT
refunds on the first purchase of residential property. While the scope for tax rate increases is limited,
the reduced VAT rate could be increased from 8 to 10 percent in line with the last year’s increase in
the headline rate, although this would have social implications given the large weight of food
among the goods subject to the 8 percent rate. Furthermore, improvements in tax administration
should address the recent unanticipated weakness in revenue collection. The authorities expressed a
commitment to strengthen tax administration and improve tax compliance in line with the
recommendations of a recent IMF technical assistance, including by streamlining the organizational
structure of Tax Administration, phasing in a modern compliance risk management approach, and
upgrading information technology systems.

The NBS affirmed its commitment to price stability. The authorities concurred with staff
that the IT framework was the most appropriate for Serbia. They indentified several factors that
explain inflation volatility since adopting the full-fledged IT regime in 2009, including: (i) large
pass-through from periodic depreciation bouts; (ii) exceptionally high euroization that weakens the

16.
The NBS saw some room for relaxing monetary conditions given the unbalanced
policy mix and weak economy. The NBS considered the elevated level of liquidity as supportive of
credit growth. Staff advised caution in relaxing monetary policy (i.e., reducing the average reverse
repo rate) until fiscal consolidation firmly takes hold, provided that capital inflows continue and
monthly inflation subsides as expected. If capital outflow risks and depreciation pressures
re-emerge, the NBS should promptly mop up excess dinar liquidity by stepping up auction volumes.
The NBS agreed with staff that the gap between the key policy rate and the average reverse repo

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

rate sent an uncertain signal about the monetary policy stance and should be gradually eliminated
(Figure 10). The NBS nevertheless reduced both the key policy rate and the reverse repo rate by
50 basis points in May, thus effectively easing monetary policy. Staff voiced concerns that relaxing
monetary conditions appeared premature whereas the NBS believed that this was consistent with
bringing inflation back to the IT band by year-end.

C. Financial Sector: Preserving Stability and Reviving Credit Growth
17.
The authorities and staff considered the banking system as stable overall, despite
weaknesses in some public banks. Capitalization and liquidity indicators of the banking system are
high, and NPLs are well-provisioned,

The authorities agreed with staff that financial sector policies should aim to reduce
banking system vulnerabilities and address structural impediments to credit growth. While
dominated by subsidiaries of euro area banks, Serbia’s banking sector has been less impacted by
deleveraging than other European peers (Box 6

priorities:

Addressing the high stock of NPLs. The authorities have already implemented several
measures to address the legacy NPL stock by avoiding taxation of restructured debt, setting up a
legal framework for voluntary corporate debt restructuring, and allowing sales of corporate NPLs
to nonbank entities. They noted progress in NPL resolution, especially through the use of new
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

(pre-pack) procedures under the bankruptcy law. The Belgrade Forum (March 2013) held under
the auspices of the Vienna-2 Initiative provided further suggestions, such as improving the
broader judicial system, promoting out-of-court debt workouts, and clarifying creditor classes in
bankruptcy procedures and creditor rights under the mortgage law. Staff agreed that efforts
should focus on reducing remaining bottlenecks.


Implementing a comprehensive strategy of dinarization. The NBS and staff were of the view
that deepening local currency financial markets and fostering institutions operating in these
markets (pension funds and insurance companies) would increase demand for dinar assets and
encourage dinarization. The NBS also emphasized the need for the involvement of other
government agencies to successfully implement the strategy.



Maintaining strong prudential policies. While Serbia’s regulatory provision-to-NPL ratio is
very high (Figure 11), it partly reflects the exclusion of some classified assets (such as off-balance
sheet items) from the definition of NPLs. Thus, staff saw the need to preserve these vital safety
cushions to guard against the resurgence of financial stress. On the other hand, NBS believed
that tight prudential policies have contributed to high lending rates, thereby exacerbating
constraints to credit growth. Staff advised against changes to the asset classification and
provisioning framework pending results of its careful examination.

D. Structural Reform: Strengthening Competitiveness and Growth
19.
The authorities recognized the need to address significant bottlenecks to private
sector activity and competitiveness stemming from the delayed transition to a market
economy. They agreed with staff on the need to improve non-price competitiveness, address
longstanding labor market impediments, and reduce the large number of extensively subsidized and
protected state and socially owned enterprises (SOEs). They pointed out that the medium-term fiscal
strategy published at end-2012 outlined structural reforms needed to achieve robust and
sustainable growth (Figure 12, Table 9, and Selected Issues Papers “In Search of an Effective Growth
Model” and “External Competitiveness Assessment”). Staff welcomed these plans, but noted that
implementation has yet to firmly take off. The authorities replied that many of these reforms are
difficult and require broad-based support. Staff acknowledged these challenges and the short-term
cost of reforms, but urged their steadfast implementation to unlock potential growth.


Labor market reforms. Staff urged reforms to foster private sector job creation and tackle
persistently high unemployment (Selected Issues Paper “Improving the Labor Market:
Challenges and Options”), particularly removing disincentives for hiring and making wage
bargaining and employment procedures more flexible, delinking severance payments from
lifetime employment, and relaxing restrictions on the separation process, which would in turn
improve incentives for hiring. Staff also cautioned against minimum wage increases that outpace
productivity growth and consequently exacerbate the already high youth unemployment (now
at 51 percent). The authorities are setting up a working group to prepare amendments to the
Labor Law that would revisit the length of fixed-term contracts, employment termination

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

procedures, severance pay, payroll calculation procedures, and other administrative burdens for
employers.


Regulatory reforms. The authorities concurred that Serbia’s rigid business environment hampers
foreign investment and needs an urgent overhaul. Staff recognized the recent steps to improve
the complex regulatory framework, such as the reduction of parafiscal fees, but advised further
progress. Policy priorities include simplifying business laws and regulations, strengthening the
regulatory impact analysis of new legislation, streamlining fees and charges, modernizing tax
and customs administration, effectively implementing the anti-corruption framework, as well as
land and real estate reform.



Public enterprise reform. The authorities recognized the need to reduce excessive state-directed
intervention in public enterprises, which strains public finances (direct state support to SOEs is
estimated at 2½ percent of GDP over 2010–11), and crowds out private sector activity. Jointly
with the World Bank, they are preparing a comprehensive plan to privatize and corporatize
SOEs and improve transparency of their operations. This includes divesting of SOEs that are
currently in the portfolio of the Privatization Agency, and finding strategic partners or divesting
of a number of large commercial SOEs. Staff clarified that the process should be accompanied
by strict wage and employment policies in SOEs based on performance criteria, and a gradual
increase of utility tariffs to cost recovery levels. Staff welcomed these plans and the potential
future fiscal savings through lower subsidies and guarantees, but advised proper budgetary
planning of transitory costs associated with severance payments and the assumption of some
SOE debt by the government.

STAFF APPRAISAL
20.
Serbia’s economy is recovering from recession but faces multiple challenges. The
successful launch of Fiat production in 2012 is contributing to growth this year and inflation is
declining. Yet, unemployment is high and the large 2013 fiscal deficit will further exacerbate the
already high public debt. Potential growth is constrained by multiple structural hurdles resulting
from unfinished structural reforms—the business environment is not conducive to investment and
the unreformed parts of the economy continue to drain public resources. The outlook is subject to
external risks, particularly as higher global risk aversion could raise the cost of financing and erode
reserve buffers.
21.
Progress towards EU accession creates an opportunity to tackle these challenges.
Rebalancing the policy mix and launching a comprehensive package of structural reforms are critical
to unlocking Serbia’s growth potential. Taking advantage of favorable market conditions could
lessen the contractionary short-term effects of adjustment and reform. This would allow Serbia to
realize the significant potential for convergence towards EU income levels.
22.
Sustained and sizeable fiscal consolidation in the near and medium term is needed to
repair public finances. In 2013, fiscal measures of 1½ percent of GDP—in addition to what has

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

already been legislated and included in the unchanged policy scenario—are needed to maintain at
least a neutral budgetary stance. In the medium term, achieving a much lower public debt ratio
should be the overarching policy objective. The emphasis of adjustment should be on reducing
mandatory spending, including by freezing pensions and wages, a far-reaching parametric pension
reform, and public employment rationalization. Progress on a vast agenda of PFM reforms is crucial
for enhancing the credibility and quality of the expenditure-based adjustment. Improving tax
administration and reducing tax exemptions have the potential to supplement fiscal savings.
23.
The IT framework and flexible exchange rate should be preserved. A lower level of
inflation and reduced volatility would support dinarization and improve the monetary transmission
mechanism. Once the fiscal adjustment process is firmly on track, cautious monetary easing would
be appropriate provided inflation remains firmly on a downward trajectory and absent exchange
rate pressures. In that regard, the recent reduction of the average interest rate on reverse repo
operations—the main gauge of monetary conditions—appears premature. Meanwhile, the gap
between the key policy rate and the average reverse repo rate should be gradually reduced in order
to send consistent policy signals.
24.
Reviving credit growth and maintaining financial sector stability is essential for
economic recovery. Removing regulatory and tax hurdles are welcome steps that should help
resolve NPLs and pave the way for boosting private sector credit. Given an unsettled external
environment and downside risks, the current prudential standards should be preserved pending
further examination. Recent cases where state-owned bank resolution was required underscore the
need for careful supervision and a comprehensive strategy for public banks. In that regard, close
coordination between NBS, the MoFE, and the DIA would be important.
25.
Sustained progress on wide-ranging structural reforms would help unlock Serbia’s
growth potential. Priority areas include streamlining the regulatory framework and improving the
business environment, enhancing the functioning of the labor market, and restructuring of SOEs.
These reforms would help boost Serbia’s competitiveness and growth potential and accelerate
income convergence to EU levels.
26.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 2. Structural Fiscal Challenges
Serbia has a relatively weak track record of meeting its own fiscal deficit targets, both in the short
and long term. On average, those targets were exceeded by around 5 percent of GDP over a three-year
horizon, largely due to expenditure overruns, as opposed to revenue shortfalls. Slippages reflect electoral
cycles compounded by weak institutions. Fund-supported programs helped improve policy implementation,
but progress tended to be undone between program periods.

To improve policy implementation, Serbia’s fiscal framework needs to be strengthened in the
following areas: (i) decreasing the fragmentation of the budget process across time and the various parts of
the general government; (ii) introducing an effective multi-year orientation of spending policies;
(iii) improving the transparency of fiscal operations; (iv) strengthening external and internal audit procedures
and follow-up; (v) reducing recourse to quasi-fiscal operations; and (vi) reducing the dominance of
mandatory current spending, whose overruns cannot be fully offset by other items and crowd out more
productive investment spending.
PFM reform can also bolster the fiscal framework and help improve expenditure execution. Some
progress has been made in this area, such as the integration of own source accounts into the central
government budget, and the creation of a public employee register (to be finalized by June) as a first step
towards controlling public sector employment. Further PFM priorities, include: (i) integrating own-source
accounts of indirect budget beneficiaries into the budget process; ii) developing a system to
comprehensively monitor spending arrears and properly resolve their existing stock; (iii) improving
implementation of existing provisions of the Budget System law for screening and containing new
expenditure initiatives; (iv) introducing binding aggregate medium-term expenditure ceilings; (v) improving
the financial position of social security funds and the Road Fund, and more fully integrating them into the
budget process; (vi) strengthening fiscal coordination between central and local governments; (vii)
containing fiscal risks from the recent public-private partnership (PPP) law; (viii) imposing strict and
sustainable controls on the issuance of government guarantees; and (ix) strengthening debt management.

Box 3. External Sustainability Assessment
Serbia’s large current account deficit partially adjusted since the onset of the global crisis. Yet at
end-2012, the current account deficit was the highest in the region. Serbia’s low export base has been held
back by structural rigidities and a weak business environment, leading to a low share of FDI (particularly
greenfield) into tradable sectors. Recent IMF research suggests that the composition of FDI matters and
excessive inflows into nontradable sectors can contribute to external imbalances.1

Serbia’s ample reserves somewhat mitigate
the large external vulnerabilities. International
reserves are adequate, exceeding all standard
indicators of reserve coverage. They surpass the
recommended bounds of the IMF reserve
adequacy metric,2 recording the highest reserve
coverage in the region.
A fundamental change in policies is needed
to reduce external vulnerabilities and ensure

Under unchanged policies, staff
estimates that the real exchange rate appears
overvalued compared to medium-term
fundamentals in the absence of fiscal consolidation and meaningful structural reforms. The macro balance
(MB) and external sustainability (ES) approaches suggest overvaluation of 15–20 percent. High current
account deficits and lack of external financing due to negative confidence effects would gradually deplete
reserve buffers and put the international investment position on an unsustainable path.

In contrast, sustained policy efforts in staff’s illustrative adjustment scenario would help ensure
external sustainability, mitigate dinar overvaluation, preserve adequate reserve buffers, and reduce Serbia’s
net indebtedness to the rest of the world.

Box 4. Experience with Containing the Public Wage Bill
Serbia’s past experience with containing mandatory spending pressures has been mixed. Mandatory
spending—mainly public wage and pension expenditures—comprises ⅔ of consolidated government
expenditures and is therefore an important source of fiscal pressure. Serbia’s nominal public wage freeze
(2009–10) introduced at the onset of financial crisis succeeded in reducing the public wage bill by
0.3 percent of GDP over 2009–11—less than in most other emerging and advanced European economies. In
2012, Serbia’s public wage bill grew more rapidly than in the average European country, eliminating previous
consolidation gains.
Adherence to the indexation rule has been a challenge. In 2010, Serbia adopted a semi-annual CPI wageindexation mechanism (April/October) based on the previous 6-months inflation rate where the April wage
adjustment is augmented by half of real GDP growth in the previous year if positive. Although the indexation
rule was designed to trend the public wage bill down gradually over time in relation to GDP, wage bill
growth has consistently exceeded the percentage implied by the rule by a wide margin. This was due to
one-off increases (e.g. ad hoc wage bonuses) and a stubborn wage and employment drift. Furthermore, this
contributed to a sustained wedge between public and private sector wages.

Europe’s recent experience with wage austerity offers important policy insights for Serbia at the
current juncture. Meaningful reductions in public wage bills have been achieved primarily on the basis of
multi-year nominal public wage freezes and/or explicit upfront wage cuts. Measures to eliminate wage
bonuses and allowances, promotion freezes, and attrition rules have also been effective. In Serbia,
widespread public sector downsizing would exacerbate the already very high unemployment. However, a
temporary suspension of indexation can yield powerful savings as it contains both wage and pension
expenditures. An illustrative three-year nominal wage freeze is estimated to deliver cumulative fiscal
consolidation of around 1¾ percent of GDP. When combined with measures to eliminate wage drift over the
same period, potential savings increased to around 2½ percent of GDP. Additional fiscal savings could be
achieved if indexation measures were extended to pensions.

Consequently, Serbia's wage bill is among the highest in Europe.

Box 5. Local Government Spending
Fiscal decentralization can reduce the size of the public sector, but efficiency savings are not
necessarily assured. Savings do not materialize when decentralizations are financed primarily through
resource transfers and/or borrowing, as is the case in Serbia.1 This gives rise to vertical fiscal imbalances
(VFIs)—a gap between subnational spending and “own” revenues (excluding transfers and shared revenues
from central government)—that empirical studies associate with weaker expenditure discipline at the local
level. In Serbia, the past decade has seen a shift away from self-financed local government expenditure and
VFI’s have thus increased. Own source deficits of LGs averaged 5¼ percent of GDP over 2006–10, implying
that subnational operations have been a drag on overall public finances.
The 2011 amendments to the Law on Local Government Financing contributed to deterioration in the
general government deficit. The reform was motivated by a perceived need to compensate LGs for a
reduction in discretionary transfers during 2009–10.
Own Balance of by Level of Government
The main change was an increase in the LG share of

increase in Serbia’s VFI. The fiscal (and structural)
deterioration associated with the 2011 reform is estimated at around 30-40 billion dinars (1-1¼ percent of
GDP).
Rolling-back the 2011 decentralization reform merits consideration given overall fiscal consolidation
needs. The recently approved wage/pension tax rate reform aims to indirectly claw back a portion of the
revenues shared with LGs, but the estimated savings (½ percent of GDP) involve risks and are smaller than
those associated with a full repeal of 2011 amendments. Furthermore, decentralization reforms should be
complemented by targeted measures to improve fiscal outcomes at the LG level. Priorities include boosting
“own” revenues through property tax and service fee increases, scaling back large subsidies to municipal
public entities (by increasing fees to cost-recovery levels and/or measures to reduce operating costs), wage
and employment restraint, and better-targeting of subnational social assistance programs.

Box 6. Macro-Financial Linkages
Domestic credit to the private sector has been slowing down continuously from 2010. The 12-month
growth rate of private credit in early 2013 was close to zero and creates a drag on economic activity. The
slowdown has been associated with a weaker growth of domestic deposits and crowding out by the public
sector. Net foreign liabilities did not play a significant role, as they remained broadly stable.
Both supply and demand factors were important for the credit slowdown. In 2012, demand for credit
was affected by the recession. At the same time, the average interest rate on FX and FX-linked loans—that
constitute the bulk of lending in Serbia—fluctuated within a narrow band of 7–9 percent. This is consistent
with the demand for and supply of credit both changing simultaneously. Persistently high lending interest
rates despite a fall in credit demand suggest a rise in the risk premium and credit supply constraints.
Interest rates on bank loans in Serbia are higher than those in peer countries. This is partly explained by
the external risk premium (as there is a positive relationship between the EMBI spread and real lending
rates). However, the EMBI spread does not account for the entire difference in lending rates. Significant
lending risk, arising from the high share of NPLs, is priced in by banks, thus leading to tighter lending
standards. In addition, the strict required reserve ratio and prudential policies—needed to preserve financial
stability—add to the cost of credit.
Macroeconomic stabilization and reduced credit risk would help alleviate supply-side constraints and
accommodate a demand-driven increase in credit growth. Macroeconomic stabilization would reduce
external risk premia and the “crowding out” effect by the public sector, thereby providing scope for easing
monetary policy. Resolving the high stock of NPLs and thus repairing corporate and bank balance sheets
would reduce credit risk. These factors would reduce interest rates, making credit more affordable.

1/ For comparability, all indices normalized so that they range from 0 (lowest) to 100 (best).
2/ Country name and index of best performers among: Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary,
Latvia, Lithuania, FYR Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovak Republic, and Slovenia.
Country names are not shown for EBRD transition indicators due to the presence of multiple entries.
3/ Distance of Serbia from best performer for each index.
4/ As pointed out in an independent evaluation of the Doing Business survey (see www.worldbank.org/ieg/doingbusiness),
care should be exercised when interpreting these indicators given subjective interpretation, limited coverage of business
constraints, and a small number of informants which tend to overstate the indicators' coverage and explanatory power.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks.
Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the adjustment scenario and
scenario being presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the information is
used to project debt dynamics five years ahead.
3/The no policy change scenario reflects constant primary balance from 2013, and is different from the no policy
change scenario presented in the staff report.
4/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
5/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2013,
with real depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local
currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

 = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and  = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-(1+g(1+r1+g++g) times previous period debt stock. increases with an appreciating domestic currency (> 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Large negative values in the projection period reflects the drawdown of international reserves. The line also includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels

Safeguards Assessment: The latest safeguards assessment for the NBS has been completed
in December 2011. The assessment found that the NBS has implemented several
recommendations of the 2009 assessment that have further strengthened its financial
safeguards. Multi-year external auditor appointment has been introduced and an independent
external assessment of the internal audit function has been conducted. Governance has been
strengthened with the Council’s new role, which provides oversight of external and internal
audits, financial reporting, and the system of internal controls. The assessment recommended
improvements in external audit procedures, disclosures in financial statements, and data
compilation procedures. Subsequent to the assessment completion, amendments to the NBS
Law, which included inter-alia dismissal of the Council members, have raised concerns about
NBS autonomy. In line with staff’s advice, the authorities subsequently took steps towards
restoring NBS autonomy.
Exchange Arrangement: Serbia accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and
4, on May 15, 2002, and maintains a system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for
current international transactions, except with respect to blocked pre-1991 foreign currency
savings deposits (IMF Country Report No. 02/105). The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a
floating system since January 1, 2001. According to the 2009 Monetary Policy Program, the
National Bank of Serbia (NBS) implements a managed floating exchange rate regime.
Last Article IV Consultation: Concluded on March 31, 2010 (IMF Country Report No. 10/93).
FSAP Participation: Serbia participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program in 2005,
and the Executive Board discussed the Financial System Stability Assessment in February 2006
(IMF Country Report No. 06/96). An update under the Financial Sector Assessment Program
was conducted in 2009 and the Executive Board discussed the Financial System Stability
Assessment in March 2010 (IMF Country Report No. 10/147).

WORLD BANK GROUP RELATIONS
A. Partnership with Serbia’s Development Strategy
The World Bank has been discussing the policy reform agenda with successive governments, and has
been actively engaged with the new Government since winning a mandate and assuming office in mid2012. Support for the government’s development strategy from the World Bank and the IMF follow the
agreed upon division of responsibilities between the two institutions.
The Fund takes the lead on macroeconomic policies (fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate) aimed at
facilitating sustainable growth, while the Bank takes the lead on structural policy aimed at medium to
long-term adjustment. In areas of direct interest to the Fund, the Bank leads the policy dialogue in: (i)
public expenditure management; (ii) pension, health, and education; (iii) social safety net reform and the
monitoring of the impact of the crisis on the poor; and (iv) reforms with a bearing on the business
environment, including labor markets and the performance of publicly owned enterprises. The Bank and
the Fund have jointly led the policy dialogue in the financial sector.

The World Bank
Total IDA credits and grants committed to the Republic of Serbia (Serbia) by the Bank since 2001
amount to approximately $740 million, with an additional $846,5 million in IBRD commitments (as of
May 2013). The Bank has assisted Serbia to make progress against key objectives set out in the Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY12–15: (i) encouraging a more competitive economy; (ii) and improving
the efficiency and outcomes of social spending. The Government has made progress on these two
priorities with the support of World Bank financial and analytical products.
The CPS was discussed by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors on November 15, 2011. IBRD
financing during the first two years of the CPS was expected to amount to US$340 million. The
authorities requested total lending during the CPS period of US$800 million. The lending amount for the
final two years of the CPS is to be discussed with Bank management at the time of the CPS Progress
Report, scheduled for mid-CY13.
As of May 2013, Serbia has a portfolio of 7 Bank-supported projects under implementation with a total
commitment value of $670 million (including IDA, IBRD and GEF). Investment support focuses on (i)
transport and energy infrastructure aimed at encouraging regional integration and spurring economic
growth; (ii) agricultural, environment, and irrigation investments to improve production and help Serbia

meet EU standards; (iii) pension, education and health sector reform to strengthen the quality of service
and improve financial sustainability; (iv) strengthened land administration; (v) energy efficiency; and (vi)
regional development in the economically depressed former mining region of Bor. The Bank is also
preparing policy lending to enhance the contribution of the public enterprise sector to the
competitiveness of the Serbian economy.
IFC
As of April 2013, the IFC’s committed portfolio in Serbia was US$753 million in 25 projects. Equity
investments account for 9% of committed portfolio. IFC has significantly increased its financing in Serbia
in FY12-13. In FY12 IFC invested US$ 504 million (including mobilization) in 7 projects and in FY13 is
expected to invest $500 million (including mobilization) in 5 projects. In the financial sector, in FY12-13
IFC invested US$375 million at own account and mobilized about US$ 330 million through MIGA
supporting the banking sector to expand its financing to MSMEs, agribusiness, trade finance, and
housing sectors. Although the financial sector has been the focus, during FY12–13 IFC has also
increased its presence in the real sectors investing US$290 million. Through its investments IFC has
supported projects in the agribusiness sector, including in meat processing and juice production. Also,
to improve private companies’ competitiveness and their exports, IFC invested in one of the largest
private companies in Serbia with activities in agribusiness, manufacturing and mining. Also, IFC financed
a green-field metal stamping facility. In addition IFC invested about US$100 million in two regional
projects in the cement and insurance sectors, with operations in the Balkans including in Serbia. In
addition to providing financing, IFC is supporting Serbia through a number of advisory projects with
focus on Investment Climate, Corporate Governance and Renewable Energy/Energy Efficiency.
MIGA
As of May 2013, MIGA’s outstanding portfolio in Serbia consisted of 6 contracts of guarantee with total
gross exposure of $176 million. All but one project are in support of foreign banks' loans to their Serbian
subsidiaries, half of them in the aftermath of the 2008-09 global financial crisis. MIGA’s continuing
support to these projects signals the Agency’s efforts to continue to underwrite projects in Serbia,
encourage inward FDI, and add to the World Bank Group’s strategy of encouraging private sector
development in the country.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Economic statistics in Serbia have faced many challenges in recent years but data provision is broadly
adequate for surveillance. The statistical system has been successfully upgraded in recent years with the
assistance of the IMF1 and other bilateral and multilateral institutions. Although international standards
are not yet fully met, official data for all sectors are sufficiently good to support key economic analysis
and surveillance. In many areas, including monetary, balance of payments, and real sectors,
internationally accepted reporting standards have been introduced. A page for the Republic of Serbia
was introduced in the October 2006 issue of the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Serbia participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and its metadata were posted on
the IMF Data Dissemination Bulletin Board on May 1, 2009. The metadata identify plans for
improvement, which are being used to guide further progress.

A. Real Sector Statistics
The real sector data are compiled by the Statistical office of the Republic of Serbia (SORS). Annual and
quarterly nominal and volume measures of GDP by activity are available from 1997 onwards. Nominal
annual GDP estimates by expenditure are available from 1997, while the respective volume measures
estimates have been disseminated only starting with the data for 2003. Quarterly GDP estimates by
expenditure both at current prices and in volume measures are available from 2003 onwards.
The national accounts statistics of the Republic of Serbia are based on the conceptual framework of
1993 SNA/ESA 95. Work is progressing on the transition to the most updated international
recommendations of the 2008 SNA/ESA 2010. In the last two years significant methodological changes
were introduced in the compilation of volume measures of GDP as the SORS adopted a system of chainlinked volume measures, thus replacing the previous estimates with a fixed base. Also the scope of the
estimates were recently extended with the compilation of annual volume measures of GDP by
expenditures on final uses and the compilation of expenditure-based quarterly GDP, both at current
prices and in volume terms. These estimates were disseminated for the first time on March 29, 2013.
Procedures for the compilation of the estimates of annual GDP by production are in line with
internationally recommended practices. Estimates for achieving exhaustiveness in the production
account estimates are being produced with an adequate methodology and compiled at very detailed
levels.
Sources and method for the compilation of GDP by expenditures, are in general adequate but, the
adjustment to domestic household consumption expenditure for net expenditures of residents abroad
1

Recent examples of STA technical assistance missions include the SDDS assessment and the national accounts missions
of FY 2011, as well as national accounts missions in FY 2012 and FY 2013, respectively.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

differs from the corresponding estimates in the balance of payments compiled by the National Bank of
the Republic of Serbia (NBS) thus implying an internal inconsistency within GDP by expenditure.
Weaknesses in the estimates of gross fixed capital formation are due to the lack of coverage of the
unincorporated enterprises in the survey on investments, but starting in 2013 these enterprises are
included in the survey. Separate estimates of changes in inventories are disseminated from 2007.
Reconciliation between the independent annual GDP estimates based on the production and
expenditure approach is being made at aggregate levels, although the original differences are not
significant. The gap between the quarterly estimates of GDP by expenditure and GDP by production is
closed by a residual covering the statistical discrepancy plus changes in inventories and net acquisition
of valuables. There are no reliable independent estimates of changes in inventories on a quarterly basis.
The RSSO compiles and disseminates monthly indices for retail and consumer prices, producer prices,
industrial production, as well as unit-value indices for imports and exports. Concepts and methods used
to compile the CPI, introduced in 2007, as well as other price statistics, attempt to reflect international
standards and best practices.

B. Balance of Payments Statistics
Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the National Bank of Serbia (NBS). The compilation
procedures are generally appropriate; however, the source data for compiling various current account
transactions could be further improved. In particular, additional programs should be developed to
collect data to estimate unrecorded trade, travel, and private transfers (workers’ remittances).
The NBS has improved the source data for estimating transactions relating to direct investment by
conducting direct surveys of direct investment enterprises. However, there is a backlog of data to be
processed and direct investment transactions in the balance of payments statistics have not been
adjusted based on the survey data.
The staff levels are not commensurate with the statistical program and the NBS may face some difficulty
in conducting all the requisite data collection exercises and implementing the majority of the
recommendations if staffing is not increased.
Serbia reports balance of payments statistics to STA for publication in the IFS and the Balance of
Payments Statistics Yearbook.

C. Government Finance Statistics
Government finance statistics are compiled by the Ministry of Finance and reported on a monthly basis.
Principal data sources are the Republican Treasury and budgetary execution reports of the spending
ministries and first-level budget units.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

Since 2001, Serbia has made efforts to bring the existing budget reporting system in line with the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) methodology. Full compliance has yet to be
achieved as implementation of the new chart of accounts, generally consistent with the classifications of
the GFSM 2001, has not been completed. The classification of all expenditure of the “National
Investment Plan” as capital needs to be brought in line with international standards. While the data on
the clearance of arrears are available on a monthly basis, information on the accumulation of new
arrears is not available. The reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data is not conducted on a regular
basis.

D. Monetary and Financial Statistics
Monetary and financial statistics are compiled by the NBS, broadly following the methodology set forth
in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, 2000 (MFSM), and meeting the GDDS recommendations
with respect to periodicity and timeliness for financial sector data. Monetary data are reported to the
Fund using Standardized Report Forms.
Some improvements could still be made. The coverage of monetary statistics could be improved by
including banks in liquidation (as their data are not available on a timely or comparable, International
Accounting Standard-specified, basis).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Republic of Serbia
July 1, 2013
This statement provides information that has become available since the issuance of the
staff report. The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
The government has adopted a draft supplementary 2013 budget and proposed
legislation to reduce mandatory spending indexation in 2014. The draft budget—expected
to be enacted in early July—aims to generate savings of about 1 percent of GDP in 2013,
mainly through discretionary cuts in current expenditures (largely subsidies) and public
investment. For 2014, the government has proposed legislative changes to limit the annual
indexation of public wages and pensions to 1½ percent compared to staff calculations in the
unchanged policy scenario of 5½ and 4½ percent for wages and pensions respectively based
on the current indexation formula. Beyond 2014, wage indexation will be harmonized with
pensions. The 2013 package, however, is insufficient to achieve a neutral fiscal stance in
structural terms this year as recommended by staff, and, in staff’s view, the underlying
measures are of poor quality as they are largely one-off in nature and subject to significant
implementation risks that will likely compromise saving yields. On balance, the overall
package of proposed consolidation, while a step in the right direction, is by itself insufficient
to reverse the upward trend in the public debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term.
2.
The NBS has further eased monetary conditions despite market pressures. In
June, the NBS lowered the key policy rate by 25 basis points to 11 percent citing a better
inflation outlook, weak demand, and potential positive confidence effects from the planned
fiscal consolidation package. While moving to increase somewhat its operations to absorb
liquidity, the NBS has allowed the average repo rate—the true gauge of monetary
conditions—to also ease further. Meanwhile, pressures in the foreign exchange market have
intensified, in line with global market trends, with the dinar depreciating by about 3 percent
over the past month despite NBS foreign exchange sales of some €275 million (less than
3 percent of the reserve stock). In the same period, the EMBI spread for Serbia has widened
by 160 basis points and recent T-bill and bond auctions have been significantly
undersubscribed.
3.
The government has taken steps to advance selected structural reforms. An
action plan aimed at resolving formerly socially-owned enterprises that was developed with
support from the World Bank is expected to be adopted by the government on June 27. The
authorities also unveiled plans to accelerate privatization of a few public enterprises and
streamline procedures for construction permits. At the same time, while some labor market
reform is now envisaged by end-2013, pension reform is not included in the latest reform
package, reflecting a lack of broad-based social and political consensus.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 13/76
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 3, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Serbia
On July 1, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Serbia.1
Background
The Serbian economy is recovering from a recession but faces multiple challenges. Robust
growth in automotive exports is underpinning the recovery in 2013 and the double-digit inflation
is subsiding. However, unemployment well above 20 percent is a major social concern and
large fiscal and current account deficits constitute key vulnerabilities. Structural bottlenecks
continue to undermine overall competitiveness and constrain Serbia’s growth potential.
Despite some consolidation measures implemented in the second half of 2012, the general
government deficit rose to 7¾ percent of GDP in 2012 in part due to bank resolution costs,
clearance of arrears, and payments for called guarantees. As a result, public debt reached 62
percent of GDP at end-2012, well above the legal ceiling of 45 percent of GDP. The National
Bank of Serbia (NBS) tightened monetary policy to compensate for the fiscal slippage.
The favorable global financial markets situation since late 2012 eased Serbia’s financing and
balance of payments pressures, creating scope for a successful placement of several
Eurobonds and large foreign inflows into local government securities. This contributed to a
reduction of government yields and an appreciation of the exchange rate.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The financial system remains stable overall. Capitalization and liquidity indicators are high and
non-performing loans (NPLs) are well-provisioned despite their relatively high level. However,
there are pockets of vulnerabilities as two medium-sized public banks had to be recently
resolved. The significant euroization of the economy and the large stock of corporate NPLs
pose significant challenges as the balance sheet constraints hamper financial intermediation
and the economic recovery.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors concurred that strong policies are required to tackle long-standing
challenges facing the economy, recently exacerbated by the adverse external environment.
Priorities include sustained fiscal consolidation and a rebalancing of monetary policy to reduce
external and domestic vulnerabilities, and a comprehensive package of structural reforms to
unlock Serbia’s growth potential.
Directors agreed that reversing the rapid rise in the public debt-to-GDP ratio is key to
rebalancing the economy. They welcomed the effort embodied in the draft supplementary
budget and the authorities’ plans to reduce wage and pension indexation. Most Directors,
however, considered that additional measures are necessary. In particular, Directors
emphasized the need to contain the public sector wage bill and to undertake a comprehensive
pension reform. They also noted that improving tax administration and reducing tax exemptions
can contribute significantly to the consolidation effort, and called for more rapid progress on
public financial management reforms.
Directors concurred that the inflation targeting framework has served Serbia well, despite the
difficulties of implementing inflation targeting in an economy where the bulk of deposits and
loans are either in or linked to foreign currencies. They agreed that lower and less volatile
inflation would support a greater role for the dinar in domestic transactions and as a store of
value, and improve monetary transmission. Against this background, Directors noted that the
recent easing of monetary conditions may have been premature, and called on the central bank
to step up liquidity absorption to bring money market interest rates closer to the policy rate.
Directors agreed that room for additional monetary easing could open up only once fiscal
adjustment is well underway and exchange rate pressures subside.
Directors stressed the importance of maintaining financial sector stability and current prudential
standards. They considered that improvements in banks’ balance sheets are necessary to boost
private sector credit and support the economic recovery, and welcomed recent measures to
facilitate the resolution of non-performing loans. Directors also underscored the importance of
continued careful supervision and a comprehensive strategy to improve the management of
public banks.

3
Directors emphasized that more reforms are necessary to increase labor force participation,
reduce persistent unemployment, and improve competitiveness. Priority areas include labor
market reforms, streamlining regulations, and improving the business environment. Directors
also welcomed the authorities’ plans for restructuring state-owned enterprises.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mr. Dominik Radziwill and Mr. Vuk Djokovic on Republic of Serbia
July 1, 2013

On behalf of our Serbian authorities we would like to thank staff for useful discussions
during the IMF mission and for a broadly fair and objective report. The assessment points to
the moderate recovery of the Serbian economy. Some challenges have emerged, but our
authorities reiterate their commitment to address the issue of creating an investment friendly
environment and tackling the rising deficit. In this regard, the report adequately delineates
the delicate policy challenges that our authorities are facing.
On the political side, we would like to emphasize that Serbia has taken strategic steps
towards its future in the European Union by successfully reaching an agreement with Kosovo
to normalize mutual relations, paving the way for Serbia to begin negotiations with the
European Commission on full EU membership.
Outlook
Following the recession in 2012, this year Serbia’s economy is expected to grow by two
percent, driven by strong exports and a rebound in agriculture. In the first four months of
2013, the manufacturing recorded growth of five percent, while the exports increased by 25
percent. Our authorities consider that this reinvigorated growth, based on export-oriented
FDIs, is pivotal for reducing unemployment and balancing public finances. To attract high
quality FDIs, the government has put in place a set of supporting measures, including tax
exemptions and employment subsidies. In order to preserve this growth momentum, our
authorities are committed to underpin it with further structural reforms and an improved
business environment.
Fiscal policy
The policy priority of our authorities is to achieve fiscal sustainability and decrease public
debt, while also preserving social safety network. Cognizant of the unexpected
underperformance of revenues during the first half of the year, our authorities have taken
decisive measures aimed at addressing the rising deficit. This week the government approved
and submitted to parliament a supplementary budget which plans public spending cuts (e.g.,
mostly on subsidies, goods and services and other discretionary spending) by one percent of
GDP this year. Our authorities made a difficult decision in containing growth of public
wages and pensions. This is a particularly sensitive issue in Serbia if one bears in mind that
the pensions in Serbia are low and the purchasing power of the average pension has been
declining since 2009. Although wages and pensions will not be frozen in nominal terms, by
changing the indexation formula their growth will be limited well below projected inflation.
Moreover, in order to better control the sizable public sector wage bill, the Serbian

2
government is introducing the central registry of public employees, which will allow better
monitoring and controlling of new employment and promotions in the public sector.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
Monetary policy will continue to use inflation targeting to achieve low and stable inflation as
its main objective. After the spike in inflation caused by the rise of food prices in 2012,
inflation is gradually declining. The authorities expect that inflation will revert by October to
the projected target range of between 2.5 to 5.5 percent. As the inflation expectations are
declining—notably from an elevated level—the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) is continuing
to ease its monetary stance, and the policy rate was recently lowered to 11 percent. In order
to strengthen the inflation targeting framework and to allow for better monetary transmission
mechanisms, the NBS is continuously working to promote de-euroization of Serbia.
The NBS continues to be committed to the managed floating exchange rate regime. The dinar
recently depreciated against the euro as a consequence of capital outflows. However, similar
trends have been observed in numerous emerging countries. Earlier this year, the NBS
intervened in the foreign exchange market, to prevent excessive daily volatility in the
relatively shallow market. Under usual metrics, the NBS foreign exchange reserves remains
robust.
Financial sector
Overall, Serbia’s financial sector is stable, well capitalized and profitable. The share of nonperforming loans is high, however those are well provisioned. In order to preserve
confidence and financial sector stability, the government took decisive measures to address
weaknesses in two mismanaged state owned banks. The resolution of those banks came at
significant fiscal cost. Our authorities are determined to preserve financial sector stability by
continuing to closely monitor the banking system, strengthen prudential supervision, and
improve corporate governance.
Structural reforms
Lastly, our authorities are steadfastly working to improve the investment climate in order to
attract FDIs. Among other measures, our authorities are drafting the new urbanism and
construction law, which is expected to streamline and simplify the process to obtain building
permits and reduce red tape in the construction sector. Furthermore, with support from the
World Bank, our government has approved the Action Plan for disposition of enterprises in
restructuring, which envisages the resolution by sale or bankruptcy of 175 socially owned
enterprises.
