STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 26, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. Since the mid-2000s, macroeconomic stability supported by high world
commodity prices and active social policies have contributed to nearly tripling income
per capita and reducing poverty in Bolivia. Prudent fiscal policies allowed saving a
sizable portion of the hydrocarbon revenue windfall, improving the resilience of the
economy to adverse external shocks. Reflecting this, Bolivia was one of few countries in
Latin America that sustained positive growth during the global crisis of 2008–09 and
weathered well the recent regional slowdown.
Recent developments and outlook. Real GDP growth is projected at 6.7 percent in
2013, the highest growth rate of the last thirty years and is expected to remain above
potential in 2014. Downside risks from weaker activity in trading partners or lower world
hydrocarbon prices have increased, but a strong external position and sizable
international reserves provide ample buffers.
Macroeconomic policies. Staff recommended targeting a neutral fiscal stance in 2014,
saving policy stimulus to respond to downside external shocks and adopting a medium
term fiscal framework (MTFF) to manage resource wealth. The authorities reiterated their
commitment to prudent fiscal policy and highlighted that work on the MTFF is an
ongoing process. On monetary policy, staff noted that further tightening may be needed
if inflationary pressures prove persistent and recommended discontinuing the direct
lending of the central bank to public corporations and gradually exiting the stabilized
exchange rate regime. The authorities did not concur with staff’s recommendations.
Financial sector. The Bolivian financial system remains solid and well capitalized, but the
new Financial Services Law could pose a risk to financial stability. Interest rate caps and
minimum credit quotas could reduce the profitability of financial institutions, lower total
lending funds, over-leverage target beneficiaries, and complicate the conduct of
monetary policy. Staff recommended using other instruments to achieve the objectives
set out in the law.
Structural and social policies. Removing uncertainties in the legal framework is critical
to improve the business climate and promote private investment. Impact evaluation of
social transfers and better targeting of fuel subsidies would enhance the costeffectiveness of social policies and deepen the notable gains achieved by the authorities.

BACKGROUND
1.
Since the mid-2000s, good macroeconomic performance and active social policies
have helped nearly triple income per capita and reduce extreme poverty in Bolivia. Prudent
fiscal policies allowed saving a sizable portion of the hydrocarbon revenue windfall from the
commodity price boom, improving the resilience of the economy to adverse shocks. Reflecting this,
Bolivia was one of few countries in Latin America that sustained positive growth during the global
crisis of 2008–09 and weathered well the recent regional slowdown. At the same time, deep political
and social changes have been taking place. The 2009 Constitution dictates substantial revisions to
the legal and policy frameworks. The authorities’ economic strategy is aligned with new
constitutional requirements and envisages the expansion and industrialization of natural resource
production. The authorities are also making inroads to tackle still high levels of poverty, inequality,
child and maternal mortality rates, and improve access to public services in remote areas.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Real GDP growth and the external position continued to be strong. The latest data
suggest that real GDP growth accelerated to 6.6 percent by September 2013, from 5.2 percent in
2012, supported by soaring hydrocarbon exports, resilient private consumption, and accommodative
macro policies. Staff expects output growth of 6.7 percent for the year as a whole, the highest
growth rate in thirty years. Notwithstanding elevated export volumes, the external current account
surplus is projected to narrow to 4 percent of GDP in 2013, from the peak of 7.8 percent of GDP in
2012, due to softer terms of trade and a pickup in imports. Sizable gross international reserves
(projected at 49 percent of GDP at end-2013) continue to provide ample buffer against external
shocks.
3.
Inflationary pressures resurfaced in the second half of 2013 triggered by food supply
shocks. After hovering around 5 percent (y/y) in the first seven months of 2013, inflation increased
in August and September driven by a spike in some food prices. By November, the food price shock
reversed, with key staples posting deflation m/m aided by temporary measures to boost supply.1
However, core inflation (excluding food, fuel, and administered prices) edged up to 4.9 percent (y/y),
from 4 percent in January. Staff projects headline inflation to rise to 7.5 percent by end-2013, from
4.5 percent in 2012.
4.
Monetary conditions were tightened in response to the inflation shock. Since end-2011,
monetary policy has been anchored on a stable nominal exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar,
supplemented by liquidity management through open market operations.2 Amid sizable excess

liquidity, the central bank started a gradual tightening of monetary conditions at the end of 2012
and accelerated the pace of open market operations in response to the food inflation shock. The
central bank also placed papers directly with pension funds and immobilized banks’ excess reserves
in domestic currency (at a remunerated rate of 1.8 percent). As a result, excess liquidity fell and the
auction rate of the 91 day t-bill inched up to 1.9 percent in November, from 0.35 percent at end2012.3 The authorities also applied stricter prudential limits on consumption credit and offered a
savings bond to the public to stem the end-of-year seasonal hike in consumption.
5.
The overall fiscal balance is projected to stay in surplus in 2013, consistent with an
expansionary fiscal stance. Fiscal outturns through October showed a strong overall performance,
supported by robust hydrocarbon and tax revenues. Higher transfers and fuel subsidies partially
offset the increase in revenue, while capital expenditure execution advanced at a faster pace than in
previous years, as capacity at the subnational level continues to be enhanced with support from the
ministry of planning. For 2013 as a whole, staff projects an overall fiscal surplus of 0.6 percent of
GDP (1.8 percent of GDP in 2012), which would imply a pro-cyclical impulse of about 0.8 percent of
GDP.4 Gross public debt is projected to decline to 32.5 percent of GDP by end-2013 and continue its
downward trajectory over the medium term, with low risk of debt distress.5
6.
The banking sector remains well capitalized. Growth in credit to the private sector
moderated to 19 percent in nominal terms in November but remains high, led by commerce, real
estate, and construction.6 Banks’ capital adequacy ratio stood at 12.9 percent in November, above
the regulatory minimum of 10 percent, and the NPL ratio declined to 1.7 percent (from 8.7 percent
at end-2006). Reflecting a new tax on foreign currency transactions and a corporate income tax
surcharge for financial intermediaries, bank profitability is declining, with return-on-equity at
12.9 percent in November, compared to the peak of 21.2 percent in 2007. The steady increase in
reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits and the stable exchange rate have contributed to
a significant fall in the dollarization ratio (23 percent of total deposits in September from 53 percent
in 2008).7
7.
A new Financial Services Law could alter significantly the financial landscape. The law
establishes a comprehensive legal framework for the regulation of financial services, financial
institutions, and financial groups. Although the law includes several good provisions, its general
thrust is to subordinate financial sector activities to social objectives. Furthermore, by allocating
broad powers to the Executive branch, the law may give rise to regulatory uncertainty.
3

The yield of the 1-year t-bill increased to 4.08 percent in November 2013 from 0.75 percent at end-2012.

4

The fiscal impulse is calculated as the change in the cyclically-adjusted non-hydrocarbon fiscal balance (Annex I).

5

See accompanying Debt Sustainability Analysis.

6

Banking sector credit accounts for about ¾ of total credit to the private sector; the remaining ¼ is provided by
cooperatives and other non-bank financial institutions.
7

Reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits are scheduled to steadily rise to 66.5 percent by 2016, from
21.5 percent in 2008.

Main features of the law include: (i) provisions to regulate lending rates and set lending targets for
the productive sector and social housing; (ii) discretion to set floors on deposit rates; and (iii)
mechanisms to enhance consumer protection and financial access in rural areas. The law came into
effect in November, but specific regulations will be defined by Supreme Decrees in coming months.
8.
Bolivia’s strong economic performance allowed the country to borrow from
international capital markets at favorable terms. In October 2012, Bolivia tapped international
capital markets for the first time since the 1920s, issuing a 10 year bond for US$0.5 billion at a yield
of 4.875 percent. In August 2013, a second issuance followed also for US$0.5 billion at a yield of
6.25 percent.8 The issuances did not reflect a fiscal need but the authorities’ desire to establish a
benchmark for corporate foreign borrowing and to pre-finance important public investment projects
in anticipation of tighter external financial conditions. The authorities are advancing with the
preparation of a medium term debt strategy.

10.
Near and medium term external risks are somewhat higher than at the time of the
2012 Article IV consultation, but external financial buffers continue to be abundant. Downside
external risks include:


Weaker growth in Argentina and Brazil. The share of Argentina and Brazil in Bolivian exports has
climbed to around 50 percent in 2013, from 25 percent in the early 2000’s. A slowdown in these
countries would adversely affect Bolivia both through trade and non-trade (i.e. private sector
confidence) channels. Empirical calculations by staff suggest that a one percentage point
reduction in Brazil’s output growth would lower Bolivia’s output growth by 1/3 percentage point
on impact and by close to 0.8 percent over a twelve month period (Annex III).



Lower world commodity prices, particularly for hydrocarbons. Close to 90 percent of Bolivia’s
exports are commodity based—with natural gas representing roughly 50 percent of total
exports. Bolivia’s fiscal accounts are also sensitive to commodity prices, as hydrocarbon related
revenues account for nearly 35 percent of total revenue and grants. An adverse shock to
hydrocarbon commodity prices would affect revenues, public investment, and activity. Export
price formulas for gas exports based on a basket of petroleum products with a three month lag
provide a temporary cushion to a drop in commodity prices.



Large buffers. Sizable international reserves and government deposits at the central bank—
projected at 49 and 26 percent of GDP by end-2013, respectively—would allow the authorities
to mitigate the effects of adverse external shocks, especially if these are transitory.

11.
Domestic risks are broadly balanced. On the downside, absent significant progress in
finalizing key laws and improving the business climate, private investment may remain subdued. At
the same time, the new Financial Services Law may not provide a level playing field for public and
private banks and may weaken credit conditions and banks’ balance sheets. On the upside, fiscal
stimulus may turn out stronger than anticipated in staff’s baseline scenario, in the context of the
general election scheduled to take place in late 2014. In addition, the implementation of the
National Public Investment System may result in a faster-than-envisaged removal of bottlenecks in
investment planning, execution, and monitoring, particularly at the local level.
12.
The authorities were not too concerned about external risks. They stressed that Bolivia’s
development strategy relies on domestic demand as the main engine of growth and noted that a
slowdown in external demand would not have a major impact on economic activity, in particular
since fiscal policy could have a more active role in a less benign external environment. The
authorities also considered that staff estimates of spillovers overstated the effects that a slowdown
in trading partners would have on Bolivia. The authorities emphasized that the large financial buffers
would allow them to respond timely and effectively to any external shock.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Strengthening the Fiscal Framework
13.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to prudent fiscal policy. They highlighted
that the overall fiscal deficit target of 3.2 percent of GDP included in the 2014 draft budget was
significantly smaller than the fiscal deficit target of 4.6 percent of GDP that had been presented in
the 2013 budget, supported by the established practice of conservative forecasting of oil prices.
Replacing these forecasts with the WEO baseline for oil prices results in a projected fiscal deficit of
0.4 percent of GDP for 2014, which would imply a moderately expansionary fiscal stance. In view of
prospects for strong growth and the closed output gap, staff recommended aiming for a neutral
fiscal stance in 2014, saving stimulus to respond to downside external shocks, and cautioned that
fiscal tightening may be

current spending, as
investment was essential to deepen the diversification and industrialization of the economy, with
important projects already in the pipeline. The authorities did not see any reasons to be concerned
about the impact of the election cycle on fiscal sustainability.
14.
Staff underscored that improving the non-hydrocarbon fiscal balance is critical for
medium term sustainability. The non-hydrocarbon primary deficit has widened from 3.2 percent of
GDP in 2006 to 9.1 percent of GDP projected in 2013. On current proven gas reserves and resource
horizon, staff estimates that the sustainable level of the non-hydrocarbon primary deficit is around
3¼ percent of GDP, requiring an improvement of 5¾ percent of GDP from the 2013 projected level
(Annex I). The short resource horizon has a visible impact on the debt trajectory after the mid-2020s,
underlying the urgency to invest in exploration with support from the private sector.10 The
authorities indicated that they were giving priority to investment in gas exploration, with 18 new
contracts expected to be subscribed by 2025. At the same time, they disagreed with staff’s concern
about the level of the non-hydrocarbon fiscal deficit, given good prospects for the sector. The
authorities argued that Bolivia had been able to post fiscal surpluses for several years without
having to focus on the non-hydrocarbon fiscal balance and were committed to continue doing so in
the future.

15.
Strengthening the non-hydrocarbon fiscal balance will require both expenditure and
revenue measures. On the expenditure side, measures that would help fiscal consolidation include
a gradual reform of fuel subsidies to target the most vulnerable groups and enhancements in the
quality of capital expenditure. On the revenue side, staff recommended (i) introducing personal
income taxes or reforming the existing VAT complementary system; (ii) strengthening compliance of
the corporate income tax; (iii) reforming revenue agencies; and (iv) quantifying and reporting tax
expenditures in the budget with potential to curtail those with high cost-benefit ratios. With quasifiscal risks of public corporations and financial institutions on the rise, staff noted that a
comprehensive risk statement in the budget would help identify fiscal vulnerabilities and inform any
additional reform needs. The authorities acknowledged that revenue measures undertaken in recent
years, even if different in nature, pursued the same goals suggested by staff, but clarified that there
was little scope for structural fiscal reforms during the election year.11
16.
Staff recommended developing a fully-fledged MTFF to manage resource wealth. Staff
welcomed the progress made by the authorities in preparing medium term fiscal projections, but
noted that these projections should be part of the budget documentation, in line with best practices
in fiscal transparency. Staff stressed that a fully fledged MTFF comprises, in addition to numerical
projections, mechanisms to insulate the fiscal sector from commodity price volatility, improve the
predictability of the budget, and promote countercyclical fiscal policies. Staff advised the authorities
to consider the eventual adoption of a fiscal rule that would set a target for the structural primary
balance, supported by a stabilization/savings fund with clear investment objectives and a strong
governance structure. Recognizing that the effective implementation of such a complex rule requires
meeting important pre-conditions, staff suggested as a first step the calculation, reporting, and
discussion of structural fiscal indicators in the budget. In addition, hydrocarbon revenue sharing
agreements may need to be revisited in the context of the fiscal rule. The Fiscal Pact called for by
the decentralization law of 2010 provides an opportune time for such a revision.
17.
The authorities noted that the preparation of a MTFF is an ongoing process that will
evolve into multi-year budgeting in the future. They concurred with the need to continue
strengthening fiscal reporting and analysis for budget formulation, but saw the preparation of a
MTFF as a more gradual process with some essential elements already underway. With respect to a
stabilization fund, while it is foreseen in the decentralization law, they noted that it would be difficult
to build the necessary consensus for its implementation during an election year. Still, the sizable
resources of subnational governments held at the central bank already provide an important source
of fiscal savings. The authorities were not persuaded about the benefits of a fiscal rule.

11

In addition to the new taxes on the financial sector, the authorities have strengthened tax administration and
significantly broadened the base of contributors.

B. Maintaining Low and Stable Inflation
18.
Staff noted that the rapid response to the food price shock of 2013 was appropriate.
Bolivia’s highly open and commodity dependent economy is vulnerable to inflationary pressures
from both external and domestic supply shocks (Box 2). Past experience suggests that second round
effects take 5–8 months to reach their peak and are more persistent amid lax monetary conditions,
such as those present in the first half of 2013. In addition, incomes policy decisions recently taken by
the government,12 coupled with the end year seasonal hike in demand entail upside risks. Given
these risks, staff argued that further tightening may be necessary if second round effects prove
persistent. The authorities stressed that measures taken had successfully decelerated inflation
already in October. In addition, as the new instruments effectively withdrew liquidity in a short
period of time, they noted that the food price shock could be less persistent.
19.
Persistently high volatility of food prices and sizable pass-through suggest the need to
strengthen the monetary policy framework. The gradual weakening of central bank
independence and increased central bank lending to public corporations highlight the need to
strengthen the framework and safeguard the hard won anti-inflation credentials of the central bank.
To attain these objectives, staff recommended:


Discontinuing the practice of direct lending by the central bank to public corporations. Since 2009,
the central bank is authorized to lend to the central government at concessional terms. In 2013,
this lending limit was increased to US$5.3 billion, of which US$2.2 billion had been disbursed by
November. Staff noted that this lending exposes the central bank to quasi-fiscal losses in an
adverse scenario and creates a potential conflict with its price stability objective. Staff
recommended that financing of public investment be implemented by the ministry of finance
through a savings fund, which could absorb the credit portfolio of the central bank. Staff argued
that the “Fondo para la Revolución Industrial Productiva” (FINPRO), established in 2012 using
part of international reserves, could be the stepping stone of a savings fund, provided that it
generates sufficient positive returns, makes investments based on sound financial
considerations, and is supported by a strong institutional setup (Box 3). The authorities stressed
that price stability was a constitutional mandate that was not imperiled by lending activities on
strategic areas. Moreover, the lending to public corporations constituted an income source for
the central bank. They also argued that coordination among public institutions was essential to
pursue appropriate policies, rather than a detriment to central bank independence. The
authorities expressed interest in further input from staff on the accounting treatment of the
lending operations currently on the balance sheet of the central bank.



Continuing to rely primarily on market-based signals to allocate financial savings. Regulated
interest rate margins and credit quotas contemplated by the new Financial Services Law may
create costly distortions and complicate the conduct of monetary policy. In view of these risks,
staff advised to establish a clear and transparent process for setting interest rates that minimizes
distortions with market signals. It also stressed that any changes stemming from the new

constitution conserve the supremacy of the Central Bank Law.13 The authorities clarified that
regulated interest rates and credit quotas would apply to a fraction of the loan portfolio, leaving
room for market-based signals.


Creating the conditions for a gradual exit from the de-facto stabilized exchange rate arrangement
in place since end-2011. This will enhance the capacity to absorb external shocks and to conduct
independent monetary policy. Staff and the authorities concurred that there is no evidence of
exchange rate misalignment (Annex IV). The authorities emphasized that their exchange rate
policy allowed for sufficient flexibility to respond to changes in the international environment
and had been appropriate for Bolivia, especially given volatility in external markets in recent
years. Moreover, the steady fall in dollarization had won them increased independence in their
monetary policy. Staff noted that several steps would help transition to greater exchange rate
flexibility, including improving liquidity management, enhancing the role of the policy rate,
continuing to develop inflation forecasting, collecting more high frequency indicators, and
increasing central bank operational autonomy.

C. Safeguarding Financial Stability
20.
The authorities have made progress in expanding access to financial services, amid
improving financial soundness indicators. Preserving these gains will require monitoring the
current credit expansion closely, maintaining banking sector buffers, and continuing to strengthen
supervision. Staff encouraged the authorities to advance quickly with the creation of a real estate
price index that would allow a better assessment of any potential misalignment in property prices. It
also urged the authorities to expeditiously bring the large number of unlicensed financial
institutions into the regulatory perimeter. The authorities noted that work on a real estate price
index is underway.
21.
Several FSAP recommendations have been implemented. In particular, progress has been
made in adopting Basel II and III principles (such as adding market risk to capital requirements and
completing the guidance on operational and interest rate risk), and introducing a deposit insurance
scheme. Shortcomings remain in the areas of independence of the supervisory authority (ASFI),
criteria for setting provisioning requirements, limits on total foreign investments as a share of
capital, and regulations for the pensions and insurance sectors. Plans to strengthen ASFI’s resources
will help to ensure that the quality of oversight does not deteriorate in light of new tasks mandated
by the Financial Services Law. The authorities noted that the close working relationship between the
ministry of finance, ASFI, and the central bank is important and will be further strengthened under
the Financial Stability Council created by the new law.
22.
Bolivia’s exit from the FATF monitoring process attests to the recent strengthening of
the AML/CFT legal framework. Working towards effectively implementing the AML/CFT regime as
13

The Financial Services Law explicitly states the supremacy of its provisions over contradictory laws, but recognizes
that the Central Bank of Bolivia is regulated by its own legal framework (Art. 5).

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BOLIVIA

the Financial Services Law comes into effect should be a key next step towards further enhancing
the integrity of the financial system. In particular, it would be important to ensure a smooth transfer
of the Financial Investigations Unit (FIU) and its resources from ASFI to the ministry of finance, to
clarify the FIU’s organization, functions, and sanctioning procedures in forthcoming regulations, and
guarantee the autonomy of the FIU.
23.
Staff expressed concern about potentially significant risks to financial stability
stemming from the new Financial Services Law. In particular:


The regulated interest rates and credit quotas may distort resource allocation and negatively affect
the profitability of financial institutions. Controlled deposit rates may encourage circumvention
and disintermediation more generally. Ceilings on lending rates and credit quotas may “crowdin” sectors ill-equipped to efficiently absorb the funds and create concentration risks to the
financial sector as a whole. Compressed interest margins are likely to hurt banks’ profitability
and thereafter capitalization. Banks’ diverse credit portfolios and operational structures also
pose challenges to set regulations consistent with financial stability and to ensure a level playing
field among different types of institutions.



The legal framework regarding contracts could expose financial institutions to additional risks. The
law would allow clients to terminate contracts with financial institutions without incurring any
penalty. In addition, mortgage loans would be considered fully paid with the amount that is
recovered from the collateral, thus creating incentives for strategic defaults.



Increased intervention in financial institutions and regulatory uncertainty may discourage
investment in the financial sector. The law authorizes the Executive branch to impose “temporary
preventive measures” (Art. 6) to safeguard the continuity of financial services and the stability of
the financial system. In addition, the law does not elaborate on the functions, scope of powers,
and accountability framework for the Financial Stability Council.

24.
Staff argued that the authorities’ financial inclusion goals could be attained through
other policies. Such policies could include transparent fiscal transfers to financial institutions to
subsidize lending to target beneficiaries. Moreover, staff noted that innovative interventions (such as
partial credit guarantees and productive development services) could be more effective instruments
to leverage public funds for development and housing finance. The authorities did not see merit in
staff’s concerns and stressed that regulations in Supreme Decrees would be set with due
consideration for the stability and growth of the financial system and the economy.

D. Sustaining Inclusive Growth
25.
Uncertainties in the legal framework continue to hamper the business climate. High
commodity prices and accommodative policies have supported growth in Bolivia in recent years, but
private investment as a share of GDP remains among the lowest in the region. Long delays in
finalizing key legislation (e.g., on investment, hydrocarbon, mining, and labor) have weakened
business confidence, as has the uncertainty regarding expropriation and nationalization processes. A

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

BOLIVIA

vibrant private sector would help sustain strong growth over the medium term, including by
partnering with the public sector in the exploration of natural resources and by enhancing the
productivity and diversification of the economy. However, a business climate where private
investment can thrive requires stable rules of the game, few, fair and swift processes of
nationalization, and legislation that addresses the private sector’s concerns over property rights. At
the same time, the governance framework for public corporations should be improved to minimize
fiscal risks and delineate their role vis-à-vis private companies in the authorities’ development plan.
The authorities continue to work towards building consensus for the approval of these laws. In their
view, there is no legal uncertainty for investment in Bolivia, as the Investment Law of 1990 remains
in effect and the 2009 constitution guarantees private property and fair rules for private investment.
26.
The authorities’ economic strategy yielded a considerable increase in standards of
living and aims to continue tackling deep rooted social challenges. Notwithstanding these
achievements, Bolivia ranks low in the UN’s Human development index (108 out of 187 in 2012),
child and maternal mortality rates are still high, and water and sanitation coverage is low, especially
in the rural and poor marginal urban areas. Cash transfer programs in education, maternal health,
energy, and pensions have been central to the authorities’ efforts to combat poverty, inequality and
improve health indicators. Staff recommended conducting an impact evaluation of the existing
social transfers before scaling up their coverage, to ensure a good design and focalization. Finally,
improved capacity at the local level would enhance the impact of social infrastructure and deepen
the social gains already achieved by the authorities.

STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
Bolivia’s strong macroeconomic performance, backed by high commodity prices and
active social policies, has resulted in an exceptional rise in income per capita and a decline in
poverty. In 2013, real GDP growth is expected to reach its highest rate in over thirty years,
supported by buoyant natural gas exports, strong private consumption growth, and accommodative
macro-policies. Prudent macroeconomic management has allowed saving part of the hydrocarbon
revenue windfall, with continued twin surpluses in the fiscal and external accounts strengthening the
resilience of the economy to adverse shocks. Social policies have pursued ambitious redistributive
and poverty reduction goals, increasing living standards of vulnerable households. Impact
evaluation of cash transfer programs and better targeting of fuel subsidies would help improve on
the design and cost-effectiveness of social policies. In addition, expanding access to quality health
care and water and sanitation remain long standing priorities.
28.
The economy is expected to continue to grow above potential in 2014, albeit at a
slower pace, and risks to the outlook seem manageable. Although external risks over the near
and medium term have increased (including from a sharp drop in world commodity prices or weaker
activity in main trading partners), sizable international reserves and government deposits at the
central bank provide ample buffers. Domestic risks are broadly balanced, with upside risks from
fiscal stimulus offset by downside risks from a weak climate for private investment.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BOLIVIA

29.
An immediate policy challenge is ensuring that the spike in some food prices of mid2013 does not result in permanently higher inflation. The authorities’ rapid tightening of
monetary conditions has helped reduce this risk. If inflationary pressures persist, it would be
necessary to continue to mop up liquidity. In addition, the effectiveness of monetary policy should
be enhanced, including by allowing market-based signals to operate under the new Financial
Services Law and gradually exiting from the de-facto stabilized exchange rate in place since late
2011. The recent practice of mandating the central bank to lend to public corporations should be
discontinued, as it may weaken the solvency of the monetary authority and undermine
macroeconomic stability in the long term. Staff recommended that those lending activities be
undertaken by a sovereign fund administered by the ministry of finance, supported by a strong
governance structure and clear investment criteria that ensure that benefits accrue to both current
and future generations.
30.
The favorable growth outlook points to the importance of ensuring that fiscal policy
does not over-stimulate domestic demand. A neutral fiscal stance for 2014 would be consistent
with a moderate overall fiscal surplus, rather than the deficit envisaged in the draft budget. The
authorities should give priority to adopting a MTFF to manage resource wealth and help guide fiscal
policy, balancing intergenerational equity against immediate needs. Priority should also be given to
exploring new natural gas reserves to offset the impact of the depletion of hydrocarbon resources
projected for mid-2020. The success of these efforts hinges on establishing a clear, stable legal
framework and a favorable business climate for private investment. More generally, such efforts
would help leverage the authorities’ development strategy to industrialize the resource sector,
diversify the economy, and boost competitiveness and productivity.
31.
The Bolivian financial system remains solid and well capitalized, but the new Financial
Services Law may create risks to financial stability. The law is appropriately focused on financial
inclusion and productive development and contains various elements that, if effectively
implemented, will help strengthen the safety net and the integrity of the financial system. However,
the instruments chosen (interest rate caps and minimum credit quotas) could reduce the profitability
and lending funds of financial institutions, over-leverage target beneficiaries, and complicate the
conduct of monetary policy. Staff recommended the authorities to choose different instruments to
achieve their goals, for example transparent fiscal transfers to financial institutions to subsidize
lending to target beneficiaries.
32.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Bolivia be held on the standard
12 month cycle.

Box 1. Past Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
The 2012 Article IV Consultation focused on the appropriate policy mix to mitigate risks of overheating and
on medium term challenges to achieving strong, sustained, and inclusive growth.
Monetary and exchange rate policy. Directors recommended that the central bank absorb part of the
large excess liquidity in the banking sector to slow credit growth and seek a gradual increase in interest
rates. A gradual move toward greater exchange rate flexibility would be facilitated as lower dollarization
becomes entrenched and financial markets develop.
Amid sizable excess liquidity, the central bank started a gradual tightening of monetary conditions at the end
of 2012 and reacted promptly with further measures in response to the food inflation shock in mid-2013. The
Boliviano has remained virtually unchanged vis-à-vis the US dollar since late 2011.
Fiscal policy. Directors recommended aiming for a higher fiscal balance to offset strong private demand
growth and strengthening the non-hydrocarbon balance over the medium term. They stressed the
advantage of setting up a MTFF to manage resource wealth. Directors encouraged the authorities to limit
the role of the central bank in financing public investment and to enhance the governance and
accountability framework for public enterprises.
The overall fiscal surplus in 2012 was about 1 percent of GDP higher than envisaged at the time of the Article
IV Consultation, but the surplus narrowed in 2013. The authorities have advanced with the preparation of
medium term fiscal projections and medium term forecasts for key public enterprises. The authorized limits for
central bank lending to public corporations were raised in 2013. The Public Enterprises Law is under discussion.
Financial sector. Directors recommended avoiding direct controls on the price and allocation of credit,
while noting that plans to enhance the financial system safety net should help consolidate the strength of
the banking sector. Staff welcomed the progress in adopting FSAP recommendations.
The new Financial Services Law contemplates setting floors on deposit rates, as well as ceilings on lending rates
and quantitative lending targets for the productive sector and social housing. The law includes several elements
aligned with international practices, including the establishment of a macroprudential oversight body, a credit
registry, and a deposit guarantee scheme.
Structural policies. Directors highlighted the importance of improving the business environment to sustain
high and stable growth, through the adoption of a legal framework for natural resources and private
investment that ensures clear and stable rules and delineates the scope of public sector operations.
Legal reforms of key legislation, including on investment, hydrocarbon, mining and labor, are still pending.
Uncertainty regarding expropriation and nationalization process continues to affect business confidence.

Box 2. Inflation Dynamics
Bolivia’s highly open and commodity dependent economy is very sensitive to inflationary pressures
stemming from both external and domestic supply shocks. Spikes in commodity prices have come hand
in hand with spikes in domestic headline inflation. Developments in 2008 and early 2011 are particularly
noteworthy, with headline prices in Bolivia growing by double digits on the back of a surge in global food
and fuel prices.
The pass-through from global food prices to both domestic food prices and to headline inflation is
very high. Staff estimates suggest that over a 12 month period, a 1 percent shock to global food prices
increases domestic food prices by 0.81 percent. In turn, a
1 percent increase in domestic food prices has a
cumulative twelve month pass-through of 0.85 percent
to headline inflation. To put this in perspective, the
October 2011 World Economic Outlook finds the median

The exchange rate pass-through is high from a regional perspective. Based on a VAR model estimated
for Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay a proxy for the exchange rate pass-through is computed
from the impulse response functions for the price level and the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER),

Box 3. International Reserves Management
After the nationalization of the hydrocarbon sector in 2006, Bolivia’s public sector became the sole
recipient of large natural gas exports receipts, resulting in substantial fiscal savings. As a self-insurance
mechanism, and absent an institutional arrangement to manage this wealth, the windfall from these
resources has been continuously deposited at the central bank. A managed exchange rate regime and a
process of financial de-dollarization have also been important factors behind the accumulation of
international reserves.
Bolivia’s international reserves level is currently more

Going forward, Bolivia should develop a mechanism to transform the reserves from the nonrenewable sector into sustainable and more stable future income. Proper management of these
resources could achieve the government’s objective of spreading Bolivia’s wealth across generations, help
mitigate possible boom-bust cycles, and maintain the competitiveness of the non-commodity sector. An
investment fund, with clear operational rules and functioning within an appropriate government-wide
framework, could be an important tool for the government to manage its wealth from non-renewable
resources and as an insurance mechanism from volatile commodity prices.

Annex I. A Medium Term Fiscal Framework for Managing Resource
Wealth
Given the importance of the hydrocarbon sector for fiscal revenues in Bolivia, assessing the
sustainable level of non-hydrocarbon fiscal balances is critical to anchor medium term fiscal
policies. Based on resource horizon and production scenarios, the following approaches could
inform the levels of non-resource balances that can be sustained by the resource wealth: 1) the birdin-hand rule; 2) the permanent income hypothesis (PIH); 3) the modified PIH; and 4) the fiscal
sustainability framework (FSF).


The bird-in-hand rule, followed by Norway, sets aside resource revenue in a separate fund
and targets the non-resource primary balance (NRPB) equal to the return on the fund. This
approach limits the non-resource spending in earlier periods by accumulating savings for
future generations.



The PIH combines both physical (natural resources in the ground, in net present value) and
financial (savings realized from resource revenues) assets, and targets the NRPB based on
the return on this combined resource wealth.



The modified PIH takes into account the infrastructure investment needs of the country, and
assumes a scaled up investment schedule in the near term. The resource wealth is
subsequently replenished to sustain the same level of NRPB as in the PIH framework.



The FSF assumes that the front-loaded investment under the modified PIH has a growth
enhancing effect on the non-resource sector. Higher revenue generated from a more
developed non-resource sector would help narrow the non-resource primary deficit, which,
in turn, would imply a smaller pool of resource wealth required for its financing.

These frameworks could inform fiscal consolidation paths under different resource horizons,
investment plans, and external environment assumptions. For example, based on current proven
reserves of natural gas, equivalent to about 17 years of average annual production, an analysis
based on PIH suggests a sustainable non-resource primary fiscal deficit of 3¼ percent of GDP
(which would imply a fiscal adjustment of about 5¾ percent of GDP from projected 2013 levels). A
more optimistic scenario with a longer resource horizon and a moderate decline in the resource
balance indicates a sustainable deficit of 4½ percent of GDP. The figures below show an illustrative
scenario with a gradual decline of current levels of spending, followed by an MPIH adjustment
period to accumulate the resource wealth to the level needed to achieve long term sustainability.

Insulating budget expenditure from commodity price fluctuations is also important for
resource rich countries. Bolivia has managed the price risks through the practice of conservative
forecasting of oil prices in the budget and the prudent use of hydrocarbon revenues. While this
helped the authorities to successfully set aside windfalls from the commodity price boom,
expenditure has been on occasion unpredictable, calling for the reformulation of the budget during
the fiscal year. Calculating the structural fiscal balance (SB) and using it as a policy tool could be a
first step towards a more systematic and predictable management of resource revenues.
The SB helps assess the fiscal stance by adjusting fiscal indicators by the output cycle and the
impact of commodity price shocks, asset price cycles, and any one-off factors. The measure is
highly relevant for Bolivia, as the increasing importance of hydrocarbon revenues backed by higher
prices and greater demand for its natural gas exports has made it difficult to assess the underlying
fiscal stance in recent years. Two measures of SB are of relevance for Bolivia: (i) the cyclicallyadjusted non-hydrocarbon primary balance, and (ii) the structural primary balance with the
hydrocarbon-balance based on structural commodity prices.
(i) Cyclically-adjusted non-hydrocarbon primary balances adjust non-hydrocarbon primary
balances by the output cycle, ideally measured against non-hydrocarbon GDP. The adjustment for
the output cycle requires calculating potential output, the output gap, and budget elasticities, and
identifying one-off items.


34

Potential GDP and the output gap can be calculated by various statistical and economic
methods, including extracting the trend that smoothes business cycle fluctuations, the
production function approach based on the trend subcomponents of GDP, and econometric
models. Staff estimates suggest that Bolivia’s potential growth is around 5 percent (Annex II).

Elasticities estimate how budget revenues or expenditures respond to changes in the
economic cycle. A bottom-up approach is taken to apply estimated elasticities for major

average of the past five years, current, and forecast for the next five years (5/1/5); and average of the
past twelve years, current, and forecast for the next three years (12/1/3).

Structural primary balance targets can be set to determine the level of expenditure,
irrespective of the realized level of commodity prices and revenues. The primary balance target
may be complemented by rules applied specifically to expenditures, such as ceilings on real
expenditure growth, to further reduce volatility and limit pro-cyclicality. The figures below shows the
actual primary balance and the primary balance that would have been realized under a structural
primary balance target of 0 percent of GDP. Additional cumulative savings under those price rules
and structural balance target, compared to the actual level of expenditure, are also shown below.

The use of the structural balance as a policy tool could be augmented by improvements in the
quality of data and the institutional framework. Enhancing the quality and timeliness of fiscal
data would help measure the fiscal policy stance more accurately, and its publication would
strengthen transparency. Once monitoring of the structural balance is well established and
integrated as a policy tool, the authorities could consider establishing formal fiscal rules to cope
with price volatility and the exhaustibility of natural resource revenues. For fiscal rules to be
effective, they should be measurable and evaluable. The rules should also be clear about the
objectives, institutions, and reporting arrangements to avoid undermining their credibility.

Annex II. Potential Output
Estimating potential output is useful for the conduct of macroeconomic policy in Bolivia.
Assessing the position of the economic cycle is critical given the increasing need to assess the
monetary policy stance that would maintain low and stable inflation, evaluate the fiscal stance that
could help bring the non-hydrocarbon fiscal balance to a sustainable path, and ultimately support
long term growth.
However, the estimation of potential output
is challenging. The Bolivian economy seems to
have exhibited a structural break in 2001, with a
sharp fall in output followed by a long period of
strong growth. In addition, important structural
transformations in recent years implied a
noticeable acceleration in real GDP growth, with
implications for trend or potential GDP.

Annex III. Assessing External Spillovers
Bolivia’s economic linkages with Brazil and Argentina have strengthened in recent years with
its exports to these countries increasing by more than fivefold since early 2000. As a result,
Bolivia has become more vulnerable to shocks affecting its two largest neighbors. In view of their
size and interconnectedness, the Brazilian and Argentinean economies can therefore act as
transmitters and/or amplifiers of global demand shocks onto the Bolivian economy.

The spillover effects of regional and global shocks on Bolivia were identified using a
structural VAR (SVAR) model. The model contains three block exogeneity restrictions: one
containing only global variables (global demand and oil prices), a second block containing regional
variables (Argentinean and Brazilian variables), and a third (domestic) block, with Bolivian variables.
Following the methodology presented in Sims and Zha (2006),14 counterfactual scenarios are
constructed to quantify the empirical relevance of different channels of transmission of spillovers.

Global demand and oil prices. A one percentage point cutback in global demand brings down
Bolivian output growth by 1.8 percent. At its trough, growth in Bolivia is principally affected by
lower trade flows to Brazil. Oil prices have a large and significant effect on Bolivia’s output. A ten
percent drop in oil prices (relative to the U.S. consumer price index) would reduce Bolivia’s
output by 1.6 percent after one year. The impact of oil prices on trade flows with Brazil is the
main factor behind the contraction of Bolivia’s output.

Regional and global growth shocks appear to have a strong impact on Bolivia. Albeit it comes
as no surprise, the empirical exercise suggests that trade flows with Brazil are the main channel of
transmission of spillovers from external growth shocks or shocks to international oil prices. While
domestic non-trade effects are particularly important for explaining the initial impact on Bolivia’s
output of foreign shocks, the volume of exports to Brazil is the main driver of Bolivia’s output several
months after impact.
Understanding the transmission mechanism of external disturbances is important for
macroeconomic management. Prudent fiscal policies and current account surpluses over the past
several years have allowed Bolivia to accumulate significant buffers, but the economy is still
vulnerable to external shocks which are transmitted and amplified primarily through the trade
channel with Brazil. To ensure sustainable economic growth over the medium term, it would be
important for the authorities to continue their efforts to diversify the export base, increase
competitiveness, and manage natural resource wealth in an effective manner.

Annex IV. Exchange Rate and Competitiveness Assessment
Against a backdrop of substantial reserves
accumulation, Bolivia’s real effective exchange
rate (REER) has risen by about 21 percent over
the last decade. Bolivia’s strong terms of trade,
large public investment, and relatively high inflation
rate account for most of the appreciation. Although
there has been a nominal strengthening against
regional currencies, the Boliviano has been kept
virtually fixed vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar since late
2011.
CGER methodologies tailored for resource rich
countries suggest no significant misalignment:15


The benchmark Macroeconomic Balance (MB)
approach was modified to separate the effects of
hydrocarbon revenues and fiscal policy in the
current account and to capture the elasticity of
non-hydrocarbon exports and imports relative to
the REER.16 Following the large increase in the
current account surplus in 2012, the MB
approach suggests that a strengthening of
Bolivia’s REER would be needed for the
underlying current account balance (CAB) to be
close to its estimated medium term norm
(-1.4 percent of GDP).17 The estimated deviation
from equilibrium is not statistically significant.

burdensome building permits are the main components behind Bolivia’s relatively poor performance

needed to enhance competitiveness and productivity.

These indicators should be interpreted with caution due to a limited number of respondents, a limited
geographical coverage, and standardized assumptions on business constraints and information availability.

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of
Bolivia (CBB) was subject to an assessment with respect to the April 2, 2003 Stand-By Arrangement
(SBA). A safeguards assessment was completed on June 27, 2003, and while no systemic risks with
the CBB’s safeguards were identified, uncertainties were expressed about the de facto lack of
operational independence and program monetary data. An update assessment was completed on
September 27, 2004 in conjunction with an augmentation of the SBA. This assessment confirmed
that measures had been implemented to address all previously identified vulnerabilities, except for
those requiring a change in the central bank law. Currently, CBB is not subject to the policy.

Exchange Arrangement: The Bolivian currency is the Boliviano. The de jure exchange rate
arrangement is classified as a crawling peg to the U.S. dollar. Within the scope of the official
crawling peg exchange rate regime, in an external environment characterized by marked exchange
rate volatility and decreasing external inflation, the sliding rate was set to zero to anchor the public
expectations. Consequently, the boliviano stabilized anew against the U.S. dollar since November
2011. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been retroactively reclassified to a
stabilized arrangement from a crawling peg, effective November 2, 2011.
Article IV Consultation. The last Article IV consultation was completed by the Executive Board on
June 1, 2012 (Country Report No. 12/149). Bolivia is on a standard 12 month consultation cycle.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK AND BANKFUND COLLABORATION UNDER THE JMAP
A. Relations with the World Bank
1.
The ongoing Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the fiscal period 2012–2015 is
guiding the World Bank Group (WBG) support to Bolivia. The CPS consists of a program of
lending operations and knowledge activities along four pillars: (i) sustainable productive
development; (ii) climate change and disaster risk management; (iii) human development and access
to basic services; and (iv) public sector effectiveness. In addition, the strategy incorporates gender,
governance, and anti-corruption as cross-cutting themes. These areas respond to government
requests and priorities outlined in the National Development Plan (NDP) while also making the most
of the WBG´s comparative advantage.
2.
A CPS Progress Report will be presented to the Board of Executive Directors in
February 2014. This Mid-Term Review is confirming the relevance of the current CPS, under which
most of the proposed lending program is under implementation or in the last stage of preparation.
In agreement with the government, one operation in water and sanitation was dropped given the
expanded role of other development partners. With the launch of the government´s Agenda
Patriotica 2025 in early 2013, there is an increased policy dialogue on its emerging priorities with
particular emphasis on those related to unlocking alternative sources of growth.
3.
For the remainder of the CPS period, efforts will involve more programmatic
interventions, new instruments, and more innovative approaches and will now include
financing from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). As
envisioned in the CPS in addition to the resources allocated by the International Development
Association (IDA), the proposed lending program for the remaining period includes financing from
IBRD. The lending strategy will seek to minimize any significant drop in resources in the expected
transition after the IDA17 cycle. Under this framework, the proposed program includes new
investment financing in rural electrification, employment and job quality, an additional financing for
an ongoing statistical capacity strengthening project, and a climate resilience operation for which
resources include a combination of grant and concessional financing from the Climate Investment
Fund. In terms of more programmatic and transformative approaches, a new project to support the
development of Andean products is being prepared; in terms of new instruments, the upcoming
Program for Results in road rehabilitation will seek to underpin a multi-agency program. A project to
support government efforts to improve the effectiveness of public investment at decentralized levels
will also be presented to the Board in the next months.
4.
There will be an effort to align the current portfolio and results framework to provide
transformative solutions and to further focus on extreme poverty eradication and shared
prosperity. The portfolio under implementation comprises eleven investment projects worth
US$464 million, of which the undisbursed balance is US$285 million (Table 1); new projects under

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

BOLIVIA

preparation are worth approximately US$390 million. The Bank will continue to focus on resolving
implementation bottlenecks and on moving to a portfolio where products coalesce around a few
areas of intervention that are both catalytic and aligned with Bolivia’s own goals of shared
prosperity and extreme poverty eradication by 2025. New initiatives will be prioritized according the
following criteria: (i) support to sustainable employment and production corridors, particularly in
rural areas; (ii) enhance institutional capacity in decentralized areas to deliver basic and social
services and to address disaster risk and climate resilience; and (iii) enhance country systems and
procedures to promote and evaluate results based development.

5.
Under the leadership of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the CPS will
continue supporting opportunities for private sector development under the NDP´s
framework. The IFC’s overall program has focused on the investment climate and on simplifying
procedures, as well as on Access to Finance (A2F) in agriculture and on training for small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) through its Business Edge Program. On the investment side, the IFC has
engaged clients in SME banking, microfinance and trade finance, agribusiness, and forestry.
6.
In terms of Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) and convening services, the Bank
will continue supporting the development of a flexible program tailored to the government´s
needs. To the extent possible, AAA will be bundled around the criteria mentioned above. For the
first time, AAA will include Bolivia´s first Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) program to
strengthen public sector management systems for the Department of Santa Cruz. Table 2 presents

8.

The following priorities were identified for the coordinated work plan on Bolivia:


Strengthening of the fiscal framework. In particular, the reform of intergovernmental
relations, transparent management of the hydrocarbon related revenue, and the
reinforcement of the multi-annual budget and planning process. The public sector also

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

BOLIVIA

has to strengthen capacity on public sector management, procurement, and public
investment, including at the subnational level.

9.

8



Maintaining adequate financial sector supervision. The financial sector is liquid and
solvent. The current challenge is to implement the new Financial Services Law, continue
strengthening supervision to maintain the health of the loan portfolios, and manage the
transition of the AML/CT regime under the new law.



Improving the business climate to bolster investment. Bolivia’s private investment
rate remains below the levels observed in the early 2000s and well below the regional
average. There is also the challenge to reconcile the need to maintain the role of the
private sector with the government intention to increase the role of the state in the
economy.



Reducing poverty. Significant challenges remain in the area of human development,
including access to quality basic education, health, and a social protection network as
well as the employability of low income youth. Technical strengthening on poverty
measurement issues is also on the agenda.

It was agreed that the teams continue with the following division of labor:


Tax policy and administration. The Fund will continue to have the lead in collaborating
with the authorities in this area. If requested by the government, the Bank may support
this effort through its diagnosis tools.



Fiscal federalism and budget framework. The Bank is supporting the Ministry of
Development Planning in the decentralization process and the public investment
management and coordination among different levels of government. The Bank is also
providing support to strengthen the planning and implementation of public investment
at all levels of governments, in association with the work towards the multi-annual
budget process. The Fund will continue its analytical work on macro-fiscal institutions to
manage resource wealth, including advising on the components of a medium-term fiscal
framework.



Debt management. The Bank, in collaboration with the Fund, is assisting the Ministry of
Finance on developing debt management reform plans, based on the findings of the
Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA). In addition, the Bank will provide
technical assistance on the management of non-concessional loans, for which Bolivia is
already eligible for access.



Poverty and social protection. The Bank has been providing technical assistance on
poverty measurement, including monetary poverty and multidimensional well-being
indicators. This complements the support provided to generate high quality statistical
information through a STATCAP project. These tools would help both diagnose and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BOLIVIA

target the population that fails to reach minimum standards of multidimensional welfare,
as well as build capacity on the measurement of poverty, which would include gender
issues. Also, the Bank will continue assisting the Government in the area of social
protection, health, and early child development.


Private sector development. The World Bank Group will continue providing financing
in the area of agricultural productivity, food security, rural development and community
driven development. The Bank is conducting a sectoral evaluation of growth, bottlenecks
and measures to improve growth prospects, which would focus on agriculture,
hydrocarbon and mining sectors. The IFC is providing support on improving business
procedures for private sector, primarily on subnational levels.



Financial sector surveillance. The Fund will continue with the surveillance of the
financial sector developments and the monitoring of the implementation and operation
of the Financial Services Law.



Statistics. The Fund is providing TA for the subscription to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS). The Fund will also continue to provide support on
enhancing the accounting of mixed-ownership companies, primarily in the
telecommunications, electricity and hydrocarbon sectors, and their inclusion in the fiscal
accounts of the non-financial public sector, given the government’s majority ownership
and control.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
1.
As of September 30, 2013, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) had approved
loans to Bolivia amounting to US$5.23 billion, with disbursements totaling US$3.89 billion.
Bolivia’s outstanding debt to the IDB was approximately US$828.1 million with undisbursed
approved funds for US$972.5 million. During the year, net cash flows to the country were positive
for a fourth year in a row, a trend expected to continue in the base scenario to 2016. At the end of
2007, the IDB unilaterally joined the IMF-WB MDRI initiative, by writing off a total of US$741.1
million in principal payments and US$307.3 millions of future interest payments, generating an
estimated annual fiscal space of more than US$18.0 millions on average.
2.
After the last round of debt relief, the IDB has implemented a new criteria of
allocation of concessional lending which is consistent with the application of the Debt
Sustainability Framework. The IDB lending to Bolivia will follow the operational guidelines for
concessional funds under the Fund of Special Operations (FSO) performance-based allocation
system. Parallel lending operations, modality that blends ordinary and concessional funding, will be
the preferred lending instrument up to 2020.
3.
The IDB and Bolivia have a country strategy covering the period 2011–2015. Under the
country strategy, the IDB has decided to increase financial flows to Bolivia. Beginning 2012, Bolivia,
in the base scenario, will be allocated 20 percent of the concessional element under IDB’s blended
financial conditions. In 2013, Bolivia enjoyed an annual allocation of US$356.50 millions; the base
scenario for the period 2013–2014 is the approval of new loans US$356.5 million per year.
4.
Under the Bank’s country strategy with Bolivia, the government and the IDB have
agreed on two main objectives: sustainable growth and poverty-inequality reduction. In
pursuit of these objectives, the Bank will align its actions with those on Bolivia’s National
Development Plan. The country strategy will target its interventions in the following sectors: (i)
Transport; (ii) Water and sanitation; (iii) Energy; (iv) Early Childhood Development (ECD); (v) Health;
(vi) Education; and (vii) Institutional and Sustainability Strengthening. As overarching sectors, the IDB
will focus on climate change and indigenous population/diversity issues.
5.
As of September 30, 2013, the portfolio of executing sovereign guaranteed operations
in Bolivia consists of 35 loans totaling US$1.30 billion, of which 26.9 percent has been
disbursed. The current executing portfolio supports mostly transport, water and sanitation, and
energy infrastructure interventions. The undisbursed sovereign portfolio is concentrated (56 percent)
in the above mentioned sectors. The non-sovereign guaranteed executing portfolio consists of 5
loans ascending to US$29.0 million and two TFFP´s ascending to US$3.7 million. The Bank’s 2013
operative program portfolio contains six sovereign guaranteed loans for a total amount of US$378.5
million, which will be concentrated in transport, water and sanitation, airports, urban development,
and the strengthening of public governance, and two non-sovereign guaranteed loans for a total

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BOLIVIA

amount of US$22 million. Six additional loans for US$334.5 million have been identified for the
pipeline 2014.
6.
The conditions for the strategy’s implementation remain complex, with important
institutional, social, and political definitions yet to be clarified thus representing direct and
indirect risks to the fulfillment of the strategy objectives. In the new country strategy several
macroeconomics, institutional, and regulatory risks have been identified to pose direct and indirect
challenges to the implementation scenarios of the Bank’s strategic engagement. Particularly relevant
for the new country strategy are the financial implications of the country’s excessive dependence on
oil revenues, the weak policy implementation and institutional capacity affecting public investment,
and the problematic regulatory environment that keeps downgrading the investment climate.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of November 26, 2013)

A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ plans to further strengthen the quality and timelines of statistics, which
includes updating the base of the national accounts, implementing the agricultural and economic
census, reinstating the employment survey, and working towards full subscription of the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
National Accounts: The National Institute of Statistics (INE) is in the final stage of updating the
base year of the national accounts (from 1990 to 2007), which includes the implementation of the
System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA 1993) and some of the most relevant recommendations of
the SNA 2008. INE plans to release preliminary results (year 2007–2012) by June 2014 and definitive
series by the end of the year.
Labor market: The quality of the household and employment surveys has declined in the last few
years, due mainly to financial constraints. The quarterly employment survey was discontinued in
2003, leading to a lack of quarterly information on unemployment, employment and wages. Yearly
information on wages is still compiled by INE.
Prices statistics: Industrial producer price indices and external trade unit values are compiled by
INE, but are in need of revision in regards to concepts and definitions consistent with SNA 1993, as
well as treatment of seasonal products, missing items, quality changes, and introduction of new
products.
Government finance statistics: The ongoing implementation of a comprehensive financial
management system, with funding from the IADB/WB, will help ensure proper monitoring of public
sector financial operations including subnational fiscal operations, debt, and social spending. It will
also be important to improve on the reporting of the operations and debt of public enterprises. In
particular, mixed-ownership companies, primarily in the telecommunications, electricity and
hydrocarbon sectors, should be included in the fiscal accounts of the non-financial public sector,
given the government’s majority ownership and control.
Balance of payments: The coverage of certain services and financial transactions in the balance of
payments has been expanded, following recommendations by the January 2007 Data ROSC mission.

B. Data Standards and Quality
Bolivia has participated in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since November 2002.
The Data ROSC was published on August 13, 2007. In October 2013, a Special Data Dissemination
Standard assessment mission was conducted. The mission found that the statistical system of Bolivia
is, in general, in a good position to graduate to the SDDS in the mid-term.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By

Prepared by the Staff from the International Monetary Fund

Miguel Savastano and
Chris Lane
Bolivia’s public debt declined sharply following MDRI debt relief in 2006–07 and debt
sustainability has continued to improve, supported by overall fiscal surpluses since then.
Under the baseline scenario, debt ratios continue to display ample margins with respect to
risk thresholds and are expected to decline further in the medium to long term. Debt
service is projected to remain low, reflecting predominantly long maturities of both
domestic and foreign debt. The path of debt ratios deteriorates under standard stress tests,
especially for total public debt, but would remain well below indicative thresholds. The risk
of debt distress remains low. An alternative scenario was also prepared, which assumes no
augmentation of current natural gas reserves and thus a shorter resource horizon
compared to the baseline. Under this alternative scenario, debt ratios would start to climb
after the mid-2020s when current proven gas reserves are expected to be exhausted.

BOLIVIA

BACKGROUND
1.
Bolivia’s gross public debt declined sharply following MDRI debt relief and has continued to
fall owing to consecutive years of overall fiscal surpluses and strong economic growth. Gross debt
dropped from 95.7 percent of GDP in 2003 to 40.5 percent in 2007 and subsequently to 33.4 percent in
2012. The decline in external public debt—to 14.8 percent of GDP in 2011 from 65.0 percent in 2003—
reversed in 2012 to 15.7 percent of GDP as Bolivia issued the first international bond since the 1920s of
US$ 0.5 billion. External public debt is projected to increase further in 2013 following the second issuance
of an international bond of US$0.5 billion in August 2013.
2.
Bolivia’s changing debt structure and the accumulation of significant public sector deposits
at the central bank have further reduced debt vulnerabilities. With the reduction in external debt and
the shift to domestic debt in Bolivianos, foreign currency exposure has been reduced since 2005. In
addition, almost all domestic debt had maturities exceeding five years at end-2012, compared to only
about ⅔ in 2005, and 87.7 percent of external public debt had maturities exceeding eleven years. With the
accumulation of net deposits of the non-financial public sector at the Central Bank, net public debt (i.e.,
gross debt minus net central bank credit) declined to 11.1 percent of GDP in 2012 from 87.8 percent in
2003. The effective interest rate of the total public debt was 3.4 percent in 2012.

BASELINE AND ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
3.

2

The main assumptions of the baseline scenario for the period of 2013–2033 are:


Average annual real GDP growth: 6.7 percent in 2013, 5.4 percent in 2014, 5 percent
until 2018 and 4 percent thereafter.



Inflation (CPI, period average): 5.9 percent in 2013, 6.8 percent in 2014, and 5 percent in
2015–2033. Reflecting the food supply shocks of mid-2013, inflation assumptions for
2013–14 are higher than in last year’s DSA.



External sector: in line with the medium term staff projections through 2018, and based
on stable import and export ratios to GDP over the long term. Net FDI is assumed to
remain stable at 3 percent of GDP through 2020, and decline gradually over the long
term, mainly influenced by foreign investment in the natural resource sector.



Fiscal assumptions and financing strategy: in line with the medium term staff
projections until 2018. For 2019–33, a primary surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP is assumed
for the non-financial public sector (a surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP on average over
2018–32 in the previous DSA), on the basis of stable international oil prices and public
expenditure as a share of GDP. CAF is expected to remain the largest external lender.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BOLIVIA



Average concessionality of public external debt: around 27 percent in the medium
term, based on projected disbursements of official loans and the concessional financing
conditions.

4.
To assess the impact of the exhaustion of natural gas reserves, the following assumptions
are made under an alternative scenario with a shorter resource horizon:


Natural resource horizon: The authorities have increased efforts to develop new gas
exploration areas. Given the uncertainty and length of this process, an alternative
scenario assesses the debt sustainability implications of a shorter resource horizon based
only on current proven gas reserves. In line with the current reserves and staff’s medium
term production assumptions, the resource horizon is assumed to last through 2025.



Fiscal assumptions: With the assumed loss of hydrocarbon related revenues, the
primary balance of non-financial public sector is projected to worsen to a deficit of
around 8 percent of GDP on average in 2026–33.

5.
Under the baseline scenario, Bolivia’s public and external debt are expected to remain
sustainable throughout the projection period. 1 Bolivia is classified as medium performer in terms of its
policy and institutional capacity, measured by the three year average of the World Bank’s Country Policy
and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) scores. The gross non-financial sector public debt is projected to
decline to 22 percent of GDP by 2018 from 33 percent in 2012, then to 11 percent by 2033. Total external
debt (including private) is projected to decline to 16 percent in 2018 and 10 percent by 2033, from
20 percent in 2012. All the debt burden indicators for Bolivia are well below the specific indicative
thresholds for medium performers.
6.
Under the shorter resource horizon scenario, the debt trajectory starts to worsen from mid2020, reflecting the assumed exhaustion of current proven gas reserves. The public debt-to-GDP ratio
is projected to bottom out at 21 percent in 2020 and increase to 32 percent by 2025. With the larger
primary deficit, public debt could rise to around 61 percent of GDP by 2033.

STRESS TEST
7.
Standard stress tests on the baseline scenario suggest that Bolivia’s low public and external
indebtedness is resilient to a series of shocks. Under the most extreme stress test to external debt—one
time 30 percent nominal depreciation relative to the baseline in 2014—the ratio of the PV of debt to GDP
deteriorates by around 8½ percentage points on impact, but converges to the trajectory under the
baseline scenario in the medium to long term. All the external debt indicators remain well below the

1

Remittances in Bolivia represent about 4 percent of GDP and 9 percent of goods and services exports. If we take
remittances into account, there are no breaches of (modified) thresholds under the baseline or stress tests in the
DSA. The inclusion of remittances does not lead to a change in the risk rating, which remains low.

threshold in extreme stress scenarios. For public debt, the most extreme risk arises from a temporary shock
to real GDP growth, but the stress tests indicate that debt ratios remain well below indicative thresholds.
8.
Bolivia’s risk of debt distress is low. Based on the analysis under the baseline and the most
extreme stress test, staff and the authorities concurred that Bolivia’s risk of debt distress is low, and its debt
is expected to be sustainable over the medium and long term. The authorities highlighted that they have
successfully reduced the public debt-to-GDP ratio to one of the lowest in the region. Moreover, they noted
that the improvement in the maturity structure and the systemic decline in external debt service indicators
pointed to limited liquidity risks.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. The high levels of residuals over the projection period are explained by
the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, and increase in foreign assets related to FINPRO and management of bank reserve requirement on foreign currency deposits.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Statement by IMF Staff Representative on Bolivia
January 27, 2014
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the
issuance of the staff report. The information does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
Recent macroeconomic developments are in line with the staff report except for
end-year inflation.


Inflation moderated to 6.5 percent y/y in December, closing the year below the
7.5 percent projected in the staff report. An unanticipated decline in the prices of key
food items in the last two months of the year accounts for the difference between the
staff projection and the outturn. Core inflation (excluding food, fuels, and
administered prices) edged up to 5.1 percent y/y in December.



Fiscal outturns through November showed an overall surplus of 3.7 percent of GDP
(5.5 percent of GDP in the same period of 2012). The 2014 Budget Law approved by
Congress in December was in line with the fiscal projections and targets presented in
the staff report.



Net international reserves reached US$14.4 billion at end-2013 (48.4 percent of
projected 2013 GDP). The external current account recorded a surplus of 3.8 percent
of GDP through September (5.5 percent of GDP in the same period of 2012).

3.
On December 23, a supreme decree set lending rates for social housing and
credit quotas for social housing and the productive sector. The ceiling on lending rates
for social housing ranges from 5.5 to 6.5 percent depending on the value of the property.
Existing mortgages can be renegotiated at the regulated rates. For housing financial
institutions, the minimum credit quota for social housing was set at 50 percent. For
commercial banks, the minimum quota for social housing and the productive sector
combined was set at 60 percent, and for microfinance institutions at 50 percent. Commercial
banks and microfinance institutions will have five years (housing financial institutions four
years) to comply with the quotas. The national development bank, now a first-tier public
bank, is exempt from the decree.
4.
On December 26, a new law on public enterprises was approved. The goal of
strategic enterprises in mining, energy, telecommunications, transport and other areas will be
generating profits to finance social policies. The goal of social enterprises will be generating
employment, providing services, and intervening in the market to avoid distortions. The law
creates the Strategic Public Enterprises Council to establish policies, approve strategic plans,
and appoint and dismiss enterprises’ directors. The law requires external audits and the
submission of the enterprises’ budget to the ministry of finance and Congress.

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Bolivia
On January 27, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Bolivia.
Good macroeconomic performance and active social policies since the mid-2000s have helped
Bolivia to nearly triple income per capita and reduce poverty. In recent years, the economy
benefitted from high international commodity prices and rising volumes of natural gas exports.
Coupled with twin surpluses in the fiscal and external accounts, net international reserves have
increased to almost 50 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), providing ample buffers against
external shocks. Social policies have pursued ambitious redistributive and poverty reduction
goals, increasing living standards of vulnerable households.
Real GDP growth is projected at 6.7 percent in 2013, the highest growth rate of the last thirty
years, supported by soaring hydrocarbon exports, strong private consumption, and
accommodative macroeconomic policies. Growth is projected to remain above potential again in
2014, sustained by hydrocarbon exports and a moderate fiscal impulse. Notwithstanding elevated
export volumes, the external current account surplus is expected to narrow in 2013 and over the
medium term on the back of softer terms of trade.
Food supply shocks triggered an increase in inflation in mid-2013, but the authorities responded
with rapid monetary tightening and measures to improve food supply. Staff expects the
authorities will succeed in anchoring inflation expectations and inflation is projected to fall to
5.5 percent by the end of 2014, though further tightening may be needed if inflationary pressures
prove persistent.
The fiscal stance is expected to remain expansionary, with important investment projects to
industrialize the resource sector in the pipeline. The overall fiscal surplus is projected to narrow

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

to 0.6 percent of GDP in 2013 and turn to an overall deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2014. Gross
public debt is expected to continue its downward trajectory to 32.5 percent of GDP by end-2013,
from 40 percent of GDP in 2009.
The Bolivian financial system remains solid and well capitalized, but the new Financial Services
Law could alter significantly the financial landscape. The law establishes a comprehensive legal
framework for the regulation of financial services, financial institutions, and financial groups.
The law includes several good provisions that, if effectively implemented, will help strengthen
the safety net and the integrity of the financial system. However, the law’s general thrust is to
subordinate financial sector activities to social objectives with instruments that could create risks
to financial stability. Main features of the law include: (i) provisions to regulate lending rates and
set minimum lending quotas for the productive sector and social housing; (ii) discretion to set
floors on deposit rates; and (iii) mechanisms to enhance consumer protection and financial
access in rural areas.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Bolivia’s strong economic performance in 2013, which saw
higher economic growth, strong fiscal and external positions, and improved standards of living.
They noted that the near-term outlook is favorable, but encouraged the authorities to address
some vulnerabilities and improve the policy frameworks.
Directors agreed that a neutral macroeconomic policy stance is appropriate for the period ahead
in view of the favorable growth outlook and the closed output gap. Accordingly, they encouraged
the authorities to avoid a pro-cyclical fiscal stimulus and save budgetary resources to respond to
adverse external shocks. More broadly, Directors stressed the need to improve the
non-hydrocarbon fiscal balance to secure medium-term sustainability. Measures could include
better targeting fuel subsidies, enhancing the efficiency of public investment and social transfers,
and implementing tax administration reforms. Taking note of the authorities’ plans, Directors
also encouraged the adoption of a medium-term fiscal framework to manage resource wealth,
balancing intergenerational equity against immediate development needs.
Directors commended the authorities’ response to the rise in inflation in mid-2013. They
generally agreed that further monetary tightening could be needed if second-round effects prove
persistent. Directors noted that continued reliance on market-based allocation of financial
resources is important and recommended that central bank lending to public enterprises be
discontinued. They considered that a savings fund established in line with international best

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

practices could help channel such lending. Directors generally saw merit in gradually allowing
greater exchange rate flexibility to help absorb external shocks.
Directors took note of the sound state of Bolivia’s financial sector but stressed the need to
continue to strengthen supervision. While recognizing the social objectives of the new Financial
Services Law, Directors considered that less distortionary instruments to promote financial
inclusion could be employed. Directors welcomed Bolivia’s strengthened framework against
money laundering and terrorist financing and urged its implementation.
Directors commended the authorities’ progress in reducing poverty. They called for continued
efforts to address longstanding social challenges, which could be grounded in a comprehensive
evaluation of existing programs. They also noted that the changing world hydrocarbon market
calls for broadening the economic base and raising productivity to sustain strong growth. In this
regard, Directors emphasized the importance of improving the business climate, including by
creating a predictable legal framework, to promote private sector activity. Greater investment in
infrastructure and human capital will also be critical.

Statement by Sergio Chodos, Alternate Executive Director for Bolivia
and Victor Hugo De la Barra, Senior Advisor
January 27, 2014
Background
During the past eight years, including the period of international crisis, the Plurinational State
of Bolivia has consolidated macroeconomic stability and it has grown at an average rate of 5
percent. The ongoing reform process is based on the implementation of the so-called
Bolivian economic, social, productive and communitarian model in which the state plays a
leading role. In this model the macroeconomic stability is fundamental to achieve economic
development with income redistribution and industrialization of natural resources.
The authorities regret that the staff throughout the report does not give enough merit to the
industrialization and economic policies aimed at achieving a higher level of growth in
Bolivia, attributing growth in recent years to the external context only.
Economic Overview
In 2013, Bolivia reached the highest growth of the past three decades, as well as a substantial
improvement in the standard of living of the population, thanks to the successful social
programs aimed at reducing inequality in the income distribution. This growth rate was
mainly driven by domestic demand.
Hydrocarbons and manufacturing—in similar magnitude—led the dynamism of the
economy, followed by financial services and transport. Figures from the National Institute of
Statistics (INE) show that as of the third quarter of 2013 the cumulative growth was 6.7
percent of which 96 percent was domestic demand driven. The authorities believe that the
staff is overstating the importance of the risk coming from Bolivia’s ties with Brazil and
Argentina, which are quite obvious due to the historical integration and their regional and
global weight. In addition, according to growth projections for Brazil and Argentina included
in the WEO, this risk is limited even in the medium term. On the other hand, it would have
been more useful if the staff analyzed the process that the Plurinational State of Bolivia went
through to reduce its external vulnerability and the role of the industrialization and economic
policies implemented in the last eight years. The authorities commented extensively on the
robustness of the risk estimates by the staff.
Macroeconomic stability is reflected in a set of indicators such as: sustained surpluses in the
fiscal and external accounts, the dynamism of economic activity, stable prices, and high
levels of international reserves and stability of the financial system, among others. These
indicators are positive and are associated with the economic stability in the last eight years.
Therefore; the authorities disagree with the assessment that the resilience of the economy
was supported mainly by commodity prices given that their boom began much earlier than
2006 and had a short duration. The authorities reiterate that it is important to strike the right
balance at the time of assessing the importance of commodity prices in the Bolivian
economic performance.

2

Macroeconomic policy has succeeded in isolating the country from the effects of
international crises since substantial buffers have been built to deal with any external shocks,
which have provided sufficient confidence to economic agents. These, along with the
orientation towards a greater role of the state in the economy, have enabled sustained growth,
greater potential output and substantial improvements in the quality of life of the population,
thus unemployment has been declining every year. In 2013 the unemployment rate was 3.2
percent while in 2006 it was 8 percent.
Fiscal Policy
Control over current spending has been crucial, as well as the use of fiscal space to increase
capital spending. The electoral process of the year 2014 will have no impact on fiscal
sustainability, taking into account that in elections and referendums carried out between 2006
and 2012, fiscal revenue was always higher than expenditure, reflecting the authorities’
commitment to fiscal discipline. In 2013 the fiscal stance ended up once more with a surplus
of 0.1 percent of GDP.
Capital spending accelerated significantly contributing to the remarkable growth in 2013.
Economic development relies on a steady expansion of public investment as Bolivia requires
expanding its infrastructure and moving forward in the process of industrialization of its raw
materials for economic diversification. In 2012 public investment amounted to $2,897
million while in 2013 the execution of the public investment budget will be greater, as
numbers show a level of $ 2,854 million as of November. Tax revenue has been strengthened
in recent years with measures that allow increasing the scope of the tax base, improving the
efficiency of tax administration, combating tax fraud and imposing new sanctions for noncompliance with tax obligations.
The staff has expressed worries about the non-hydrocarbon fiscal deficit. In response, it is
necessary to mention that in recent years the authorities have established a range of policies
in order to diversify the economy towards other extractive and non-extractive sectors, the
positive results of which have been levied in the short and medium term. The scope of public
investment is broad and not only addressed in the hydrocarbon sector. In addition, it is
necessary to reiterate the remarkable levels of protection in public savings, international
investment position, and international reserves which reached nearly 50 percent of GDP,
standing out as the highest in the region.
Fiscal policy may have a more active role to the extent that economic activity may have
difficulties going forward as a result of new shocks, whether external or internal. In addition,
the considerable withdrawal of liquidity by the Central Bank of Bolivia (BCB) gives margin
to monetary impulse if necessary.
The authorities are aware of the need for greater investment in oil exploration; therefore, the
State oil company (YPFB) is implementing an ambitious plan of investment, with particular
emphasis on exploration which, as we all know, takes time. In addition to investments made
in 2013 that enabled the company to increase gas reserves for about 3 trillion cubic feet,

3
YPFB aims to sign 18 new contracts for exploration in a time span of 10 years, which could
imply increasing gas reserves up to 18 trillion cubic feet.
The staff has recommended abandoning the direct financing of the BCB to public enterprises
under the argument of possible quasi fiscal losses. However, such financing is an important
contribution to the process of industrialization and expansion of the output base. In addition,
risks are limited and manageable since the financed projects have financial, economic and
social high-yield. As a matter of example, the BCB is financing the construction of a urea
and ammonia plant which will become operational in 2015 and will produce 432,000 and
756,000 metric tons of urea and ammonia respectively. It should be emphasized that the BCB
has lent to strategic pubic enterprises which not only represent interest income but mainly
more efficient use of national resources as opposed to financial investment. Taking into
account recommendations from the staff, the authorities would appreciate a working paper to
discuss the accounting treatment of the resources set aside to be lent to public corporations
which are currently managed by the BCB as part of its balance sheet.
The authorities do not concur that there is absence of a framework that specifies the
establishment and functioning of the Fund for Productive and Industrial Revolution
(FINPRO) in a transparent manner, which would lead to a "mismanagement of funds".
FINPRO has been regulated by Supreme Decree No. 1367 and its resources are managed
through a trust which guarantees their preservation. Each project it finances must be
approved by supreme decree.
Since 2006 the BCB counts on a short-term planning instrument: the Fiscal-Financial
Program, which is agreed annually between the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance
(MEFP) and the BCB, for establishing macroeconomic targets which have been satisfactorily
achieved since then. In the same way, a medium-term fiscal framework is under preparation
in accordance with the constitutional mandate for economic planning.
With regard to the setup of savings and/or stabilization funds, these are already considered
within the Autonomy and Decentralization Law framework. In the meantime, the results of
the budget execution of the sub-national governments (municipalities and governorates) and
universities have also produced surpluses in recent years, which for practical purposes are
fiscal savings.
The Plurinational State of Bolivia enjoys a greater capacity for public indebtedness because it
has reached a sustainable level of external debt, which is not at risk even though the
exploration for new oil and gas deposits would not lead to increases in gas reserves in the
short term. External public debt represents only 14 percent of GDP and is among the lowest
levels in the region, standing below the maximum limits recommended by international
organizations. It is also necessary to point out that the placement of public debt is up to a 50year maturity as few countries do, which ratifies the confidence of the Bolivian private sector
in the economic stability of the country.

4
Monetary Policy
Since the fourth quarter of 2012, the BCB has gradually reduced the liquidity of the financial
system by increasing the supply and the placement of monetary regulation instruments,
allowing moderated increases in interest rates. Gradualism in these operations was in
accordance with a context of slowing global growth (especially in Bolivia’s trading partners),
minor external inflationary pressures, but risk of internal inflation which, however, did not
justify more restrictive policies. These gradual increases in rates preserved the dynamism of
economic activity.
Inflationary pressures appeared in August 2013 because of rising prices of three products of
the food basket, meaning that such pressures did not arise from a monetary impulse but from
a transitory supply shock. Those increases were caused by adverse weather conditions (frost
and drought), and disruption in commercialization channels and speculation. The authorities
reacted quickly to solve the problem of supply, normalize the flow of those products and
reverse the situation in the last two months of the year.
The response of the BCB through liquidity management has been suitable as the results
show. By the end of 2013 monetary conditions tightened preventing second-round effects
from inflationary pressures in August and September. The pace of open market operations
accelerated and two new highly effective mechanisms were implemented to rapidly withdraw
liquidity: i) the direct placement of BCB’s deposit certificates to pension funds and ii)
supplementary reserve requirement to financial intermediaries. In addition, the base of
foreign-currency denominated deposits subject to reserve requirements was expanded while
the prudential limits on consumer credit were raised.
It is inappropriate to associate second-round effects from the supply shock in August to
liquidity conditions in early 2013. According to the staff report, inflation in the first seven
months was kept at low levels. Moreover, inflation trend indicators remained stable and core
inflation did not reach 4.9 percent yoy in any month of 2013, as the staff argues. On the
contrary, core inflation ended up at 4.1 percent, lower than 2012’s (4.8 percent).
The recommendation to move to greater exchange rate flexibility has been present in Article
IV reports in recent years. The authorities emphasize that exchange rate policy is adequate in
light of the high volatility observed in international monetary and exchange markets. The
Plurinational State of Bolivia continues to apply successfully measures to de-dollarize its
economy. The exchange-rate policy allows sufficient flexibility to respond to changes in the
international context and—as the staff also points out—there is no misalignment of the real
exchange rate. A retrospective study on the hypothetical implementation of a more or full
flexible exchange rate policy in a context of high exchange rate volatility in the region
between 2008 and 2010 would be appreciated by the authorities, as well as its impact on the
process of de-dollarization.

5
Financial Services Law
The recently enacted Financial Services Law (FSL) goes beyond the macro-prudential
recommendations set out by Basel II and Basel III. This law aims to democratize access to
credit through the use of affordable guarantees to the population, generate better conditions
for savings, protect the consumer who uses financial services, strengthen supervision to the
financial system and promote operations of state banks, among other aspects.
The staff report magnifies the risks to financial stability that this law would entail arguing
about the introduction of distortions in the allocation of resources, negative effects on the
profitability of financial institutions, exposure to additional risks and granting broader
powers to the government, which would cause regulatory uncertainty. A more rigorous
analysis is required to back up these statements given that several provisions embodied in
this law were already being applied before the FSL, enacting without creating additional risk
to the financial system. For example, the termination of contracts without penalty and the
prepayment are provisions that were already approved in previous laws. In addition,
regulations of FSL were worked out alongside financial institutions’ staff, who did not
express concern, as the staff does.
The diagnosis made by the staff is orthodox with a strong position leaning towards financial
liberalization which would be at the expense of financial inclusion and the need for financial
institutions to endorse social and output- oriented goals. Financial markets are imperfect and
present asymmetries of information that impel government intervention to make financial
activities more efficient. This opinion is internationally growing consensus, especially after
the latest international financial crisis generated by an excessive financial deregulation.
Conversely to the staff’s position, this law preserves the stability of the financial system
through measures such as greater capital requirements, particularly in boom periods. The
regulation of interest rates included in the FSL does not cover all rates, but only those
negotiated in loans for social housing and manufacturing.
The staff mentioned that this law would entail complications to the conduct of monetary
policy; however, it must be clarified that the main legislative body of the financial system
will be the Financial Stability Council (composed by the President of the BCB, the
Executive Director of the Authority's for Financial Supervision (ASFI) and the Minister of
Economy and Finance). Within this Council the objectives of monetary policy will be
harmonized with the provisions of the FSL. We are of the view that analysis of the FSL
should have been done in the Article IV report of the following year, once all regulations and
the immediate effects of its implementation are available.
Structural Reforms, Uncertainty and Poverty Reduction
There is no uncertainty for private investment given that some reforming legislation is under
preparation. The country has an Investment Law in place which was approved in September
1990. In addition, in 2009 the Constitution approved mandates protection for private property
and fair rules for private investment. A draft to reform such law in accordance with the
Constitution’s provisions was elaborated in consensus with the private sector representatives

6
and sent to the Legislative Assembly. To counterargument the existence of uncertainty it is
worth mentioning that foreign direct investment went from $ 1,060 million in 2012 to $
1,366 million as of September 2013.
It should be clear that the Government of Bolivia—in the process of nationalization of
strategic companies that were privatized in the past—has not expropriated any privatelyowned capital but compensated fairly to investors, after a process of assessment and
negotiation. Some of these processes have needed more time than others.
The process of reforming the legal framework for extractive sectors involves achieving the
necessary consensus to ensure sustainability. The Law of Public Enterprises to reform and
modernize the regulatory framework for these types of companies has recently been
approved.
On social policies, the authorities maintain their commitment to improve the living
conditions for the population through building basic infrastructure (water, sanitation, and
roads) as well as increasing public expenditure to provide better education and health
services. Key to that end, and also to reduce poverty, is the program of conditional cashtransfers to keep elementary school students on track and to entice pregnant women to attend
regular pre-natal and pediatric checkups. The non-conditional cash transfer for the elderly
will also continue as a universal retirement pension in addition to the benefits for the
affiliates to the pension system. These programs aim to enhance domestic demand. As a
result of such policies, extreme poverty has been reduced from 38.2 percent in 2005 to 21.6
percent in 2012. The authorities are still not comfortable with the prevalent level of poverty
and intend to reduce it further by expanding the social safety net and improving access to
basic infrastructure across the country.
