INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation and Request for a Three-Year
Arrangement Under the Extended Credit Facility
Prepared by the Middle East and Central Asia Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by David Owen and Tom Dorsey
June 2, 2011
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: The Kyrgyz economy is recovering from a deep political crisis last year. In April 2010, a
popular uprising toppled the previous regime and internal ethnic conflict in June 2010 exacerbated the
already difficult political situation. The subsequent constitutional referendum and parliamentary elections in
October 2010 have helped to stabilize the political situation and put the economy on a path of recovery,
though the political situation remains fragile. Following the Joint Economic Assessment and the donor
conference in mid-2010, the Fund provided post-crisis support to the Kyrgyz Republic under the Rapid
Credit Facility (RCF). The successful implementation of the RCF-supported policies helped to catalyze
donor assistance and allowed the new authorities to build a track record.
Staff views: Expansionary fiscal policy and rising inflation have raised concerns about the policy mix
going forward. While a limited fiscal expansion in 2011 will support the nascent economic recovery,
consolidation from 2012 will be critical to ensure medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability and support
the central bank’s efforts to curb inflation. Moreover, reducing underlying vulnerabilities in the banking
sector, addressing governance issues, and improving the business environment will be key to enhancing the
role of the private sector in the economy and fully realizing the economy’s growth potential. Productivity
enhancing structural reforms are needed to safeguard external sustainability and support medium-term
growth prospects.
The authorities’ views: The authorities shared staff’s concerns about the risks associated with
expansionary fiscal policy in 2011 and rising inflation, but emphasized that the 2010 fiscal deficit and the
cumulative deficit for 2010–11 is significantly lower than anticipated earlier. They saw merit, however, in
withdrawing fiscal stimulus during 2012 and over the medium term, highlighting that strong growth and
appropriate measures will help boost revenues and reduce the fiscal deficit. They also agreed that
vulnerabilities in the banking sector need to be dealt with swiftly and effectively and that addressing
governance issues, including through the commitment to not create any new extra budgetary funds, will be
important for supporting economic development.
New ECF arrangement: The ECF-supported program (75 percent of quota, SDR 66.6 million) draws from
the authorities’ priorities and supports their efforts to restore macroeconomic stability, rebuild policy
buffers, promote inclusive growth in a low inflation environment, achieve medium-term fiscal
consolidation, address weaknesses in the financial sector, bolster reserves, and catalyze critical donor
support. The ECF arrangement entails risks, but strong conditionality in macrocritical areas, including prior
actions, provides sufficient safeguards.
Relations with the Fund: The Kyrgyz Republic has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4, and its exchange rate system is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current transactions.
The de jure/de facto exchange regime is floating/other managed. The official exchange rate may differ by
more than 2 percent from market rates, giving rise to multiple currency practice, because the official rate is
based on the average transaction weighted rate of the preceding day. In practice, the official and market
rates have never differed by more than 2 percent.

I. EMERGING FROM THE POLITICAL CRISIS1
The Kyrgyz Republic suffered from a deep political crisis last year. In April 2010, a popular
uprising toppled the previous regime and internal ethnic conflict in June 2010 exacerbated
the already difficult political situation. The crisis adversely affected economic activity and
near-term growth prospects, straining the government’s financial position, which was further
worsened by critical reconciliation, recovery and reconstruction needs. Parliamentary
elections took place in October 2010 and a new coalition government took office in
December 2010. The shift to a parliamentary democracy provides a unique opportunity to
break with the past and strengthen governance and reform the economy. The political
situation remains fragile, with presidential elections scheduled for October 2011.
1.
The 2010 political turmoil disrupted economic activity and negatively affected
near-term growth prospects. Border closures, especially with Kazakhstan, hampered the
business of Kyrgyz companies and households involved in trade. The security situation led to
the lowest tourist arrivals in almost a decade. Interruptions in the spring farming season and
problems in harvesting and marketing have led to losses in agricultural production. Rising
global food and fuel prices have posed additional challenges. The banking sector also
suffered from diminished depositor confidence and the economic effects from the events in
the south. Subsequently, the economy contracted by 1.4 percent and inflation rose to nearly
20 percent in 2010.
2.
Timely and well coordinated efforts by the international community have helped
to prevent the Kyrgyz economy from plunging into a much deeper recession. The Fund,
together with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank led two Joint Economic
Assessment missions to evaluate economic damage from the shocks in 2010. The
US$1.1 billion worth of pledges made by the international community at the donor
conference in July 2010 (US$380 million of which have been contracted so far) have
provided important financial underpinnings for implementing the government’s anti-crisis
program. Along with technical assistance, the Fund provided important financial support (in
the amount of 25 percent of quota, SDR 22.2 million) under the RCF in September 2010. The
support under the RCF helped to catalyze pledged donor assistance and allowed the Kyrgyz
authorities to build a track record ahead of a medium-term program engagement with the
Fund.

1

Discussions were held in Bishkek during April 20–May 4, 2011. The staff team comprised Mr. Beddies
(head), Messrs. Amaglobeli and Shukurov (MCD), Mr. Rota Graziosi (FAD), Ms. Knight (LEG),
Ms. Kongsamut (MCM), Mr. Rayner (SPR), and Mr. Gvenetadze (Resident Representative). The team met with
President Otunbayeva, Prime Minister Atambaev, Minister of Finance Mambetjanov, Acting Chairperson of the
National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) Jeenbaeva, Minister of Economic Regulation Tashbaev, other
senior government officials, and representatives of the donor community and civil society. The mission also
organized a public seminar to present the findings of a recent study on inflation in the region.

5
3.
Stabilization of the security situation allowed the interim government to conduct
a constitutional referendum and parliamentary elections, which led to the formation of
a new coalition government. The outcome of the June 2010 constitutional referendum
shifted the balance of powers toward the parliament and set the stage for the first
parliamentary democracy in Central Asia. The recent changes in the political landscape
present a unique opportunity to address long-standing governance problems that were the
root cause for not completing the two remaining reviews under the 2008 Exogenous Shocks
Facility (ESF).2
4.
Against this background, one of the main objectives of the new Kyrgyz coalition
government is to restore and maintain macroeconomic stability. While supporting the
nascent economic recovery in the near term is essential to maintain political stability, fiscal
consolidation in 2012 and beyond will be critical to rebuild policy buffers and promote
inclusive private sector-led growth in a low inflation environment. To support this effort, the
authorities have requested Fund support under a three-year ECF arrangement, which will be
instrumental in securing much-needed donor assistance. The ECF arrangement draws from
the government’s priorities and builds on the findings of the recently concluded Ex Post
Assessment (EPA) of Longer Term Program Engagement. EPA findings are summarized in
Box 1.

2

The government’s decision to entrust the management of the bulk of bilateral donor assistance received in
2009 to a newly created extra-budgetary fund became the main stumbling block for completing the remaining
ESF reviews. Ultimately, the sovereign funds invested overseas have been returned to the central bank; the ESF
expired on June 9, 2010.

6
Box 1. Kyrgyz Republic: Lessons Learned from the Ex Post Assessment
The EPA report reviewed the Kyrgyz Republic’s economic performance under Fund-supported
programs from early 2005 to mid-2010. Two Fund-supported programs were assessed: the March
2005 arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF, which expired in May
2008), and the December 2008 ESF arrangement (which expired in June 2010). The main conclusions
of the EPA are as follows:
 Macroeconomic performance under Fund-supported programs in the Kyrgyz Republic in the
period under review (2005–10) was generally satisfactory.
 However, progress in promoting structural reforms and in improving the transparency of
government operations was disappointing. Lack of progress in economic governance could
jeopardize macroeconomic stability over the medium term, and exposes the Fund to reputational
risk.
 A new three-year Fund supported program could be very helpful during the reconstruction period.
Given the Kyrgyz Republic’s protracted balance of payments need, an ECF arrangement that
could help to finance this need, catalyze support from other donors and address structural issues
would play a key role in supporting macroeconomic management over the next few years. Such a
Fund-supported program should ensure fiscal consolidation over the medium term to avoid a
renewed build-up of debt, and rebuild macroeconomic policy buffers.
Structural reform of key sectors will need to be addressed forcefully under a new ECF
arrangement. Structural conditionality will need to be carefully designed, be based on a homegrown
development strategy, take into account implementation capacity, and be coordinated with other
donors, in particular the World Bank. It must be meaningful without being perceived as
intrusive—ownership of reforms remains crucial. In particular:
 In the financial sector, a level playing field needs to be maintained, including by strengthening the
central bank’s independence and supervisory capacity. The role of the courts in financial stability
matters should be reduced, and financial sector transparency and accountability standards raised.
 In the energy sector, below cost recovery tariff levels, high technical and commercial loses, and
poor governance need to be addressed. However, given the Fund’s limited expertise in energy
sector issues, close cooperation with key donors will be important.
The EPA also highlighted that key risks associated with renewed engagement under an ECF
arrangement will need to be carefully managed.
 The resolution of security issues, especially through reconciliation in the south, is a precondition
for sustainable economic development.
 Weak governance remains a key concern—while reducing corruption and the perception of
corruption will need to be a top priority for the new government, progress in the area has proven
elusive in the period under review in the EPA.
 Program design and monitoring of implementation will need to be mindful of the risks associated
with weak governance.
 Exogenous shocks will likely continue to affect program performance. A solid performance under
the RCF provides some comfort, but no guarantees.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
While there are early signs of recovery from the economic contraction in 2010, the situation
remains fragile with inflation at more than 20 percent. The political crisis has disrupted
trade flows, agricultural production, construction, and tourism, which led to a shift in the
current account from surplus to deficit. Fiscal policy has been expansionary, albeit less than
anticipated, and monetary policy was tightened toward the end of the year to counter rising
inflation.
5.
Following the economic contraction in 2010 the Kyrgyz Republic is showing
signs of a gradual recovery.
Growth and inflation


Domestic instability and trade disruptions resulted in nongold GDP contracting by
2 percent in 2010 and overall GDP by 1.4 percent. The gradual normalization of the
political situation and the reopening of borders boosted growth in the first four
months of 2011 with nongold GDP increasing by 3.7 percent and overall GDP by
3.2 percent.



Following the global spike in food and fuel prices, annual inflation has increased
from 3.5 percent in June 2010 to 22.6 percent in April 2011. Latest developments in
2011 suggest that core inflation (excluding food and fuel) has stabilized, and May is
likely to be the first deflationary month in more than a year (see below).

External sector


Agricultural exports, tourism, transportation receipts, and shuttle trade declined as a
result of a lack of security and border closures.3 However, higher international gold
prices mitigated the decline in exports, while remittance inflows increased as Russia,
the source of more than 90 percent of remittances, recovered from the international
financial crisis in 2010.



The border closures also slowed import growth, while the imposition by Russia of a
fuel export duty reduced the volume of fuel imports. The import volume decrease,
however, was outweighed by higher fuel prices leading to an overall increase in the
value of imports.



Consequently, the current account deficit (excluding official transfers) in
2010 deteriorated to almost 4 percent of GDP. Reserve coverage declined somewhat,
but remained at 4.2 months of prospective imports.

3

The Kyrgyz Republic is the only World Trade Organization (WTO) member in Central Asia and also has free
trade arrangements with the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. As a result, the Kyrgyz
Republic has a comparative advantage to transit Chinese exports to CIS countries.

8
Fiscal policy

Tax revenue collections in 2010 turned out somewhat better than projected, in part
due to advance payments made by the largest gold-mining company and efforts to strengthen
tax and customs administration. Moreover, absorptive capacity constraints to implement
capital projects in a highly insecure environment, delays in the government capitalization of a
problem bank, and slow disbursements of external financing led to expenditure
underexecution.

Thus, the overall budget deficit in 2010 was significantly lower than envisaged under
the RCF (6.5 percent versus 12 percent of GDP) and allowed the coalition government to
announce plans to raise wages for education and healthcare employees shortly after taking
office.
Monetary policy and exchange rate

In response to growing inflationary pressures, the NBKR has tightened monetary
policy. Beginning in December 2010 the NBKR has significantly increased sales of its
short-term notes and raised reserve requirements from 8 percent to 9 percent in February
2011.4 Yields on the NBKR notes, which form the basis for the policy rate, rose to
9.5 percent in early May of this year from 2 percent in August 2010. Yields on treasury bills
have followed suit.

The exchange rate had been depreciating and the NBKR intervened to smooth
short-term volatility, which helped to absorb som liquidity. Subsequently, interventions
combined with active open market operations and a tighter fiscal stance in the first quarter of
2011 resulted in a slowdown in year-on-year reserve money growth from 18.5 percent in
December 2010 to 14.5 percent in March 2011. More recently, the exchange rate has been
appreciating, in part owing to strong remittances inflows but it is uncertain how sustainable
this trend will be. While remaining above 50 percent, deposit dollarization has somewhat
declined.
Financial sector

The crisis contributed to a change in the banking sector landscape. During the April
2010 events, seven banks—including the largest and systemic Asia Universal Bank
(AUB), which was allegedly connected with the outgoing regime—were placed under
temporary administration to prevent capital flight. Ultimately, two banks were released from
temporary administration, four were placed under conservatorship, and AUB was
nationalized. Deposits in those banks shifted to banks perceived as safer, particularly foreign

targeting. The operational framework is primarily based on open market operations and foreign currency
interventions.

9
banks and the largest state-owned bank, the Settlement and Saving Company (SSC), which
has emerged as the second largest bank in the system. AUB lost more than half of its
deposits.

Despite the stress on the system, financial sector stability has been maintained and
depositor runs avoided. The share of nonperforming loans (NPL) increased in the aftermath
of the political events, and the system’s liquidity declined. However, the NPL ratio appears
to have stabilized recently (excluding AUB/Zalkar, which is the newly created “good bank”
resulting from the split of AUB) and system capital adequacy appears comfortable (Text
Table 1).

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Policy actions have been broadly consistent with the recommendations of the 2009 Article IV
consultation, although there were setbacks owing to the political crisis in 2010. The fallout
from the crisis has posed significant near- and medium-term challenges. Against this
background medium-term policies should focus on rebalancing the policy mix to restore
macroeconomic stability and rebuild policy buffers. While limited fiscal expansion in 2011 is
needed to support the nascent economic recovery, consolidation in 2012 and beyond will be
critical to ensure medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability and support the central bank’s
efforts to curb inflation. Moreover, reducing underlying vulnerabilities in the banking sector,
addressing governance issues, and improving the business environment will be key to
enhancing the role of the private sector in the economy and fully realizing the economy’s
growth potential. The authorities plan to prepare a medium-term country development
strategy which would form the basis for a PRSP.
A. Medium-term objectives5
6.
Political stability following this year’s presidential elections and a favorable
external environment should allow the Kyrgyz economy to grow by 6 percent in the
medium term. With continued high oil prices, Russia and Kazakhstan—two large oil
exporting countries in the region—will have positive spillovers on the region, including the
Kyrgyz Republic. Agriculture, tourism, mining and textile production will be important
drivers of growth. Realizing the yet untapped hydro power potential would yield additional
growth dividends. Planned large infrastructure projects and a revival of private sector credit
will also support the authorities’ medium-term growth objectives.
7.
The authorities agreed that addressing corruption and long-standing governance
problems will be instrumental in ensuring sustainable growth.6 The new political
landscape presents a fresh opportunity to introduce governance reforms, which are likely to
generate significant immediate and long-term benefits. In addition to producing budgetary
gains, reducing fiscal risks and improving the business environment, these reforms will help
to instill confidence in public institutions and strengthen resilience to potential shocks.
8.
The authorities realize that despite recent progress in reducing poverty, much
work remains. During 2005–09 aggregate poverty and extreme poverty declined from
43 percent to 32 percent and from 11 percent to 3 percent, respectively. The 2010 events,
followed by a large increase in inflation, have likely resulted in a partial reversal of these
gains. On the other hand, wage increases for social sector employees and the planned
increase in targeted cash transfers to the poor, along with expanded coverage under this
5

corruption perception index.

16
program, will be mitigating factors. Emigration of the younger population has likely
mitigated the adverse impact on unemployment and poverty from the political crisis last year.
Strong growth in the medium term, further development of social safety nets, and
improvements in governance will help to reduce poverty.
9.
Strong export-oriented growth and fiscal consolidation will help to reduce the
current account deficit in the medium term. Continued increases in gold prices and output
along with strong remittance growth will further contribute to deficit reduction. However,
large energy infrastructure projects, which are expected to start from 2012 and have a
significant import component, as well as high food and fuel prices, will prevent the current
account deficit from declining faster. Official development assistance, while slowing, will
remain an important source of financing the current account deficit and will help to maintain
an adequate reserves level. The planned accession to the Belarus-Kazakhstan-Russia customs
union would adversely impact the volume of transit trade from China to the CIS leading to a
deceleration of both import and export growth (Box 2).7
10.
Given a very low level of financial intermediation, further financial deepening is
necessary to support economic growth and help improve monetary policy effectiveness.
Credit to GDP stood at a mere 13 percent in 2010 and is projected to increase to about
20 percent in the medium term. The authorities plan to swiftly address financial sector legacy
issues and create a transparent and level playing field. This should help restore public
confidence in banks. To support financial deepening, the government will increasingly
involve banks in its operations, including by using their services for all government
collections and payments. The authorities will also further develop banking infrastructure,
primarily through the ongoing payment system reform, which will encourage the public to
rely more on banking services.
11.
The authorities acknowledge the importance of an independent and effective
monetary policy as the key anti-inflation instrument. Strengthening de facto
independence will help to boost NBKR credibility and will make combating inflation in the
future less costly. The NBKR will continue to further develop the monetary policy
transmission channel through its efforts to deepen the financial sector and to improve its
policy toolkit. The NBKR and the government will also closely coordinate their policies and
actions. In the medium term, the NBKR will focus on maintaining price stability, as the
primary objective of monetary policy.

7

In April 2011, the authorities submitted an application to the customs union. The negotiation strategy is
currently under preparation, with accession expected in about two years.

17

Box 2. Kyrgyz Republic: The Customs Union (CU)
The Kyrgyz Republic has submitted an application to join the Belarus-Kazakhstan-Russia CU, which
became effective on July 1, 2010. Accession to the CU, which is expected in about two years, may have effects
on external trade and fiscal revenues. Accession may also raise procedural issues, since the Kyrgyz Republic
would be the only member of the CU that is also a member of the WTO. However, because accession
discussions are at a very early stage, the effects of accession remain highly uncertain.
Joining the CU will improve external trade relations with Russia and the other CU members, but will
hamper trade relations with nonmembers, most notably China. The most apparent benefit to the Kyrgyz
economy would be the preservation of petroleum import supplies and prices from other CU members. The
Kyrgyz textile industry may also benefit as the higher common external tariff (CET) under the CU would likely
reduce textile imports from nonmember countries, notably China. There could also be an increase in foreign
direct investment if (manufacturing) businesses in other CU members were to relocate to the Kyrgyz Republic to
take advantage of lower labor costs. The most significant cost of accession would be the loss of transit trade
from re-exporting (mostly Chinese) goods to Russia and other CIS countries, caused by the higher external tariff.
The Kyrgyz Republic would lose its advantage as a cheap access route to the larger markets of Russia and other
CIS countries, with which the Kyrgyz Republic has preferential trade agreements. This transit trade is estimated
to have totaled US$267 million before the effects of the international financial crisis in 2009 and domestic
instability in 2010 (Figure 1).
The effects of the CU on fiscal revenues are unclear at
this stage and will depend on the outcome of
negotiations. The current CET is much higher than the
average tariff applied by the Kyrgyz Republic, but the
potential reduction in volume of the transit trade could have
an adverse impact on domestic revenue collections.
Furthermore, it is not yet known how revenues collected at
the common customs border will be shared with the Kyrgyz
Republic. Options include sharing based on the final
destination or the port of entry of the imported goods, or
some combination thereof. Regardless of the eventual
sharing method, however, the bargaining position of the
Kyrgyz Republic would be improved by efforts to increase
revenues collected by customs prior to accession.

Since the Kyrgyz Republic would be the only member of the CU that is also a member of the WTO, there
may be significant procedural obstacles related to accession. If the Kyrgyz Republic were to adopt the higher
CET of the CU, it would have to offer a compensatory adjustment to WTO members so that the regime would
not be less favorable to trade than the status quo. Typically this compensation would take the form of a reduction
in particular tariff lines, but is not automatic and would require another WTO member to file a grievance against
the Kyrgyz Republic. Since the other CU

B. Addressing immediate challenges to restore macroeconomic stability
12. The risk of continued high inflation in the remainder of the year is a concern.
Projections for international food and fuel prices combined with fiscal expansion in the
second half of the year will put upward pressure on prices. The recent inflation spike was
mainly driven by exogenous factors, but there have been signs that inflation expectations are
rising, pushing up prices on items in the core basket as well (Box 3). However, the latest core
and headline inflation developments and the expected base effect from July, 2011 onwards
would help the NBKR to achieve its end-year inflation objective.
Box 3. Kyrgyz Republic: Inflation—Causes and Outlook
The surge in international food and fuel prices and political instability in 2010 explain the bulk of the
recent hike in inflation. 1 Food constitutes 48 percent of the CPI basket and the Kyrgyz Republic is a net food
importer. Moreover, internal unrest caused shortages and supply bottlenecks in key agricultural products.
Subsequently, food contributed almost 18 percentage points to 22.6 percent headline inflation in April 2011.
However, inflation started to propagate to nonfood components of the CPI basket pointing to higher inflationary
pressures, thereby warranting a policy response. Based on a diffusion index, more than 50 percent of items in the
basket experience price increases. More recent data suggest that prices of items other than food and fuel have
started to stabilize.

The pass-through from international to domestic prices is
quick and relatively complete in the Kyrgyz Republic, unlike
in some neighboring countries. Cumulative inflation in the
Kyrgyz Republic from end-2008 to date, the period covering
two opposite episodes of rising and declining international food
and fuel prices, is comparable with other countries in the region
and the CIS, where the latest inflation reading is much lower
than in the Kyrgyz Republic. Downward rigidity in prices is less
pronounced in the Kyrgyz Republic than in most of the other
countries in the region, which helps domestic inflation to drop
quickly when international food and fuel prices decline.

With international food and fuel prices expected to remain high in 2011, achieving disinflation quickly will
be a challenge. The fiscal expansion in 2011, especially the shift in the composition of spending from capital to
current, will add to inflationary pressures. However, the recent removal of the export fuel duty by Russia, the
expected recovery in agriculture, and an improved security situation along with the timely tightening of monetary
policy, which appears to be already bearing fruit, are important mitigation factors.
_____________

In response to rising wheat prices, the Kyrgyz authorities reduced the customs duty on wheat flour in the third quarter of 2010.
*The 12-month diffusion index is calculated as the number of items in the CPI basket experiencing price increases and one-half of the items
with prices unchanged divided by all items. The “unchanged” category includes items experiencing inflation of 7 percent or less based on the
understanding that 7 percent inflation is a benign level of inflation for the Kyrgyz Republic. A rising index implies that an increasing number
of items are experiencing above normal price increases.

19
13.
The NBKR agreed to stand ready to tighten monetary policy further,
particularly in light of inflationary pressures stemming from the fiscal expansion in
2011 (MEFP ¶20). The actions already taken to slow reserve money growth, combined with
higher reserve requirements, should translate into a deceleration of broad money growth in
2011, compatible with the projected decline in inflation. However, should the wage increase
lead to renewed inflationary pressures, the NBKR will further tighten monetary policy. Tight
monetary policy will also help ease exchange market pressures and limit the effect on
inflation from depreciation.
14.
The approved 2011 budget includes a large wage increase and entails risks on
both revenues and financing. Following the underexecution of last year’s budget, the
authorities decided on a sizable wage increase for social sector workers, effective May 2011,
which will add about 3 percent of GDP to the annual public sector payroll in 2011.
Moreover, the authorities have continued the policy of nominal annual raises in pensions,
implying an additional 0.4 percent of GDP increase in social fund expenditures. The
government recently adopted specific revenue enhancing measures for this year, but there are
risks that revenue projections, external financing and privatization plans may not fully
materialize.8
15.
The authorities concurred that the expansionary 2011 budget may put
additional pressures on inflation. The salary increase helps to mitigate potential risks to
social stability, but it will likely contribute to inflationary pressures.9 While limited fiscal
expansion with a deficit of 7.6 percent of GDP in 2011 is needed to support the nascent
economic recovery, the expansion needs to be moderate compared to the authorities’ earlier
plans. More importantly, significant fiscal consolidation in 2012 and beyond will be critical
to ensure medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability and support the central bank’s efforts to
curb inflation.
16.
Despite a sizable wage bill increase, the magnitude of fiscal expansion this year is
more moderate than earlier projections. Because of significant under-spending in
2010 and a less expansionary fiscal stance in 2011 (largely due to windfall revenues from the
gold-mining company), the authorities noted that the cumulative fiscal deficit for 2010–11 is
much lower than envisaged at the time of RCF (MEFP ¶10). Recognizing absorptive capacity
constraints, the authorities adjusted their capital budget in favor of an increase in the
spending on wages and pensions. While some of the capital expenditures were crisis related,

8

These include measures to strengthen customs administration through better customs valuation, limit VAT
exemptions, and increase collections from higher weight-based customs duties and taxes collected from mining
companies. The wage increase is expected to generate additional personal income tax revenue.
9

The wage increase has important social implications, as the current salary levels for teachers and doctors are
very low and barely exceed the minimum subsistence level.

20
which would automatically dissipate with the completion of these projects, the increase in
wages and pensions are irreversible, thus complicating the task of medium-term fiscal
consolidation.
17.
The government has developed a contingency plan and will respond proactively
should revenue and financing risks materialize. In case of a shortfall in tax revenues,
privatization proceeds, or external financing, and in light of limited space for mobilizing
additional domestic financing, the authorities agreed to restrain spending and submit to
parliament a supplementary budget with proposed cuts in current (e.g. goods and services)
and, if necessary, domestic capital expenditures to maintain the agreed 2011 overall deficit.
To compensate for potential shortfalls in privatization receipts, the government is considering
selling its equity stake in the largest mobile phone operator company. Mindful of
macroeconomic risks stemming from the fiscal expansion, the government will save the
majority of windfall revenues during 2011 (MEFP ¶12).
18.
Rising commodity prices will lead to deterioration in the external sector outlook
in 2011. While exports are expected to rebound with domestic stability and in line with high
gold prices, the import bill will increase, primarily because of rising commodity prices,10 but
also as a result of the reopening of the borders, and rebounding economic growth, which will
contribute to import volume growth. As a result, the current account deficit (excluding
official transfers) in 2011 is projected to deteriorate to about 9 percent of GDP.
C. Safeguarding medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability
19.
The authorities agreed that the proposed
medium-term fiscal consolidation path will help to
avoid excessive debt accumulation and to achieve
sustained disinflation. The general government
overall fiscal balance, excluding foreign financed
energy infrastructure projects, is projected to decline
from 7.6 percent in 2011 to 4.4 percent in 2014.11
Adjustment of this magnitude will improve the debt

The increase in the fuel import price due to higher global oil prices is only partly offset by the removal of the
fuel export duty by Russia.

11

Foreign-financed energy infrastructure projects, which predate the current government, are excluded to
adequately assess the government’s medium-term fiscal adjustment effort. This narrower measure is more
relevant to the domestic economy because these projects involve heavy imports, including labor. Initially the
energy sector loans were intended to be provided directly to the relevant state-owned enterprises with a
government guarantee. More recently, it became apparent that the ministry of finance will have to act as a
borrower and subsequently onlend the resources to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Thus, the SOEs, which are
outside the defined general government sector, are effective borrowers under these projects. The projects are
expected to commence in the second half of 2012.

21
outlook, while allowing the authorities to finance critical development and social needs.
Without this adjustment, the debt outlook would deteriorate significantly with the PV of
debt-to-GDP following an upward trend (see Text Figure 1 and the DSA in Supplement 1).
Moreover, as economic activity rebounds, higher fiscal deficits would limit the NBKR’s
ability to meet its inflation objectives.
20.
While counter-cyclical fiscal policies since 2009 have helped to mitigate the
adverse impact of the global financial and domestic crises, medium-term fiscal
consolidation is necessary to bring fiscal policy back on a sustainable path. With the
economy recovering from 2011, the authorities acknowledge the importance of starting fiscal
consolidation from 2012 (MEFP ¶13). The consolidation strategy, which includes measures
to increase revenues and restrain expenditure growth, will aim to bring the general
government deficit, excluding foreign financed energy infrastructure projects, to about
4½ percent of GDP by 2014 (Text Table 2).

21.
The fiscal consolidation strategy is underpinned by tax policy measures and
expenditure restraint. Simplified customs clearance procedures, which were introduced in
2004 to encourage “corridor” trade in Chinese goods, will be largely reversed so that the
majority of imported goods are subject to a price based, instead of weight based, valuation
system. This measure will encourage formalization of economic activity, expand the tax
base, and help prepare the Kyrgyz Republic for joining the customs union. Other measures
include (a) reforming excise taxation on tobacco and alcohol; (b) removing turnover tax

22
exemptions on electricity, heat, and natural gas for commercial users and VAT exemptions
on communication services; and (c) moving to a contract-based tax regime for food services
(MEFP ¶13). These measures (a structural benchmark) are expected to generate additional
revenues in the amount of 1 percent of GDP in 2012. The authorities agreed that the
2012 public sector wage bill will reflect only the full year impact of the 2011 wage increase
(MEFP ¶13). The ongoing civil service reform, which aims at downsizing the public sector,
will help raise efficiency and generate additional fiscal savings (Text Tables 3 and 4).

22.
Reforming tax administration could yield significant additional revenue and
help improve the business environment. In this context, the authorities believe that
focusing on large taxpayers by expanding coverage by the Large Taxpayers’ Office would be
particularly effective in achieving revenue gains (MEFP ¶14). The government’s efforts to
improve the quality and reduce the frequency of tax audits will ease the administrative
burden on businesses and limit opportunities for rent seeking. Regular communication with
taxpayers and enhancing access to information will raise confidence in the tax authorities and
encourage taxpayer self-compliance (structural benchmark).
23.
Social spending will be safeguarded and the existing targeted social assistance
system strengthened with the support of key development partners.12 While the recent
wage and pension increases are expected to offset some of the negative impact on poverty,
the authorities agreed to focus more on targeted social assistance programs. In that vein, the
authorities plan to raise the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) by 20 percent from June 1,
2011 and subsequently increase spending on targeted social assistance programs, i.e. the
Unified Monthly Benefit (UMB) and the Monthly Social Benefit (MEFP ¶15). The
government will continue to further expand the coverage under the UMB and work together
with the World Bank and EU to improve targeting of social assistance programs.
24.
The government’s efforts to increase transparency of public finances through
improved reporting and monitoring of large SOEs will help to minimize fiscal risks. In
this context, the authorities noted the progress made under the extractive industries
transparency initiative (EITI). The Kyrgyz Republic became a compliant country in March
2011(MEFP ¶28). The largest Kyrgyz mining companies will undertake the reconciliation of
their financial statements in accordance with the EITI requirements. Furthermore, the
government will develop new reporting requirements for the ten largest SOEs at the first
stage, which should help mobilize additional nontax revenues and reduce potential fiscal
costs (structural benchmark, MEFP ¶16).
25.
Additional structural policy measures will strengthen budget preparation and
improve transparency. The authorities recognize the importance of strengthening the fiscal
framework and plan to consolidate the social fund operations into the state budget and
consider moving tax policy function back to the Ministry of Finance. These measures will
help to improve ability of the Ministry of Finance to develop annual- and medium-term
budgets (MEFP ¶17). Moreover, staff stressed—and the authorities agreed—that selection of
an external auditor for the Kyrgyz Republic Development Fund (KRDF) (prior action),
12

The Kyrgyz Republic currently has two main targeted social assistance programs: Unified Monthly Benefit
(UMB) and Monthly Social Benefit (MSB) programs. The UMB is a means tested program and targets
households with children. If the household income is below the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) level
(linked to the extreme poverty line), the family receives the difference between the actual income and the GMI.
The MSB provides for cash transfers to defined categories of individuals unable to work and not entitled to
pensions (e.g. children with disabilities, large families, children who lost the breadwinner).

24
publication of the audit report (structural benchmark), completion of its liquidation, and a
commitment not to create any extra budgetary funds in the future are important measures to
raise transparency of public finances and strengthen budgetary discipline (MEFP ¶30).
26.
The debt outlook is expected to improve significantly in 2011 and beyond,
despite large energy infrastructure borrowing (see the DSA in Supplement 1). While
there are still large development needs, which will require external public borrowing going
forward, the authorities are committed to maintaining debt sustainability (MEFP ¶19).13 To
finance energy infrastructure investments and related imports, the authorities intend to
borrow about US$450 million from China, including a recently approved US$208 million
loan over the next four to five years.14 The terms of the Chinese loans are expected to be
marginally nonconcessional with a grant element of nearly 34 percent and will therefore be
incorporated in the ECF-supported program under a (tied) nonconcessional debt limit. At the
same time, they have cleared approximately US$14.4 million in arrears to Russia to pave the
way for debt relief of about US$194 million, which will likely be finalized in 2011.15 The
authorities also reached an agreement with the government of Turkey in April 2011 for debt
relief of approximately US$50 million and have agreed with the government of Belarus to
restructure debt of US$207,649. They have contacted, and are awaiting a response from, the
governments of Korea and China to clear arrears totaling about US$7.6 million.16 The return
of economic growth and the programmed fiscal consolidation in the medium term will

13

Total public debt in 2012–14 rises by 2.4 percent of GDP, which merely reflects a gradual, albeit small,
increase in the share of domestic debt in total public debt in line with the projected development of the domestic
market.
14

These energy infrastructure projects will expand the potential for exporting electricity, improve the reliability
of the transmission system and ensure a smooth supply of electricity to remote parts of the country. Neighboring
Uzbekistan has repeatedly indicated its intention to withdraw from the regional power grid, which would leave
the southern part of the Kyrgyz Republic without electricity, given that the only way to supply electricity to the
south is through the Uzbek electricity grid.

15

Under the debt-for-equity swap agreement signed between the previous Kyrgyz administration and the
Russian authorities in 2009, the Russian side agreed to relinquish claims on the Kyrgyz Republic in the amount
of US$193.5 million in exchange for a 100 percent stake in two state-owned companies in the Kyrgyz Republic.
However, in early 2010, the Russian side called into question the implementation of the agreement and declared
the outstanding debt disputed. Since then the parties have been in close consultations to resolve this issue and a
settlement is expected in 2011, as also assumed in the previous DSA.

16

The precise timing of the Turkish debt relief is still to be determined, but it is assumed that it will become
effective in 2011. The authorities only recently became aware of the Belarusian debt and took prompt action to
resolve it. The arrears to China and Korea have existed since the Agreed Minutes were signed on March 11,
2005 within the Paris Club framework. In March of this year, official letters were sent to the governments of
China and Korea by the MOF requesting negotiations to restructure those arrears, but no replies have been
received so far. No penalties or fines are accruing on these arrears.

25
further improve the debt outlook. Development and adoption of a medium-term debt
management strategy (MTDS) will guide the authorities in their future borrowing decisions
(structural benchmark, MEFP ¶19).
D. Ensuring financial sector stability and supporting financial deepening17
27.
Staff and the authorities agreed that developments in the banking sector after
the political upheaval last year exposed shortcomings in the bank resolution framework
and the NBKR’s de facto lack of independence. The experience has demonstrated that the
central bank is susceptible to political influence. The deficient legal framework for problem
bank resolution, and frequent interference by the courts have prevented the NBKR from
taking prompt and resolute actions to deal with the banks placed under official control. In
addition, bank supervisors lack adequate legal protection from prosecution for actions taken
in performance of their official duties. Staff and the authorities agreed that reforms are
needed to address weaknesses in the legal framework for bank resolution, including by
limiting the role of the judiciary and providing adequate legal protection for NBKR
supervision staff (structural benchmark, MEFP ¶26). As parliamentary confirmation of the
acting chairperson of the NBKR failed recently, staff encouraged the authorities to expedite
the appointment of the NBKR chair.18
28.
The resolution of AUB and the four banks currently under conservatorship
remains incomplete. A recently concluded forensic audit suggested that AUB was used to
conduct large scale criminal activities, and that it was likely insolvent even before the April
2010 events. The resolution process so far has involved a split of the balance sheet into AUB
(bad bank) and the newly created Zalkar Bank (good bank). However, the new bank’s
balance sheet was not “clean” at its creation, making it less attractive to a prospective buyer,
and the authorities have agreed to take resolute actions to deal with these legacy issues
(MEFP ¶23). While Zalkar is not considered to be systemic, staff noted that resolution in line
with international best practices would help to rebuild the NBKR’s credibility and lay the
groundwork for a financial system that is better able to support economic growth.19 Along
these lines, the authorities are in the process of commissioning a financial audit of Zalkar
Bank (prior action). Staff recommended that the audit results inform a resolution strategy
(structural benchmark):

17

Selected issues paper I provides an assessment of how the banking sector fared during the crisis and of the
challenges ahead.

18
19

An NBKR chairperson must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the parliament.

AUB/Zalkar is no longer considered systemic because (i) its share of private deposits has fallen from
44 percent at end-2009 to Zalkar’s 2.7 percent in January 2011; (ii) its interconnections with other banks is
minor; and (iii) the services it provides can be provided by other components of the system.

26

If Zalkar is confirmed to be solvent, it should be sold as a going concern to a
reputable bank. The authorities preferred to open the door to acquirers other than banks to
increase the chance of a successful privatization. Staff responded that the significant risk of a
repeat of the circumstances surrounding the failure of AUB was the main reason to
recommend limiting the sale of Zalkar to a reputable bank. However, staff noted that if no
such buyer comes forward within the specified timeframe, Zalkar should be liquidated and
any interested investors would be able to purchase assets and liabilities of Zalkar through the
liquidation process.

If the audit results determine that Zalkar is insolvent, bankruptcy proceedings should
be commenced.20
With respect to the four banks under conservatorship, the authorities noted that no further
actions can be taken until pending litigation is resolved. The delays suggest that at least some
of these banks will no longer be viable by the time the court cases are resolved, and these
banks will likely eventually need to be liquidated.
29.
The authorities highlighted that the rest of the banking system seems to have
successfully weathered the 2010 downturn and prospects are improving, but also agreed
that capital buffers should be rebuilt, particularly with respect to the largest
state-owned bank. Its balance sheet more than doubled between December 2009 and March
2011 (partly because of the acquisition of some large loans from AUB), and the bank is now
among the largest in the system. There was agreement that, as the bank’s loan portfolio
matures, it is likely that performance will deteriorate, and thus capital buffers should be
rebuilt, while asset growth should be restrained with supervisory measures. The authorities
cautioned that the bank was to play a critical role in channeling loans to entrepreneurs who
suffered damage in the south, and therefore some growth in assets should be allowed. They
agreed to start preparations for its privatization (structural benchmark, MEFP ¶23).
30.
Staff and authorities agreed that the Special Bank Refinancing Fund (SBRF),
which has made the NBKR more susceptible to political interference, should be wound
down (MEFP ¶25). The SBRF was set up by a resolution of the NBKR Board in 2009 to
provide loans to commercial banks and micro finance institutions. While the initial capital
injections were provided by the NBKR, the government recently provided funding to the
SBRF for highly concessional onlending to farmers. The existence of such a vehicle has
allowed the government to interfere in the NBKR’s activities, including for the purpose of
financing the budget. Therefore, the plan to announce the SBRF liquidation process (prior
action) and subsequently refund the portions to the respective contributors (structural
benchmark), will help further strengthen the NBKR’s de facto independence. The authorities
also support the view that the NBKR should not be used as a financing source for public or
private uses.
20

The current projections assume recapitalization of Zalkar Bank by the government, financed through the
issuance of domestic securities (KGS 1.3 billion).

27
E. Structural reforms to improve the business environment and strengthen
competitiveness
31.
Imperfect enforcement of laws and regulations is the main constraint on the
business environment. Although business climate reforms are quite advanced, as evidenced
by the Kyrgyz Republic’s favorable rankings (e.g. ranked 44 according to the World Bank
“Doing Business” survey), governance and corruption problems have been preventing the
country from fully benefiting from this improved regulatory environment. Tackling these
longstanding problems will be vital to promote private sector activity and achieve inclusive
and sustainable growth. Moreover, the Kyrgyz Republic would benefit from reforms to
strengthen property rights, further cut red tape, and create a level playing field for all
businesses (Box 4).
32.
Exchange rate flexibility has helped to cushion the impact of external shocks and
will be important for maintaining competitiveness going forward. The exchange rate
came under pressure in 2008 and the NBKR allowed the som to depreciate against the U.S.
dollar by more than 25 percent in 12 months since August 2008. Staff’s findings suggest that
the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. While the macroeconomic balance
approach and the external sustainability approach indicate a small undervaluation, the
equilibrium real exchange rate approach indicates a small overvaluation. Overall, the results
suggest a small undervaluation of 2.9 percent on average (see selected issues paper II for
details). Improving productivity through market-oriented reforms should bolster the
competitiveness of the Kyrgyz economy. According to the World Economic Forum Global
Competitiveness Report 2011, the Kyrgyz Republic is ranked 121 out of 139 countries.
33.
Energy sector reforms would not only remove an important constraint on
growth, but also create an important driver for growth in the medium-term. The energy
sector still remains in a poor condition with unreliable supplies, especially during the winter
season. Below cost-recovery tariff levels, extremely high technical and commercial losses,
and poor governance lead to high quasi-fiscal deficits. Initial efforts to address these
challenges have failed and eroded the public confidence in the reform process.21 The ongoing
efforts focus on increasing transparency and efficiency of the largest energy companies with
the assistance from key development partners in light of the Fund’s limited expertise in
energy sector issues (MEFP ¶29).
21

Starting from 2009 the previous Kyrgyz authorities embarked on comprehensive reforms in the energy sector
which included (i) two-round increase in electricity tariffs for all end-users in 2010, which would have resulted
in a cumulative growth in the household electricity tariffs of 171 percent; (ii) privatization of six large energy
companies—with two of them completed in early 2010— the interim government annulled the privatization and
suspended the privatization program altogether; (iii) wage and pension supplements to compensate for the tariff
increase; and (iv) new public investments in power generation (Kambarata 2 project) and transmission
(Datka-Kemin project). However, such a colossal tariff increase announced at the dawn of the global economic
crisis, led to massive protests and the ouster of the previous regime. Consequently, the interim government
returned the energy tariffs to their previous levels, while maintaining wage and pension supplements.

28
Box 4. Kyrgyz Republic: Business Environment
While the Kyrgyz Republic has made important strides to improve standard indicators of the business
climate, the situation on the ground does not yet reflect these efforts. Registration formalities (seal,
publication, notarization, inspection, and other requirements) have been simplified and the processes of starting
a business, registering property, and protecting investors, received high ratings in the 2011 Doing Business
survey. However, the good performance in Doing Business reforms did not translate into an actual improvement
of the business environment. Most amended laws and regulations are not implemented or implemented poorly.
The Kyrgyz Republic’s Corruption Perception Index has deteriorated in recent years, which has put a heavy
burden on businesses and has undermined the trust in the public sector. Although anticorruption legislation was
put in place with the assistance of key development partners, its enforcement remains problematic. Customs
procedures are burdensome, which encourages corruption, while restricting trade.

Weak institutions are also a constraining
factor. According to the Global Competitiveness
Report, the Kyrgyz Republic ranks 121 out of
139 countries. Property rights and public trust in
politicians, judicial independence and efficiency
of the legal framework, strength of auditing and
reporting standards, and protection of minority
shareholders’ interests are among the main areas
that remain major obstacles. Local competition is
weak and the effectiveness of the anti-monopoly
policy is limited.

Going forward, the authorities need to translate the good legal and regulatory framework into tangible
improvements on the ground. Efforts are already underway to address the perception of corruption and
strengthening institutions. The authorities need to identify, with the assistance from the development partners,
and eliminate (instead of amending) redundant regulations and rules. Crime and disorder that followed the
unrest in 2010 should effectively and continuously be dealt with. The government also needs to simplify
customs regulations easing export and import procedures.

29
IV. THE NEW ECF ARRANGEMENT
Access and financing
34.
The ECF-supported program is expected to catalyze significant donor assistance,
which will help to finance the current account deficits in 2011 and the medium term
and maintain reserves at comfortable levels. Although reserve coverage is expected to
decline slightly (by 0.3 months of imports) from 2011, it will stabilize at 3.8 months of
imports in 2013. The projected level of international reserves after donor support meets the
majority of reserve adequacy indicators. However, as a small open economy, the Kyrgyz
Republic is particularly vulnerable to exogenous shocks (selected issues paper III).
Anticipated external official development assistance in 2011 will total about US$271 million,
including a US$107 million loan from the Eurasian Economic Community’s Anti-Crisis
Fund (Text Table 5). Donor financing appears to be frontloaded, as a significant part of the
financing earmarked for 2010 has been delayed to 2011.22 The proposed access of 75 percent
of quota (SDR 66.6 million), to be disbursed in equal semiannual installments with the first
disbursement expected in June 2011 (Table 10), would finance the residual balance of
payments gap. Given the prohibition on central bank financing of the budget, constraints in
domestic market financing, and the urgent budgetary need until donor disbursements
commence, the authorities have requested that both 2011 disbursements be channeled to the
budget, i.e. disbursed to the treasury account in the NBKR. The Kyrgyz Republic’s capacity
to repay the Fund is adequate (Table 11) and the DSA concludes that the country remains at a
moderate risk of debt distress.

Monitoring, safeguards, and risks
35.
Program monitoring will be performed on a semi-annual basis. The first review
is expected to be completed by November 30, 2011 based on continuous and end-June
2011 quantitative performance criteria and the second review is expected to be
completed by April 16, 2012 based on continuous and end-December 2011 quantitative
performance criteria. Conditionality will focus on the critical aspects of the Fund-supported
program and will include quantitative performance criteria on (i) net international reserves;
(ii) net domestic assets; (iii) the overall cash deficit; and (iv) external nonconcessional
borrowing and external arrears. Indicative targets apply to (i) reserve money; (ii) state
government tax revenues; and (iii) spending on targeted social assistance. On the structural
side, conditionality will focus on tax policy and administration reform, strengthening
management of SOEs, transparency of public finances, completion of problem bank
resolution, bolstering banking supervision, and central bank independence (MEFP Tables
1 and 2).
36.
A safeguards assessment is in progress and will be completed no later than by
the time of the first review. The last safeguards assessment was completed in 2009. The
authorities plan to update the February 6, 2010 memorandum of understanding between the
ministry of finance and the NKBR on the respective responsibilities for servicing their
respective obligations to the IMF (MEFP ¶34).
37.
Risks to the Fund-supported program are considerable, especially in the near
term. Potential for renewed political turbulence remains high in the run up to the presidential
elections later this year and the foundation for the current coalition government remains
fragile. The adoption of tax policy reforms, which contain unpopular measures, could be
delayed jeopardizing medium-term fiscal consolidation. The resolution of problem banks
may be postponed further while delays in addressing growing vulnerabilities in other
systemically important banks could destabilize the financial sector leading to fiscal costs and
a decline in credit. However, strong conditionality under the ECF arrangement in
macrocritical areas mitigates these risks.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
In the aftermath of the deep political crisis last year, the Kyrgyz authorities’
immediate priority should be to restore macroeconomic stability. While there are early
signs of recovery from the economic contraction in 2010, the situation remains fragile with
inflation at more than 20 percent. Staff noted that the initially planned fiscal expansion in
2011 should be scaled back and contingency measures prepared, and that consolidation in
2012 and beyond will be critical. Moreover, reducing underlying vulnerabilities in the

31
banking sector, addressing governance issues, and improving the business environment will
be key to enhancing the role of the private sector in the economy and fully realizing the
economy’s growth potential.
39.
Fiscal consolidation in 2012 and beyond will be critical to ensure medium-term
fiscal and debt sustainability and support the central bank’s disinflation objectives. The
consolidation strategy is underpinned by strong tax policy and administration measures,
which will yield about 1 percent of GDP in 2012, and prudent spending plans. Exercising
nominal wage restraint in 2012 and moderate wage and pension growth in subsequent years
will also be needed to support fiscal consolidation. Other current spending should be adjusted
downward through better public financial management, while social spending should be
safeguarded and focused on further developing targeted assistance programs. Staff noted that
the civil service reform will allow for a smoother fiscal consolidation, as it is likely to
generate significant efficiency gains. Reform efforts to strengthen budget preparation and
improve transparency through the consolidation of the social fund into the state budget,
return of tax policy to the ministry of finance and better monitoring of SOEs, will also be
critical.
40.
Sound monetary policy supported by the flexible exchange rate regime will be
key to contain inflation. Staff welcomes the recent monetary tightening, but the NBKR
should stand ready to tighten further in light of inflationary pressures stemming from the
fiscal expansion in 2011. To further develop the effectiveness of monetary policy, the NBKR
should strengthen its policy toolkit and work toward deepening the financial sector. Staff
notes that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals and the flexible exchange
rate regime, which has served the Kyrgyz Republic well, should be maintained.
41.
Staff urges the authorities to take the necessary actions on the banking sector
without delay. AUB/Zalkar resolution should proceed promptly once the results of the audit
are known. Resolute action on problem banks, along with passage of amendments to the
banking laws to strengthen the NBKR’s supervisory independence and address weaknesses
in the resolution framework, are critical to a well-functioning banking sector and will help to
provide a sound basis for further financial deepening. Capital buffers should be rebuilt,
particularly for the largest state-owned bank, and its growth rate contained through
supervisory measures. The vigorous pursuit to recover the assets wrongfully taken from AUB
would also send a strong signal of a break with the past.
42.
Potential accession to the Belarus-Kazakhstan-Russia customs union creates
risks for economic growth and for future budgets. Membership in the customs union may
significantly reduce shuttle trade from China and lead to lower growth and tax revenues at
customs. Therefore, revamping the Kyrgyz tax system, by expanding the tax base and
strengthening administration, should become a priority in this highly uncertain context.
Increasing customs revenues would help strengthen the bargaining position of the Kyrgyz
Republic during the accession negotiations.

32
43.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ cautious approach to external borrowing and
efforts to resolve outstanding bilateral debt disputes. A cautious approach is needed to
maintain the Kyrgyz Republic’s lower debt vulnerabilities as indicated by the moderate
external risk of debt distress rating. The clearance of arrears to Russia, the restructuring of
the debt to Belarus, and efforts to clear arrears to China and Korea are important
developments in this regard. While substantial prospective external borrowings, staggered
over time, are not likely to jeopardize the country’s debt outlook, any future large-scale
borrowing decisions should carefully consider potential growth dividends.
44.
The recent political changes provide an opportunity to address governance
issues. A similar but forgone opportunity presented itself after the “Tulip Revolution” in
2005. The shift to a parliamentary form of government, which is new to the Kyrgyz
Republic, may slow down the reform effort, simply because parliamentary involvement in
the policy-making process and the diverse nature of the coalition may prolong decisionmaking. It is therefore important for the new government to instill confidence and obtain
popular support for important reforms.
45.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to phase out the SBRF and not to
create any new development/investment vehicle without prior consultation with IMF
staff. The use of the SBRF for directed lending and government financing has hampered
central bank operations. The creation and operation of the KRDF was a major obstacle for
completing reviews under the ESF because of the substantial governance issues involved.
The authorities are aware that failure to observe this commitment could jeopardize the
completion of future program reviews.
46.
The proposed ECF arrangement entails significant risks, but strong
conditionality in macrocritical areas, including prior actions, should provide sufficient
safeguards. While the period ahead is marked by uncertainty and political fragility, the
Fund-supported program will be important to help the authorities to put the economy back on
a sustainable path and secure much-needed donor support. Based on the authorities’ good
track record under the RCF and the strong medium-term policies and structural program,
staff supports the authorities’ request for an ECF arrangement and the request to channel the
first two disbursements to the budget. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultations be
held on the standard 24-month cycle, in accordance with the Decision on Article IV
Consultation Cycles (Decision No. 14747–(10/96), (9/28/2010)), as amended.

APPENDIX I. KYRGYZ REPUBLIC: LETTER OF INTENT
June 2, 2011
Mr. John Lipsky
Acting Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, DC 20431
Dear Mr. Lipsky:
The Kyrgyz Republic suffered from a deep political crisis last year. In April 2010, a popular
uprising toppled the previous regime and the tragic events of June 2010 exacerbated the
already difficult political situation. Following the joint economic assessment and the donor
conference in mid-2010, the IMF was the first international financial institution to support
the Kyrgyz Republic. Financial assistance provided under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) in
September 2010 supported our country at a very difficult time in our history and was
instrumental in mobilizing much-needed donor assistance. Parliamentary elections took place
in October 2010 and a new coalition government took office in December 2010. We believe
that the shift to a parliamentary democracy provides new opportunities to break with the past
and strengthen governance and reform the economy.
The fallout from the domestic crisis has posed significant challenges. The economy
contracted last year, straining the government’s financial position, further exacerbated by
critical reconciliation, recovery and reconstruction needs. Moreover, the global food and fuel
price shock triggered a sharp rise in inflation, eroding real incomes of the most vulnerable
part of the population. Business confidence deteriorated, hampering prospects for private
sector-led economic recovery.
The Kyrgyz authorities are determined to take prompt actions and implement a
macroeconomic and structural reform program that will support the economic recovery in the
short term and place the country on the road to stronger sustained and inclusive growth in the
medium term, while preserving macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. We will also
develop a comprehensive Country Development Strategy. Governance problems that had
been mounting in the past also need to be addressed in a comprehensive manner.
Against this background, we hereby request Fund support under a new three-year Extended
Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 66.6 million and the first
disbursement in an amount equivalent to SDR 9.514 million upon the approval of the
arrangement. We also request that the first two disbursements under the ECF arrangement be
channeled to the budget. The new Fund-supported program (June 2011–June 2014) will

45
provide a coherent macroeconomic framework that will support our efforts to restore
macroeconomic stability, rebuild macroeconomic policy buffers, promote inclusive growth in
a low inflation environment, achieve medium-term fiscal consolidation, address weaknesses
in the financial sector, and catalyze critical donor support, which would allow us to keep
reserves at a comfortable level.
The observance of all end-2010 indicative targets under the RCF allowed the new
government to build a track record, which we consider an important prerequisite for a
medium-term program engagement with the IMF.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) outlines our
macroeconomic objectives for 2011–14 and provides specific measures for 2011–12. We are
committed to the objectives of our Fund-supported program recognizing that disbursements
under the ECF arrangement are subject to observance of performance criteria, fulfillment of
prior action(s), and completion of program reviews. The government believes that the
policies set out in the attached MEFP are adequate to achieve the objectives of the Fundsupported program, but stands ready to take additional measures. The Kyrgyz Republic will
consult with the Fund on such measures and in advance of any revision to policies contained
in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies. During the Fund-supported program
period the government will not introduce any exchange rate restrictions, multiple currency
practice, and import restrictions for balance of payments purposes, and will continue to
comply with all obligations under Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreements.
In line with our commitment to transparency in government operations, which we believe is
essential for good governance, we consent to the publication of all ECF-related documents
circulated to the IMF Executive Board on the IMF’s web site.

APPENDIX II. KYRGYZ REPUBLIC: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL
POLICIES (MEFP) FOR 2011–14
June 2, 2011
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This Memorandum sets out the economic and financial policies of the government of
the Kyrgyz Republic for 2011–14, which aim at rebalancing the policy mix to restore
macroeconomic stability and rebuild policy buffers through fiscal consolidation while
protecting social outlays, strengthening financial sector stability, and addressing governance
problems. These policies form the basis for a new three-year Fund-supported program under
an Extended Credit Facility (ECF).
II. BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
2.
The interim government, which took office following the April 2010 revolution,
faced a difficult task to restore security in the country and to transfer power to the
newly elected government. The new constitution approved in June 2010 balanced the power
between the parliament and the government and established the first Central Asian
parliamentary democracy. We also conducted successful parliamentary elections, which were
assessed by international observers as fair and democratic. Following the elections, a
three-party ruling coalition was formed and a new government appointed at the end of 2010.
The overarching objective of the caretaker government to ensure a smooth transition to a new
political system with minimal social cost and economic damage was met, enabling us to
focus on key economic issues.
3.
While the Kyrgyz economy showed signs of recovery from the global economic
crisis in the first quarter of 2010, the events of 2010 took a heavy toll on growth. During
the first quarter of 2010 real GDP grew by an impressive 16 percent, driven by strong gold
production and a pickup in industrial production and construction. The collapse of the
government in April 2010 and the tragic events of June 2010 reversed these positive
developments and the economy contracted by 1.4 percent in 2010, primarily due to negative
growth in construction, agriculture, and trade. Border closures and internal security concerns
disrupted normal trade flows, resulting in losses by the traditional export industries and a
sharp drop in supply.
4.
The external position deteriorated in 2010. The current account shifted from a
surplus of about 1 percent of GDP in 2009 to a 2 percent of GDP deficit. Reserve coverage
dropped from 4.9 to 4.2 months of imports, although the decline would have been larger
without external financial assistance from bilateral and multilateral donors following the July
2010 donor conference in Bishkek. In addition, high gold prices, coupled with increasing
gold production, boosted export earnings and the economic recovery in Russia helped to
bolster remittance inflows.

47
5.
Rising international food and fuel prices led to a surge in inflation from
3.5 percent in June 2010 to 20.8 percent in March 2011. While the removal of the fuel
export duty by Russia in January of this year partially offset the impact from rising
commodity prices, supply shortages stemming from security concerns aggravated the
problem and we are concerned that inflationary expectations have become entrenched. We
have therefore tightened monetary policy by raising reserve requirements, increasing the
policy rate and intensifying open market operations.
6.
The Joint Economic Assessment prepared by the international community with
the Fund’s active participation identified significant financing needs for reconciliation,
recovery, and reconstruction. Donors pledged US$1.1 billion in assistance over the period
of 18 months to deal with the consequences of the 2010 events. As of April 2011, the total
contracted amount was US$380 million. We call upon the donor community to fulfill their
pledges.
7.
We are committed to restoring macroeconomic stability and have already taken
number of measures towards this end. We realize that a comprehensive and homegrown
medium-term country development strategy is necessary to set the foundation for putting the
economy back on a sustainable growth path. Work on such a strategy has already begun with
the assistance of our development partners and we expect it to be finalized by the end of this
year. Meanwhile, in March, the government approved an Action Plan for Economic Security
(APES) for 2011, which puts forward measures intended to remove the immediate obstacles
to economic growth and poverty reduction. These measures, some of which are included in
this memorandum, aim at strengthening public finances and improving governance. We will
rigorously monitor the implementation of this plan, which can be considered as our
short-term work program.
8.
Over the medium term, we are committed to implementing sound
macroeconomic and structural policies. These policies will allow us to reestablish
macroeconomic stability, fully utilize the economic growth potential, curb inflation, reduce
the fiscal deficit, strengthen the financial sector, improve the external position, and enhance
the role of the private sector in the economy. The shift to a more democratic political system
enables us to break with the past and strengthen governance, which will be the cornerstone of
our reforms. We also believe that the ECF arrangement will help mobilize official external
financing to support these objectives. We read with interest the Ex Post Assessment of
Longer-Term Program Engagement report for the Kyrgyz Republic prepared by IMF staff
and incorporated the main findings of the report into the design of our new Fund-supported
program.

48
III. POLICIES FOR 2011 AND BEYOND
9.
A gradual economic recovery and return to a stable macroeconomic position is
the cornerstone of our Fund-supported program. In particular:

We expect real GDP to grow by about 6 percent on average during 2011–14 on the
back of continued political stability and a rebound in agriculture, trade and construction.

Our tight monetary policy stance will help to reduce inflation in 2011 but it is still
expected to remain in the lower double digits. In 2012 inflation will continue to subside and
stabilize at about 7.5 percent in 2013–14, largely reflecting normalization of trade,
stabilization of international food and fuel prices, and prudent fiscal policies.

The general government deficit, excluding Chinese-financed investment projects, will
be brought down to 4.4 percent of GDP by 2014, primarily on account of tax administration
and tax policy measures (see below).

The current account deficit will increase in 2011 and gradually decline over the
medium term. However, strong import demand including foreign-financed energy related
public investments will prevent the current account deficit to improve faster. The
ECF-supported program is expected to catalyze significant donor support, which will help to
finance the current account deficits and maintain comfortable reserve levels.
A. Fiscal policy
10.
We wish to emphasize that the 2010 fiscal deficit was significantly lower than
anticipated under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF). The caretaker administration’s
cautious approach, a shortfall in planned external financing, solid gold related tax receipts,
including advance payments, and delays in the capitalization of Zalkar bank created from
Asia Universal Bank (AUB), resulted in a fiscal deficit of less than 7 percent of GDP in
contrast to 12 percent of GDP projected earlier. In addition, capacity constraints, which did
not allow us to fully execute capital expenditure projects in the south to rebuild housing and
infrastructure damaged during the events of June 2010, led to spending underexecution. At
the same time, we have fully executed our social commitments.
11.
Recognizing risks to macroeconomic stability, we envisage a less expansionary
fiscal stance in 2011 compared to the projections at the time of the RCF. The general
government overall deficit is now projected at 7.6 percent of GDP. On the back of rapidly
rising inflation and public discontent from the previous governments’ inaction to address
pressing social problems, we substantially raised salaries for teachers, healthcare workers,
and other social sector workers. This decision, which became effective on May 1, 2011, will
allow the majority of about 180,000 social sector employees to earn incomes just above the
subsistence level. At the same time, mindful of the capacity limitations and to accommodate
the salary increase we revised downward capital expenditures. While the salary reform helps

49
to mitigate potential risks to social stability, it will likely contribute to inflationary pressures.
To this end the government and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) will
closely coordinate fiscal and monetary operations to mitigate the inflationary impact from the
expansionary fiscal stance, while supporting the fragile recovery.
12.
Given the ambitious reform agenda, the 2011 budget contains financing risks,
which we plan to address through contingency measures. We have already adopted
several tax policy and administration measures and begun fighting corruption and tax evasion
that should yield additional revenues of about 1 percent of GDP. Moreover, we plan to
privatize KyrgyzTelecom through an open and competitive bidding process. We will
carefully analyze revenue performance on a monthly basis and should additional tax
revenues, privatization proceeds, and external financing not materialize, we will either
compensate the shortfall through the sale of additional government shares of the mobile
phone operator MegaCom or immediately submit to the parliament a supplementary budget
proposing sequestration of nonpriority spending, while preserving expenditures on protected
items. At the same time, we commit not to initiate any supplementary budget that may lead to
an increase in total government spending beyond the amounts agreed with the IMF. We also
commit to save 75 percent of the recent dividend payment received from Centerra Gold Inc.
and any additional windfall receipts above the amounts envisaged in the approved budget.
13.
Our medium-term fiscal policy aims to bring the fiscal position back on a
sustainable path. To achieve this goal, we recognize that substantial fiscal consolidation
from 2012 will be necessary. To this end, we will introduce additional revenue measures and
restrain expenditures. Given that a large part of the domestic economy remains outside the
tax system, our efforts will focus on broadening the tax base, which should help improve the
efficiency of our tax system. Our measures will encourage formalization of the economy,
limit tax evasion, spread the tax burden more evenly and simplify the tax system. The main
element of our reform will be to improve the customs valuation system. In particular, we will
move the majority of imported goods from weight-based to price-based valuation for raising
revenues collected by customs (0.3 percent of GDP). We also plan to introduce additional
measures by (i) reforming excise taxation on tobacco and alcohol in line with the draft tax
code amendments (0.4 percent of GDP); (ii) removing the turnover tax exemption on
electricity, heat and natural gas for commercial users (0.1 percent of GDP) and VAT
exemptions on communication services (0.1 percent of GDP); and (iii) moving to a
contract-based tax regime for food services (0.1 percent of GDP). These tax revenue
measures, which in total will yield revenue of 1.0 percent of GDP, will become effective by
January 1, 2012 (amendments to be submitted to Parliament by end-October, 2011, structural
benchmarks). We also commit not to introduce new tax exemptions for the duration of the
Fund-supported program.
14.
We will further bolster tax administration by strengthening the large taxpayers’
office, deterring noncompliance through improved audits, and enhancing
communication with, and assistance to, taxpayers (structural benchmark). Moreover,

50
we will exercise nominal wage restraint for public sector employees in 2012, reduce
spending in other areas and generate additional fiscal savings through the civil service
reform, which will result in at least 10 percent reduction of the civil service. We will begin to
outsource part of government services to the private sector starting from 2012, which will
result in a decline in revenues from fees and expenditures on services. The consolidation
strategy will help to bring the fiscal deficit, excluding the Chinese-financed investment
projects, from almost 8 percent of GDP in 2011 to 4.4 percent of GDP by 2014.
15.
Strong inclusive growth will aid in reducing poverty. To ensure that the growth
dividends from our reform efforts also benefit the poor, we plan to further develop our key
targeted social assistance programs with the support of our development partners. Recently
we modified the Unified Monthly Benefits (UMB), the central targeted assistance program,
to introduce elements of a proxy means tested system. We plan to raise the size of the
Guaranteed Minimum Income by almost 20 percent and increase spending on UMB and
Monthly Social Benefit (MSB) to catch up with the rising cost of living. We plan to continue
a gradual increase in spending on targeted social assistance programs and expand the
coverage to nearly 0.5 million recipients (9 percent of the population) in the medium term.
16.
We believe that strengthening management of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs)
and Joint Stock companies (JSCs) with majority government equity participation will
improve their efficiency, enhance the revenue base and minimize fiscal risks. A recent
study of their operations revealed shortcomings in their budget planning and accountability.
The shortcomings stem from operational inefficiencies related to noncore expenditures.
While external audits are mandatory for these companies, there is no procedure or
mechanism in place to perform effective budget planning, analyze audit results, and take
appropriate actions. We plan to develop a uniform procedure for budget planning and
accountability to be used by these companies to increase their accountability. We will
strengthen corporate governance principles. We will establish new reporting requirements for
the 10 largest (in terms of assets) of these companies, which will include procedures to
submit, approve, and monitor their budgets (structural benchmark). As these companies
become more efficient, the budget will benefit from increased revenues from dividends.
During the program period we will expand coverage to all SOEs and JSCs with majority
government equity participation. Subsequently, we will prepare a transparent privatization
plan with the assistance of our development partners.
17.
Additional structural reforms will aid the process of fiscal consolidation and put
public finances on a stronger footing. As a step towards further budgetary consolidation,
we plan to integrate the social fund into the state budget framework by bringing its
operations under the central treasury (envisaged under APES). At the same time, to
strengthen the role of the Ministry of Finance as the key agency responsible for fiscal policy,
we will consider returning the tax policy function to the Ministry of Finance.

51
18.
We also intend to advance public financial management (PFM) reform to
increase the effectiveness of public spending. The events of 2010 prevented us from
focusing on implementing PFM reforms, particularly the recommendations provided by the
IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) technical assistance mission in December 2009. We
have requested a follow-up mission to take a fresh look at PFM issues and update the
recommendations. PFM reform measures would strengthen budget design and
implementation and increasing transparency of budgetary operations. The donor trust fund
will be instrumental in revitalizing PFM reforms.
19.

We are committed to maintaining debt sustainability.


In this regard, we will prepare a medium-term debt management strategy (MTDS) in
consultation with the World Bank and IMF. We will also step up efforts to conduct our own
debt sustainability analysis.

We are actively working with the Russian authorities to find a resolution of the
outstanding debt issue. We have already cleared arrears in the amount of US$14.4 million
thereby removing a key impediment for the disbursement of budget support loan from the
Eurasia Economic Community Anti Crisis Fund (ACF). We have also signed an agreement
with the Belarusian government to settle debt obligations in the amount of US$207,649. We
have contacted the governments of China and Korea to discuss and negotiate the settlement
of technical arrears totaling approximately US$7.6 million.

We are in discussions with China to borrow US$208 million for energy infrastructure
investments. We may consider borrowing an additional US$240 million for related
investments in a few years time. While the terms of these borrowings are not yet finalized,
we will make every effort to ensure that the borrowing occurs on concessional terms. We are
committed to contracting only external debt that is consistent with maintaining lower external
debt vulnerabilities, i.e., maintaining or improving the moderate risk of external debt distress
rating.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate policies
20.
We are concerned with the recent inflation developments, largely driven by the
food and fuel price shock. Inflation has become widespread, encompassing a larger share of
the basket and will likely be amplified by this year’s fiscal expansion. But the recent inflation
trends, which show core inflation stabilizing, are encouraging. We have already started to
tighten monetary policy. In particular, we have raised the policy rate since October 2010 by
almost 500 basis points, which has allowed us to substantially increase liquidity absorption
through sales of NBKR notes. We also raised reserve requirements in February of this year
by 1 percentage point. We anticipate that the combination of these policies will slow the
growth of monetary aggregates and help to reduce inflation. Nonetheless, we stand ready to
tighten further if inflation does not revert to a declining path in the second half of 2011. The

52
adverse impact on NBKR profits will not be a constraining factor on implementing monetary
policy. To strengthen the effectiveness of monetary policy, we intend to work on deepening
financial markets and increasing competition in the banking sector. We recognize that the
best way to reduce high dollarization is to establish a track record of macroeconomic stability
and to maintain exchange rate flexibility.
21.
The floating exchange rate system has served us well in mitigating the impact of
external shocks without a sharp deterioration in the external position. Exchange rate
flexibility will help to maintain the real exchange rate in line with fundamentals. We will
therefore intervene in the foreign exchange market only to smooth short-term exchange rate
movements.
C. Financial Sector
22.
Political developments in 2010 tested our financial system, severely disrupted the
regular course of supervisory activities, and undermined the NBKR’s credibility. Seven
commercial banks, including the largest and systemically important one, AUB, were put
under official control. The situation in five of these banks has not been fully resolved. As
expected, the banking system’s performance weakened and nonperforming loans increased.
Some commercial banks experienced liquidity problems. However, there are signs of
improvement.
23.
We have taken actions to isolate and resolve the problems in the banking system;
but the process remains incomplete. We will decisively deal with these legacy issues and
ensure that the banking system is sufficiently resilient to withstand possible further shocks.
We are taking the following steps:

Asset recovery. The forensic audit of AUB revealed that the bank was insolvent ahead
of the April events. It also suggests that shareholders and senior bank officials may have used
the bank to engage in money-laundering activities. Based on these findings, we are actively
working with the Basel Institute of Governance to determine whether any assets could be
recovered.

Resolution of AUB/Zalkar. We will complete the resolution of AUB/Zalkar in line
with international best practices and as agreed with Fund staff. We will commission a
financial audit to determine the financial position of Zalkar Bank, the new bank created from
the AUB split (prior action). The audit will be conducted by a reputable big-four
international accounting firm, and the results will be shared with IMF staff. Regardless of
how these issues are resolved, the budget will bear the financial responsibility.

If the audit determines that the bank is solvent, it will be offered for sale, to a
reputable bank, through a transparent and competitive privatization process (structural
benchmark).

53

If the privatization is not successful within the allotted timeframe, the assets
and liabilities will be disposed of in a transparent and competitive tender process to
interested investors within a reasonable time frame (structural benchmark).

If the audit determines that the bank is insolvent, we will dispose of its assets
and liabilities in a transparent and competitive tender process within a reasonable
time frame (structural benchmark).

Resolution of banks currently under conservatorship. We will continue to maintain
the banks under conservatorship until they are fully compliant with the regulatory
requirements or placed under liquidation.

Strengthen supervision, particularly of systemically important banks. After an
interruption due to the heavy volume of work on the problem banks, we have restored a
regular cycle of supervisory inspections in a prioritized manner. In this context, we agree that
SSC’s rapid growth requires close monitoring and supervisory actions to contain its rate of
growth and ensure its soundness. We will inject capital only to the extent necessary to allow
the bank to extend loans to the entrepreneurs who suffered damages during June 2010 events.
Going forward, we plan to privatize the bank and, in this context, will develop a strategy by
end-April 2012.
We recognize that the NBKR should have sufficient financial resources to employ necessary
staff and experts to tackle the difficult problems.
24.
We acknowledge the need to strengthen mechanisms to deter money laundering.
We will work towards enhancing interagency coordination between relevant government
agencies by reestablishing the Interagency Commission for Combating the Financing of
Terrorism and Legalization (laundering) of Proceeds from Crime, composed of the State
Financial Intelligence Service, the NBKR, the National Security Service, the General
Prosecutor’s Office, the State Financial Market Supervision and Regulation Service and other
relevant agencies, if any. The commission will meet on a regular basis and will prepare
proposals on developing and implementing an AML/FT national strategy to strengthen the
AML/CFT system and ensure interaction between government authorities on AML/CFT
issues. The SFIS will streamline the financial analysis of the AML/CFT-related information
it receives.
25.
We recognize that the Special Bank Refinancing Fund (SBRF), which was set up
in 2009 by the NBKR to provide loans to commercial banks and micro finance
institutions, should be phased out. We will therefore announce the liquidation of the SBRF
by issuing the relevant NBKR Board decision (prior action). Subsequently, we will transfer
the loan portfolio to the NBKR and the government, in proportion to their funding

54
contributions (structural benchmark). We will not create any development/investment vehicle
without prior consultation with IMF staff to ensure consistency with our program
commitments.
26.
The recent experience with the banking sector revealed that the NBKR’s
supervisory independence had been compromised and that there are weaknesses in the
legal framework for early intervention and resolution of problem banks. Gaps, overlaps
and inconsistencies in the banking laws render them difficult to interpret and apply, and may
inadvertently hinder the protection of the interests of depositors and the maintenance of
financial stability. We will submit to Parliament banking legislation to remedy these
shortcomings as follows (structural benchmark):

Banking Code. We will compile our banking laws into a Banking Code to ensure that
only the Constitution and/or Constitutional Laws will supersede the banking laws.

Early Intervention and Bank Resolution. The Banking Code will strengthen the
existing powers of the NBKR with respect to the early intervention and resolution of problem
banks, in line with international best practice and based on technical assistance from Fund
staff. The Banking Code will provide for the appointment of an official administrator to a
problem bank who will be empowered to use a range of restructuring tools, under the
direction of the NBKR, such as recapitalization, purchase and assumption transactions and
the establishment of a bridge bank, without preemptive rights of shareholders or creditors. In
the event that a problem bank cannot be restructured as a going concern, the NBKR will be
empowered to commence out-of-court liquidation proceedings against the bank.

The role of the judiciary. The Banking Code will limit the scope of judicial review of
actions taken by the NBKR to better align it with international best practice. This would
entail limiting the courts’ review of technical matters within the competence of the NBKR.

Rights of bank shareholders and creditors. The Banking Code will ensure that the
rights of bank shareholders and creditors are adequately protected and appropriately balanced
against the public interest in depositor protection and financial stability. Shareholders and
creditors will retain their rights to challenge the lawfulness of actions taken by the NBKR in
court and to seek monetary damages.

Legal Protection for NBKR staff and agents. The Banking Code will contain
provisions that ensure that the NBKR, rather than its individual staff members or agents, is
liable for actions taken by those individuals in the performance of their official duties.
D. Governance
27.
We fully recognize that our country’s image has been damaged by the high level
of perceived corruption, impeding the prospects of economic growth and sustainable
development. International agencies have been ranking the Kyrgyz Republic very low for

55
the last five years due to the widespread perception of corruption. Addressing this issue
remains one of the biggest challenges for our government, but we are working hard to
improve this image. Addressing governance issues will ensure the efficient use of public
resources and improve the business climate, which will be instrumental to attract high-quality
domestic and foreign investments in the country.
28.
Increasing transparency will play a pivotal role in reinforcing governance
reforms. Shortly after the new government came to power, we stepped up efforts to become
an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) compliant county. While the formal
launch of the EITI for The Kyrgyz Republic was announced in 2004, the process stalled. We
undertook corrective actions in October 2010 and we were accepted by the EITI Board as a
compliant country on March 1, 2011. Given the Kyrgyz Republic’s natural resource
endowment being an EITI compliant member demonstrates our commitment to enhance
transparency.
29.
As part of the Fuel Energy Sector Transparency Initiative, we have requested
USAID’s Regional Energy Security, Efficiency and Trade project to undertake phase
one management diagnostics of the main companies in the electricity sector of the
Kyrgyz Republic. The primary purpose of this appraisal is to identify ways to improve the
governance and performance of each state-owned company and thus, establish the basis for
the entire sector to become more efficient, self-sustaining and customer-oriented. The
appraisal revealed many shortcomings in management practices of the companies, including
weak control over procurement, exaggeration of reported technical losses, and lack of
credible strategic planning. We will address these deficiencies in the course of phase two and
three of the project, thus improving governance in energy sector crucial for the Kyrgyz
economy. In addition, we hope to get World Bank support to improve energy sector
transparency, accountability, and operational efficiency, and to enhance financial discipline
through its planned Economic Recovery Support Operation.
30.
Governance issues related to the financial activities and reporting procedures of
the Kyrgyz Republic Development Fund (KRDF), currently undergoing liquidation,
prevented the previous government from completing reviews under the program
supported by the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF). We recognize the Fund’s constructive
role in helping to safeguard bilateral assistance received from Russia in 2009. We believe
that there are still many unknowns in KRDF’s operations. In line with our commitment under
the RCF (see RCF MEFP, ¶17 (b)), we will select a reputable international auditing firm
(big-four) to conduct a forensic audit of the KRDF from its inception through end-April
2011 (prior action). We will provide all the necessary information to the external auditor.
Once finalized, we will publish the forensic audit report (structural benchmark). Mindful of
the implications for the Fund-supported program, we will not create any other extra
budgetary fund throughout the duration of the ECF arrangement and will ensure that all
public finances are channeled through the budget.

56
31.
Despite the favorable rankings the Kyrgyz Republic enjoys in business climate
indicators, the business community is very vocal about the problems encountered in
their activities. We are analyzing the reasons behind this in close consultation with
representatives of the business community. Recognizing the importance of improving the
business climate our APES envisages measures to reduce administrative burdens on
taxpayers, strengthen property rights and, and streamline business registration and
operations.
E. Other Structural Reforms
32.
The caretaker government partially reversed the large electricity tariff increase
implemented by the previous government in January 2010 because of the heavy burden
placed on socially vulnerable citizens. This reversal has postponed much-needed reforms
and worsened the financial condition of the energy sector. We will design energy sector
reform with the objective to reduce losses in the sector, and increase its competitiveness and
attract foreign investors, which should help to generate funding for its rehabilitation. The
reform will be designed in close consultation with our development partners. We also intend
to export summer surplus power to new markets.
33.
We have carefully weighed pros and cons of joining the Belarus-KazakhstanRussia Customs Union (CU). We have submitted an application and plan to launch
membership negotiations shortly. We have set up a working group headed by the ministry of
economic regulation to conduct the negotiations. We will consult with the World Trade
Organization during this process.
F. Safeguards Assessment
34.
We recognize the importance of completing an updated safeguards assessment of
the NBKR by the first review under the ECF arrangement. The NBKR has provided the
IMF’s Finance Department all the requested information, including the authorization to speak
with its external auditor and stands ready to receive a safeguards mission, if needed. We are
also committed to implement recommendations emerging from the safeguards assessment
and include priority ones in future measures under the Fund-supported program. We also
agree to update the February 6, 2010 memorandum of understanding between the ministry of
finance and the NKBR on the management of foreign exchange reserves, including those for
budgetary support.
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING
35.
The Fund-supported program will be monitored through prior actions,
quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks. Prior
actions and structural benchmarks are set out in Table 1; the quantitative targets
(performance criteria and indicative targets) for end-June 2011, end-September 2011,
end-December 2011, end-March 2012, and end-June 2012 and continuous performance

57
criteria, are set out in Table 2. The reviews will be conducted semi-annually based on
end-June and end-December test dates. The first and second reviews will be expected to take
place by November 30, 2011 and April 16, 2012, respectively. The understandings between
the Kyrgyz authorities and IMF staff regarding the quantitative performance criteria and the
relevant structural measures described in this memorandum and reporting requirements are
further specified in the technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) attached to this
memorandum.

APPENDIX III. KYRGYZ REPUBLIC: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
June 2, 2011
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum defines the quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets
and adjustors, and establishes the content and frequency of the data to be provided to IMF
staff for program monitoring related to the economic program supported by an arrangement
under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The indicators presented in Table 2 of the
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies dated June 2, 2011 reflect the
understandings on quantitative performance criteria reached between the authorities of the
Kyrgyz Republic and staff of the IMF.
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Definitions and concepts
2.
Test dates. Quantitative performance criteria are set semi-annually starting June 30,
2011 through June 30, 2012, and are to be met at the end of each period.
3.
National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR). The NBKR is the central bank of
the country and is responsible for the formulation and implementation of monetary policy,
bank supervision, and the payment system. For the purpose of the program, the NBKR
includes all its central and regional offices.
4.
Public sector. For the purpose of the program, the public sector comprises the
general government, the NBKR, and 10 largest nonfinancial public enterprises (enterprises
and agencies in which the government owns more than 50 percent of the shares, but which
are not consolidated in the budget, as listed in Table 1). The State budget comprises central
and local government budgets. The general government budget includes the State, Social
Fund and the Development Fund (hereinafter, KRDF) budgets.1
5.
Foreign-financed Public Investment Program (PIP) loans and grants. The foreign
financed PIP is a program of investments in infrastructure and social sectors agreed by the
general government of the Kyrgyz Republic and its donors (including but not limited to
international financial organizations). The PIP is fully financed by related grants and loans.
6.
Program loans and grants are loans and grants received by the general government
for direct budget support from external donors and not related to PIP financing.

1

KRDF will be included for the duration of its existence.

61
7.
The stock of external payment arrears for program monitoring purposes is defined
as the end-of-period amount of external debt service due and not paid within the grace period
specified in the relevant debt contract, including contractual and late interest. For arrears to
exist, a creditor must claim payment of amounts due and not paid. Amounts in dispute are not
considered arrears. Arrears for which a clearance framework/rescheduling or restructuring
has been agreed with the creditor are not considered arrears for program monitoring
purposes. Program arrears would include any debt service due under such agreements that
has not been paid.
8.
Concessional and nonconcessional debt. Concessional debt is defined as debt with a
grant element equivalent of 35 percent or more. The grant element of a debt is the difference
between the present value (PV) of the debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage
of the nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by
discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt. The discount rates
used for this purpose are the currency specific commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs),
published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation Development (OECD). For debt
with a maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year-average CIRR will be used to calculate the
PV of debt and, hence, its grant element. For debt with a maturity of less than 15 years, the
six-month average CIRR will be used. To both the ten-year and six-month averages, the same
margins for differing repayment periods as those used by the OECD need to be added
(0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years, 1 percent for 15 to 19 years,
1.15 percent for 20 to 29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more). The debt refers also
to commitments contracted or guaranteed and for which value has not been received. The
calculation of concessionality will take into account all aspects of the loan agreement,
including maturity, grace period, payment schedule, upfront commissions, and management
fees. The calculation is performed by the authorities and verified by the IMF staff based on
the data provided by the authorities.
9.
Valuation changes (program exchange rates). For program monitoring, U.S.
dollar-denominated components of the NBKR’s balance sheets will be valued at the program
exchange rates. The program exchange rate of the KGS to the U.S. dollar is set at the
end-2010 exchange rate of KGS 47.0992 = US$1. The corresponding cross exchange rates
and program gold price for the duration of the program are provided in Table 2.

B. Quantitative performance criteria
Floor on net international reserves of the NBKR in convertible currencies2
Definitions
10.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the NBKR. The floor on NIR will be calculated
as the difference between total international reserve assets and total international reserve
liabilities of the NBKR in convertible currencies. Total international reserve assets of the
NBKR are defined as the NBKR holdings of monetary gold, holdings of SDRs, reserve
position in the IMF, and any holdings of convertible foreign currencies in cash or with
foreign banks, and debt instruments issued by nonresidents that are liquid. Accrued interest
on deposits, loans, and debt securities are included in reserve assets and liabilities,
correspondingly. Reserve assets pledged as collateral or otherwise encumbered, capital
subscriptions in foreign financial institutions, and illiquid assets of the NBKR are excluded.
Also excluded are net forward positions, defined as the difference between the face value of
foreign-currency denominated NBKR off-balance sheet claims on nonresidents and foreign
currency obligations to both residents and nonresidents. Total international reserve liabilities
of the NBKR in convertible currencies are defined as the sum of Kyrgyz Republic’s
outstanding liabilities to the IMF and other convertible currency liabilities to nonresidents
with an original maturity of up to and including one year. NIR is not affected when foreign
assets are received by the NBKR through foreign currency swaps with resident financial
institutions. Total international reserves and NIR decline with the provision of foreign assets
by the NBKR through foreign currency swaps with resident financial institutions.3 For
program monitoring purposes, total international reserve assets and liabilities will be valued
at the program exchange rates as described in paragraph 9 above. Thus calculated, the stock
of net international reserves in convertible currencies amounted to US$1,526 million on
December 31, 2010.
11.
Net foreign assets (NFA) of the NBKR. NFA consist of net international reserve
assets plus other net foreign assets, including the medium- and long-term foreign obligations
of the NBKR, other net claims on CIS countries, reserve assets pledged as collateral or
otherwise encumbered, capital subscriptions in foreign financial institutions, and illiquid

2

Convertible currencies are defined as currencies that are freely usable for settlements of international
transactions.
3
In case of a foreign currency swap that involves receipt of foreign currency by the NBKR and transfer of local
currency to a resident financial institution, total international reserves increase, NIR is unchanged, and net
claims on domestic banks in soms increase. In case of a foreign currency swap that involves transfer of foreign
currency by the NBKR and receipt of local currency from a resident financial institution, total international
assets and NIR decline, while the NBKR net claims on resident banks remain unchanged.

63
assets. For program monitoring purposes, other NFA will also be valued at program
exchange rates. Thus defined, other NFA is projected to amount to minus KGS 8280 million
at end-June, end-September, and end-December 2011.
Adjustors
12.
The floor on NIR will be adjusted upward/downward to the full extent of any
excess/shortfall in program grants and program loans, as given in Table 3 and
upward/downward to the full extent that amortization and interest payments of public
external debt is less/more than the amortization and interest payments given in Table 3.
Ceiling on the net domestic assets of the NBKR
Definitions
13.
Net domestic assets of the NBKR (NDA) are defined as reserve money of the NBKR
(defined below), minus NFA as defined above. Items in foreign currencies will be valued at
program exchange rates.
14.
Thus defined, NDA consist of: (a) gross credit to the general government from the
NBKR, minus deposits of the general government with the NBKR; (b) gross credit to
domestic banks by the NBKR; c) net claims on other financial corporations and (d) all other
net assets of the NBKR (other items net). Thus defined, the stock of NDA amounted to minus
KGS 14,933 million on December 31, 2010.
Adjustors
15.
The ceiling on NDA will be adjusted downward/upward to the full extent of any
excess/shortfall in program grants and program loans, as given in Table 3 and
downward/upward to the full extent that amortization and interest payments of public
external debt is less/more than the amortization and interest payments given in Table 3.
Ceiling on the cumulative overall cash deficit of the general government
Definitions
16.
The overall cash deficit of the general government will be measured from the
financing side (below the line) at current exchange rates and will be defined as the sum of:
a) the change in the stock of net claims of the domestic banking system and nonfinancial
institutions and households on the general government. The change in the stock of net
claims of the domestic banking system on the general government is defined as the
change in the stock of the banking system claims on the general government, less the
change in the stock of all deposits of the general government with the banking
system. The claims of the banking system on the general government include: bank

64
loans to the general government; any securities issued by the general government and
held by domestic banks, with the exception of those issued in relation with bank
rescue operations; and overdrafts on the current accounts of the general government
with banks;
b) the change in the stock of net claims of foreign governments, banking systems, and
nonfinancial institutions and households on the general government;
c) net privatization receipts, i.e. any new sales net of purchases of shares;
d) net foreign loans disbursed to the general government for budgetary support; and
e) net foreign loans disbursed to the general government for PIP financing.
The quantitative performance criteria for the fiscal balance are calculated on the projected
exchange rate. Reporting and adjustments, as defined above, will be made using current
exchange rates.
Adjustors
17.
The ceiling on the cumulative overall cash deficit of the general government will be
adjusted downward to the full extent of any excess in program grants, as given in Table 3.
The ceiling on the cumulative overall cash deficit of the general government will be adjusted
downward to the full extent of any shortfall in program loans, as given in Table 3 and
upward/downward to the full extent that PIP loans are more/less than PIP loans given in
Table 3.
Ceiling on contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external debt by the
public sector (continuous quantitative performance criteria)
Definitions
18.
Debt. In connection with the contracting or guaranteeing of short-, medium-, and
long-term external debt by any entity of the public sector, for program purposes, the
definition of debt is set out in Executive Board Decision No. 6230–(79/140, Point 9, as
revised on August 31, 2009 (Decision No. 14416–(09/91)) and reads as follows:
a) For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a
current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through
the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and
which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will
discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts
can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:

65
i.

loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis
of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including
deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and
temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans
under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay
interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as
repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);

ii.

suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to
defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are
delivered or services are provided; and

iii.

leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee
has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually
shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor
retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the
present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to
be made during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that
cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.

b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9 (a) above, arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a
contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an
obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery)
will not give rise to debt.
For program purposes, external debt is defined based on the residency of the creditor.
19.
External debt ceilings apply to the contracting or guaranteeing by the public sector
(as defined in section II. A., paragraph 4) of nonconcessional external debt, i.e. external debt
with grant element of less than 35 percent (see section II. A., paragraph 7), except normal
short-term import-related credits and NBKR international reserve liabilities. The current
nonzero ceiling (US$450 million) is tied to infrastructure projects in the energy sector.
Should the total borrowings for these projects be less than US$450 million, the remaining
space cannot be used to borrow for other projects. The grant element on these loans is
expected to be slightly less than 35 percent but will not be lower than 30 percent.
20.
Exclusions from the external debt limits. Disbursements by the IMF are excluded
from the ceilings on external debt. Also excluded from external debt ceilings is the
contracting or guaranteeing of new external debt that constitutes a rescheduling or
refinancing of existing external debt on the terms more favorable to the debtor.
21.
Guarantees. For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit
legal obligation of the public sector to service a debt in the event of nonpayment by the

66
debtor (involving payments in cash or in kind), or from any implicit legal or contractual
obligation of the public sector to finance partially or in full a shortfall incurred by the debtor.
22.
New external payments arrears. Ceiling on accumulation of new external
payments arrears is a continuous quantitative performance criterion.
C. Indicative targets
Ceiling on reserve money
23.
Reserve money is defined as the NBKR’s national currency liabilities to the
economy, which includes currency issued and liabilities to other depositary corporations.
Cumulative floor on state government tax collections
24.
Tax collections in cash correspond to the line “Tax Receipts” in the Treasury Report
and comprise the following categories: tax on income and profits; taxes on goods and
services; specific taxes on services; turnover taxes; taxes on property; taxes on international
trade; and other taxes. Tax collections include collections of tax arrears but exclude tax
offsets.
Cumulative floor on state government spending on targeted social assistance
25.
Targeted social assistance spending comprises state government spending on
Unified Monthly Benefit (UMB) and Monthly Social Benefit (MSB) programs.
III. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE ARRANGEMENT
26.
The government and the NBKR will provide the IMF with the necessary economic
and financial statistical data to monitor economic developments and the quantitative targets
(Table 4). In particular, the government and the NBKR will provide the following specific
information.4
A. The balance sheet of the NBKR
27.
The NBKR will provide to the IMF its analytical balance sheet on a daily basis. The
information provided will clearly identify the following items in the definitions specified
above: the gross foreign assets and liabilities of the NBKR, decomposed by currency and
instrument for the assets and by currency and creditor for the liabilities (decomposition
provided on a monthly basis); the net foreign assets of the NBKR; the net international
4

Any correction or revisions to data previously reported should be clearly indicated and documented along with
the reasons for the revision.

67
reserves of the NBKR; medium- and long-term liabilities; the net domestic assets of the
NBKR; net credit from the NBKR to the general government, disaggregated by state
government and the KRDF; net credit from the NBKR to commercial banks; net claims to
other financial corporations; other items net; and reserve money. The balance sheet will be
provided using both actual and program exchange rates. The above information will be
provided to the IMF Resident Representative and/or transmitted by e-mail to the IMF.
B. Monetary survey
28.
Monthly banking system data, in the form of monetary surveys of the banking sector
and other depository corporations, will be reported to the IMF by the NBKR within 16 days
of the end of the month. The information provided will clearly identify the following items:
net foreign assets and net domestic assets of the banking system, medium- and long-term
liabilities, net credit from the banking system to the general government disaggregated by the
state government, the social fund and the KRDF, net claims to the rest of the economy, other
items net, and broad money. The monetary survey will be provided using both program and
actual exchange rates.
29.
The NBKR will provide monthly data to the IMF within seven days after the end of
the month on the amount of holdings of treasury bills, treasury bonds and other securities
issued by the state government, differentiated by the following categories of holders: the
NBKR; resident banks; resident nonbanks (including separately the social fund and deposit
insurance fund); and nonresidents. The information will be provided in both the book
(nominal) value and the actual value, where applicable.
C. International reserves and key financial indicators
30.
The NBKR will provide detailed monthly data within 20 days from the end of the
month on the composition of both its gross and net international reserves in convertible
currencies and holdings of monetary gold. These data will be provided at two alternative sets
of the exchange rates and the gold price: first, at those used to derive the NFA position in the
NBKR accounts; and second, at those specified in the program (Section I). The NBKR will
also provide data on net foreign financing flows, including disbursements of program loans
and grants, amortization, interest payments on external debt, interest income on reserves,
other direct foreign currency payments by the government and the NBKR. In addition,
weekly reports should be sent to the IMF on (a) nominal exchange rates (including the
official and interbank exchange rates), foreign exchange interbank market turnover, and the
volume of NBKR foreign exchange sales and purchases in the domestic interbank market and
with other parties, on a daily basis; and (b) treasury bill yields and the amount of treasury bill
sales and redemptions on a weekly basis every Monday. On the twenty-fifth day of the month
following the reference month, the NBKR will provide indicators of financial soundness of

68
the banking system, including the ratios of regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets,
nonperforming loans to total loans, and return on equity, as well as data on bank deposit and
lending rates by maturity.
D. External debt
31.
The ministry of finance, together with the NBKR, will provide monthly information
on the disbursements, principal and interest payment—both actual and falling due—on
contracting and guaranteeing of medium- and long-term external loans by the state
government, nonfinancial public enterprises, and the NBKR; and any stock of outstanding
arrears on external debt service payments within 21 days of the end of each month. In
addition, the ministry of finance will report the total amount of outstanding government
guarantees and external arrears on a monthly basis. While the NBKR will provide the debt
service payment data on private debt, the ministry of finance will provide data on debt
service on public and publicly guaranteed loans.
E. Budgetary and extra budgetary data
32.
In addition to the monthly treasury report, the Social Fund will report monthly on its
operations. This information will be provided to the Fund staff within 26 days from the end
of each reference month. The ministry of finance will also provide monthly reports on the
disbursements and use under the public investment program and budgetary grants with a
one-month time lag.
F. Balance of payments data
33.
The NBKR will provide current account and capital account data, including data on
foreign trade, services, official and private transfers, foreign investment, and disbursements
of public and private loans, on a quarterly basis, with at most a three-month lag. The NBKR
will also provide monthly foreign trade data with a two-month lag.
G. Other general economic information
34.
The National Statistics Committee will notify the IMF of the monthly Consumer
Price Index by category by the fifteenth business day of the following month, and convey
monthly GDP estimates within 30 days of the end of each month.

Status of HIPC and MDRI Assistance

Based on end-2004 data, the Kyrgyz Republic is potentially eligible for HIPC relief. The
Executive Board considered the preliminary HIPC document on October 13, 2006. However,
in 2007, the authorities indicated that they did not wish to avail themselves of debt relief
under the HIPC Initiative.
VIII.

Safeguards Assessments

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessments policy, an update assessment of the National Bank
of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) was completed on April 9, 2009. Previous assessments were
completed in October 2005 and in January 2002. The 2009 assessment found a strengthened
safeguards framework at the central bank, but raised concerns and made recommendations
about the need for updated terms of reference for audits of program data, and the lack of a
benchmark financial reporting framework and multi-year audit appointments. An update
assessment is currently underway with respect to the request for an ECF.
IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangements

The currency of the Kyrgyz Republic has been the som (100 tyiyn = 1 som) since
May 15, 1993. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating arrangement. The NBKR
participates and intervenes in the interbank foreign exchange market to limit exchange rate
volatility as necessary. The de-facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other
managed arrangement. The NBKR publishes daily the exchange rate of the som in terms of
the U.S. dollar, which is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The official
exchange rate of the som against the dollar is calculated as the daily weighted average of the
exchange rates used in the purchase and sale transactions of dollars conducted in the foreign
exchange market through the Trade Information Electronic System (TIES) of the NBKR for
the reporting period from 3.00 pm of the previous trading day to 3.00 pm of the current
trading day. The government uses the official exchange rate for budget and tax accounting
purposes as well as for all payments between the government and enterprises and other legal
entities. The official rate may differ by more than two percent from freely determined market
rates, because the official exchange rate is set based on the average transaction-weighted rate
of the preceding day, which may give rise to a multiple currency practice. In practice, the
official and market rates have never differed by more than 2 percent.
The Kyrgyz Republic maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for exchange
restrictions maintained for security reasons relating to the restriction of financial transactions
and the freeze of accounts of certain individuals or organizations associated with terrorism
pursuant to (i) relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and (ii) the list of current terrorist

4
organizations designated by the U.S. Secretary of State. The authorities have notified these
measures to the Fund.
X.

Article IV Consultations

The Kyrgyz Republic is on the 24-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation
discussions were held in March 2009 and were completed by the Executive Board in May
2009 (see Country Report No. 09/209, 5/11/09).
XI.

FSAP Participation and ROSC Assessment

An FSAP update mission in October 2006 reviewed progress since the 2002 assessment, and
the Board considered the Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) along with the
fourth PRGF review in May 2007. A fiscal ROSC mission was held in March 2001 and the
ROSC Fiscal Transparency Module was published on March 13, 2002. A data ROSC mission
was held in November 2002 and the ROSC Data Module was published in November 2003.
A fiscal ROSC reassessment was held in September 2007.
XII.

Resident Representative

The eighth resident representative of the Fund in the Kyrgyz Republic, Mr. Gvenetadze, took
up his post in Bishkek in October 2009.

ANNEX II. KYRGYZ REPUBLIC––RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of May 19, 2011)
World Bank Group Strategy: A Joint Country Support Strategy 2007–10 (JCSS)—one of
the earliest in the Bank—was prepared for the Kyrgyz Republic by a group of six donors and
presented to the Board in mid-2007. Currently The Kyrgyz Country team is working on
preparation of the Interim Strategy Note (ISN). The proposed ISN builds on the
achievements of the JCSS and the lessons drawn from its experience. It is intended to cover
two fiscal years: 2012 and 2013. Its need arises from the acute political and social
uncertainties faced by the country following turmoil in mid-2010, and the absence of a
medium term development framework upon which a full IDA strategy could be based. The
ISN is built around the near-term program of an elected government as well as strong donor
partnerships, characterized by joint IMF and IDA funding of budgetary needs together with
other multilateral donors, and well developed joint initiatives in high poverty-impact
investment programs, in such areas as health and community development.
IDA allocation: IDA-15 allocations for the Kyrgyz Republic were on a 45 percent grant and
55 percent credit basis. IDA allocations for the FY11 were US$136 million, including
US$10.4 million from Crisis Response Window (CRW) facility and US$56 million from
reallocation of IDA-15 envelope.
IDA Portfolio: The active portfolio consists of 19 IDA financed investment projects and one
budget support operation, totaling US$302.6 million out of which US$165.9 million has been
disbursed.
FY11 Lending Program: In FY11, following the Donors Meeting in 2010 (see below) and
in response to the considerable needs of the country for financial assistance, the Bank
prepared two emergency operations: an Emergency Recovery Project (ERP) in the amount of
US$70 million (US$54.40 million from IDA and US$15.60 million from CRW), and an
Additional Financing for the National Road Rehabilitation Project (Osh-Batken-Isfana) in the
amount of US$10 million, both processed under Operational Policies; OP.8.0, Rapid
Response to Crises and Emergencies and approved in September 2010. In addition, the
second Education for All- Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) grant in the amount of
US$6 million to support the Government’s introduction of the national school preparation
program has been approved this FY.
Trust Funds: In addition to IDA funds, the Bank manages a significant number of
co-financing and stand-alone Trust Funds. To date, the TF Portfolio has a total value of
US$98.4 million including 17 Bank Executed TFs and 20 Recipient Executed TFs, out of
which US$72.6 million has been disbursed. The largest TF donors are EU, SDC, DFID and
Japan.
AAA Program: The Bank led the preparation of a Joint Economic Assessment (JEA),
together with the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund, with the

6
participation of four other donors. The JEA, which followed the principles of the European
Commission-United Nations-World Bank agreement Joint Declaration on Post-Crisis
Assessments and Recovery Planning, 2008, was presented at the High Level Donors Meeting
on July 27, 2010, where donors pledged US$1.1 billion over a 30-month period including
US$200 million pledged by the World Bank. The FY11 AAA program also includes a
Poverty Update; an Agricultural Policy Update, Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening
(FIRST) Initiative TAs on: (i) Strengthening Bank Supervision and Resolution,
(ii) Strengthening the Legal, Regulatory, Supervisory and Market Infrastructure Framework
for Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI) and Securities Markets, and (iii) Deposit
Protection Agency (DPA) Capacity Building.
Pipeline projects: The Kyrgyz Republic has received an additional US$56 million from the
IDA-15 reallocation. There are five IDA operations under preparation, scheduled for Board
presentation in May–June, 2011:
1. Central Asia Hydrometeorology Modernization project (US$2 million of IDA country
allocation and US$4 million of CA regional allocations) with an objective: (i) to
improve coordination, information sharing and training between NMHSs of the
Central Asian countries; and (ii) strengthen the hydromet service delivery in Kyrgyz
Republic and Republic of Tajikistan and in other participating Central Asia countries.
2. Additional Financing for Health and Social protection SWAP (US$24 million) to
finance the implementation of expanded activities that scale-up the project’s impact
and its development effectiveness. Specifically, it would finance activities associated
with the conflict in the Osh and Jalalabad provinces in June 2010, which exacerbated
the already poor health, nutrition and social conditions in the South of the country.
3. Additional Financing for Disaster Hazard Mitigation project (US$1 million) to cover
a financing gap in the original DHMP.
4. The Second Additional financing for National Road Rehabilitation project
(US$16 million) to scale up of NRRP project activities to improve road infrastructure,
reduce travel time, lower vehicle operating costs, and provide reliable access to social
services and economic activities for the population (in particular living along the road
corridor in Batken and Osh oblasts), as well as improve management of the road
network in the country.
5. Additional Financing for On-farm Irrigations project (US$15 million) to finance the
costs associated with scaling up of OIP-2 project activities to enhance the impact of
this well-performing project, especially on vulnerable rural communities in the south
of the Kyrgyz Republic which have been affected by ethnic clashes in the summer of
2010.
In addition to IDA financed operations, two projects, financed by TFs are also under
preparation:
1. Food Security and Agriculture Productivity Assistance project in the amount of
US$6.85 million is being prepared for financing under the Russia Food Price Crisis
Rapid Response Trust Fund made available to the Kyrgyz Republic.
2. Health Result based Financing project (US$12 million) to assess the impact of the
RBF pilot on quality of health care.

7

The ISN is scheduled for Board presentation on July 26, 20011 along with Economic
Recovery Support Operation (ERSO). The ERSO (US$30 million), a budget support
operation, will support the Government’s efforts to strengthen public sector governance,
address urgent social and reconstruction needs and restore private sector confidence, all
critical to put the country back on track to recovery, growth and poverty reduction.
IFC Program and Portfolio
1.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) continues to contribute to sustainable
private sector development with long-term financing and advisory services to local financial
institutions, and direct financing to small enterprises for the expansion and modernization of
their operations. The engagement of IFC has accelerated in the period of 2007–10, and
these efforts have been complimentary to WB efforts in private sector development and
development of the financial sector. IFC will continue focusing on private sector
development and aiming to increase its investments with a particular focus on the banking,
manufacturing, mining, and agribusiness sectors. In addition, IFC is planning to participate in
financing investment programs of privatized entities if privatization is undertaken in an open
and transparent manner and in line with international best practice. In infrastructure, IFC is
exploring opportunities, primarily on a subnational basis, in power transmission, hydropower
plants, and municipal utilities. In addition, an IFC Infrastructure Advisory program is being
implemented in the Central Asia region and IFC is seeking to engage with the Kyrgyz
government to assist with privatizations and concessions.

IFC STRATEGY AND PROGRAM:
Increase access to finance for MSMEs by strengthening local financial institutions and
providing credit lines for MSME financing to local banks and expanding microfinance
institutions.
Develop institutional capacity and support capacity building of financial institutions
(including leasing and insurance, if there are opportunities) and microfinance companies
and improve corporate governance in local enterprises.
Increase private sector participation in infrastructure through selective advisory and
investment climate engagement.
Assist the agribusiness sector directly and through MSMEs finance to banks and
microfinance companies.
Support the improvement of business environment and investment climate.

Since becoming a member of IFC in 1993, the Kyrgyz Republic has received commitments
totaling more than US$90 million from IFC’s own funds to finance more than 25 projects in
the financial, banking and microfinance, oil, gas and mining sector, agribusiness, pulp and
paper sectors. New commitments in 2007–10 amounted to US$27.4 million. As of April 1,
2011, IFC’s committed portfolio was US$28 million, which includes investments in six
companies, representing banking, microfinance and real sector companies.

8
IFC will continue its advisory services work in the financial sector, developing
corporate governance and improving the business environment. The Azerbaijan-Central
Asia Financial Infrastructure Project is planning to complete its work on the Code of
Conduct, strengthen the institutional capacity of the private credit bureau, and possibly work
on the special law on credit bureaus. The Investment Climate project will continue working
with the government on ensuring higher transparency standards by helping to draft the new
Law on Inspections and working with inspectorates on introducing risk-based criteria for
inspections and using checklists during inspections. In order to address the revenue
transparency and financial disclosure challenge in the Kyrgyz Republic, a new Project on
Regulatory Reform and Tax Transparency has been launched in 2011 to identify the main
policy constraints and root causes of low formalization and poor tax compliance by real
sector companies and define a set of actionable policy options to increase compliance and
formalization. The project is expected to complement the efforts of IFC’s Investment Climate
work and facilitate an increase in IFC investments in the real sectors of the economy.
MIGA: has supported private sector development in the Kyrgyz Republic by extending
guarantees to foreign direct investments in four projects in the manufacturing, services, and
mining sectors. The total amount of foreign direct investment facilitated by MIGA
guarantees is over US$360 million.
MIGA’s current portfolio in the Kyrgyz Republic consists of guarantees for two projects in
the transport sector: an airline (Kyrgyz Airlines) and an airport services company (Manas
Management Company). The projects are owned by Austrian and Italian investors. The
combined gross exposure from these projects is US$14.8 million. Both of these projects were
the subject of disputes between the investors and the Government during the last four years.
The settlement between the Kyrgyz Government and investors, which was worked out in
May of 2008 with MIGA’s mediating role, has now been fully implemented by both sides.
This finally resolves this matter that had been pending for more than four years. In August
2009 MIGA's guarantee holders withdrew their claim against MIGA and released MIGA
from any liability. In addition, they have dismissed their claims against the government,
which had been pending in the London Court of International Arbitration. At present, there
are no new projects in the Kyrgyz Republic in MIGA’s FY11 pipeline.

ANNEX III. KYRGYZ REPUBLIC––RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(ADB)
(As of May 1, 2011)
The Kyrgyz Republic joined ADB in 1994. ADB's country partnership strategy for the
Kyrgyz Republic is presented in the joint country support strategy1 (JCSS) for 2007–10. The
JCSS was prepared in cooperation with four development partners—the Swiss Cooperation,
the United Kingdom's Department for International Development, the United Nations
Agencies, and the World Bank Group. Three other development partners—the European
Commission, the German Government (presented by GTZ and KfW), International Monetary
Fund, and United States Agency for International Development joined the JCSS at the later
years. In line with the country development strategy, the JCSS identifies four priority areas:
(i) promoting economic management consistent with strong and sustained pro-poor growth;
(ii) improving governance, promoting effective public administration, and reducing
corruption; (iii) building sustainable human and social capital; and (iv) ensuring
environmental sustainability and natural resources management.
ADB's country operations business plan (COBP) 2011–12 updates the country strategy and
program 2007–10 to better help the country address challenges that arose after political
disturbances in April 2010 and a conflict in June 2010, while maintaining consistency with
the priorities set out in ADB’s Strategy 2020.2 The program for 2011–12 continues support to
public infrastructure and institutional reforms, which will contribute to creating a favorable
environment for sustainable growth with broader private sector participation, thereby
generating more jobs and income. ADB will continue to support: (i) transport, (ii) water
supply and other municipal infrastructure and services, (iii) energy, and (iv) public sector
management. Continued support for the education sector, especially for skills development,
is being discussed.
ADB is one of the major development partners in the country. All assistance provided to the
Kyrgyz Republic is from concessional ADB’s special fund resources—Asian Development
Fund (ADF). As of 31 March 2011, the country has received 31 loans worth
US$736.2 million, 14 ADF and 1 GEF grants worth US$249.1 million. The Kyrgyz Republic
has also received seven grants from Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR grants)
amounting to US$7 million. Nine operations totaling US$252 million provided to support
policy reforms to facilitate the transition to a market economy. The remaining operations
(worth US$733.3 million) were provided to support various investment activities. At present,
6 loans and 11 grants with approved amount of US$370.3 million are ongoing.

The Kyrgyz Republic has been eligible for 50 percent grant and 50 percent ADF loan since
2009. The indicative allocation for the two years 2011–12 is US$120 million.
In addition to investment loans and grants, ADB has provided 74 technical assistance (TA)
projects amounting to US$42.7 million as of today.
The performance of ADB’s portfolio is generally satisfactory with no loans or grants rated at
risk. ADB’s annual lending began with US$40 million in 1994 and reached the peak level of
US$167.8 million in 2010.
The Kyrgyz Republic was selected as one of the pilot countries during the February
2003 Rome Conference on Harmonization. Since then key development partners have
learned to better coordinate and harmonize procurement procedures, oversee financial
management and monitoring, share project implementation units, and conduct joint country
portfolio reviews. The JCSS for the Kyrgyz Republic has been prepared by five funding
agencies. The areas identified for harmonization in the immediate future are: (i) procedures
for procurement of goods and services; (ii) financial management and monitoring of projects;
and (iii) project implementation units. World Bank and ADB procurement documentation has
been harmonized in these areas.
ADB cooperates extensively with civil society organizations in the Kyrgyz Republic to
strengthen the effectiveness, quality, and sustainability of the services it provides.

ANNEX IV. KYRGYZ REPUBLIC––RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (EBRD)
(As of May 1, 2011)
Overview of EBRD Activities to Date
The Bank has been actively supporting the transition in Kyrgyz Republic since 1995. From
1995 to the end of 2010, the Bank signed 72 projects accounting for a net cumulative
business volume of €338 million at end 2010. Over the past three years the Bank signed on
average 9–10 projects per year with a total of 29 projects and €154 million in volume over
the period with an average project size of €5.3 million. The Bank has continued to disburse
commitments at approximately €15 million per year. The current private sector portfolio ratio
(as a percentage of the total portfolio) is 84 percent which is well above the Bank’s
60 percent mandated ratio.
Fostering the Private Sector: The Bank’s operations in support of local private enterprises
took advantage of the ETC Initiative, which was instrumental in enabling the Bank to deliver
a number of small projects with significant transition impact, particularly in the areas of
corporate governance and business conduct. In all, the Bank supported eight local operations
under the ETC Initiative. The impact of the global financial crisis and the domestic
socio-political crisis impeded the Bank’s ability to generate the volume of projects originally
anticipated. In particular, a number of private sector projects under preparation when the
crises hit—under DLF, DIF or MCFF—were cancelled or postponed as they became
unbankable.






Under the Direct Lending Facility (DLF), the Bank supported two property sector
operations (a local hotel at the Issyk Kul Lake and a residential compound in Bishkek), a
glass manufacturer, a construction materials producer, and a local food and beverages
producer. As a result of the two crises, the Bank supported fewer DLF operations than
expected: following the global financial crisis in 2008–09, the number of potential
property projects decreased; following the socio-political turmoil in 2010, several DLF
projects under preparation were cancelled and/or postponed.
Under the Medium-sized Co-Financing Facility (MCFF), the Bank supported a leading
food retailer with two MCFF loans. These were the Bank’s first deals in the country’s
retail sector and the first sub-project with a new MCFF partner bank (Demir Kyrgyz
International Bank). This was a modest achievement, with fewer deals under MCFF than
expected coming to fruition. Following the 2010 crisis, it was particularly difficult to
identify larger size investment projects that could be well supported by MCFF.
Under the Direct Investment Facility (DIF), the Bank took a 34 percent equity stake in a
local dairy producer and provided technical assistance under the TAM program to help it
expand its processing plant. This operation complimented an initiative by the Swiss
Government to revive the local economy in remote regions. DIF has proven to be a

16





difficult instrument to deploy widely, as potential clients in the country are not yet ready
to discuss the market value of their companies in accordance with international standards.
Implementation of DIF operations in Kyrgyz Republic have also been quite labor
intensive.
Under the TAM/BAS program, the Bank facilitated the skill transfers to the local
consultancy industry and improved the know-how and management of the MSME sector
through the provision of management and advisory services to over 500 small local
enterprises under the TAM/BAS grant-funded program. This included a successful crisis
response initiative in the South in 2010. Despite the difficult business climate, turnover
increased in nearly 50 percent of TAM/BAS in the year following project completion,
and 16 percent of the clients secured external investments. The Bank has supported the
growing professionalism of local advisory services to serve the MSME sector on a
sustainable basis and introduced more sophisticated advisory services in areas such as
quality management and energy efficiency.
The Bank supported a landmark large scale operation with a foreign strategic investor in
2010: a US$150 million three-year revolving credit facility with Centerra Gold Inc. in
support of the company’s ongoing operations and potential acquisitions of mining assets,
signed in 2010. The company, 33 percent owned by the Kyrgyz state, owns the Kumtor
gold mine, which generates 30 percent of country’s foreign currency reserves and
10 percent of its GDP. One of the major achievements of the project was to improve the
reporting of taxes paid by the mining industry under the “Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI)” and on March 2011, the Kyrgyz Republic became “EITI
Compliant”. The EBRD supported this process through the active policy dialogue with
the authorities and Centerra, the largest mining company in the country.

Strengthening Financial Institutions: The Bank provided crucial support to financial
institutions during the previous strategy period at a time when the country was feeling the
impact of the global financial crisis in 2008–09 and the domestic socio-political crisis in
2010. The global financial crisis affecting Russia and Kazakhstan had a knock-on effect on
the Kyrgyz Republic, in terms of lower demand for Kyrgyz exports and a fall in inflows of
remittances to fund private consumption. As the Kyrgyz banking system was dominated by
banks with foreign capital, particularly from Kazakhstan, all banks and nonbank micro
financial institutions reduced or stopped lending by the end of 2008. The Bank’s crisis
response included:




In 2009, provision of local currency financing to banks. The Bank provided three local
banks and three non-bank micro financial institutions (NBMFIs) with local currency
credit lines totalling the equivalent of €22.7 million at a time of scarce alternative
commercial funding.
In 2010, the Bank disbursed US$6.5 million equivalent (mainly in local currency) under
four existing committed credit facilities in support of local enterprises. The Bank’s

17





continued support to the financial sector after the events of April and June 2010 was seen
as a strong signal to the Bank’s clients as well as other lenders to the sector.
In the context of ongoing work to address local currency lending broadly across the
region under the Bank’s Local Currency and Local Capital Market Initiative, the Bank
developed a proposal for local currency financing mechanisms, which was approved in
February 2011. The Bank aimed to ensure more competitively priced and less volatile
local currency operations and to decrease systemic dollarization risk in the financial
sector by introducing a risk-sharing scheme supported by donor funds.
In response to the crisis in 2010, the Bank supported the National Bank with technical
assistance, including through supporting its efforts to restructure Asia Universal Bank
(AUB), the largest bank in terms of assets prior to the events in 2010, with a forensic
audit of its accounts. This has helped contain a possible systemic crisis in the banking
system.

During the past strategy period, the Bank continued moving its partners forward in area of
corporate governance, through strengthening external and internal audit, improving
shareholder transparency, and implementing better internal policies and procedures. The
Bank also conducted training courses for its partner banks in the area of anti-money
laundering (AML), which will continue to support better AML standards both at Government
and bank levels, and may help to reduce crime and corruption. AML is important in helping
local banks and NBMFIs with their transition to more transparent and commercially oriented
operations.
Support for Critical Infrastructure: During the previous strategy period, the Bank
financed two key infrastructure projects, the first projects to be financed by the Bank in this
sector since 1997. However, intentions to finance infrastructure projects on the basis of PPPs
turned out to be overly ambitious, given the very weak legal and regulatory framework and
the early stage of transition.




The Bank provided a US$35 million sovereign loan to finance the renovation of the
highway linking the towns of Osh, Batken and Isfana. This road plays a crucial role as an
international transit route in the region by linking Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and China.
Through its financing and policy dialogue the Bank sought the following transition
objectives: (i) introduction of tendering procedures for periodic road maintenance,
(ii) refining road user charges and reform of the Road Fund, (iii) formulating the
privatization plan for maintenance units, and (iv) introducing service level agreements for
routing maintenance.
In the municipal infrastructure sector, the Swiss Government and the EBRD provided
€11.8 million to improve the water supply in Bishkek. The project is financed by a grant
of €5.7 million from the Swiss Government and a €5.5 million sovereign loan from the

18



EBRD. Projects in the water sector enabled the Bank to make progress with water tariff
reforms, meeting IFRS accounting standards, and promoting efficiency in the Bishkek
water company.
Despite the difficult domestic situation following the events in April and June 2010, the
Bank continued the implementation of the municipal water project and the preparation of
projects in urban transport and solid waste in Bishkek. In May 2011, the Bank signed
new water/wastewater projects for Osh and Jalalabad.

Policy Dialogue: In line with the 2007 strategic priorities for policy dialogue described
above, the Bank has been working to enhance its dialogue with the government to improve
the investment climate and address bottlenecks affecting local and regional investors,
coordinating with other international financial institutions, donors and the business
community. With generous support from donors, the Bank has provided critical assistance to
the secretariat for the Investment Council since its establishment in early 2007 and
implemented legal TC for the training of judges.








The Investment Council has been providing local and international business
representatives (representing the mining, industry, agro-processing and tourism sectors)
with a forum to discuss the main barriers to doing business with top officials of the
government. Following the political events and subsequent changes in 2010, the new
government acknowledged its commitment to improve the investment climate in the
country and renamed the council as the Council for Business Development and
Investment. The donor community expressed its readiness to continue its full support to
the Council under the new government.
The Bank participated in the IFIs Joint Economic Assessment (JEA), which set out a
strategic framework for reconciliation, recovery and reconstruction after the April and
June events of 2010. The JEA identified the need for external support in three major
areas, including essential public expenditures, social needs, and critical investments. The
JEA helped the government to achieve economic recovery more quickly than expected
after months of political turmoil.
The Bank continued to actively engage in policy dialogue with the government and local
authorities to promote the further reform agenda in corporate and infrastructure sectors,
although reform efforts were temporarily suspended due to the internal political crisis.
The Bank strengthened its collaboration with the Kyrgyz Supreme Court with a view to
increasing capacity in the judiciary dealing with commercial disputes. Since 2007, the
Bank provided technical advice to the Judicial Training Centre, trained judicial trainers,
delivered commercial law training seminars for up to 240 existing judges, created a law
library at the Supreme Court, organized internships in the courts of Kazakhstan and
Russia, and published a bench book on commercial law. The Bank expanded its
assistance in 2010 to help establish a training system for candidate judges, and implement
a fair and transparent judicial selection process.

ANNEX VI. KYRGYZ REPUBLIC––STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The four institutions responsible for
collecting, compiling and disseminating macroeconomic statistics—the National Statistics
Committee (NSC), the Ministry of Economic Regulation (MER), the Ministry of Finance
(MOF), and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR)—have legal and institutional
environments that support statistical quality, and their respective staff are well-versed in
current methodologies.
2.
The NSC maintains a comprehensive and regularly updated website with data that
largely incorporate international methodological recommendations with adequate coverage
and timeliness (http://www.stat.kg). In February 2004, the Kyrgyz Republic subscribed to the
SDDS.
3.
A data ROSC mission in November 2002 concluded that the quality of the
macroeconomic statistics had improved significantly in the last few years. The authorities’
response to the data ROSC (posted on the IMF website (www.imf.org/external/np/rosc)
includes an update on the status of implementation of the ROSC recommendations.
National accounts
4.
In general, dissemination of national accounts statistics is timely. Technical assistance
has been received from the IMF, EUROSTAT, OECD, the World Bank, and bilateral donors.
While significant progress has been made in improving the national accounts estimation
process, problems persist regarding the quality of the source data, due mainly to excessively
tight collection deadlines associated with the release schedule. Efforts are needed to improve
the quality of the source data for quarterly GDP estimates. Moreover, while the quarterly
GDP estimates are disseminated on a discrete basis for SDDS purposes, these estimates are
still derived from cumulative data. Difficulties also remain in properly estimating the degree
of underreporting, especially in the private sector. To improve the coverage and reliability of
primary data, work has been undertaken to introduce sampling procedures. Improved
sampling procedures have been adopted for household surveys and new report forms have
been introduced for the enterprise survey. The NSC has established a division of sample
surveys, which would assist in improving the sampling techniques.
5.
The November 2008 STA mission on national accounts assisted the staff of the
National Accounts Division in NCS to produce discrete quarterly GDP estimates at current
and constant prices, using both the production and expenditure approaches. The mission
made a number of recommendations, including: (a) need to introduce the new establishment
surveys; (b) disseminate the industrial production index (IPI) as a chain-linked indices, in
line with international standards; (c) investigate the inconsistency between the IPI and the
producer price index (PPI); (d) fully computerize the calculation of volume estimates for
agriculture in line with international practice; and (e) obtain time series data for loans and
deposits of financial institutions.

25

Price and labor market statistics
6.
The concepts and definitions used in the CPI, which has been published since
January 1995, are broadly consistent with international standards. The price index covers all
urban resident households of all sizes and income levels, but needs to cover rural households,
which comprise the majority of the population.
7.
The PPI, which has been published since October 1996, is compiled broadly in
accordance with international standards, although its coverage needs to be improved. The
coverage of the PPI was broadened in May 1997 and is expected to be further expanded in
the coming years.
8.
Progress has been made in computing unit value indices for imports and exports.
Work continues with regard to computation of these indices using a standard index
presentation and the development of an export price index. However, problems in customs
administration have led to incomplete coverage of trade and the lack of an appropriate
valuation system. Moreover, the data processed by customs have suffered due to the use of
an outdated computer software system.
9.
Problems exist in the compilation of the average wage, especially with respect to the
valuation of payments in kind and the coverage of the private sector. Monthly and annual
data are not comparable because of different coverage and classifications. These problems
extend to employment data as well. The coverage of unemployment includes an estimate of
unregistered unemployed.
Government finance statistics
10.
The scope of central government statistics falls short of international standards
because it excludes data for the Social Fund (these data are published separately). Other
limitations involve the discrepancies between the deficit and financing data. While revenue
and expenditure data generally accord with the GFSM 1986, there are misclassifications in
both categories (for example, some nontax revenues are classified as taxes, and certain
expenditure items are misclassified in the budget and treasury accounts). Monthly GFS data
are reported to STA for publication in the IFS; the latest data reported for publication in the
GFS Yearbook were for 2006, and covered general government and its subsectors; the data
were compiled using the GFSM 2001 analytical framework.
11.
The provision of data on public external debt service has improved. Data on actual
debt service, guaranteed debt service, outstanding debt and revised debt projections, are
provided on a monthly basis. The quality (including timeliness) of external debt data is
adequate. The External Debt Division of the MOF is now solely responsible for monitoring
external debt, and has benefited from on-site training provided by a Swiss-financed longterm consultant and the computerization of its database.

26

Monetary and financial statistics (MFS)
12.
The 2002 data ROSC mission found that: (a) the residency criterion was not
uniformly applied, as the currency denomination was used to classify some transactions with
foreign and domestic units; (b) deposits with banks in liquidation were included in broad
money; and (c) source data did not provide sufficient information for a more detailed sectoral
breakdown (e.g., subsectorization of nonbank institutions as recommended in the MFSM).
13.
The April/May 2004 STA mission on MFS found that the NBKR had made
substantial progress in implementing ROSC recommendations pertaining to monetary
statistics. To address the outstanding issues, the mission further recommended that the
NBKR (a) improve the basic source data to allow for proper classification of the transactions
with foreign and domestic units; (b) fully implement the MFSM’s methodology concerning
accrual accounting; (c) exclude deposits with banks in liquidation from monetary aggregates
and classify them as restricted deposits; and (d) set up a working group to follow up on
consistency between monetary and balance of payments statistics. The mission also
recommended expanding the current broad money survey to include the accounts of credit
unions and microfinance companies.
14.
The new accounting framework for banks implemented in January 2009 revealed
some problems in classification of a part of the Social Fund deposits. Efforts are under way
to address the consequences of the introduction of the new accounting rules.
15.
Monetary data have been reported electronically to STA using Standardized Report
Forms (SRFs). STA identified classification issues in the reported SRF data, which were
communicated to the authorities. The data will be published in IFS and IFS Monetary and
Financial Statistics Supplement as soon as these issues are resolved.
External sector statistics
16.
Data on the balance of payments and international investment position are compiled
and disseminated on a quarterly basis. The 2002 data ROSC mission noted that the
compilation of balance of payments statistics broadly follows the methodology recommended
in the BPM5. However, deficiencies remain with respect to data on remittances, trade,
services, and foreign direct investment. There is also a need to improve compilation
procedures for achieving temporal consistency of data, and investigating and reconciling
discrepancies. The March 2004 STA mission on balance of payments statistics noted that
while progress had been made in several areas, further improvements were needed in the
international transactions reporting system; data sampling methods; and data validation and
coverage, particularly on trade, services, private sector external debt, and foreign direct
investment.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION AND
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
Kyrgyz Republic—Debt Sustainability Analysis Under the Debt Sustainability
Framework for Low Income Countries
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank
Approved by David Owen and Thomas Dorsey (IMF) and
Yvonne Tsikata and Jeffrey Lewis (World Bank)
June 2, 2011
Based on the joint IMF-World Bank Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Framework,
the Kyrgyz Republic is assessed to remain at a moderate risk of debt distress.1 Stress tests
suggest that the country is still vulnerable, particularly to a combination of exogenous
shocks. Further improvement of the debt outlook will depend on maintaining sound
macroeconomic policies, including fiscal consolidation and prudent borrowing, as well as
ensuring continued concessional financing to support the country’s large development needs.
I. BACKGROUND
The Kyrgyz Republic’s nominal stock of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external
debt declined from about 100 percent of GDP in 2003 to 41 percent in 2008. This decline
was mainly the result of an acceleration in the pace of economic growth and a nominal
appreciation of the domestic currency, but also reflected firm fiscal discipline and Paris Club
support.
The Kyrgyz Republic had two debt restructuring agreements with the Paris Club. The
first was in December 2002 under Houston terms and provided for flow rescheduling in three
phases. The second was in March 2005, under the Evian approach. The Kyrgyz authorities
indicated in early 2007 that they did not wish to avail themselves of the HIPC initiative, but
subsequently expressed interest in the MDRI.
Since end-2008, the nominal stock of PPG external debt has increased, reaching
57 percent of GDP at end-2010. The increase in this ratio largely reflects the decline in
nominal (dollar) GDP in 2009 and 2010 as a result of the international financial crisis and
1

This DSA has been produced jointly by Fund and Bank staffs, in consultation with Asian Development Bank
and the Kyrgyz authorities. The fiscal year for the Kyrgyz Republic is January 1–December 31. The risk rating
would not change with the inclusion of remittances (Figure 2).

2
domestic political instability which negatively impact real growth, but also reflects an uptick
in external borrowing to finance infrastructure development and crisis-related fiscal deficits.
The present value (PV) of PPG external debt was equivalent to US$1.5 billion (34 percent of
GDP) at end-2010, of which 66 percent is owed to international financial institutions (IFIs),
and the remaining 34 percent to bilateral creditors. At end-2010, indebtedness indicators
were estimated to be below the applicable HIPC Initiative thresholds, while income levels
were estimated to be above the IMF MDRI thresholds.
II. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
The macroeconomic assumptions reflect the framework underlying the ECF-supported
program and World Bank and IMF staff projections through 2031. They have been
updated to incorporate recent developments and changes to the medium-term outlook, but
long-term assumptions are broadly similar to the framework used in the last DSA. The data
on the stock of external debt at end-2010 and debt payment schedule were provided by the
Kyrgyz authorities, except for the data on the World Bank and Asian Development Bank
debt, which were provided directly by the two institutions.
The framework assumes implementation of sound macroeconomic policies—including
fiscal consolidation and prudent public debt management—as a basis for sustaining
growth. Near- and medium-term growth would be underpinned by recovery from the shocks
of 2009 and 2010, including a rebound in agricultural production and tourism, and would be
supported by infrastructure investments and strong mining production. Long-term growth
will be generated by firm implementation of structural reforms to remove impediments to
private investment, stimulate economic diversification, and improve the business climate,
including increased financial stability and deepened financial intermediation. The energy
sector, which has large potential, is also envisioned to add positively to growth in the long
run. The framework features average medium-term GDP growth of around 6 percent per year
and average long-term growth over 2017–31 of about 5 percent, as in the previous DSA.
The main updates relative to the last DSA reflect new information regarding the
authorities’ infrastructure development plans and debt relief. Specifically, energy-related
investments have been delayed, partly because of the domestic political unrest in 2010. The
Kyrgyz government is still in discussions with the Chinese authorities to finance and assist in
the construction of substations and transmission lines linking to the south.2 The latest
information indicates total investments in this area to be about US$450 million (compared to
2

These energy infrastructure projects will expand the potential for exporting electricity, improve reliability of
the transmission system and ensure smooth supply of electricity to remote parts of the country. Neighboring
Uzbekistan has been threatening repeatedly to withdraw from the regional power grid that would leave the
southern part of the Kyrgyz Republic without electricity, given that the only way to supply electricity to the
south is through the Uzbek electricity grid.

US$550 million in the previous DSA), including US$208 million likely to be disbursed over
the next two to three years. These investments would be financed with loans from China and
are expected to contain a grant element slightly less than 35 percent, but not less than
30 percent. This borrowing would be accommodated in the ECF-supported program under a
tied, nonzero, nonconcessional debt limit in the equivalent amount. In April 2011, the
authorities reached an agreement with Turkey for a debt write-off in the amount of about
US$49.5 million, which is likely to be effected in 2011.
Planned energy sector investments will ensure
smooth supply of electricity within the country
and contribute to economic growth. During the
construction period (2012–16), the energy
infrastructure projects are estimated to contribute
around a quarter of a percentage point to GDP
growth annually.3 The electricity transmission lines,
when built, will reduce system overloading and
increase the self-sufficiency of supply. The impact
on exports and long-term growth from the energy
projects would be more significant if new large
electricity generation facilities are built.4

Note: Issyk-kul road disbursements are assumed to
take place over three years starting in 2012.

The authorities have also explored the possibility
of investing in transportation infrastructure around a main tourist destination (Lake
Issyk-kul). Borrowings in this area could total approximately US$600 million and be
financed on terms similar to those of the energy infrastructure projects. Given the uncertain
growth effects and the possibility of a significantly worse debt outlook (Text Figure 1), the
authorities have decided not to pursue this investment further at this stage. Consequently, this
borrowing is not included in the baseline DSA projections.

3

The contribution to economic growth will come from increased domestic spending, which is not likely to be
significant, as only around 10 percent of the disbursed financing from China will be spent domestically (the rest
will be used to purchase imported equipment and labor).
4

Kambarata-II (hydropower) was put in operation in 2010, but does not generate substantial volumes of
electricity. Its contributions to exports and growth are therefore limited. Kambarata-I is a much larger project,
but remains highly uncertain and is therefore excluded from this DSA, as from previous DSAs.

Box 1. Kyrgyz Republic: Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth is projected to average about 6 percent over the medium term, underpinned
by economic recovery from the shocks of 2009 and 2010, including a rebound in agricultural
production and tourism and in line with strong recent growth in the main trading partners.
Growth in the medium term would also be supported by infrastructure investments and
strong mining production. Long-term growth would be generated by firm implementation of
structural reforms to remove impediments to private investment, stimulate economic
diversification, and improve the business climate, and is broadly in line with the historical
average and with assumptions in the previous DSA.
After two successive years of contraction, exports would rebound somewhat in 2011, in line
with developments in the mining and tourism sectors, and reflecting strong growth in the
main trading partners. In the medium term, export growth will decelerate as the Kyrgyz
Republic joins the Russia-Kazakhstan-Belarus customs union and transit trade declines.
Import growth in 2011 would be strong, consistent with growth projections and reflecting the
high price of crude oil. In the medium term, import growth will also decelerate with the loss
of transit trade, but the high import content of energy infrastructure projects will dampen the
deceleration somewhat. In the long-term, import growth would be in line with assumptions in
the previous DSA, averaging around 6½ percent. As a result of these trends, the current
account deficit would increase in 2011, but gradually improve, averaging about 5 percent of
GDP in the long term.
With the exception of the energy infrastructure borrowing from China, medium-term public
borrowing is assumed to be on highly concessional terms. Over the longer DSA horizon,
concessionality of new external public borrowing would gradually decline from around
38 percent in 2011 to around 20 percent by 2031, as more borrowing is assumed to be
contracted at less concessional terms.
In line with the programmed fiscal consolidation, government revenues are projected to
increase from about 30 percent of GDP in 2011 to about 32 percent by 2016 and remain
broadly stable at that level through 2031. After a wage-related increase in 2011, noninterest
current expenditure would increase temporarily to about 33 percent of GDP before declining
to about 30 percent of GDP by 2016. As a result, the primary fiscal deficit would deteriorate
to 6.3 percent of GDP in 2011, but gradually improve to 2.4 percent of GDP by 2016. Fiscal
consolidation and appropriately tight monetary policy will also help to maintain (GDP
deflator) inflation at an average of around 7 percent over the medium term.

III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline
The baseline scenario points to a cautiously favorable improvement in the external debt
outlook over time. At end-2010, the PV of debt-to-exports and the PV of debt-to-revenue
ratios, at 62 and 119 percent respectively, were well below their policy-based indicative
thresholds.5 Only the PV of PPG debt-to-GDP ratio, at 34 percent in 2010, is close to its
relevant threshold of 40 percent. This latter ratio then remains broadly stable through the
medium term as energy-related disbursements offset growth gains, before returning to a
sustainable path underpinned by solid growth, fiscal consolidation, and prudent debt
management.
Debt service is expected to remain manageable throughout the DSA horizon. This
reflects the high concessionality of both the outstanding multilateral debt and the assumed
new borrowing over the medium term. The PPG debt service ratio would decline slightly
from 3.6 percent of exports in 2010 to 2.9 percent in 2011 following debt relief from Russia
and Turkey, and remain broadly at that level through the medium and long term.6
B. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
Stress tests and alternative scenarios show that the Kyrgyz Republic’s external debt is
vulnerable to large shocks or substantially less favorable assumptions. The PV of the
external debt-to-GDP ratio and the PV of the external debt-to-revenue rise above the relevant
indicative thresholds under some tests. The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio rises above the
indicative threshold of 40 percent in the medium term (or even over the longer term) when
(i) export value growth is at historical average minus one standard deviation in 2012−13;
(ii) the net non-debt creating inflows over 2012−13 are one standard deviation below their
historical average; and (iii) under a shock over 2012−13 combining lower GDP and export
growth, a decline in the US dollar GDP deflator, and lower net non-debt creating inflows.
The ratio of PV of debt-to-revenue would also approach the relevant indicative threshold of
5

The Kyrgyz Republic is rated as a medium performer based on the World Bank’s Country Performance and
Institutional Assessment Index for low income countries. The relevant policy-dependent thresholds for
countries in this category are 40 percent for the PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio, 150 percent for the PV of
debt-to-exports ratio, 250 percent for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 20 percent of the debt service-to-exports
ratio, and 30 percent of the debt service-to-revenue ratio.
6

Under the debt-for-equity swap agreement signed between the previous Kyrgyz administration and the
Russian authorities in 2009, the Russian side agreed to relinquish claims on the Kyrgyz Republic in the amount
of US$193.5 million in exchange for a 100 percent stake in two state-owned companies in the Kyrgyz Republic.
However, in early 2010, despite the Kyrgyz Republic appearing to have fulfilled all its obligations, the Russian
side called in question the implementation of the agreement and declared the outstanding debt disputed. Since
then the parties have been in close consultations to resolve this issue and a settlement is expected in 2011, as
also assumed in the previous DSA.

6
250 percent in the medium term under the last two conditions. However, the PV of
debt-to-exports ratio is robust and does not breach its threshold under various tests. Debt
service ratios also prove resilient, staying below their indicative threshold levels under
various tests. The historical scenario—where key macro variables evolve according to their
historic averages—points to a more benign external debt outlook than the baseline scenario.
However, an alternative scenario that assumes no fiscal consolidation in the medium term,
financed by external borrowing, results in an unsustainable debt outlook, with the PV of
debt-to-GDP following an upward trend (Text Figure 2).

IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline
Domestic debt is projected to increase and will play a more important role in financing
the budget deficit in the medium and long term. Domestic debt accounted for around
3 percent of total public debt at end-2010. However, by 2031, domestic debt is projected to
reach about 9 percent of total public debt as domestic financial markets deepen.
The Kyrgyz Republic’s public debt outlook is projected to be manageable in the
medium and long term. Under the baseline scenario, the PV of public debt-to-GDP ratio
would increase slightly in the medium term from about 38 percent of GDP at end-2010 to a
maximum of about 42 percent of GDP in 2016 following disbursements for energy-sector
infrastructure. It would then decline gradually to about 37 percent by 2031 reflecting fiscal
consolidation.
B. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
Alternative scenarios and stress tests show that Kyrgyz Republic’s public debt remains
highly sensitive to shocks that reduce real GDP growth and result in unsustainable debt
burden trajectories. The standard sensitivity analysis based on the historical variation of
key parameters, including real GDP growth and exchange rate, shows that debt ratios would
rise considerably in the long run. Under stress tests and scenarios, the PV debt-to-GDP ratio
in 2031 could increase to about 80 percent under the permanent real GDP growth shock

7
scenario and the fixed (at 2011 level) primary deficit scenario. In addition, debt burden
trajectories are ever increasing if the long run growth rate turns out 0.8 percentage points
below the current estimate.
V. DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION AND CONCLUSIONS
Based on the projected external debt burden indicators, the Kyrgyz Republic is
assessed to be at moderate risk of debt distress. All PV-based external debt indicators in
the baseline are projected to stay below their indicative thresholds over the DSA horizon.
Moreover, the debt service burden would remain well below the thresholds, reflecting the
high concessionality of the external debt. Nevertheless, alternative scenarios and stress tests
show that the external public debt indicators could approach or breach the thresholds if the
Kyrgyz Republic were to experience large adverse exogenous shocks or relax its prudent
debt management policy. This conclusion is consistent with the last DSA. When adding
domestic debt to the analysis, total public sector debt seems manageable in light of the
dynamics of the domestic debt stock. This said, debt burden trajectories are highly sensitive
to real GDP shocks and a somewhat smaller long-run real growth rate.
Low-concessionality loans from bilateral and commercial creditors to finance large
public investment projects continue to pose a risk to the debt outlook. Staff recognizes
that the Kyrgyz Republic has large developmental needs, but considers paramount to lock in
the recent progress towards achieving and maintaining debt sustainability. Even if loans have
a grant element of at least 35 percent, it would be important to ensure that the underlying
projects are viable and that market risks, including exchange rate risk, are accounted for, so
as to avoid the buildup of an unsustainable debt burden. Similarly, it would remain important
for the government to seek highly concessional loans, including in the energy sector.
The authorities broadly concurred with this analysis. They are highly concerned about
maintaining debt sustainability and will remain vigilant on the debt outlook. Indeed, given
the uncertain growth benefits and negative debt impact of the potential Issyk-kul road
borrowing, the authorities do not plan to pursue that project further at this point. Looking
forward, the authorities intend to make every effort to contract only concessional loans.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Also includes the effect of the financing gap, which is assumed to create debt, but does not enter the current or financial account.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Kyrgyz Republic
June 20, 2011
1.
This statement briefly summarizes recent developments since the issuance of the Staff
Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation and Request for a Three-Year Arrangement
Under the Extended Credit Facility (www.imf.org). In the staff’s view, none of these
developments warrant any change in the Staff Appraisal.
2.
All three prior actions have been observed. The National Bank of the Kyrgyz
Republic (NBKR) Board adopted a resolution announcing the liquidation of the Special
Bank Refinancing Fund on June 10, 2011. The authorities/NBKR have selected big-four
companies to conduct a forensic audit of the Kyrgyz Republic Development Fund (PWC)
and a financial audit of Zalkar bank (KPMG).
3.
Consumer prices fell in May for the first time in more than a year. Month-onmonth deflation in May was 0.3 percent and was broad based, with the 12-month rates of
both core and headline inflation declining (headline inflation declined to 22.1 percent).
These developments were expected and suggest that the end-year inflation objective is
attainable. However, the NBKR will need to remain vigilant to ensure that reserve money
targets are met, especially in the face of a recent rebound in foreign exchange inflows.
4.
The president nominated the current NBKR deputy chairperson for the position
of NBKR chairperson. The parliamentary hearing on the nomination is currently scheduled
for June 16. Any further delays could exacerbate uncertainties surrounding NBKR
management, thereby hindering the NBKR’s ability to take resolute actions on the problem
banks.
5.
The authorities have continued to press for more concessional terms on planned
borrowing from China for large energy infrastructure projects. The latest information
from the Ministry of Finance indicates that the lender has agreed to extend the grace period
on these loans, which will raise the grant element to above the 35 percent threshold.
6.
Recently released official data confirm an increase in poverty in 2010. Following
the economic contraction in the aftermath of the 2010 events and an increase in inflation,
aggregate poverty increased from 31.7 percent to 33.7 percent and extreme poverty
increased from 3 percent to 5.3 percent in 2010 compared to 2009.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Kyrgyz Republic
On June 20, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Kyrgyz Republic.1
Background
The Kyrgyz Republic is recovering from a deep political crisis last year. In April 2010, a
popular uprising toppled the previous regime and internal ethnic conflict in June 2010
exacerbated the already difficult political situation. The subsequent constitutional
referendum and parliamentary elections in October 2010 have helped to stabilize the
political situation and put the economy on a path of recovery, though the political
situation remains fragile with presidential elections scheduled for later this year.
The fallout from the domestic crisis has posed significant challenges. Border closures,
especially with Kazakhstan, hampered Kyrgyz companies and households involved in
trade. The security situation led to the lowest tourist arrivals in almost a decade.
Interruptions in the spring farming season and problems in harvesting and marketing
have led to losses in agricultural production. Rising global food and fuel prices have
posed additional challenges. The banking sector also suffered from diminished
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up
can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
depositor confidence and the economic effects from events in the south. Subsequently,
the economy contracted by 1.4 percent and inflation rose to nearly 20 percent in 2010.
To counter rising inflation, monetary policy was tightened toward the end of 2010. Early
signs of recovery have started to appear this year, with the economy growing by
3.2 percent in the first four months of 2011.
On the back of political and macroeconomic stability, the Kyrgyz economy is expected to
grow by 6 percent in the medium term with positive spillovers from its larger partners in
the Region. Agriculture, tourism, mining and textile production will be important drivers
of growth. Strong export oriented growth and fiscal consolidation will help to reduce the
current account deficit in the medium term. Official development assistance, while
slowing, will remain an important source of financing the current account deficit and will
help to maintain an adequate reserves level.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the economy is recovering from a deep political crisis,
which disrupted activity and negatively affected near-term growth prospects. Directors
commended the authorities for their efforts to restore macroeconomic stability and
acknowledged the timely and coordinated assistance by the international community,
which helped prevent the economy from falling into a deeper recession. Directors noted
that the recovery remains fragile and a steadfast implementation of prudent policies and
structural reforms are crucial to improving growth prospects.
Directors acknowledged the importance of supporting the nascent recovery, but
underscored that fiscal consolidation is needed to rebuild policy buffers, reduce
vulnerabilities, and promote inclusive growth over the medium term. In this context,
Directors welcomed the revenue and expenditure measures prepared by the authorities,
and encouraged them to follow through with contingency plans, possibly based on
reductions in low-priority spending, if risks to the fiscal position materialized.
Directors noted the risks and governance issues associated with extra-budgetary funds
and underscored the importance of channeling all public finances through the budget.
They welcomed the authorities’ decision to liquidate the Special Bank Refinancing Fund
and their efforts to increase the transparency of public finances through improved
reporting and monitoring of large state-owned enterprises. They also encouraged the
authorities to strengthen the existing targeted social assistance system, with the support
of key development partners.
Directors expressed concerns on continued high inflation, and welcomed the central
bank’s timely tightening of monetary policy in response to growing inflationary
pressures. Most Directors agreed with the need for further policy tightening if inflation
fails to decline in the period ahead. Directors noted the staff assessment that the

3
exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals and highlighted that exchange rate
flexibility has served the Kyrgyz Republic well.
Directors noted that developments in the banking sector have exposed shortcomings in
the bank resolution framework and the central bank’s de facto lack of supervisory
independence. They encouraged the authorities to take decisive action to resolve
problem banks and restore confidence in the financial system, and welcomed the
selection of an external auditor for Zalkar Bank. Directors stressed the need to reform
the legal framework for early intervention and resolution of problem banks, and
highlighted the need for enhanced supervisory vigilance and increased capital buffers
for the largest state-owned bank.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ structural reform agenda, emphasizing that steadfast
implementation is critical to the success of the economic program. They welcomed plans
to improve the business environment, which is key to supporting private sector-led
growth, and stressed that energy sector reform would create an important driver for
growth in the medium term. Directors also welcomed the ongoing efforts to increase
transparency and efficiency of the largest energy companies, with assistance from key
development partners.

views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves US$106 Million Extended Credit Facility Arrangement
for the Kyrgyz Republic
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year
SDR 66.6 million (about US$106 million) arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility
for the Kyrgyz Republic to support the economic recovery in the short term and place the
country on the road to stronger sustained and inclusive growth in the medium term. The
Board’s approval enables the immediate disbursement of SDR 9.514 million (about US$15.2
million).
The Kyrgyz Republic suffered from a deep political crisis in 2010. The fallout from the
domestic crisis has posed significant challenges. The economy contracted last year, straining
the government’s financial position, further exacerbated by critical reconciliation, recovery
and reconstruction needs. The banking sector also suffered from diminished depositor
confidence and the economic effects from the events in the south. Moreover, the global food
and fuel price shock triggered a sharp rise in inflation, eroding real incomes of the most
vulnerable part of the population.
The new Fund-supported program will provide a coherent macroeconomic framework that
will support the authorities’ efforts to sustain economic recovery, promote inclusive growth
in a low inflation environment, restore macroeconomic stability, achieve medium-term fiscal
consolidation, address weaknesses in the financial sector, improve the country’s governance,
and catalyze critical donor support.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on the Kyrgyz Republic, Mr. Naoyuki
Shinohara, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Domestic political turmoil in the Kyrgyz Republic in 2010 disrupted economic activity and
negatively affected near-term growth prospects. Real GDP contracted, the current account
shifted to a deficit, international reserves coverage declined, and credit growth stalled.
Moreover, rising international food and fuel prices have increased inflation and eroded real

2

incomes. Faced with these challenges, the authorities have developed a strong program,
which aims at restoring macroeconomic stability, rebuilding policy buffers, catalyzing donor
assistance, and promoting private sector-led inclusive growth.
“A limited fiscal expansion in 2011 will support the nascent economic recovery, but policies
will need to be carefully balanced to curb inflationary pressures. Significant fiscal
consolidation in 2012 and beyond will be critical to ensure medium-term fiscal and debt
sustainability and support efforts to reduce inflation. The central bank has already tightened
monetary policy and stands ready to tighten further if necessary.
“Last year’s political turmoil exposed weaknesses in the financial sector. Strengthening the
supervisory independence of the central bank will play a pivotal role in restoring confidence
in the financial sector, mitigating vulnerabilities, and ultimately enabling banks to perform
their key function of intermediating scarce resources.
“While the authorities have made progress in reforming the regulatory framework related to
the business environment, addressing longstanding governance issues will be key to
enhancing the role of the private sector and fully realizing the economy’s long-term growth
potential.”
ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
While there are early signs of recovery from the economic contraction in 2010, the
situation remains fragile with inflation at more than 20 percent. The political crisis has
disrupted trade flows, agricultural production, construction, and tourism, which led to a shift
in the current account from surplus to deficit. Fiscal policy has been expansionary, albeit less
than anticipated and monetary policy was tightened toward the end of the year to counter
rising inflation. The latter is already yielding tangible results with May 2011 having been the
first deflationary month in over a year.
Program Summary
Sustain economic recovery and foster inclusive growth to help reduce poverty.
The program foresees a slight fiscal expansion in 2011 to further support the nascent
economic rebound. The authorities expect real GDP to grow by about 6 percent on average
during 2011–14 on the back of continued political stability and a rebound in agriculture,
trade and construction. To ensure that the growth dividends also benefit the poor, the
government plans to further develop key targeted social assistance programs with the support
of development partners. The authorities also plan to raise the size of the Guaranteed

3

Minimum Income by almost 20 percent and increase spending on Unified Monthly Benefits
and Monthly Social Benefit to catch up with the rising cost of living.
Bring the fiscal position back on a sustainable path in the medium term. To achieve this
goal, the authorities will introduce additional revenue measures and restrain expenditures.
Given that a large part of the domestic economy remains outside the tax system, the Kyrgyz
government efforts will focus specifically on broadening the tax base, which should help
improve the efficiency of the Kyrgyz tax system. The main elements of the reform will be to
improve the customs valuation system, removing tax exemptions and reforming excise
taxation on tobacco and alcohol. Such measures will encourage the formalization of the
economy, limit tax evasion, spread the tax burden more evenly and simplify the tax system.
Improve the resilience of the country’s financial sector. Political developments in 2010
tested the Kyrgyz financial system and severely disrupted the regular course of supervisory
activities. The authorities are taking actions to isolate and resolve the problems in the
banking system to ensure that the banking system is sufficiently resilient to withstand
possible further shocks. Such actions include resolution of troubled banks, asset recovery
measures from fraudulent transactions and strengthening supervision, particularly of
systemically important banks.
The authorities are committed to improving governance in the country. Addressing this
issue remains one of the biggest challenges for the Kyrgyz government. Ensuring the
efficient use of public resources and improving the business climate will be instrumental to
attract high-quality domestic and foreign investments in the country.

Statement by Mr. Weber, Executive Director, and Mr. Duperrut, Advisor to Executive
Director
June 20, 2011
On behalf of our Kyrgyz authorities, we thank management and staff for the candid set of
reports and for the constructive discussions on a medium-term program engagement. This
intensive dialogue, building on the recent Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) and the Ex Post
Assessment (EPA) of Longer-Term Program Engagement, has resulted in clear and welcome
policy guidance. The authorities concur with the staff’s appraisal, including on the necessity
for fiscal consolidation beyond 2011, the importance of financial sector stability, the thrust of
the required structural reforms, and the extent of the balance of payments need. In support of
their strategy, our Kyrgyz authorities ask the Executive Board to favorably consider their
request for an Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in the amount of SDR 66.6 million (75 percent
of quota). All three prior actions for this program request have been met.
The authorities are grateful to the Fund for rapidly providing financial support to the Kyrgyz
Republic under difficult circumstances last summer, which was instrumental for restoring
macroeconomic stability and building a sound track record. They are equally thankful to the
international donor community for the solidarity shown at the Development Forum held in
Bishkek in July 2010. The authorities are pleased that US$380 million of the US$1.1 billion
pledged at the Forum have so far been contracted. However, given their substantial financing
needs and the fact that donor support represents the major source to cover the projected
financing gap, they hope that the pledges made will be fully and expeditiously validated. The
ECF provides a strong policy framework and sufficient assurances to donors, also with
regard to shortcomings in the areas of implementation capacity and ownership. The new
program will serve to anchor sound macroeconomic policies over the medium-term as the
political transition to a Parliamentary democracy is being completed.
Macro-economic situation
In the past year, the Kyrgyz Republic faced a number of shocks, political and economic,
external and internal. These shocks occurred in the context of a world economy slowly
emerging from the global crisis, which significantly affected its major trading partners.
Nonetheless, the economy is recovering more quickly than expected and the decline in
growth was measured. The major impact of the shocks was felt on prices, with overall
inflation rising above 20 percent. Decisive monetary policy actions since December 2010
should reduce the inflation rate towards the authorities’ end-year objective, thus re-anchoring
inflationary expectations. While fiscal policy is still expansionary, the deficit outcome for
2010 and 2011 is notably more benign compared to earlier projections. Increased public
spending is geared towards much needed salary adjustments in the education and health care
sectors as well as targeted social assistance programs, in an effort to promote more inclusive
growth. The authorities have prepared contingency measures to deal with potential revenue
shortfalls, including the possibility to privatize state-owned enterprises, and have signaled

2
their intention to save the bulk of revenue over-performance.
In the financial sector, the largest bank was involved in fraudulent activities related to the
previous regime and a significant number of commercial banks had to be put under
temporary administration. Although these events exposed problems of bank supervision,
there was no deposit run thanks to the authorities’ credible assurances that financial stability
was not at risk. The resolution of the troubled banks has started, most notably with the
separation of the largest bank into a good bank and a bad bank.
The authorities are well aware that the country, currently at moderate risk of debt distress,
remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks which could impact debt sustainability. They
reached an agreement with Turkey to cancel bilateral debts and are in contact with Russia
and other creditors to reach similar agreements. They intend to contract only concessional
loans and, in that regard, have been able to agree with their Chinese creditor that the terms of
the energy sector loan be extended on concessional terms.
Request for an ECF Arrangement
The Kyrgyz authorities acknowledge a weak track record in terms of implementing structural
reforms and economic governance, as pointed out in the recent EPA. The EPA also
highlighted key policy priorities, particularly medium-term fiscal consolidation, and noted
that conditionality in a future Fund program should be streamlined, focused on core elements
of the Fund’s mandate, based on a homegrown development strategy, and not be overly
intrusive. The authorities believe that the new ECF appropriately follows this guidance. The
program will support the authorities Action Plan for Economic Security for 2011 and form a
major pillar of their upcoming Country Development Strategy (PRSP).
-

Fiscal consolidation will start in 2012 with the implementation of ambitious measures on
both the revenue and expenditure sides. Tax policy and tax administration, particularly
towards large taxpayers, will be strengthened further by expanding the role of the Large
Taxpayer’s Office. The social fund will be consolidated into the budget and no new extra
budgetary funds will be created. Fund technical assistance financed by the new Topical
Trust Fund on Tax Policy Administration will be most welcome.

-

Responding to concerns about past rent seeking behavior, the President of the Kyrgyz
Republic introduced in each governmental body a supervisory board that will oversee the
practice of resource allocation, procurement, recruiting, and promotions. The Kyrgyz
Republic has become compliant under the extractive industries transparency initiative
(EITI) in March 2011.

-

Regarding the necessary reforms in the energy sector, the authorities take good note of
the division of labor with other international institutions, based on comparative
advantage. The World Bank, through its Economic Recovery Support Operation, and

3
other development partners will predominantly contribute in this area.
-

The authorities commit to refrain from using the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic
(NBKR) as a financing source for public uses by closing down the Special Bank
Refinancing Fund (SBRF). They aim to ensure the independence of the NBKR, including
in its role as financial sector supervisor.

The Kyrgyz authorities appreciate the importance of strengthening democracy, improving
governance as well as the rule of law, strengthening oversight over public resources based on
the lessons from the past, and managing public assets in a transparent way. Progress in these
areas will greatly help promote political stability and social peace. Our Kyrgyz authorities are
committed to further close cooperation with the Fund that will help achieve these objectives
in the context of a Fund arrangement.
