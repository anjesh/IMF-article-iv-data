2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION AND FOURTH REVIEW
UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY ARRANGEMENT

KEY ISSUES
Context. Real GDP growth is projected at about 3½ percent in 2012, and to increase
moderately in 2013. Benin is strongly interconnected with Nigeria, including through the
supply of most of its fuel. The reduction of Nigerian fuel subsidies in early 2012 caused
inflation to rise sharply, but only temporarily.
Program implementation. All quantitative performance criteria and targets were met,
but earlier reforms to the cotton sector and a key component of the customs reform
program were suspended. Revenue targets and performance criteria on the basic primary
balance and net domestic financing were met, as were all indicative targets, including on
social expenditure, in March and June 2012. Some structural measures were
implemented, but most others were postponed because of difficulties with donor
financing and the suspension of the import-verification program. The authorities have
committed to re-launching the reforms, progress on which would be monitored in the
next review.
Article IV consultation. Discussions focused on the stabilization achieved over the first
two years of the program, in spite of severe shocks, and also on the challenges ahead to
achieving sustainable, higher growth.
Challenges. Going forward, the key policy priority is to increase growth and to make it
more inclusive. While macroeconomic performance has strengthened in recent years,
growth has been modest and insufficient to reduce poverty. Larger public investment,
and measures to promote greater private sector participation in the economy, including
by improving the business environment, should underpin the country’s strategy. They
should be buttressed with measures to improve financial intermediation. This will require,
among other things, strengthening the financial soundness of the banking and
microfinance sectors.
Risks. Risks to the economy include a persistence of difficulties at the Port of Cotonou,
and continued suspension of the import-verification program—they would curtail growth
and reduce fiscal revenue. Developments in Nigeria, including a further reduction of fuel
subsidies, changes in trade restrictions, and other policy decisions could weaken
economic activity in Benin. Risks to program performance include wage slippages and
continued delays in the implementation of structural reforms.

ROBUST MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, BUT A
NEED FOR STRONGER GROWTH
A. Background
1.
Since the beginning of the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement, Benin has
made significant progress in consolidating
macroeconomic stability. Real growth has
rebounded after the 2010 floods, and is
projected at about 3½ percent in 2012, the
same level as the year before (Figure 1).
Prudent fiscal policy has kept fiscal deficits at
manageable levels and has yielded basic
primary surpluses during most of the period.
This policy, combined with the benefits of the
Highly Indebted Poor Countries and the
Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiative, has kept
public debt low, at about 32 percent of GDP.
Appropriate monetary policy by the Central
Bank of West African States (BCEAO) has
helped keep inflation low at about 2½ percent
in 2010-11. The external current account deficit
has remained broadly stable, and the balance
of payments deficit was about 5 percent in
2011.

performance. Low public investment and the
high cost of doing business, in a context of a
high public wage bill share in government
spending, have hampered progress in
addressing Benin’s large infrastructure gap.

2.
Economic growth, however, has
been insufficient to make a significant dent
in poverty. Per capita income has remained
stagnant for several years, over half of the
population lives on less than one dollar a day,
and Benin’s ranking in the Human
Development Index is low.1 When compared to
its peers in the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAEMU) and in sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA), Benin lags in per capita growth

4.
Benin’s banking system is
concentrated and shallow. There are
12 banks, with the four largest of them
accounting for about 70 percent of deposits.
Pan-African banking groups—who have been
spared thus far from the effects of the
sovereign debt crisis in the euro area—are the
main players, along with one large French
bank. There are also a large number of
microfinance institutions, which account for
about 9½ percent of total financial sector
loans and supply financial services to
households and microenterprises. The
prevalence of information asymmetries,
insufficient creditor rights, and a weak judiciary
system hamper financial intermediation.

1

Poverty declined from 37.2 percent in 2006 to
35.2 percent in 2009, but it is estimated to have risen
to 36.2 percent in 2011 (2011-15 PRSP). Benin is
ranked 167 out of 187 countries in the 2011 Human
Development Index.

3.
The economy remains vulnerable to
shocks. Benin is a net importer of food and
fuel, and as such, is exposed to shocks from
the global and regional environment. This was
demonstrated by the adverse impacts of the
2008 world food price crisis and the early 2012
fuel price hike emanating from Nigeria. Benin
is also prone to recurrent flooding, of which
the 2010 occurrence was particularly
devastating. Furthermore, the country has a
narrow export base—cotton represents
17 percent of total exports—which makes
export performance sensitive to price
fluctuations of a single commodity and global
demand shocks.

5.
The microfinance sector is
insufficiently supervised, and a number of
microfinance institutions are troubled.
While microfinance institutions are now
subject to tighter regulation, following the
Ponzi schemes that unraveled in 2009–10, only
30 percent of them are currently operating
with a license. A number of microfinance
institutions are insolvent or undermined by
serious governance problems.
6.
The Beninese economy is deeply
interconnected with that of Nigeria (Box 1).
This gives rise to vulnerabilities but also
provides opportunities. Developments in
Nigeria, including trade policy decisions
(e.g., the list of prohibited imports, customs
tariffs, fuel subsidies, and enforcement of
border controls) have important fiscal and
economic implications for Benin. It is
estimated that almost 50 percent of imports
moving through the port of Cotonou are
destined for Nigeria. At the same time, Benin’s
proximity with Nigeria provides the country
with opportunities to foster new sources of
exports and growth.
7.
Much of Benin’s formal economy is
oriented towards commerce and related
services. The latter are associated with transit
trade to Nigeria and other neighboring
countries. Benin’s services sector is large when
compared to those of other countries in the
region and in SSA, and it absorbs a large share
of commercial banks’ loan portfolios.

8.
Progress on the recommendations
of the 2010 Article IV consultation focused
on implementing the structural reform
agenda and prudent macroeconomic
policies. A considerable fiscal adjustment
was needed to preserve fiscal sustainability
(the overall fiscal deficit had more than
doubled since 2008). Recommendations also
emphasized the need to contain the wage bill,
in order to safeguard fiscal space for priority
spending, and to improve competitiveness.
Since the 2010 consultation, fiscal
sustainability has been largely restored, but
the wage bill remains high, crowding out
priority spending. The reform agenda has
progressed, albeit much slower than expected.
There have been no changes to Benin’s
measures related to payments and transfers
for current international transactions since the
last Article IV consultation, including to those
imposed solely for security reasons.

Box 1. Benin-Nigeria Interrelations
Nigeria’s GDP is about 33 times larger than that of
Benin. The interrelations between the two economies
are asymmetrical and are critically important for
Benin. Trade and financial relations between the two
countries proceed through the following channels:




Fuel prices and subsidies. About 85 percent of
the gasoline sold in Benin is smuggled from
Nigeria, dwarfing the provision of gasoline in
the formal market and drastically reducing the
number of operating gas stations. Nigeria’s
decision to cut fuel subsidies by half in early
2012 was immediately and fully passed through
to the informal gasoline market in Benin,
increasing average annual inflation from
1.8 percent in the last quarter of 2011 to
6.5 percent in the first quarter of 2012, and
dampening domestic demand as households
adjusted to higher fuel prices. The implicit
subsidy provided by Nigeria to consumers in
Benin through cheap fuel is unknown but
deemed significant.
Trade. Estimates suggest that about half of
imports going through the Port of Cotonou are
destined for Nigeria. The top imports that move
through the port include frozen poultry, used
cars, and textiles.

Nigeria’s main exports to Benin are construction
materials, cosmetic products, alcoholic and soft
beverages, and cocoa derivatives.


Fiscal revenue. Tax revenue on goods going to
Nigeria was estimated at about 14 percent of
total tax revenue (2.4 percent of GDP) in 2007,
which highlights Benin’s fiscal dependency on
policy decisions in Nigeria.1



Financial sector. Three large Nigerian banks
operate in Benin. They hold about 20 percent of
total deposits and provide a similar share of
total credit. Banks in Benin derive significant
fees from CFA franc/naira exchange operations,
which fuel a largely cash-based informal trade.



Migration and remittances. Nigeria is an
important destination for emigrants from Benin,
and an important source of remittances,
although data are not available.

Economic activity is showing signs
of improvement, but has been saddled with
recurrent problems. Real growth in 2011
reached 3½ percent, despite elections early in
the year and disruptions at the Port of
Cotonou, because of resistance to customs
reforms (Figure 2 and Letter of Intent—LOI—
Appendix I,¶7). Further increase in growth in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2012 has been stymied by higher fuel prices,
and by renewed disruptions at the Port of
Cotonou (Box 2). Staff projects real growth in
2012 at 3½ percent, but the authorities are
more sanguine on account of their more
optimistic outlook for the 2012/13 cotton
harvest (Box 3 and Appendix II).

BENIN

Box 2. Suspension of the Import-Verification Program
In April 2012, the government suspended the
import-verification program (IVP). The IVP was a
component of a comprehensive customs reform
program implemented in 2011, despite significant
initial opposition, including from customs officers
and private operators.
The authorities indicated that the IVP had been
suspended because the Beninese company, which
had won the contract on the basis of its partnership
with a reputable international partner well versed in
pre-shipment import valuation, was unable to
maintain the technical partnership and thus was not
able to fulfill the technical aspects of the program.
The authorities further noted that the company
charged excessive fees for scanning and tracking

10.
Some prices surged in early 2012,
but inflationary pressures have abated since
then (LOI ¶8). The elimination of fuel subsidies
in Nigeria in January 2012 raised informal
gasoline prices in Benin initially by more than
120 percent, but a few weeks later, after the
subsidies elimination was partially reversed,
the domestic price hike settled around
50 percent. It translated into a 6 percent
increase in inflation (January-July, year-onyear) from less than 2 percent at end-2011,
thus breaching the 3 percent regional
convergence criterion. The increase in the price
of informal fuel spread mostly to
transportation and food prices. Excluding
these items, there is, however, little evidence
of persistent inflationary momentum in the

services, making the Port of Cotonou uncompetitive.
Importers complained about significant delays in
container processing that, together with high
storage fees, led to some containers being
abandoned in the port. These difficulties led to a
diversion of ships to other ports in the region,
reducing activity at the Port of Cotonou. There were
also governance issues, including difficulties in
getting data and information from the company.
Since the suspension, customs have reverted to the
practices used before the introduction of the IVP. In
particular, pre-shipment inspection, scanning
operations, and electronic monitoring of transit
goods were suspended.

rest of the consumer price index of this shock.
Core inflation, which excludes fuel and
transportation, was little affected owing to
minimal second-round effects. The recent
spike in international food prices has so far not
had a notable impact in Benin given the
country’s ability to supply basic staples with
domestic production.
11.
Banks have continued to increase
their domestic assets, but financial
intermediation has remained limited. They
increased lending to the private sector, despite
problems at the port, but also invested in
sovereign bonds. Credit growth was about
11 percent (year-on-year) in June 2012. Banks
also increased their purchases of WAEMU
government bonds on the regional market.

Box 3. Suspension of the Framework Governing the Cotton Sector
Over the past decade, Benin has taken steps to
liberalize the cotton sector. Recent efforts, however,
resulted in excessive concentration of a large portion
of the sector, and declining cotton harvests.
These failings of the liberalization effort led the
government to suspend the cotton sector framework
temporarily in April 2012, while it develops a new
framework that preserves competition and better
serves farmers. The suspended agreement had
entered in force in 2009 as the culmination of a
decade-long reform effort to privatize cotton
production and trade. During that period, the state
progressively withdrew from organizing, buying,
ginning, and trading cotton. By 2009, the role of the
state was essentially reduced to providing subsidies
for inputs (fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides). The
private sector’s control of the sector was centered on
the Professional Association of Cotton (Association
interprofessionnelle du coton, AIC), which grouped
the country’s 18 gins, constituting the sector’s
backbone. Members of the AIC used to borrow
sizable ―campaign loans‖ (crédit de campagne) from
commercial banks to finance the production cycle.
They provided farmers with inputs on credit at the
beginning of the sowing season, bought the entire
harvest at the nationwide official price, and, after
processing it, sold it almost exclusively abroad.1
Cotton is mostly produced on small family plots, and
is grown by farmers with little to no access to the
financial system.
Cotton production steadily declined until the
2011/12 campaign, from an all-time high of
427,000 metric tons in 2004/05. The AIC invoked
several factors to explain the decline, including
inclement weather conditions (droughts and
recurrent flooding), low international prices, and late
payments to producers, all of which resulted in a
growing disaffection of farmers for cotton.

They have strong incentives to invest in
sovereign bonds, which are easily refinanced at
the BCEAO with a margin, and are statutorily
classified as having ―zero risk,‖ so they do not
require capital provision. The BCEAO lowered

The government acknowledged these adverse
factors, but considered them compounded by
governance problems. It noted that the volume of
production had declined in spite of increasing
subsidies. It also noted that the privatization of the
sector, rather than fostering competition, resulted in
the vertical concentration of the sector in the hands
of one group, leading to actual ―private monopoly.‖
In light of the above developments, the authorities
suspended the AIC and the framework agreement,
and took over the organization of the 2012/13
campaign from end-to-end. The area cultivated has
increased by some 60 percent compared to the
previous campaign. Accordingly, and with favorable
rainfall, at end-September the authorities assessed
prospects for the forthcoming harvest favorably, in
spite of some reported initial difficulties in the timely
distribution of fertilizers and pesticides. They expect
the new harvest will exceed the last one.
Authorities are considering implementing a zoning
system modeled on Burkina Faso’s cotton sector and
have solicited advice from development partners,
including the World Bank. A well-designed
framework needs to be carefully considered, thus
authorities anticipate having it ready in time for the
2014/15 campaign. Appendix II discusses
developments in the sector in more detail.

June 2012, which freed up funds that the
larger banks used to increase their holdings of
regional sovereign bonds. However, because

banks are overly liquid and have incentives to
buy sovereign bonds, these measures had little
effect on credit volume and cost.
Supplement 1 on the financial sector in Benin
analyses these developments in detail.
12.
Overall, the banking system appears
sound, but the regulatory prudential norms
do not take full account of risks and two
banks are troubled (LOI ¶17). Taken together,
commercial banks’ capital-adequacy ratio was
about 10½ percent (at end-2011), above the
8 percent regulatory threshold. When assessed
individually, three smaller banks have failed to
comply with regional capital requirements.
Two banks have negative capital, and are
under close surveillance by the monetary
authorities. The third bank, which had been
insolvent for several years, was closed in March
2012 and is being liquidated. In addition,
banks’ overall loan portfolios deteriorated,
with nonperforming loans (NPLs) amounting
to 18.6 percent of total loans in July 2012. The
concentration on a few large borrowers in loan
portfolios is another source for concern.
13.
In 2012, the external current
account deficit is projected to narrow
somewhat, reflecting, among others, higher
official transfers. Despite lower international
cotton prices, higher volume of cotton exports
and a recovery of non-traditional exports
should slightly improve export performance.
This, together with moderate import growth
and higher official transfers, is expected to
reduce the current account deficit from
10 percent of GDP in 2011 to about
9½ percent of GDP in 2012. Higher foreign
direct investments, project loans, and the
expected repatriation of banks’ net foreign
assets are projected to increase the financial
account balance from 1.9 percent of GDP in
2011 to 5.6 percent of GDP in 2012. The overall

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

balance of payments deficit is thus projected
to contract from almost 5 percent of GDP in
2011 to about 1¾ percent in 2012.
14.
The external stability assessment
indicates a deterioration of external
position and competitiveness, and a
moderate real exchange rate misalignment.
Empirical assessment of the external stability
suggests that the current account deficit, in
percentage of GDP, exceeds its medium-term
equilibrium norm by about 4 to 6 percentage
points. The real effective exchange rate (REER)
is estimated to be overvalued by 15 percent on
average. At the regional level, the REER
remains, however, broadly in line with
medium-term fundamentals.2 Survey-based
structural indicators confirm these findings and
reveal impediments to external
competitiveness. Appendix III provides the
details of the analyses.
15.
Benin’s risk of debt distress remains
low. External debt, mostly consisting of official
concessional loans from multilateral creditors,
has stabilized at about 17½ percent of GDP in
2012. Domestic debt has increased somewhat
(from about 14 to 15½ percent of GDP)
because of government debt issuance on the
regional bond market. Benin’s debt burden
compares favorably with that of comparable
low-income countries.

C. Strong Quantitative, Mixed Structural Program Implementation
16.
All performance criteria and
quantitative targets were met at endMarch and end-June, 2012, sometimes
with comfortable margins (Text Table 1 and
LOI Table 1).




During the first quarter, revenue continued
to recover from the shortfall resulting from
the opposition to customs reforms in 2011
(Figure 3). The sale of a 3G mobile phone
license raised additional and unprogrammed revenue (CFAF 44 billion,
6.2 percent of projected total revenue in
2012), providing a buffer for the rest of the
year. Spending was kept broadly under
control, and thus the performance criteria
on the primary fiscal balance and net
domestic financing were met at end-March
(test date). The same trends continued
during the second semester and the
corresponding targets were also meet at
end-June (not a test date).3
The indicative targets on priority social
spending at end-March and end-June were
met for the first time, thanks to the
implementation of a better monitoring
system.

On the downside, spending on investment
was lower than programmed, both for
domestically and for externally financed
projects. The lagging behind in the
implementation of the investment
program has been a recurrent issue in the
last few years.

Implementation of structural

measures programmed for the fourth review,
while the other measures were delayed. Some
of the measures were delayed in part because
of delays in technical and financial assistance

from donors. Other measures—including
those to avoid tampering with customs
declarations and to connect the IVP data to
the one-stop window in the port—were in the
process of being implemented, when the
suspension of the IVP brought them to a halt.
The liquidation of a failed bank (programmed
for September 2012, LOI¶ 16), however, was

carried out earlier than projected, with a
liquidator appointed in March 2012. Two
structural benchmarks relating to the
Integrated Human Resource Management
System (SIGRH) have been released since the

D. Favorable Medium-Term Outlook, but with Vulnerabilities
18.
Over the medium term, the average
annual real growth rate is projected to
increase to 4½ percent (Text Table 2).
A projected improvement in the global
economy starting in 2014, an expanding
agricultural production, and medium- and
long-term capital inflows for investment,
along with higher revenue following a
resolution of the current problems at the port,
would strengthen growth and the fiscal
balance. Inflation would return to lower trend
levels, as the fuel shock phases out. It is
expected to return to the 3 percent regional
convergence criterion over the medium term.
However, sustaining growth will require full

and timely implementation of the structural
reform agenda, including measures needed to
strengthen customs administration and the
resumption of the IVP.4
19.
The improved growth outlook is
subject to risks from domestic, regional,
and global developments (Risk Assessment
Matrix, Appendix IV). On the domestic front,
failure to resolve recent disputes in the

Medium-term projections include assumptions on a
return to a private-sector led cotton sector by the
2014/15 campaign and a resumption of the IVP in the
near term.

management of customs and the cotton
sector orderly would have a negative impact
on growth and the fiscal accounts. Wage
slippages and further delays in the structural
reform agenda could also weaken program
performance. On the regional front,
developments in Nigeria, including easing of
trade restrictions, more effective border
controls, or a further reduction of fuel
subsidies could significantly reduce revenue
and weaken the fiscal outlook. On the
international scene, a delayed recovery of the
global economy would reduce exports, and

could result in reduced public and private
capital inflows.
20.
The Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA) update indicates a low risk of debt
distress (Supplement II). The baseline and
alternative stress test scenarios indicate that
total debt positions present low
vulnerabilities to shocks. It is noteworthy that
the debt indicators have deteriorated
moderately, compared to the 2011 DSA,
because of weaker export projections and
medium-term growth prospects, stemming
from the continuing global crisis.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
In the context of strengthened macroeconomic performance, discussions focused on
emerging challenges: (i) the short-term macroeconomic risks stemming from the
suspension of IVP and the government’s decision to intervene in the cotton sector; (ii) the
soundness of the financial system and reforms to reduce its vulnerability; and (iii) the
need to take advantage of achievements in macroeconomic stability to implement a
reform strategy to achieve stronger growth.

A. Fiscal Policy: Good Performance Thus Far, but Risks Going Forward
Revenue
21.
There was agreement on the
importance of fully resuming customs
reforms and restoring full activity at the
Port of Cotonou. In 2011, the government
implemented broad-based customs reforms
to strengthen revenue collection, reduce
corruption, streamline trade practices, and
boost port activities. However, a partial
reversal of the reforms—key imports were
exempted from the new measures5—was
followed in April 2012 by the suspension of
the IVP (Box 2 and LOI ¶21). Notwithstanding
these adverse developments, revenue
performance remained in line with targets up
to end-August.


Staff welcomed the good revenue
performance during the first semester of
2012 in spite of the difficulties noted.



Staff expressed concern, however, about
the potential backsliding of the reform
effort with the suspension of the IVP and
implications for revenue performance
going forward. It urged the authorities to
re-institute the IVP and to implement the
associated reform package fully because
re-instituting these is essential for
increasing the port’s efficiency in a highly
competitive environment and bringing its
operations closer to international best
practices.



Staff also urged the authorities to
implement the recommendations of the
December 2011 International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD)

5

IMF Country Report No. 12/99.

and AFRITAC West technical assistance
missions, and recommended maintaining
the prohibition of direct import releases
that circumvent regular customs
procedures.
Authorities’ views


The authorities reiterated their
commitment to a full implementation of
customs reforms. They shared staff
concerns about the stalling of customs
reforms and the slowdown of port traffic,
but they were confident that this would be
resolved by the reduction of fees,
measures to shorten the clearance time at
the port, and the launch of a public
information campaign to bring back
importers and shippers in the region. They
noted that the one-stop window
introduced with the reforms continued to
operate effectively. Going forward, they are
committed to reinstate the IVP through a
joint public-private partnership to manage
the scanning operations. Accordingly, in
mid-September, they announced that they
had cancelled the IVP contract and that
they were launching a bidding process to
negotiate a new contract; this will be
conducted by end-March 2013, allowing
the IVP to be relaunched and the two
related structural benchmarks to be
implemented by end-June 2013 (LOI, ¶16,
bullet 7). They also called for a regional
discussion on customs reforms to avoid
unhealthy competition between ports in
the region.



The authorities also indicated that they
were committed to implementing the
recommendations of the December 2011
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

BENIN

technical assistance mission, including the
freezing of tax exemptions, broadening the
value-added tax base in line with WAEMU
directives, and establishing a unit within
the Ministry of Economy and Finance to
monitor tax exemptions and expenditures.
They noted that revenue administration
would be strengthened by streamlining
and updating the taxpayers’ database for
medium-size enterprises, with the
assistance of AFRITAC West. They viewed
these efforts as critical for widening the
domestic tax base and reducing overreliance on customs receipts, which are
vulnerable to changes in Nigeria’s trade
regime.


program could jeopardize the authorities’
growth strategy.


Going forward, staff emphasized the
importance of keeping the wage bill within
the program envelope, despite pressures
that may arise in the months ahead,
because of its already high share of current
expenditure.



Staff inquired about the fiscal cost of the
government’s involvement in the cotton
sector, including the supply of inputs, the
recruitment of some 850 new agricultural
advisors, and the guaranteeing of a sizable
syndicated loan to finance the campaign
(possibly giving rise to contingent fiscal
liabilities). Staff cautioned about cotton
spending crowding out other spending,
including priority social spending and
capital investment. It urged the authorities
to put in place a regulatory framework for
the cotton sector that addresses the
governance issues raised by the authorities
and ensures that no single player
concentrates significant market power,
while minimizing fiscal costs.

In order to complete structural
benchmarks that were delayed because of
difficulties with donor financing, the
authorities will fund them directly from the
2013 budget; this will allow the
benchmarks to be implemented by endMarch 2013 (LOI¶16, bullet 1).

Expenditure
22.
Current expenditure was broadly on
track, but investment expenditure
continued to trail its targets. The authorities
managed spending as agreed under the
program, including on the wage bill and
priority social expenditure. Spending on the
investment program, however, was slower
than planned, with about one-fourth of the
projects behind schedule.

Authorities’ views


The authorities indicated the careful
monitoring of priority social spending
would be maintained going forward, and
that they were implementing measures to
improve the execution of investment
projects. They reiterated their commitment
to keeping the wage bill within the
program envelope.



They indicated that it was too early to
assess the possible fiscal cost of increased
government involvement in the cotton
sector during the current campaign, but
that a large portion of it would be

provided by banks, under the leadership of
the West-African Development Bank. This
set up would not entail a direct fiscal cost,
only a contingent cost, should their
guarantee be called upon. They said they
expected not spending more on subsidies
than in previous years. Based on
information at end-September, they hoped
that, if the harvest was good, as they
expected, and if the international cotton
price remained unchanged, they could
recoup the cost of financing the campaign.
They confirmed they were planning to set
up a new regulatory framework that would
liberalize the sector, while maintaining key
functions for the government (LOI ¶ 20).
Looking ahead, they affirmed their
intention to withdraw from managing the
sector, keeping mostly to a supervisory
role. For this, a new framework agreement

needs to be negotiated with the private
sector. The new agreement would involve
adopting the management model of some
countries in the region, whereby Benin
would be divided into zones to foster
competition. With the help of the World
Bank, the authorities plan to have the new
agreement in place by the beginning of
the 2014/15 campaign.
2013 Budget


The authorities are committed to
submitting a draft 2013 budget to
parliament, consistent with the further
consolidation of macroeconomic stability
and with the fiscal framework of the
program.

B. Raising Medium-Term Growth and Reducing Poverty
23.
With the consolidation of
macroeconomic stability on track, Benin is
well placed to press ahead with reforms to
boost growth and reduce poverty. The
critical areas of intervention include
completing reforms in customs and the
cotton sector, simplifying the regulatory
environment to reduce the cost of doing
business, launching a program of secondgeneration reforms, and formulating a
medium-term public sector investment
strategy to address the country’s large
infrastructure gap.
24.
Normalizing operations at the Port
of Cotonou and in the cotton sector. The
Port and the cotton sector are key drivers of
economic activity, so moving forward with
reforms that allow them to operate at full
potential is critical for enhancing growth.
Regarding the port, reestablishment of the

IVP and proceeding with related customs
reforms—e.g., computerization and
streamlining of customs operations—should
help reduce transaction costs.
25.
Reducing obstacles to doing
business and facilitating the participation
of the private sector in the economy will
be crucial to improve the country's
competitiveness. As indicated in the external
stability analysis (Appendix III, ¶14),
improvements in competitiveness are needed
to align the current account balance with its
medium-term fundamentals. Benin’s weak
performance regarding the ―doing business‖
indicators, even within the region, seriously
impairs efficiency of private sector activity.6
6

The key obstacles to doing business were enforcing
contracts, paying taxes, and protecting investors.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

BENIN

Needed reforms in this area include
streamlining procedures for establishing new
businesses and strengthening the capacity of
judiciary system. Further enhancing the
dialogue between the private sector and
government, including during the annual
reviews of the poverty reduction strategy,
would promote synergies between the public
and private sectors. There is also a need to
improve the environment in which the private
sector operates, as recommended by the
2011 Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN),7 to
broaden opportunities for investment in
infrastructure, thus contributing to economic
growth beyond participation in a few large
public projects.
26.
Strengthening public investment to
improve infrastructure and allow access to
public services to a broader share of the
population. The public investment program
(PIP) has repeatedly under-performed, with
the country’s large infrastructure gap—
especially regarding the rail system and
roads—remaining largely unaddressed. This
has contributed to Benin’s high cost of doing
business and limited access to public services
by a large section the population, especially
in rural areas. The capacity to implement
projects as programmed needs to be
strengthened, and at the same time, fiscal
space should be created for capital
investment.

same time, however, the share of the
population living below the poverty remains
high.


Staff welcomed the authorities’ intention
to develop a public-private sector
partnership framework, with World Bank
assistance, to help advance investments in
transportation infrastructure and energy.



Staff noted the urgent need to improve
the planning and prioritization of the PIP;
the establishment of a medium-term
public sector investment program (PSIP),
with assistance from development
partners, that carefully prioritizes key
infrastructure projects would be welcome.
This PSIP would include carefully vetted
large infrastructure projects to be financed
with the support of donors, regional banks,
and multilateral lenders on a concessional
basis whenever possible. In particular, the
PSIP could address the poor state of roads,
which is a major obstacle to
competitiveness, especially given the
importance of trade with neighboring
countries. It also limits the access to public
services and markets for a large share of
the population living outside of the main
cities.



Staff stressed that higher capital
investment will require creating fiscal
space, including by mobilizing additional
donor financing, raising more revenue and
reducing the share of wages in public
sector spending; it would also require a
significant improvement in the
government’s capacity to implement
investment projects.



Staff welcomed the improvements in
health and education indicators, but noted
that significant poverty reduction will

particular, strengthening poverty analysis

2011 JSAN, would be critical for this effort.

participation, in line with JSAN
recommendations.


The authorities agreed on the importance
of upgrading infrastructure and
highlighted advanced plans for deepening
the access to the harbor, to be able to
receive larger ships, and rehabilitating and
expanding the rail system. They noted that
they had an action plan linked to the
priorities outlined in their povertyreduction strategy paper. They also
acknowledged weaknesses in project
implementation and indicated their
commitment to work closely with
development partners to address the
weaknesses.



The authorities noted ongoing efforts to
diversify the economy, including the
establishments of food processing
factories, which will provide opportunities
to expand the export base and take
advantage of the large Nigerian market.



The authorities agreed with staff on the
need to reinforce implementation of their
poverty-reduction strategy.

Authorities’ views


The authorities were in agreement with the
need to spur growth by completing
structural reforms, improving the business
climate, and strengthening the quality and
increasing the quantity of public
investment.



The authorities noted that they intended
to strengthen the business environment by
addressing some of its weaknesses, namely
by (i) simplifying the procedures and
cutting the cost of starting a business and
dealing with construction permits;
(ii) improving the legal rights of investors;
(iii) simplifying tax payment procedures;
and (iv) reducing the difficulties of
enforcing contracts by training judges to
allow streamlined and negotiated
agreements. They also noted that the onestop window at the Port of Cotonou had
helped reduce red tape in customs and
that changes in the regulatory framework
for the electricity sector had opened up

This endeavor initially involves conducting six pilot
country studies, of which Benin is the first pilot.

21

BENIN

following paragraphs note some of the
study’s key findings.
29.
Further financial deepening is
critical for accelerating growth. Benin’s
financial sector is shallow and only about
10 percent of the population has an account
at a formal financial institution. Access to
financial services is limited by the lack of
information on borrowers, difficulties in
enforcing contracts through the judicial
system, the absence of formalized property
rights, and the high cost of extending
banking services to non-urban areas. As
noted earlier, the study found that banks had
incentives to engage into purchasing
sovereign bonds on the regional financial
market rather than extending loans to the
private sector. Microfinance institutions are
hampered by their weak management and
small size in providing much-needed credit to
rural households and micro- and small
enterprises. Addressing the above obstacles
would help deepen financial sector
intermediation, which in turn would
contribute to economic growth.
30.
The stability of the financial sector is
also important for preserving a sound
macroeconomic environment and
minimizing fiscal contingent liabilities. The
unraveling of a large Ponzi scheme in 2010
and forbearance vis-à-vis three banks that
have failed to meet capital requirements over
several years point to weaknesses in the
supervision of financial institutions.9


Staff welcomed the liquidation of one of

in the program) and the initial steps taken

by the authorities to deal with other two
troubled banks, although staff noted that
current conservatory measures would
eventually raise the price of resolution;
accordingly, staff called for the timely
resolution of the two banks, because
prospects for a successful recapitalization
are remote. Bank resolution is being
conducted in accordance with WAEMU
regulations.


Staff welcomed the adoption of legislation
on combating the financing of terrorism by
Parliament in May 2012, but urged the
authorities to press ahead with effective
implementation of the AML/CFT regime, as
it can help combat offenses, such as
smuggling and corruption.



Staff expressed concern about the
considerable lag of the information
available on financial soundness indicators,
including on NPLs, giving rise to concerns
about the timely monitoring of the
banking system and the possibility of
having an early assessment of emerging
risks. It pointed out that, while financial
sector supervision is under the purview of
regional institutions, the Beninese
authorities can push for more resources for
stronger supervision.

Authorities’ views


The authorities reiterated their
commitment to resolve the issues with the
troubled banks, including liquidating one
of them, appointing a provisional
administrator for another, and
approaching potential investors. They
reaffirmed their commitment to recover
assets collected by fraudulent financial

BENIN

schemes and to resolve the troubled
licensed microfinance institutions.


They indicated that the unit in charge of
preventing money laundering was set up
at the Ministry of Finance by legislation
approved in 2006. Since it began
operating, it has followed over 130 cases,
including 8 cases during the first quarter of
2012. The authorities noted that these
efforts will be reinforced by the recent
legislation on AML/CFT.



Regarding supervision of the financial
sector and providing timely information,
they indicated they were strengthening the
committee supervising microfinance
institutions and collaborating on this issue
with the BCEAO and the regional banking
commission.



The authorities welcomed the enhanced
financial sector review pilot and expressed
interest in the forthcoming discussion on
regional policy implications in the context
of discussions with the WAEMU team.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Macroeconomic stability has
improved in recent years. Growth is
recovering from floods in 2010 and difficulties
at the Port of Cotonou and in the cotton
sector in 2011. Inflation increased in 2012
because of the reduction in fuel subsidies in
Nigeria, but is projected to return to lower
levels starting in 2013.
32.
Program targets were met. All
performance criteria and quantitative targets
at end-March and end-June 2012 were met,
in some cases with large margins. In
particular, the priority social expenditure
targets were achieved for the first time,
thanks to improved monitoring.
33.
The pace of structural reforms under
the program remains disappointing. Only
five of the program’s eleven structural
benchmarks for the fourth ECF review were
implemented, one with a delay. At the same
time, policy suspensions occurred in the
cotton sector and the IVP. Unless addressed,
these suspensions pose risks to economic
growth and revenue performance over the
medium term. The authorities have identified

corrective policies to bring the structural
reform program back on track, and
determined implementation will be needed.
34.
The financial sector needs to be
strengthened. Stronger supervision will
improve the soundness of the financial
system. Additional measures will be required
to develop financial intermediation, to
provide access to financial services to a larger
segment of the population, and to enhance
the sector’s contribution to growth.
35.
Benin needs to boost growth to
improve living standards and reduce
poverty. A comprehensive growth strategy,
which seeks to reduce obstacles to growth,
increase private sector participation in the
economy, and support a significantly larger
and better PIP should be at the core of the
authorities’ development strategy.
36.
Staff supports the authorities’
request to complete the fourth review
under the ECF and to disburse the
corresponding financial support. Although
the majority of structural benchmarks for the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BENIN

review were missed, completion of the review
would reflect the authorities’ strong
macroeconomic performance through endAugust, measures being taken to fight
corruption in the cotton and port sectors,
corrective actions being taken to address
delays in the structural benchmarks, and

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

broader commitments to relaunching
strengthened, more durable cotton and port
sector reforms in consultation with the private
sector and development partners.
37.
Staff recommends that the next
Article IV consultation take place on the
24- month consultation cycle.

Effective on January 7, 2010, interest on ECF credit outstanding would be zero in 2010 and 2011. On December 1, 2011, the IMF Board extended through December 31, 2012, the waiver of interest payments for concessional loans that was introduced on
January 7, 2010. For 2013, interest rates will be 0 percent for ECF and RCF loans, and 0.25 percent per year for the SCF, ESF, and subsidized ENDA/EPCA. After 2013, projected interest charges are based on 0.25/0.25/0.5/0.25 percent per year for the ECF,
RCF, SCF, and ESF, respectively. The IMF will review the interest rates for all PRGT facilities by end-2013 and every two years thereafter. Charges include net SDR charges and SDR assessments.

APPENDIX I—LETTER OF INTENT
REPUBLIC OF BENIN

MINISTRY OF ECONOMY
AND FINANCE
------------------------------------------

To :
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director

The Minister

International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431, USA

Cotonou, October 24, 2012
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
1.

The Government of Benin continues to implement its economic and financial program

under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in order to achieve its growth and poverty reduction
objectives. We wish to take the opportunity of the fourth review to take stock of program
implementation at end-June 2012 and to define the policies and reforms we plan to implement
in the second half of 2012 and in 2013.
2.

Despite a difficult international economic climate, the implementation of our program

was satisfactory overall. All the quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for endMarch and end-June 2012 were met. The medium-term economic framework is largely
unchanged, and the government reaffirms its resolve to implement the policies and reforms
described herein. We hereby request conclusion of the fourth review under the ECF arrangement
and the associated disbursement of Special Drawing Right (SDR) 10.61 million.

Recent Economic Developments and Program Implementation
A.

Recent Economic Developments

Economic developments in 2011
3.

The real GDP growth rate was 3.5 percent in 2011 compared to 2.6 percent in 2010. This

recovery in economic activity was principally driven by: (i) the significant increase in agricultural
production; (ii) increased cotton production; and (iii) the rebound in construction and public
works activities, led by infrastructure construction. Inflation remained under control in 2011,
standing at 2.7 percent on average, below the convergence criterion of the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).
4.

The current account deficit (excluding grants) widened in 2011, growing to 10.3 percent

of GDP compared to 8.2 percent of GDP in 2010. In particular, the volume of cotton product
exports and other exports dropped sharply. However, the improved balance of the capital
account and sound behavior of foreign investment made it possible to limit the overall balance
of payments deficit to 4.9 percent of GDP.
5.

Money supply grew by 9.0 percent in 2011, driven by the foreign assets of the

commercial banks and by credit to the private sector and to government following the rebound
in economic activity. The net foreign assets of the banking system remained stable overall.
6.

The Government continued its prudent external indebtedness policy. At end-2011, the

total public debt was equivalent to 30 percent of GDP. The risk of a debt crisis remains low.
7.

Measures aimed at reinforcing public finance were implemented throughout 2011,

including notably the introduction of the one-stop window at the Port of Cotonou. However,
revenue performance at end-2011 fell below expectations at CFAF 605.6 billion, or 17.6 percent
of GDP, compared to an objective of CFAF 650.1 billion, owing to problems associated with the
implementation of the new-generation import-verification program (IVP) and the resistance of
some economic stakeholders. In order to maintain balanced public finances, the government had
to contain expenditure to CFAF 754.7 billion, or 21.9 percent of GDP, compared to an objective of
CFAF 801 billion. The overall fiscal deficit, on a cash basis and excluding grants, came to
4.9 percent of GDP, in line with the program targets. This deficit was financed as planned by

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35

BENIN

external resources (grants and concessional borrowing) and issues of securities on the regional
financial market.

Economic developments in the first quarter of 2012
8.

The inflation rate rose sharply in early January 2012 following the partial elimination of

fuel subsidies in Nigeria. Inflation came to 7.4 percent at end-March (year-on-year) up from an
average of about 3.0 percent before.
9.

There was continued strengthening of public finances in the first quarter of 2012. Total

revenue was CFAF 211.6 billion, or 5.6 percent of GDP, surpassing the program target by
CFAF 63.3 billion. Overall, expenditure was in keeping with program targets. Consequently, the
overall fiscal balance exceeded its target.
10.

Customs receipts at end-March 2012 amounted to CFAF 81.0 billion, or 2.2 percent of

GDP, exceeding the program target of CFAF 69.6 billion. This performance was largely
attributable to the impact of implementing the one-stop window at the Port of Cotonou.
Domestic tax receipts amounted to CFAF 71.4 billion, or 1.9 percent of GDP, exceeding the
program target. This performance reflects solid collections of the value-added tax (VAT) and
property taxes, thanks to the intensification of collection efforts by the tax administration. Nontax
revenue increased sharply to CFAF 59.2 billion, or 1.6 percent of GDP. This performance is
explained by the additional revenue from the sale of a third-generation (3G) mobile telephone
license of CFAF 44 billion, of which only CFAF 9 billion had been programmed.
11.

Expenditure execution during the first quarter of 2012 was kept within the program

target. Total expenditure and net lending (on a cash basis) came to CFAF 193.2 billion, or
5.1 percent of GDP, compared to a forecast of CFAF 186.6 billion. Primary current expenditure
overall slightly exceeded the program target. Investment expenditure was slightly greater than
the budgetary targets, largely reflecting the payment of some certified payments (décomptes).
The indicative benchmark for priority social expenditure was observed, totaling CFAF 51.6 billion
compared to a target of CFAF 46 billion thanks to rigorous monitoring.
12.

Summing up, all the quantitative performance criteria were met at end-March 2012. The

criterion relating to the basic primary balance was observed by a comfortable margin:
performance of CFAF 39.0 billion, or 1.0 percent of GDP, compared to an objective of
36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BENIN

CFAF -20.5 billion. This reflects the solid performance of the tax and nontax collection agencies
(régies financières), quite apart from the revenue associated with the sale of the 3G mobile
telephony license. The criterion relating to net domestic financing was also largely observed:
performance of CFAF -75.9 billion, or -2.0 percent of GDP, compared with a target of CFAF
43.5 billion (adjusted amount). The criteria relating to the external debt and arrears were
observed as well.

Economic developments during the second quarter of 2012
13.

Sound fiscal performance continued during the second quarter of 2012 despite the

provisional suspension of the IVP in May (see below). Overall, revenue performance at end-June
was satisfactory. Total revenue at end-June 2012 came to CFAF 380 billion, or 10.1 percent of
GDP, compared to a target of CFAF 331.3 billion. Customs receipts amounted to
CFAF 156.4 billion, or 4.2 percent of GDP, compared to a target of CFAF 154.3 billion, thanks to
the surplus accumulated during the first quarter. Domestic tax receipts exceeded the program
target, reaching CFAF 148.7 billion, or 4.0 percent of GDP, compared to the forecast of
CFAF 145.7 billion. This solid performance is attributable to strengthened controls by the tax
administration, in particular on the value-added tax (VAT), the tax on industrial and commercial
profits, and the corporate tax. Nontax revenue came to CFAF 74.8 billion, or 2.0 percent of GDP,
compared to a target of CFAF 31.3 billion. This performance is explained for the most part by the
payment of 3G license fees and by the solid performance of other nontax revenue.
14.

The control of expenditure commitments introduced at the start of the year was

maintained during the second quarter. Total expenditure was below targeted levels at end-June
2012, amounting to CFAF 397.6 billion, or 10.6 percent of GDP, compared to a target of
CFAF 437.0 billion. The wage bill reached CFAF 133.0 billion compared to a target of CFAF 134.1
billion. Similarly, investment expenditure was below targeted levels owing to delays in the
implementation of some projects.
15.

All in all, the basic primary balance exceeded its target of CFAF -39.8 billion, or

-1.1 percent of GDP, and net domestic financing exceeded its target of CFAF 60.7 billion. The
overall fiscal balance (cash basis excluding grants) came to CFAF 27.3 billion, or 0.7 percent of
GDP, compared to a target of CFAF 124.4 billion. This deficit was financed largely by the
disbursement under the ECF, World Bank support, and a drawing against the deposits of the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

BENIN

central government, which were reconstituted in part by the issuance of Treasury bills. The
benchmarks relating to the external debt and arrears were also observed.

B.
16.


Implementation of Structural Reforms in the First Half of 2012
The implementation of the structural reforms has had mixed results.

To address long-standing delays in obtaining development partner support for three tax
reform initiatives, the government will fund these reforms out of its 2013 budget; on this
basis, the government plans to meet the following three benchmarks by end-March 2013 :


The start of the development of a complete and integrated information system at the
Directorate-General of Taxes and Government Property (DGID), scheduled for
March 2012; it may take up to three years to finalize.



The generalization of the taxpayer identification number (TIN) to all taxpayers and to all
units of the tax and customs administrations, planned for December 2011.



The generalization of the systematic use of the TIN by the Directorate-General of
Customs and Indirect Duties (DGDDI) and the cessation of the use of nonspecific
numbers in the ASYCUDA++ system (Automated System for Customs Data), planned for
end-December 2011.



Progress has been made with regard to the adoption of a civil service reform strategy by
decision of the Council of Ministers, planned for May 2012: the provisional report on the last
preparatory study was completed in July 2012 and validated on August 30, 2012; the results
of the studies carried out will be used in drawing up the strategy, which is scheduled to be
adopted by December 31, 2012.



The draft law governing pensions, based on the final report on the actuarial audit of the
Benin National Retirement Fund (FNRB) and scheduled to be conveyed to the National
Assembly in May 2012, was presented in September 2012 following the observations raised
in the course of a first reading in the Council of Ministers.

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BENIN



The operationalization of the computerized transit module of ASYCUDA++ between the Port
of Cotonou and all the land-based border customs units, planned for March 2012, has been
completed; goods in transit have been tracked by this module since September 2012.



The detailed review of all existing tax and customs exemptions was submitted to the Council
of Ministers on schedule in June 2012, including an action plan for implementing the
recommendations.



The finalization of the pilot phase of ―Sunkwè‖ (database of civil servants) was completed; the
decision to extend it to the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service (MTFP) was reached on
schedule in June 2012; this measure is being implemented with technical assistance from the
World Bank.



Two customs sector reform benchmarks planned for implementation by end-June 2012 were
missed owing to the suspension of the services contract related to the IVP: (i) the blocking of
the ASYCUDA++ fields for the TIN, the inspection certification (AV) number, and the customs
value corresponding to the AV; and (ii) the integration of IVP data into the one-stop window
to systematize the reconciliation of the certification and attestation functions of the IVP
during information processing. To ensure that these reforms can proceed, the government is
committed to relaunching the IVP under a new contract. It intends to launch the re-bidding
process and select the winner of the new IVP contract by end-March 2013, which would allow
the IVP to be re-operational and the two related customs reforms benchmarks to be met by
end-June 2013.



The bank that lost its license in 2009 and had been under provisional administration was
placed in liquidation on March 6, 2012, before the planned date of September 2012.

17.

The authorities have taken steps to strengthen the financial sector. Of the 12 banks doing

business in Benin at end-June 2012, 10 had come into line with the decision of the WAEMU
Council of Ministers on increasing minimum capital. One of the two banks whose capital and
reserves were not in keeping with that decision has been placed in provisional administration.
The authorities are exploring options for the second nonconforming bank. The Law of January
26, 2012 regulating decentralized financial structures in Benin and the law on banking regulation

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

BENIN

of June 4, 2012 have been passed by the National Assembly, giving the country modern
instruments for rehabilitating the financial sector.

II.
18.

Economic, Financial, and Structural Policies for the Future
The government will continue the implementation of its economic and financial program

to achieve its macroeconomic stability and sustainable development objectives. The
government’s economic policy is aimed at supporting the economy’s return to strong and
equitable growth led by the private sector. This choice will require a consolidation of the
macroeconomic framework and strengthened structural measures.

A.
19.

Macroeconomic Framework

The prevailing uncertainties regarding the global economy, and those pertaining to the

cotton sector and the IVP (see below), suggest we should be prudent and project growth of
3.5 percent for 2012. The growth rate may be expected to improve in 2013. We currently project
a growth rate of 3.8 percent, but are continuing to monitor developments over the second half of
2012. The rebound in economic activity in 2013 would result from, among other things, the
ongoing efforts to increase agricultural production and build the capacity of the Port of Cotonou
while enhancing its competitiveness. Owing to the impact of the elimination of subsidies on fuel
from Nigeria, average annual inflation in 2012 is expected to amount to about 7 percent.
However, owing to the easing of price pressures, inflation in 2013 is expected to be close to the
3 percent ceiling adopted within the WAEMU multilateral surveillance framework.
20.

The government decided to suspend the framework agreement governing the cotton

sector in March 2012 and to organize the approach to crop year 2012/13. This decision was
driven by the operational failures identified, in particular the poor governance of the sector,
which did little to promote the development of cotton production. Nevertheless, it is projected
that in the 2012/13 crop year production will exceed that of crop year 2011/12. In consultation
with the private sector, the government will develop and implement a new framework
agreement. This new agreement will aim at promoting the integrated development of the sector
by production zone, with the objective of effective liberalization, enhanced competitiveness, and
greater transparency in governance so as to impart new dynamism to the sector. A regulatory
authority will be established to ensure that the sector functions in keeping with the principles set

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BENIN

forth in the framework agreement. The state will continue to provide critical services in the areas
in question, such as organizing and providing support to producers, monitoring the provision of
production inputs, and gathering statistical information.
21.

The government decided temporarily to suspend the contract for IVP services in May

2012 owing to the difficulties experienced with program implementation. Among the problems
in question, the government noted the high costs of the services associated with this reform,
disputes relating to the scanner inspection of goods for delivery to outlying countries, the spike
in prices for mass consumer goods, and the gradual process of turning away from use of the Port
of Cotonou as distinguished from other competing ports in the subregion. Given these issues,
the government decided to reorient the modalities for implementing selected IVP services, in
particular regarding the flexibility of the rates applied. In addition, the cost of user-borne services
(other than customs clearance) will be reduced in order to improve the competitiveness of the
port. These approaches will be supported by trade missions to other countries of the subregion
making use of the port and by targeted measures aimed at reducing the time delays in releasing
goods from the port platform itself.
22.

The external current account deficit is expected to decline somewhat in 2012 and 2013, in

response to the anticipated increase in cotton exports and external budgetary support. This
deficit is expected in large measure to be financed by inflows of foreign capital.

B.
23.

Fiscal Policy

For the remainder of 2012, the government will undertake to limit the basic primary

balance at end-December 2012 to CFAF 7.2 billion, or 0.2 percent of GDP. It intends to:
(i) strengthen the one-stop window at the Port of Cotonou, ensuring coverage not only of the
import side (already operational) but the export side as well; (ii) replace the preshipment
inspection by an import control process that will provide information on value; and (iii) maintain
discipline with respect to current expenditure, and the wage bill in particular, while speeding up
public investment execution.
24.

Strengthened controls will contribute to an increase in domestic revenues in 2012, to

achieve the target at end-December 2012 of CFAF 710.0 billion, or 18.9 percent of GDP. The
progress made regarding nontax revenue will make it possible to offset the projected shortfall in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

BENIN

customs receipts resulting from the slowdown in port activities. The government will continue to
accord special attention to priority to social expenditure to achieve the goal of CFAF 134.0 billion
by end-December 2012.
25.

The government’s fiscal policy in 2013 will aim at beginning to create fiscal space to

address unanticipated economic developments. Total revenue should come to 19.1 percent of
GDP while total expenditure should amount to 22.5 percent of GDP. The basic primary balance
would be slightly positive at 0.4 percent of GDP.
26.

Customs receipts in 2013 should come to CFAF 356.0 billion, or 8.8 percent of GDP.

Supplementing the implementation of the new IVP orientations referred to above, the
mobilization of resources at customs should benefit from progress made with computerization,
in particular the expansion and operationalization of the ASYCUDA++ transit module. Domestic
tax receipts should increase to CFAF 329.0 billion, or 8.6 percent of GDP. Customs receipts and
taxes would be supported by, among other things, the efforts of the joint Customs-Taxes team.
Nontax revenue should remain at a level comparable to that of the preceding year in terms of
GDP (excluding the 3G license).
27.

Total expenditure and net lending should amount to CFAF 905.0 billion, or 22.5 percent

of GDP, in 2013. The breakdown of expenditure in terms of GDP should remain broadly
unchanged from 2012. The wage bill will be limited to CFAF 298.9 billion, an unchanged level in
terms of GDP. Investment expenditure of CFAF 272.9 billion, or 6.8 percent of GDP, will
contribute to economic growth. The fiscal deficit will be financed by recourse to the regional
securities market and the mobilization of grants and external concessional assistance.

C.
28.

Structural Reforms

While the following do not constitute structural benchmarks under the program, the

government nevertheless intends to speed the implementation of the following measures:


Submission of the 2012 operating accounts to the Audit Office by June 30, 2013, at the latest;



Implementation of the recommendations made by the December 2011 mission from the
IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department;

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BENIN



Review of the operational framework of the cotton sector to correct for the failures identified
and effectively deregulate the sector, this by the beginning of the 2014/15 crop season;



Implementation of the new orientations for the IVP;



Introduction of a harmonized database for management of the civil service; and



Organization of an UNCTAD study mission before December 2012 to replace ASYCUDA++
with ASYCUDA World, an improved version of the software.

29.

At the financial sector level, the government will ensure the promulgation of the three

pieces of regional legislation passed by the National Assembly, namely the framework law on
banking regulation, the law on combating the financing of terrorism in the WAEMU member
states, and the law on sanctions for violations involving checks, bank cards, and other electronic
payment methods. The government will continue its collaboration with regional institutions for
the restructuring of two Beninese banks in financial distress and will ensure regular monitoring of
the microfinance institutions in difficulty.

III.
30.

Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy

The third Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS III) for 2011–15 and its Priority

Action Program (PAP) will remain the reference documents for the government’s actions in this
area. The strategy is aimed at improving the population’s living standards and achieving the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly in the health, primary education, water, and
sanitation sectors. The GPRS III identifies two growth scenarios: one scenario based on the
macroeconomic framework supported by the ECF and a second more optimistic scenario. In view
of recent developments and the outlook for the short and medium term, the first scenario is the
one being implemented for the time being, in line with the 2011 JSAN recommendations. The
authorities will continue to explore the measures necessary for moving toward the more
optimistic scenario, including its financing.
31.

The progress report on the GPRS III for 2011 was drawn up and used as the basis for the

joint review with development partners in June 2012. It made it possible to highlight the progress
made and formulate recommendations for improving implementation of the GPRS III in the years
ahead. All in all, 48 percent of the indicators identified in the monitoring framework achieved the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

BENIN

targets set, while 33 percent made progress without meeting the targets and 19 percent showed
slippages.
32.

The government will continue to devote special attention to the execution of priority

social expenditure to protect vulnerable population groups and achieve the MDGs, in particular
in the priority sectors mentioned earlier.

IV.
33.

Conclusion

The government is convinced that the measures and policies described in this letter are

appropriate for achieving the program objectives, and it reaffirms its commitment to take any
additional measures required. It therefore requests conclusion of the fourth review under the ECF
arrangement and the associated disbursement. The fifth review of the program is expected to be
completed by end-March 2013, based on the observance of performance criteria as at
September 30, 2012. The sixth review of the program is expected to be completed by endAugust 2013, based on the observance of performance criteria as of March 31, 2013.
34.

Program monitoring will be based on the semiannual performance criteria, quantitative

targets, and structural benchmarks defined in Tables 1 and 2 attached to this letter. To facilitate
program monitoring, the government will regularly provide IMF staff with all the information
required, as defined in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), or any other
additional information that it considers necessary or that the IMF staff requests.
35.

Should it prove necessary, the government will take any further measures that may

become appropriate for achieving program objectives. The government will consult with the IMF
on the adoption of these measures, and in advance of any revisions to the policies contained in
this letter, in accordance with the IMF’s policies on such consultation. The government authorizes
the IMF to publish the staff report on the discussions of the fourth review of the program, and
this letter of intent.

ATTACHMENT 1. TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF
UNDERSTANDING
October 15, 2012
1.

This technical memorandum of understanding (―the Memorandum‖) defines the

quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks, and structural benchmarks for the Republic of
Benin’s program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). It also sets out the frequency
and deadlines for data reporting to the staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for
program monitoring purposes.

DEFINITIONS
2.

Unless otherwise indicated, ―government‖ is understood to mean the central

administration of the Republic of Benin and does not include any political subdivisions (such as
local governments), the central bank, or any other public or government-owned entity with
autonomous legal personality not included in the government’s flow-of-funds table (Tableau des
opérations financières de l’État, TOFE).
3.

The definitions of ―debt‖ and ―concessional borrowing‖ for the purposes of this

Memorandum are set out in point 9 of IMF Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140), as
subsequently amended, including by Executive Board Decision No. 14416-(09/91), effective
December 1, 2009:
(a)

For the purposes of this Memorandum, debt is understood to mean a current, that is, not
contingent, liability, created under a contractual agreement through the provision of
value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, which requires the obligor to
make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services at
some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest
liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary
ones being as follows:
(i)

loans, that is, advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of
an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including
deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary
exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the
obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

BENIN

collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official
swap arrangements);
(ii)

suppliers’ credits, that is, contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or
services are provided;

(iii)

leases, that is, arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has
the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter
than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains title to
the property. For the purpose of this guideline, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the
period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair
or maintenance of the property; and

(iv)

Treasury bills and bonds issued in Communauté Financière Africaine (CFA) francs on
the West African Economic and Monetary Union’s (WAEMU) regional market, which
are included in public debt for the purpose of this Memorandum.

Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded
damages arising from failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that
constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not
considered debt under this definition (for example, payment on delivery) will not give rise
to debt.
(b)

A loan is considered concessional if, on the date on which the contract became effective,
the ratio of the present value of the loan, based on the reference interest rates, to the
nominal value of the loan is less than 65 percent (that is, the grant element of the loan is
at least equal to 35 percent of its nominal value). The present value of the loan will be
calculated by discounting future payments of interest and principal using the commercial
interest reference rates (CIRRs) established by the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD). Specifically, the ten-year average of CIRRs
reported by the OECD will be used for loans with maturities of at least 15 years, while the
six-month average of CIRRs will be used for loans with shorter maturities. To both the
ten-year and six-month averages of the reference rate, the margin for different
repayment periods will be added, as established by the OECD (0.75 percent for
repayment periods of less than 15 years; 1.00 percent for repayment periods of 15-

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BENIN

19 years; 1.15 percent for repayment periods of 20–29 years; and 1.25 percent for
repayment periods of 30 years or more).
(c)

"Domestic debt" is defined as debt denominated in CFA francs, while "external debt" is
defined as debt denominated in any currency other than the CFA franc.

QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Ceiling on Net Domestic Financing of the Government
Definitions
4.

Net domestic financing of the government is defined as the sum of (i) net bank credit to

the government, defined below; and (ii) net nonbank financing of the government, including the
proceeds of the sale of government assets, which includes proceeds from the divestiture of parts
of public enterprises, that is, privatizations, treasury bills, and other securitized obligations issued
by the government and listed in CFA francs on the WAEMU regional financial market, and any
Central Bank of West African States (Banque centrale des États de l’Afrique de l’Ouest, BCEAO)
credit to the government, including any drawings on the CFA franc counterpart of the allocation
of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs).
5.

Net bank credit to the government is defined as the balance between the debts and

claims of the government vis-à-vis the central bank and the national commercial banks. The
scope of net credit to the government is that used by the BCEAO and is in keeping with general
IMF practice in this area. It implies a definition of government that is broader than the one
indicated in paragraph 2. Government claims include the CFA franc cash balance, postal checking
accounts, customs duty bills, and all deposits with the BCEAO and commercial banks of
government owned entities, with the exception of industrial or commercial public agencies
(établissements publics à caractère industriel et commercial, EPICs) and government corporations,
which are excluded from the calculation. Government debt to the banking system includes all
debt to the central bank and the national commercial banks, including treasury bills and other
securitized debt.
6.

The figures deemed valid within the framework of the program will be the figures for net

bank credit to the government and for the net amount of treasury bills and bonds issued in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

BENIN

CFA francs on the WAEMU regional financial market calculated by the BCEAO and the figures for
nonbank financing calculated by the Treasury of Benin.
7.

Gross external budgetary assistance is defined as grants, loans, and debt relief operations

(excluding project-related loans and grants, use of IMF resources, and debt relief under the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiatives). Net external
budgetary assistance is defined as the difference between gross external budgetary assistance
and the sum of total debt service obligations on all external debt (defined, in turn, as the sum of
interest payments and amortizations on all external loans, including interest payments and other
charges to the IMF and on project-related loans, but excluding repayment obligations to the
IMF), and all payments of external payments arrears.

Adjustments
8.

The ceiling on net domestic financing (NDF) of the government will be adjusted if net

external budgetary assistance exceeds or falls short of the program projections indicated in
paragraph 9:


If, at the end of a quarter, net external budgetary assistance exceeds the total projected
amounts (cumulative since January 1 of the same year) by over CFAF 5 billion, the NDF
ceiling will be lowered by an amount equivalent to this excess minus CFAF 5 billion. However,
if the excess is entirely or partly allocated to the settlement of domestic arrears above and
beyond the program objective specified in paragraph 9, the NDF ceiling will be lowered by
an amount equal to the excess net external budgetary assistance compared with program
targets, minus the sum of (a) CFAF 5 billion and (b) the excess repayment of domestic arrears
compared with program targets.



If at the end of a quarter, net external budgetary assistance falls short of the projected
amounts (cumulative since January 1 of the same year), the NDF ceiling will be increased by
an amount equivalent to this shortfall, within the following limits: the increase may not
exceed CFAF 10 billion at end-June 2012; CFAF 20 billion at end-September 2012;
CFAF 35 billion at end-December 2012; and CFAF 5 billion at end-March 2013.

9.

For the purposes of calculating the adjustment to the NDF ceiling, the following amounts

are projected in the program:

BENIN

B. Floor for Basic Primary Fiscal Balance
Definition
11.

The basic primary fiscal balance is defined as being equal to the difference between total

fiscal revenue (tax and nontax) and basic primary fiscal expenditure (on a payment-order basis).
Basic primary fiscal expenditure is defined as fiscal (current plus capital) expenditure minus
(a) the payments of interest on domestic and external debt; and (b) capital expenditure financed
by external grants and loans. Grants are excluded from revenue and net government lending is
excluded from fiscal expenditure.

Performance criteria and indicative targets
12.

The floor on the basic primary fiscal balance (cumulative since January 1 of the same

year) is a balance of not less than CFAF -39.8 billion at end-June 2012; CFAF -21.7 billion at endSeptember 2012; CFAF 7.2 billion at end-December 2012; and CFAF -18.7 billion at end-March
2013. The floor is a performance criterion for end-September 2012and end-March 2013, and an
indicative target for end-December 2012.

C. Non-accumulation of New Domestic Payments Arrears by the
Government
Definition
13.

Domestic payments arrears are defined as domestic payments due but not paid after a

90-day grace period, unless the obligation specifies a longer grace period. The National
Amortization Fund (Caisse Autonome d’Amortissement, CAA) and the treasury record and update
the data on the accumulation of domestic payments arrears, as well as their settlement. The
definitions of debt provided in paragraph 3a, of domestic debt in paragraph 3c, and of
government in paragraph 2 apply here.

Continuous performance criterion
14.

The government undertakes not to accumulate any new domestic payments arrears. The

nonaccumulation of new domestic payments arrears will be continuously monitored throughout
the program.

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BENIN

D. Non-Accumulation of External Public Payments Arrears by the
Government
Definition
15.

External public payments arrears are defined as the sum of payments due, but not paid,

by the government at the due date specified in the contract, taking into account any applicable
grace period, on external debt of, or guaranteed by, the government. The definitions of debt
provided in paragraph 3a, of external debt in paragraph 3c, and of government in paragraph 2
apply here.

Continuous performance criterion
16.

The government undertakes not to accumulate any external public payments arrears,

with the exception of arrears relating to debt that is the subject of renegotiation or rescheduling.
The performance criterion on the non accumulation of external public payments arrears will be
continuously monitored throughout the program.

E. Ceiling on the Contracting or Guaranteeing by the Government of
New Non-concessional External Debt Maturing in a Year or More
Definition
17.

This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in paragraph 3a, but also

to commitments contracted or guaranteed by the government (as defined in paragraph 18)
(including lease-purchase contracts) for which no value has been received. This criterion also
applies to private sector debt guaranteed by the government, which constitutes a contingent
liability of the government. As indicated in paragraph 3c, external debt excludes Treasury bills
and bonds issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU regional market. The definition of
nonconcessional debt in paragraph 3b applies here.
18.

The concept of ―government‖ used for this performance criterion and for the

performance criterion on the contracting or guaranteeing by the government of new short-term
external debt, includes the government, as defined in paragraph 2, local governments, and all
public enterprises, including administrative public agencies (établissements publics à caractère

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

BENIN

administratif), scientific and technical public agencies, professional public agencies, and
enterprises jointly owned by the Beninese government with the governments of other countries.

Continuous performance criterion
19.

No nonconcessional external borrowing will be contracted or guaranteed by the

government for the duration of the program, except for borrowing with a grant element of at
least 20 percent and not exceeding a cumulative amount equivalent of CFAF 25 billion. Changes
to this ceiling may be made (subject to approval by the IMF Executive Board) for specific
investment projects whose financial viability and profitability have been evaluated and approved
by a recognized institution, and on condition that the loan does not seriously exacerbate debt
vulnerabilities according to the debt sustainability analysis prepared jointly by the staffs of the
World Bank and the IMF.
20.

The government also undertakes not to contract or guarantee any external debt during

the implementation of the program without first having determined its concessionality with IMF
staff.

F. Ceiling on the Contracting or Guaranteeing by the Government of
New Non-concessional Short-Term External Debt
Definition
21.

The definitions in paragraphs 17 and 18 also apply to this performance criterion.

22.

Short-term external debt is debt with a contractual term of less than one year. Import-

and export-related loans, treasury bills issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU regional market,
normal short-term supplier credits, and debt relief operations are not covered by this
performance criterion.

Performance criterion
23.

The government undertakes not to contract or guarantee short-term nonconcessional

external debt.

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

defined as expenditures of a budgetary nature that are not executed following the stages of
expenditure commitment (engagement) and validation (liquidation) before the payment order
(ordonnancement) is issued, and that have not been regularized on the test date.

Indicative targets
29.

The government undertakes to limit total expenditures (cumulative since January 1 of

the same year) effected by exceptional payment procedures to a ceiling of CFAF 4.6 billion at
end-June 2012; CFAF 7.5 billion at end-September 2012; CFAF 10.6 billion at end-December

APPENDIX II—BENIN: DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COTTON
SECTOR
Cotton has historically played a dominant role in Beninese exports and represented a large fraction of
GDP. While its importance has declined significantly, it continues to occupy the attention of policy
makers because of the large number of rural poor involved in the activity and hence the close
relationship between the performance of the cotton sector and rural poverty and well-being. Following
a disappointing harvest in 2011/12 and governance concerns, the authorities assumed operational
control of input procurement and distribution in the cotton sector this year and will also control the
post-harvest marketing and sales. Preliminary information at the time of the writing of this note
suggests a significant improvement in production volume for the 2012/13 season. The authorities are
considering a new framework agreement for the sector in order to return many of these functions to the
private sector in time for the 2014/15 season.

Background
1.

The cotton sector has historically accounted for a significant fraction of GDP and dominated

formal exports in Benin, as in other West African states. Cotton production attracts the attention of
policy makers for several reasons beyond its significant economic weight. Cotton farming involves a
large number of rural workers who do not otherwise participate in the formal economy, and the
government provides significant input subsidies (e.g., fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides), which
are distributed as part of support to the cotton sector, but also go to other widely grown crops. The
banking sector is also heavily implicated, as it provides seasonal credit (crédit de campagne). Most
importantly, the government has a critical role to play in alleviating significant market failures
inherent to the production process, including input provision and access to credit.1

The economic importance of cotton has declined steadily over the last two decades. The

final value of cotton for export, representing almost all of the total value of cotton products in
Benin, declined from 77 percent of exports in 1995 to 17 percent in 2011, and from 8.4 percent of
nominal GDP to 1.6 percent during the same period. Even if this year’s harvest equaled the largest
harvest on record by volume, it would amount to only 2.3 percent of GDP in 2013. These trends may

International cotton prices spiked dramatically in 2010 and 2011, peaking 250 percent above

the average price between 2006 and 2009. They have since fallen precipitously, but remained
50 percent above the average as of July 2012. Much of Benin’s exported cotton is of high quality,
because it is harvested manually and benefits from a favorable climate, especially in the north.
However, the average sales price is typically slightly below the international price for mid-quality
cotton, possibly because of a discount linked to selling forward the harvest to minimize price risk.

B.

Policy Evolution

4.

Over the last two decades, the cotton sector was slowly liberalized. By 2000, the parastatal

ginner, Société Nationale de la Promotion de l’Agriculture (SONAPRA), coexisted with a number of
private ginners, and saw many of its other traditional activies, such as input supply and export
marketing, replaced with more competitive arrangements. Much of the coordinating of cotton
production activities was taken on by the interprofessional cotton association (Association
Interprofessionnelle du Coton, AIC), while financial matters were handled by a financial clearing
house (Caisse de Stabilisation et de Régulation des Prix, CSRP). The privatisation of SONAPRA’s
remaining gins was agreed to as part of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt-reduction
initiative.
5.

By the middle of the last decade (2000-10), poor management and ballooning losses in the

midst of low world prices, which threatened Benin’s macroeconomic situation, brought forward the
need to privatize. Several aborted attempts were made to put SONAPRA’s gins up for sale in four
lots, but progress stalled. In 2008, under very tight time constraints, the gins were sold in a single

60

BENIN

block to a consortium headed by a Beninese businessman, who was already active in the sector
with private ginning assets and in input supply. This significantly concentrated control of the sector
in private hands.

Developments During the 2012/13 Season
C. Suspension of the Framework Agreement for Cotton
6.

As discussed in Box 3, the government temporarily suspended the framework agreement for

cotton (Accord-Cadre du Coton) in April of this year, that has governed the sector since 2009. The
government cited final production outturn for the 2011/12 season, which was more than
30 percent below expectations, in spite of government charges of excess supply of state-subsidized
fertilizers, relative to the area under cultivation. Based on alleged governance concerns arising from
these results, the state assumed control of the management of the 2012/13 cotton campaign.
7.

For the current season, the government is directly involved in most steps of input

procurement and distribution and cotton delivery to gins and export sale of fiber. It initiated its
own input procurement and delivery process, supplied inputs on credit to cotton producers’
associations, as well as advice and monitoring of the cultivation process. As harvesting begins,
significant uncertainty remains about ginning, since the facilities remain in private hands. The
authorities foresee a tolling model this year, in which the government retains ownership of the
cotton and pays a fixed per metric ton fee for ginning. Existing ginning capacity is in excess of
projected production, so partial participation by private ginners would likely be sufficient. Little to
no cotton has been sold forward to date and thus price risks remain.

D. Production During the 2012/13 Campaign
8.

The area under cultivation for this year’s crop is estimated to have has expanded

dramatically, because of a historically high buying price for cotton farmers, a reduction in costs of
subsidized inputs offered by the state, and concerted efforts to encourage cotton production by the
authorities. Estimates suggest that there are between 340,000 and 360,000 hectares2 under
cultivation, which under average historical yields of slightly more than 1.0 ton per hectare, would

produce significantly more cotton than has been seen in the last eight seasons. Optimistic yield
projections imply a return that would rank among the largest harvests on record.
9.

There had been some concern early in the growing season that disruptions due to the

change in management would cause problems in the delivery of necessary inputs. In some regions
there were reports of delays in the delivery of fertilizer, which caused them to be applied outside
their recommended time period. The belated provision of insecticides in some regions was a
potentially even more serious concern. However, it would seem that these early disruptions were
corrected in time, and pest incidence has remained moderate. Together with favorable rainfall, the
increased area of cultivation has thus contributed to rising optimism about the next harvest.

Policy Going Forward
10.

The Beninese authorities foresee a significant restructuring of the sector before it is returned

to private control. A new framework agreement would likely include a zoning model in which
farmers’ producer associations are grouped into zones and enter into an exclusive relationship with
particular ginners. The zoning model is widely viewed as a success in Burkina Faso and is credited
with greater farmer participation and increased production, although other arrangements which
achieve similar ends while providing more competition have been tried in other countries. The
authorities intend to remain involved in training, technical assistance to farmers, and production
data collection.
11.

The development of a zoning model will take time to develop. This change will need to be

carefully designed. It is anticipated that the government will continue direct operation of the
production process through the 2013/14 harvest, and implement the new model for the 2014/15
season, for which the input procurement process would begin in late 2013.

APPENDIX III—BENIN: EXTERNAL STABILITY ASSESSMENT
The external stability assessment for Benin indicates a deterioration of the external position and a
moderate real exchange rate overvaluation. Empirical assessments suggest that the current account
deficit exceeds its medium-term equilibrium by about 4 to 6 percentage points of GDP, and the real
effective exchange rate (REER) is overvalued by 15 percent, on average. These results differ moderately
from the findings of the 2011 Article IV consultation with the West African Economic and Monetary
Union (WAEMU), which concluded that the REER for the aggregate WAEMU group was broadly in line
with fundamentals. The analysis of structural indicators based on survey data confirms the empirical
findings and points to Benin’s low external competitiveness.

External Sector Developments and Assessment
1.

Benin’s external current account deficit (excluding grants) widened over the past several

years reflecting the weak performance of traditional exports and higher international import prices.
In the years before 2007, the current account deficit remained moderate at about 6.5 percent of
GDP. It widened sharply between 2007 and 2009, mainly reflecting higher world food prices. After a
temporary improvement in 2010, the current account deficit widened again to 10.3 percent in 2011,
because of the weak performance of cotton exports and a decline in investment income.1
1.

Although the REER depreciated over the
Figure 1. Benin and WAEMU: Effective Exchange
Rates, 1995–2011

past two years, it has appreciated significantly
over the period 1995-2008 (Figure 1). During
2009-11, the REER depreciated by about
7 percent, reflecting Benin’s lower inflation
differential with trading partners and mirroring
the evolution of the nominal effective exchange
rate (NEER). Nevertheless, this depreciation did
not offset the cumulative appreciation of about

2.

External financing of the current account deficit, with the exception of current official

transfers, remained relatively stable over the last decade. Foreign direct investment inflows averaged
about 2 percent of GDP and represented 70 percent of total capital inflows. Short-term capital flows
and medium- and long-term private loans were equivalent to 1 and 0.3 percent of GDP, respectively.
Other capital flows, such as project loans, remained at 2 percent of GDP. Though stable in the past,
external financing is heavily dependent on donor and market confidence in Beninese institutions
and thus depends on continued progress with structural reforms and sustained prudent
macroeconomic policies.
3.

Foreign exchange reserves are adequate and debt risks remain contained. Gross external

debt is relatively low (around 17 percent of GDP) and has been stable since Benin completed the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiative (MDRI) processes.
The debt sustainability analysis (Supplement 2) indicates a low risk of debt distress. The level of
foreign exchange reserves in the WAEMU system is adequate at over 6 months worth of imports of
goods and services, covering 60 percent of broad money and 100 percent of short-term debt.

Model-Based Assessment
4.

Empirical assessments suggest a deterioration of the external position and a moderate

overvaluation of the REER. These assessments are based on the three complementary Consultative
Group on Exchange Rate Issues (CGER) model-based approaches: (i) macroeconomic balance
approach; (ii) equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach; and (iii) external sustainability
approach. They indicate the exchange rate is overvalued by 15 percent, on average.

A.

Macroeconomic Balance Approach

5.

The macroeconomic balance approach estimates the exchange rate adjustment necessary to

close the gap between the equilibrium current account balance (the ―norm‖), based on economic
fundamentals, and the underlying current account balance. The method consists of three steps. First,
the equilibrium current account balance is estimated based on a set of macroeconomic
fundamentals.2 Second, the underlying current account balance is calculated as an average of the:

The equilibrium current account balance (CAB) is estimated using a fixed effects panel specification for a panel of

that stabilizes the net foreign assets (NFA) at a certain benchmark level. The NFA-stabilizing current
account balance (in percent of GDP) is derived using medium-term projections for real GDP growth
and inflation, and NFA in percentage of GDP at the end of the prior year. The REER misalignment is
then determined as in the macroeconomic balance approach.
10.

Application of the external sustainability approach to Benin indicates that the REER is

overvalued by about 20 percent in real effective terms. The magnitude of the misalignment ranges
from 10 percent (in the case of high foreign direct investment) to 30 percent (in the case of low
foreign direct investment).

Survey-Based Assessment
12.

Structural indicators based on survey data point to low external competitiveness. Three

survey-based reports presented in this section are the: (i) Global Competitiveness Index; (ii) Doing
Business Indicators; and (iii) Global Enabling Trade Index. They suggest that several institutional and
policy factors provide serious impediments to external competitiveness.

A.

Global Competitiveness Index

13.

The World Economic Forum’s 2012-13 Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) ranks Benin 119th

out of 144 countries, with an overall score of 3.6 out of 7 (Table 1). Benin’s score deteriorated over
the last three years. Benin ranks higher than the sub-Saharan African (SSA) average on basic
requirements (macroeconomic environment and health and primary education) and innovation and
sophistication factors, but lower in efficiency enhancers (good market efficiency, financial sector
development, technology readiness, and market size). Firms identify corruption, access to financing,
inadequate infrastructure, and tax regulations as the major constraints to doing business in Benin
(Figure 4).

B.

Doing Business Indicators

14.

The World Bank’s 2012 Doing Business Indicators also reduced Benin’s ranking (Text

Table 3). Benin moved down six places compared
to 2009 and is ranked 175th out of 183 countries
in terms of business climate, trailing most other
WAEMU countries. Benin faces challenges in
protecting investors’ rights, enforcing contracts,
and paying taxes. Starting a business remains
difficult, despite important reforms introduced in
2010-11 to facilitate access to credit (the

Global Enabling Trade Index

15.

The World Economic Forum’s 2012 Global Enabling Trade Index (ETI) ranks Benin 115th out

of 132 countries with an overall score of 3.4 out of 7 (Table 2). Among the different sub-indicators of
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

BENIN

the ETI, Benin ranks lowest on domestic market access (121), availability and quality of transport
infrastructure (115), availability and use of information and communication technologies (109), and
efficiency of custom administration (113). Factors that have the highest negative impact on the ease
of exporting and importing include access to trade finance, burdensome procedures, and tariff and
non-tariff barriers (Figures 5 and 6).

Conclusion
16.

Benin’s external position has deteriorated recently in association with a moderate

misalignment of the real exchange rate and challenges with external competitiveness. Survey-based
competiveness indicators point to the necessity of improving the country’s competitiveness and
institutional capacity. Sustained capital and financial account inflows will depend on consolidating
recent successes in macroeconomic management and reinforcing efforts toward structural reform.

2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION AND FOURTH REVIEW
UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY ARRANGEMENT—
FINANCIAL SECTOR REVIEW
Prepared by

The African Department and the Monetary and Capital
Markets Department, in collaboration with the World
Bank

This enhanced review of Benin’s financial sector is the first of several pilot reviews called for by the
Executive Board in May 2012. The purpose of the reviews is to better understand the interplay
between financial deepening, macrostability, and effectiveness of macroeconomic policies in lowincome countries, under bilateral surveillance.
This study follows a “bottom up” approach and goes beyond the traditional surveillance focus on
banking system soundness and solvency. It looks at the actual way the financial sector operates in
Benin, as opposed to a mere survey of existing regulations and indicators. It examines the financial
sector’s depth, breadth, and reach, as well as these factors’ relevance for the effectiveness of
macroeconomic policies.
Benin’s financial sector is shallow, segmented, and provides limited financial inclusion. The banking
sector, dominated by 12 international banks, is generally sound, but plays a limited role in financial
inclusion. Conversely, the microfinance sector has good reach, but the volumes it handles are small,
and the bulk of its institutions operate without adequate supervision. The sector would benefit from a
consolidation and a strategic reorientation toward micro- and small enterprises. The interbank market
is virtually nonexistent, and the government securities market tends to crowd out lending to the
private sector.
The effectiveness of the regional monetary policy is constrained by the shallowness of the financial
system and a number of structural impediments, including insufficient property and creditor rights;
excess liquidity in the largest banks; and lack of competition among banks. As a result, monetary
policy has limited traction in Benin.
The study makes a number of recommendations. Most important among them are the establishment
of better institutional and market infrastructure that could help banks better assess risks; and the
strengthening of supervision, both for banks and microfinance institutions.

BACKGROUND
1.
Benin has been selected to be the first of several pilot cases for enhanced surveillance of
financial systems, called for by the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Executive Board in May
2012. The Board stressed the need to widen the scope of financial sector surveillance in low-income
countries (LICs) in Article IV consultations to better account for the interplay between financial deepening,
macro-stability and the effectiveness of monetary policy, in line with the recommendation of the 2011
Triennial Surveillance Review.1 The call was grounded in the observation that financial underdevelopment
amplifies vulnerability to macro-financial shocks, and limits the effectiveness of macroeconomic, growth,
and poverty alleviation policies by channeling part of savings toward unproductive investments, raising
credit risks to market participants, and limiting the range and efficiency of available policy instruments.2
2.
This study has been undertaken as part of the 2012 Article IV consultation with Benin.3,4 It
presents a monograph of Benin’s financial system, assesses its soundness and vulnerabilities, identifies
impediments to financial deepening, evaluates interactions between the financial system’s structural
features and macroeconomic policy choices and effectiveness, and makes recommendations for financial
deepening. Benin is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), and a
number of key macroeconomic and financial policies are designed and implemented at the union level. In
particular, WAEMU members share a common currency, the Communauté Financière Africaine franc (CFAF),
which is pegged to the euro. Under this framework, Benin’s macroeconomic policy is heavily influenced by
fiscal policy. This study focuses on Benin-specific issues, which are however embedded in the above-noted
union-wide dimensions, notably those related to financial regulation, interbank and securities markets,
banking supervision, and monetary policy. This study builds on the findings and recommendations of 2012
Article IV consultation with the WAEMU.5 Another forthcoming pilot study, to be prepared in the context of
the 2013 Article IV consultation with the WAEMU, will focus on union-wide issues.
3.
Benin has a small and segmented financial sector. The sector consists of three categories of
entities: (i) commercial banks; (ii) microfinance institutions (MFIs); and (iii) other nonbank financial
institutions (insurance companies, pension funds, postal checking services). These categories operate
independently to a large extent. The 2011-12 World Economic Forum’s report on global competitiveness

The economic literature recognizes in general that the financial system performs four basic functions essential to
economic development and growth: mobilization of savings; allocation of resources; facilitation of transactions and
risk management; and provision of corporate control (Barajas, A. and Chami, R., 2012). Another function noted by
some authors is information generation for market actors.
3

This study was initiated in July 2012 during the Article IV discussions in Cotonou, Benin, and was later completed by
a staff visit in September to the headquarters of the regional central bank in Dakar, Senegal, the regional banking
commission in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, and financial institutions in Cotonou.

ranks Benin 98 out of 142 surveyed countries in terms of financial market development, with a score of
4 (out of 7) on availability of financial services.
4.
Benin’s financial system has gone through considerable changes in recent decades. The
banking system collapsed in the late 1980s, following many years of inappropriate economic and financial
policies. In 1989, the authorities adopted a rehabilitation plan under which a number banks were liquidated
and a legal receiver was appointed to recover bank loans and reimburse depositors. Four new private
banks were established during 1988-90 and were since then joined by nine others.6 Saving and loans
associations have developed rapidly since the early 1990s and become important financial institutions for
collecting savings and providing credit to individuals and small enterprises. The largest microfinance
network (Fédération des Caisses d’Épargne et de Crédit Agricole Mutuel, FECECAM) experienced financial and
governance problems in the late 1990s. Its rehabilitation program was successfully implemented during the
2000s. Unlicensed microfinance institutions mushroomed over years and a few of them turned into Ponzi
schemes during the second half of the 2000s. These schemes attracted official attention after the largest of
them collapsed in June 2010.
5.
The study incorporates comments received from the authorities. The September 2012 mission
prepared an aide-mémoire on its findings and recommendations, which was discussed with the Minister of
Finance of Benin and senior officials of the regional central bank (Banque Centrale des États de l’Afrique de
l’Ouest, BCEAO) in Dakar and Cotonou. Comments on the aide-mémoire from these counterparts were
taken into account in this report.

FINANCIAL DEEPENING IN BENIN
Benin’s economy has grown at a moderate pace in recent years, despite significant external shocks. To sustain
higher growth, financial deepening needs to be strengthened to contribute to the effectiveness of
macroeconomic policies. The ambition to make Benin an emerging market economy requires a greater
contribution from the financial system in support of economic activity. In particular, implementation of the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy for 2011-15 requires a reinforcement of the financial system.
Weaknesses in financial intermediation and lack of effective financial markets are hampering the
transmission of monetary policy, an important tool for macro-stability.
6.
Financial deepening can be defined as the process of increasing depth (financial
intermediation and market turnover), breadth (range of markets and instruments), and reach
(inclusion) of financial systems.7 These dimensions are interlinked and their analysis in a country context
requires assessing the links between the segments of the financial market, the diversity of financial services
and products offered, and the outreach and inclusion capacity of the financial system. Financial inclusion
refers to a state in which a majority of working-age adults have effective access to credit, savings,
payments, and insurance from formal service providers.8 It is an important contributor to sustained

economic development and growth because it provides those instruments to households and enterprises
allowing them to manage the volatility of their income streams, better smooth consumption
intertemporally, diversify risks, and insure against unexpected events. In addition, broad access to payment
means facilitates the exchange of goods and services, and lowers transaction costs for individuals and firms.
7.
Deepening a financial system is a complex undertaking. It is a multi-dimensional process
requiring policy actions that promote the depth, breadth, and reach of the financial system efficiently and
in a consistent way. At the same time, this process requires finding the right balance between development
and stability because financial deepening can potentially pose risks to financial stability through the
generation and transmission of financial shocks. Financial inclusion is also linked to financial stability,
financial integrity, market conduct, and financial education of consumers. Allen and others (2012) find that
“financial sectors of most sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries remain significantly underdeveloped by the
standards of other developing countries.” They also find that “population density appears to be
considerably more important for banking sector development in Africa than elsewhere.”
8.
So where does Benin stand on financial deepening? Four sets of data are used to examine the
depth, breadth, and inclusiveness of Benin’s financial system: the traditional metrics of financial deepening
(broad money and credit to the private sector as percent of GDP); data provided by the BCEAO on access
to financial services; and two World Bank’s databases—FinStats and Findex.

Depth
9.
Traditional metrics indicate that Benin’s financial system has deepened in recent years.
Figures 1 and 2 show that the ratios of broad money and credit to the non-government sector to GDP have
both increased since 2004-05, translating the extent to which Benin has been increasingly making use of
bank services. Compared to other (groups of) countries, the two ratios indicate that Benin underperformed
SSA countries, but performed better than SSA countries when Nigeria and South Africa are excluded.
However, it overperformed two comparable countries (Rwanda and Zambia), and WAEMU countries.9
10.
The relatively stronger depth of Benin’s financial sector is somewhat confirmed by the
benchmarking method underlying the World Bank’s FinStats database. Figures 3a and 3b, generated
from that database, indicate that Benin’s private credit to GDP ratio outperformed the income group
median, and the estimated statistical benchmark, based on its economic and structural characteristics.10
The ratio of domestic bank deposits to GDP outperformed slightly the income group median, but has
come close to its statistical benchmark only recently.

9

Zambia and Rwanda are the only countries with complete series of data, among countries suggested by the World
Bank’s FinStats database as peer countries for Benin, based on GDP per capita and population data.
10

The statistical benchmark is estimated in FinStats by regressing each financial indicator on a set of structural
factors, such as GDP per capita, the square of GDP per capita (to account for potential non-linearities), population
size, population density, the age-dependency ratio, and country-specific factors, such as the presence of an offshore
financial center or the status of being an oil exporter (World Bank, 2012). The number of countries used for the
income group benchmarks varies from 25 to 31 for 2001-10.

Breadth
11.
Available data on the breadth of the financial system indicate that Benin underperforms its income
group and its statistical benchmark. Figure 4a shows the assets of the three largest banks as a share of
assets of all commercial banks to measure bank concentration and to provide an indicator of the
competition in the banking system. For this indicator, Benin is not far from its income group median, but it
underperforms (i.e., higher concentration) its statistical benchmark. Figure 4b presents the ratio between
credit from commercial banks to the government and state-owned enterprises and the GDP. It shows that
Benin’s performance in this area has deteriorated in recent years, with relative higher shares in 2008-09,
compared to the income group median and its statistical benchmark.

Inclusiveness
12.
The BCEAO estimates for 2010 show a mixed picture of financial inclusion in Benin. The
number of deposit accounts in commercial banks relative to the active population (5 percent in 2010)
confirms the relatively low level of access to banking services (Figure 5). Conversely, after including the
number of deposit accounts at MFIs and postal services, Benin becomes the most financially inclusive
country in the WAEMU (Figure 6), with about 28 percent of the population having access to financial
services. The limited supply of banking services is targeted at the high-income urban population. Low
population density, the large size of the informal sector, and limited purchasing power of the population,
contribute to low access to banking services.

13.
The World Bank database (FINDEX) indicates that the level of financial access in Benin is
close to that of other WAEMU countries, but is below that of SSA countries and in comparable
countries outside Africa. The FINDEX database shows that the share of Benin’s population with an
account at a formal financial institution is close to 10 percent, compared to an average of about 22 percent
for SSA countries, 27 percent in the Lao PDR, and 28 percent in Bolivia (Figure 7). The discrepancy between
BCEAO’s and FINDEX’s statistics on Benin occurs because FINDEX considers only ”active” accounts, i.e.,
accounts that have had at least one deposit or one with withdrawal in the past year. Other methodological
differences related to nonbank financial institutions are also at play.

A comprehensive approach to assessing financial inclusion requires assessing also the
quality of financial services. The FINDEX database provides additional insights about usage of financial
services and their quality, as measured by consumer ability to benefit from them. Accordingly, only
7 percent of the active population in 2011 had savings in a formal financial institution in the past
12 months, while 16 percent (a much higher level than in other WAEMU countries) had savings at informal
financial institutions (Figure 8). In addition, 4 percent borrowed from a formal financial institution in the
past 12 months, while 32 percent borrowed from an informal one (Figure 9). The same database indicates
that only 3 percent of the active population used bank accounts to receive their wages, and 5 percent of
those in the bottom 40 percent of income had an account at a formal institution. These statistics would
indicate that Benin has a significant gap to fill in terms of financial inclusion.

Conclusion
15.
In spite of divergences in data from different sources, financial deepening in Benin is
deemed relatively shallow in terms of its breadth and inclusiveness. This is true for the banking sector
and—to a lesser extent—for the microfinance sector. For banks, the low penetration rate reflects
impediments, such as: (i) the institutional framework that discourages banks from taking risks, considering
relatively abundant and lucrative sovereign securities; (ii) difficulties faced by banks in obtaining robust loan
guarantees and enforcing them in cases of default; (iii) the small size of the formal sector, and of the
manufacturing sector in particular; and (iv) the high cost of establishment in non-urban areas. In the
microfinance sector, impediments include (i) lack of suitable management information systems; (ii) lack of
long-term funds for use in similar lending; (iii) a degree of public mistrust in the wake of negative
experiences; and (iv) the cost of serving remote rural areas.

THE BANKING SECTOR
The next two sections show how banks dominate the financial sector in Benin in the volume of operations, but
play a limited role in financial inclusion. Conversely, the microfinance sector, whose overall volume of
financial transactions is small, has the potential to play an important role in increasing financial inclusion.
The banks are making only a modest contribution to Benin's economic development in terms of financial
services to the public. Development of the banking sector is being held back by the relative shortage of
depositors and of solvent borrowers. Obstacles inherent to the business climate, in particular the lack of
protection of creditors' rights, tend to reinforce banks’ reluctance to take risks. Banks' involvement in financing
the economy is also constrained by delays in creating or operationalizing the necessary information
databases, such as a credit bureau, a centralized registry of bad debts, and a central registry of corporate
balance sheets. Other factors that hamper financial intermediation include the limited scope of mechanisms
for guaranteeing collateral and delays in developing electronic financial services.

A. Sector Profile
16.
Commercial banks are the main financial players in Benin. At end-2011, the share of banks in
the financial sector represented more than 90 percent of deposits from, and loans to, the non-government
sector. Twelve banks were operating at end-June 2012, with assets equal to about 50 percent of GDP, half
of which was credit to the non-government sector. The sector is dominated by four banks, which
accounted for close to two-thirds of deposits and loans at end-May 2012 (Table 1). Two of them are
subsidiaries of Pan African banking groups (Bank of Africa Group and Ecobank Transnational Inc.), the other
two are subsidiaries of Nigerian and a French banks, respectively. The eight smaller banks are subsidiaries
of banks or banking groups based in Nigeria (two banks) and other African countries (six banks). Ten banks
are general commercial banks, one bank specializes in mortgage lending, and another, which operates in
each WAEMU country, specializes in financing youth’s projects. At end-2010, 98 percent of the banks were
privately owned and 69 percent foreign owned (Table 2).

Although all banks are privately owned, the regional and national public sectors play a
significant role as borrowers. At end-June 2012, the government provided about 3.5 percent of the
banking system’s deposits and held 20 percent of outstanding bank credit. Government securities
represented 24 percent of banking system assets, of which 10 percent were securities issued by the
government of Benin.
18.

The small size of the formal economy and structural impediments to lending hold back

banking activities. Bankable borrowers are few and sluggish economic activity provides limited
opportunities for lending. This feature is shown in the 65 percent loans-to-deposits ratio over the last two
years, and the concentration of bank loans in the tertiary sector (Table 3). Lending activity is constrained by

multiple institutional and structural impediments in the business environment. In particular, creditor rights
are jeopardized by lengthy and risky legal proceedings, which reinforce banks’ reluctance to take risks by
lending to operators who cannot present first-class guarantees. Banks' financing of the economy is also
constrained by delays in making existing financial information on borrowers effective, timely, and reliable. A
project to set up a credit bureau usable by banks is being prepared by the BCEAO. The current information
infrastructure includes a corporate financial database (Centrale des bilans) and a centralized registry of bad
debts (Centrale des incidents de paiements), which is currently not operational because of a lack of
agreement with the telecommunications company involved. Bankers find information provided by the
corporate financial database in principle useful, but in practice removed from their time-sensitive and
reliable credit-assessment needs. Other factors that hamper bank activities include (i) the limited scope of
existing mechanisms for guaranteeing loans to small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) and for
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BENIN

refinancing mortgage loans; 11 and (ii) unreliable company financial statements, making running credit risk
surveys and developing internal rating systems difficult.
19.
Banks are actively involved in WAEMU sovereign borrowing. Government securities are
attractive to banks for three main reasons: (i) their relatively high yield (around 6 to 7 percent a year, versus
an average union-wide inflation rate of some 3.8 percent), which is tax exempt; (ii) the ease with which
these securities can be refinanced at a low rate (slightly above 3 percent) at the BCEAO; and (iii) “zero
weighting” of WAEMU sovereign risk in the computation of bank solvency, thus requiring no capital
provision and providing a high leverage effect on profitability. As a result, most banks, in particular the
larger ones, which have structural excess liquidity, tend to give preference to buying sovereign securities to
lending to the private sector. In some of the largest banks, the profit derived from sovereign securities
almost measures up to the margin generated by loans to the non-government sector. It is mostly the small
banks, particularly those that do not meet prudential requirements to access the BCEAO’s refinancing
window, that show an interest in lending to customers—but they look for yields higher than what is offered
by government securities.
20.
Competition between banks has not yet affected the level of commission and fees charged
on banking services. Lack of transparency and noncompliance with adequately publishing commissions
and fees contribute to keeping banking services expensive. The World Bank’s FinStats database indicates
that non-interest income to total income ratio reached an average of about 45 percent in Benin over
2001-10, close to the regional and same income-group countries’ averages. The ratio has been on an
increasing trend over the last five years, rising from 42 to 53 percent. This high level of commission and
fees hinders financial inclusiveness and protects the low productivity of the banking sector.
21.
Electronic banking has hardly started, but is being contemplated as a possible tool to
expand access to bank services. Beninese banks offering debit cards are members of the regional
network set up by WAEMU banks, which provides widespread money withdrawal services within Benin and
the union. Mobile banking and electronic banking (“e-banking”) are still in their infancy. Most banks only
offer electronic access to account balances and recent operations, and provide various alerts. The larger
banks are considering leveraging their experience in e-banking in other SSA countries to offer payment
and transfer services in Benin.12

11

One mechanism for guaranteeing loans that is operating in Benin is funded by an international organization
specialized in loan guarantees: the African Guarantee and Cooperation Fund (Fonds Africain de Garantie et de
Coopération Économique, FAGACE). At end-2010, the fund had 34 Beninese projects in its portfolio, with guarantees
amounting to about CFAF 36 billion. A regional financial institution for refinancing mortgage loans (CRRH-UÉMOA)
was launched in 2010. Its first refinancing operation became effective in August 2012.
12

Allen and others, 2012, page 4, find “that the minimum viable banking sector scale is best achieved in major cities,
and that technological advances, such as mobile telephone payments, could be one way to facilitate African financial
development, especially outside metropolitan areas.” Kenya’s experience confirms this finding.

B. The Interbank Market
22.
The interbank market is largely inoperative in spite of the BCEAO’s efforts at the regional
level to provide support. At present, interbank operations are sporadic and based on bilateral
relationships, within a group, or with a counterpart deemed reliable based on subjective criteria. The
current flat interest rate curve and absence of volatility limit the scope of interest-risk-exposure
management and provide no incentive for speculative arbitrage. The overall excess liquidity of banks
(Figure 10) and the large portfolios of sovereign securities, that are relatively easy to refinance at the BCEAO
at a cost lower than the one that would prevail on the interbank market, make it exceptional for banks to
borrow from each other. Banks are reluctant to lend to each other because they do not have access to
recent and reliable financial information, necessary to evaluate counterpart risks. Pressure by the authorities
on banks to improve financial information dissemination seems low, maybe because of the fear of bankruns that could be triggered by public awareness of the actual situation of some ailing banks. This situation
underscores the urgent need for effective bank supervision, prompt remedial action for troubled banks,
and rapid bank resolution mechanisms, which are prerequisites for building confidence between banks and
promoting an effective interbank market.

The BCEAO is currently implementing infrastructure reforms for the regional interbank
market. It set up an automated interbank clearing system (SICA-WAEMU) in 2008, and established a new
certification mechanism for the real-time payment and settlement system (STAR-WAEMU) in 2009. In
parallel, it launched an information campaign for the banking community on the benefits of operating on
the interbank market. Standardizing repurchase (“repo”) contracts among banks is also under
consideration, after significant legal work has been completed. Substantial progress also has been reported
in developing a technical platform, which is being tested (IMFa, 2012, ¶19).

C. Macro-Financial Linkages
24.
Important macro-financial linkages exist between the cotton and the banking sectors. The
cotton sector has been the foundation of rural and agro-industrial economies. Cotton has historically
played a dominant role in Beninese exports and represented a large fraction of GDP. Although its
importance has declined significantly, it continues to employ a large part of the rural population—it is a
source of direct income for 300,000 people (5 percent of the rural work force) and of indirect income for
many more. Cotton is mostly produced on small family plots, and is grown by farmers with little to no
access to the financial system. Nonetheless, the banking sector is heavily involved in cotton production,
because banks provide seasonal credit (crédit de campagne). Until this year, banks typically provided credit
to ginners. Separately, but financed by cotton export sales, ginners made loans at the beginning of the
planting season to farmers to purchase seed, fertilizer, and other items. The loans are repaid when farmers
deliver their harvest to the ginners. In the current campaign, the government has taken on the organization
of the cotton campaign and has contracted a large syndicated loan (about 10 percent of 2011 credit to the
private sector) from eight banks at commercial rates. Banks' financial performance is thus closely linked to
the performance of the cotton sector. Microfinance institutions are also involved in making loans to
farmers. Box 3 and Appendix II of the companion staff report analyze the cotton sector in detail.
25.
The interrelations between Nigeria and Benin are critically important for Benin. Trade and
financial relations between the two countries proceed through the following channels:


Fuel prices and subsidies. About 85 percent of the gasoline sold in Benin is smuggled from
Nigeria; trade estimates suggest that about half of imports going through the Port of Cotonou
are destined for Nigeria.



Remittances. Nigeria is an important destination for emigrants from Benin and an important
source of remittances, although data are not available.



Banking relations. Three Nigerian banks operate in Benin. They hold about 20 percent of total
deposits and provide a similar share of total credit. Banks in Benin derive significant fees from
CFA franc/naira exchange operations, which fuel a largely cash-based informal trade and
facilitate inflows of remittances.

A change in trade or economic policies in Nigeria would affect the volume and the composition of trade
and be a source of financial stress to the Beninese banking system.

THE MICROFINANCE SECTOR
The microfinance sector in Benin has grown exponentially over the last decade. The sector plays a
limited role in financial intermediation, given its small dimensions and funding base. It has, however, a
significant potential for channeling increased financial resources to micro and small enterprises (MSEs)
that currently have almost no access to formal financial services.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

A. Sector Profile
26.
The microfinance sector in Benin plays both a systemic and a strategic role for economic
growth. The exact size of the sector is unknown. A survey conducted in 2011 inventoried 721 MFIs
operating in the country. Of these, only 226 are currently licensed. The authorities estimate, however, that
the licensed institutions represent about 90 percent of the whole sector in terms of financial volume.
Although the volume of deposits and loans is modest, compared to that of banks, the sector has a systemic
importance because of the number of people using it. It also plays a strategic role in channeling financial
resources to sectors of the economy that are underserved by banks and in providing financial services to
the underserved rural population. At end-2011, licensed MFIs served more than 1.5 million customers,
compared to an active population of some 4.5 million. They held about 5 percent of the deposits and
provided close to 9 percent of the loans of the whole financial system (Tables 4 and 5). The sector is highly
concentrated, because a small number of licensed MFIs account for the vast majority of all loans of the
sector. The biggest MFI has close to one half of the sector’s total number of clients. The core activity of
MFIs is microcredit, their loans ranging from CFAF 20,000 to CFAF 5 million (about US$40 to US$10,000).

27.
Two main business models exist for MFIs. The first category involves ”savings and credit
institutions” and the second, “direct credit institutions.”13 The two largest MFIs belong each to one of these
categories. MFIs belonging to the first category are more likely to have a substantial part of their loan
portfolio dedicated to group lending, while MFIs belonging to the second category tend to privilege
individual lending and provide, in general, higher loan amounts. In both cases, loan maturity is usually one
year, and interest rates depend on the specific circumstances, varying from 1 percent to 2 percent a month
(on the remaining capital). Almost all loans are linked to income-generating activities and only a small
percentage of loans are for consumption. It is noteworthy that institutions of the second type are now
aggressively campaigning for savings mobilization, because they have realized that this can be an
important source of additional funding. This converges the two main business models and fosters a
beneficial competition among MFIs for attracting deposits, especially in urban areas where their presence is
stronger.14
28.
Data for the microfinance sector indicate robust reach but also vulnerabilities. The number of
deposit accounts at end-2010 was 1,508,037 for a total amount of deposits of CFAF 57.7 billion and loans
of CFAF 83.5 billion. Nonperforming loans represented 7.2 percent of total loans. Prudential ratios and
performance indicators at end-2010 show that the sector as whole was in compliance with all but one
regulatory norms (Table 6). These indicators hide, however, diversities among the MFIs. Only 39 percent of
licensed MFIs were respecting the minimum capital/assets ratio and only 58 percent were in compliance
with the minimum liquidity ratio. These numbers highlight the vulnerability of the sector and the need to
strengthen supervision.

B. Constraints Facing the Sector
29.
After a phase of ―promotion‖ that has significantly expanded the reach of the microfinance
sector, it is now time to focus on its consolidation and strategic reorientation. It is important to look
at the sector not only as a social development tool for the poor, but also as a development tool that could
play a crucial role in supporting productive sectors of the economy (i.e., MSEs). The following sections focus
on impediments to financial deepening, including (i) data and information constraints; (ii) structural
constraints; and (iii) institutional and regulatory constraints. If these constraints are removed, the sector
could contribute significantly to economic growth.

Data and information constraints
30.
Consolidation and reorientation of the microfinance sector necessitate robust data to
formulate a strategy and quantify objectives. This would also help the private sector to adapt the design
and delivery of financial services. Unfortunately, the availability of data on financial inclusion (e.g., access
and usage of financial services; rural versus urban areas; credit to households versus MSEs) and on other
key statistics for the sector (e.g., market shares, transaction volumes, number of non-licensed MFIs) is
sporadic and sometimes inconsistent. Institutions involved in data collection fail to provide timely and
accurate data. Although the information provided by the 2011 survey on MFIs is useful (as it is rare to know
the number and location of institutions providing financial services in the informal economy), it is
insufficient, because the number of customers served and the volumes managed by these informal MFIs
are relatively unknown.

Structural constraints
31.
The microfinance sector lacks a ―financing culture‖ for micro, small, and medium-size
enterprises (MSMEs), which constitute the bulk of the productive sector in terms of the number of
enterprises. There is no commonly agreed on definition distinguishing categories within MSMEs in Benin,
nor a clear strategy on how to engage MSMEs financially. The 2012 World Economic Forum’s report on
global competitiveness shows that “lack of access to finance” is indicated by enterprises as the second most
important obstacle to doing business in Benin, after corruption. The whole “meso-finance” segment is
financially uncovered in Benin,15 giving rise to the “missing middle” where commercial banks do not have
incentives to “downscale” their operations, and most MFIs do not have the technical and financial capacity
to “upscale” theirs (Figure 11).16

15

“Meso-Finance” is the term often used to describe the financial needs of the “missing middle,” which is
represented by the financing gap affecting those MSEs whose financing needs are above those offered by the
traditional microfinance providers, but below the level of services offered by commercial banks (Sanders, T. and
Wegener C., 2006).
16

Allen and others, 2012, page 6, note that generally “most established commercial banks view the sectors targeted
by MFIs as “unbankable.”

32.
As in many other LICs, the lack of long-term resources is restraining the microfinance sector
in Benin. The sector’s main sources of financing come from savings mobilization (70 percent of total
sector-wide resources), financial support from the government (20 percent), and loans from commercial
banks (10 percent). Savings mobilization is necessary, but it does not provide sufficient resources to finance
investments in the medium-to-long term. Public support, provided mainly through the national fund for
microcredit (NFM, Fonds National de Microcrédit), could represent an important source of medium-term
resources, but most of the funds provided through this channel are directed to very low-income
households at highly subsidized rates and not to productive investment (Box 1). The limited links of MFIs
with the banking sector—banks have few incentives to engage the formal microfinance sector because of
the perceived risks—hamper the efficacy of monetary policy transmission, because monetary impulses do
not reach the large client base served by MFIs.
Box 1. Benin: National Fund for Microcredit
The National Fund for Microcredit (NFM) was established in 2006 and began operating in February
2007. It is a public entity under the Ministry of Microfinance, Youth Employment, and Women. NFM’s
objective is to strengthen the financial and operational capacities of MFIs to provide financial services
to the population, farmers, and entrepreneurs. The NFM essentially:



Provides microcredit to the poorest households of the population;



Finances agricultural activities in rural areas;



Supports MFIs through refinancing; and



Provides institutional support and capacity building to MFIs.

The FNM’s resources come mainly from government contributions; external donors’ and development
partners’ contributions in the form of refinancing and lines of credit; and other grants and subsidies.
Credit to the poorest households represents the bulk of NFM’s activities. It absorbed over 90 percent
of total NFM financing between 2007 and 2011, and reached over 800.000 beneficiaries. This activity
has a repayment record of 84 percent.

33.
Lack of adequate incentives for rural finance. Benin is a predominantly rural economy.
Agricultural finance should thus play a key role in promoting economic growth, but at present even MFIs
have little incentive to reach out to underserved rural areas. Yet, MFIs have the comparative advantage of
operating proximity-type financing through instruments varying from seasonal loans tailored to agricultural
cycles, to investments in mobile money technologies. These technologies in fact flourish in many LICs, and
in particular in Southern and Eastern Africa. They allow people in remote rural areas to transfer, cash-in, and
cash-out money. The potential for Benin to exploit mobile technologies is high because of the large
number of mobile phones in use (Figure 12). A couple of commercial banks are currently piloting such
services, but only for their clients. A few large MFIs have also started to invest in this technological new
frontier.17

34.
Lack of adequate deposit protection. Although financial amounts processed by MFIs are a small
proportion of those processed by commercial banks, their relative importance for low-income customers is
substantial and requires adequate protection. The systemic importance of over 1.5 million depositors
requires adequate measures to preserve the stability of the microfinance system. A project setting up a
deposit guarantee fund (fonds de garantie des dépôts) is currently under discussion at the union level. Its
implementation should be preceded by enhanced supervision.
35.
Lack of adequate financial education. Financial education is important for clients of any financial
institution, because it contributes to consumer protection. Financial education in Benin needs to be scaled
up, and this is especially important for low-income clients whose exposure to fraudulent financial practices
can have a significant impact on income. The government has an important role in supporting MFIs in
conducting financial education campaigns to promote transparency and boost public confidence in
financial services and products.

17

In Kenya, the launching of a nation-wide mobile phone plan was financially helped by an external donor.
Elsewhere, mobile phone companies were able to do the same with their own resources and were able to recoup the
initial fixed cost. In Benin, the largest MFI (FECECAM) offers instant money transfer service by mobile phone.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BENIN

36.
Excessive market concentration and lack of competition. As noted earlier, the microfinance
sector is highly concentrated. Most MFIs operate in urban centers, leaving most rural areas either financially
uncovered or under the monopoly of a single MFI. 18 Promoting competition in rural areas by offering
incentives to institutions to open a branch in underserved areas could be an effective way of serving two
purposes: lowering the cost of services to final beneficiaries and promoting economic activity in rural zones.

Institutional and regulatory constraints
37.
Limitation on activities other than savings and loans. The prudential regulations applicable to
MFIs, defined by the BCEAO at the union level and promulgated as a national law in Benin by the president
in March 2012, constitute a major step forward in strengthening supervision and the stability of the
microfinance sector. However, the law imposes a 5 percent limit on operations other than deposit
collection and loan extension, which significantly curtails options for MFIs to engage in new services, such
as microinsurance and money transfer. While there is merit in keeping MFIs focused on savings and loans,
excessive concentration on these two activities unnecessarily prevents the MFIs from venturing into new
areas where they have a comparative advantage and can make a contribution to economic activity.
Providing microinsurance and money transfer services is usually a profitable “niche” activity for MFIs, whose
earnings allow risk diversification, reach critical mass, and spread overhead costs.
38.
Weakness of the business environment and of the judiciary. Shortcomings in the business
environment limit financial intermediation. The World Bank’s Doing Business Indicators suggests that the
overall cost of doing business in Benin is higher than the corresponding average cost in SSA. The legal and
judicial environment is a factor of significant uncertainty for banks and MFIs willing to provide loans to the
private sector. The lack of clarity on property rights, lack of land titles, and the uncertain status of
certificates of land occupation sometimes used in lieu of land titles, all have a negative impact on safe
collaterals, and hence makes financial institutions hesitant to provide credit, unless the borrower can
provide exceptional guarantees.
39.
Lack of adequate management information systems. Most MFIs’ information systems are
rudimentary and preclude timely transmission of data between headquarters and field offices. The new
regulatory and supervisory requirements imposed by the microfinance law imply that MFIs should be able
to collect accurate and timely information for their own management and internal control purposes, as well
as for transmission to the supervisory authorities. Investment in upgrading information systems is a
necessity. Adequate information systems would in turn facilitate the enhancement of the union-wide
borrower risk registry (Centrale des risques). In addition to this project, which may take some time to
materialize, Benin has implemented a credit registry at the national level, managed by a private company,
with participation from most licensed MFIs. The registry shares information on microfinance borrowers
(Box 2).
18

No recent data could be obtained on the checking services of the Postal Office (Centre de chèques postaux). Given
their capillary distribution over the territory, they have good access to the rural population. They could be energized
to reach out and provide enhanced financial services. Currently, these services are not considered as financial ones
and therefore are not regulated by the financial sector supervisory authorities.

Box 2. Benin: Credit Registry
The credit registry for the exchange of risk information (Centrale d'échange d'informations sur le risque
crédit des institutions financières), was established in January 2012 by ALAFIA, the professional
association of MFIs, with five other members. The registry aims at increasing access of MSMEs to credit,
securitizing MFIs’ portfolios, and developing the financial sector in Benin.
The registry is managed by a private Beninese company, headquartered in Cotonou. Its services are
offered to MFIs, banks, and other financial institutions, but are currently used only by participating
MFIs. The services include credit reporting, history of loan repayment, and history of residential
addresses.

40.
Lack of adequate professional skills in MFIs. MFIs provide financial services, which require
adequate professional skills. This means that MFI personnel need to have basic banking knowledge,
augmented by specific skills tuned to the peculiarities of microfinance operations. The professional
association of MFIs (ALAFIA) can play an important role by offering specialized training and classes. It is also
important that MFI personnel understand the new legislation and the related requirements.
41.
Limited diversity in financial services and products. Benin’s microfinance services, as in most
WAEMU countries, are insufficiently diversified to satisfy the financing needs of the economy. Only the
largest MFIs are able to offer a wider range of saving products (e.g., current and savings accounts and term
deposits at different maturities) and of loan products (e.g., specialized loans to government employees,
military personnel, women, students). Other basic products, like micro-insurance and mobile money
transfer, are not common. More sophisticated financial products, such as leasing, factoring, venture capital,
and investment capital (which could provide alternatives to bank financing) are almost inexistent.

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
Benin’s other financial institutions are few and have a marginal role in financial deepening.
42.
Benin has two pension funds. The pension system is composed of two entities: one for
permanent civil servants (Fonds national de retraite du Bénin, FNRB) and a second one for private sector
employees and contractual civil servants (Caisse nationale de sécurité sociale, CNSS).


The FNRB is a public entity whose financial operations are embedded in the government’s
budget. It has limited power in managing and allocating its financial resources. A reform to
strengthen the sustainability of the fund is under preparation, with involvement of all
stakeholders.



The CNSS is an autonomous entity with a management board composed of nine representatives
of employers, employees, and the government (three for each constituency). Its resources
essentially come from employees’ and employers’ contributions, and from investment in real
estate and financial assets. Management decisions to allocate assets is supervised by a board.
CNSS’s net operating results have been positive since 2007, increasing from CFAF 17 billion in
2007 to CFAF 47 billion in 2011. These positive results are mostly due to the raising of the

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BENIN

retirement age in 2007 from 55 to 60 years. Net results are expected to start declining in 2013,
when the bulk of those who were 55 in 2007 will be retiring. According to CNSS’s by-laws, an
actuarial evaluation has to be updated every five years. The main constraints currently faced by
the CNSS are: (i) finishing the review of the regulatory framework; (ii) upgrading the information
system; (iii) strengthening human resources trough training and new recruitment; and
(iv) granting some flexibility to the management team in the allocation of the investment
portfolio. As a provider of financial services for long-term savings and risk sharing, a more
flexible allocation of CNSS’s portfolio would contribute to financial market deepening.
43.
The insurance industry is small and dominated by non-life insurers. Total turnover of the
industry was about CFAF 34 billion (1 percent of GDP) in 2010. There are six non-life insurers and six life
insurers in Benin. All insurers, except three, belong to large international financial groups.19 Non-life insurers
generate a large part of the industry’s turnover, but their market share declined from 78 percent in 2006 to
71 percent in 2010. Both life and non-life insurers have been profitable over the last five years. Industry
investment appears to be conservative, thus limiting insurers’ exposure to market risk. In 2010, the
industry’s assets were composed of bank deposits (36 percent); African Conference of Insurance Markets
(ACIM) members’ bonds (31 percent);20 real assets (16 percent); shares in other companies (12.5 percent);
and other assets (4.5 percent). The share of Beninese government bonds (about 5 percent) held by
Beninese insurers is far lower than similar assets held by Beninese banks. The insurance industry in Benin is
governed by ACIM’s regulatory framework. The supervision is jointly performed by the Ministry of
Economy and Finance (MOFE) and an ACIM commission.
44.
The insurance industry is shallow. The insurance penetration rate (number of insured people to
total population) for life insurance increased from 0.2 percent in 2006 to 0.3 percent in 2010. For non-life
insurance, the rate was about 0.7 percent during the same period. To improve penetration, insurers have
recommended to require mandatory insurance for two-wheel vehicles, residential buildings, and execution
of public contracts.

FINANCIAL SUPERVISION
Financial supervision, divided between the union and Benin, is complex and needs strengthening.

A. Bank Supervision
45.
Regulatory and supervisory functions are vested in the BCEAO and WAEMU’s banking
commission (BC-WAEMU). License attribution and disciplinary decisions made by BC-WAEMU are
announced to concerned banks by decrees of the minister of finance of the member country where the
bank is located. The minister may appeal decisions of BC-WAEMU to the union’s Council of Ministers.

19

Beninese nationals hold majority shares in the other three insurance companies.

20

Beninese insurers are authorized to buy bonds issued by ACIM member countries (the 14 countries of the WAEMU
and the Central African Economic and Monetary Union (Communauté Économique et Monétaire de l’Afrique Centrale,
CEMAC). Details on the issuers of ACIM members’ bonds held by Beninese insurers are not available.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

BENIN

46.
Developments in Benin’s banking sector call for stronger bank resolution mechanisms. Two
banks have been insolvent for years without being resolved and have embarked on aggressive deposit
collection to cover their operating losses. For one of them, a provisional administrator has been appointed
with a mandate to restructure the bank and approach potential investors. The second bank has recorded
losses ever since it has started operations. Its recapitalization by the regional, intergovernmental
development bank (Banque Ouest-Africaine de Développement, BOAD) is under consideration and a
restructuring plan is being devised. A third bank, which had been insolvent for several years, was closed in
March 2012 and is being liquidated. Long delays in resolving banks with negative equity damage the
reputation of the whole banking system and the credibility of banking supervision.
47.
Consolidated supervision within WAEMU needs to be developed. Three banks in Benin are
controlled by holding companies incorporated in other WAEMU countries and one bank operates as a
branch of a bank incorporated in another union country and that has benefited from the “single union
license” procedure. The BC-WAEMU holds supervisory power over banks and branches of holding
companies operating in a WAEMU country. However, no prudential framework applies to the holding
companies themselves, and the BC-WAEMU does not deliver licenses to these holding companies. Its
supervisory power is exercised through receiving and analyzing quarterly reports of each bank and holding
company, followed by on-site inspections if deemed necessary.
48.
Cross-border information sharing and supervision remains generally limited, although eight
banks are operating in Benin as subsidiaries of foreign financial holding companies headquartered
outside the WAEMU. International cooperation between home and host authorities is currently vested in
the BC-WAEMU. The current cross-border cooperation operates mostly in cases where there is a need to
get a non-objection letter of the home country when a foreign bank applies for a license. No periodic
common analysis is run by supervisory entities on the strategies, risk exposures, and regulatory
requirements of involved banking groups.

B. Prudential Norms and Bank Soundness Indicators
49.
There has been a gradual improvement in compliance with prudential norms since 2009
(Table 7). Nevertheless, there is also significant forebearance. Two banks (holding about 4 percent of bank
deposits) are noncompliant with virtually all prudential norms and have negative capital. Two other banks
face difficulty in complying with the liquidity and the asset transformation norms and have been benefiting
from a transitory derogation to allow them to restore their compliance. All banks have been systematically
missing the structure-of-portfolio norm, which requires that 60 percent of total loans be extended to
borrowers rated by the BCEAO as eligible to refinancing.

Compliance with the regulatory prudential norms raises a number of observations:



Long-term resources. Banks’ transformation capacity is hindered by the scarcity of medium- and
long-term resources, which currently come only from shareholders’ equity funds and
institutional investors’ time-deposits. Accordingly, banks have had difficulty in meeting the
regulatory ratio requiring that not less than 75 percent of their medium- and long-term loans be
funded by similar resources.



Credit concentration. The regulatory framework encourages excessive credit concentration.
Current regulation caps lending to a single borrower at 75 percent of regulatory capital, a very

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

BENIN

high limit by international standards (typically 20-25 percent).21 Loans thus tend to be
concentrated on a small number of large borrowers (mostly utility companies), raising the
potential for systemic risk if a large common borrower falters or is hit by an adverse shock. At
end-2011, the five largest borrowers accounted for about 60 percent of the banking systems’
regulatory capital.


Borrower qualification. None of the banks meet the ratio requiring that no less than 60 percent
of their credit portfolio be made up of credits rated by BCEAO as eligible for its refinancing. This
situation seems to be a union-wide feature of all the banks and explain the authorities’
forbearance regarding the nonrespect of this ratio. This general infringement of the regulation
likely has to do with (i) the limited size of the formal economy, which makes it difficult to find
borrowers meeting the requirement of providing reliable financial statements using appropriate
accounting standards; and (ii) the lack of incentives for banks to incur administrative costs to
determine eligibility while they have a large and easy access to BCEAO refinancing for their
stocks of government securities.



Deposit concentration. The excessive weight of a small number of large depositors makes some
banks vulnerable. For instance, a withdrawal of funds by large institutional depositors, such as
the private sector social security fund, could have a major impact on some banks. This deposit
concentration risk is not captured by the prudential norms.

51.
The soundness of the Beninese banking system has improved over the last few years
(Table 8).22 The capital adequacy ratios for the sector as a whole have exceeded the norm of 8 percent since
2010, and credit concentation on the five largest borrowers of each bank has declined gradually since 2007
to 60 percent at end 2011. However, gross NPLs to total loans have been in the range of 16-17 percent
since 2009, a relatively high level compared to other SSA countries (Figure 13).23 At the same time,
provisions for NPLs were maintained in the range of 55-65 percent. The profitability of the banking sector,
measured in terms of return on equity turned positive in 2007 and has gradually increased since then,
reaching 14 percent in 2011. It has approached the corresponding average in SSA countries in the last two
years.

21

Some argue that in small markets these international standards should not have full sway.

22

IMFa, 2012, presents the same table for WAEMU’s consolidated banking system for 2006-10. Appendix IV of the
report quoted presents an analysis on union-wide financial deepening in the same period.
23

Of 28 SSA countries for which data on NPLs are available for 2011, only two (Liberia and Mali) had a ratio of NPLs
to total deposits higher than Benin. The high NPL ratios in Benin are explained in part by the obligation for banks to
keep NPLs in their books until the end of long judiciary proceedings, regardless of the likelihood of the assets’
recovery. For this reason, NPL write-offs are rare, and banks keep adding new NPLs to the stock of old ones. The low
flow of NPLs gives a more relevant view of the actual risk and explains the relatively high return on equity.

Although financial soundness indicators suggest that the sector as a whole is in relative
good health, a number of risks are not captured by these indicators:


24

Asset concentration. The risk inherent in asset concentration in government securities is not
reflected by the solvency ratios because these assets are zero-weighted regardless of their
actual underlying creditworthiness. Banks intensively engaged in the primary securities market
have a high leverage and a strong capital adequacy ratio. The uniform application of zero-risk
weighting to all sovereign assets leads to an overestimation of the apparent solvency of the
banks in comparison with the solvency that would be derived from the methods recommended
by the Basel II approach for risk weighting.24

The BCEAO is considering moving to the Basel II regulatory framework in the future (IMFa, 2012, ¶27).



Liquidity ratios. These ratios can give a more favorable impression of the situation than is
actually the case. Two specific bank practices contribute to this. First, with belated payments on
loans to beneficiaries of government contract, resulting from delays in government payments to
borrowers, banks do not systematically downgrade the quality of the loans concerned. Second,
overdrafts are routinely extended, and loans are often restructured in such a manner that allows
them to continue to be classified as liquid assets, while in reality they are frozen assets.25



Counterpart risk. Claims on financial institutions are attributed a risk weight of 20 percent,
regardless of the actual credit-worthiness of each institution. This Basel I approach is
inconsistent with newer, risk-based supervision, and does not incite banks to assess their
counterpart-risk exposures adequately.

25

This practice also underestimates NPLs.

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BENIN

53.
The soundness indicators for the sector as a whole hide large disparities across banks. For
instance, the relatively high capital adequacy ratio in Benin is largely attributable to the four largest banks.
These highly leveraged banks had a return on equity above 20 percent, while new banks are still barely
profitable. The largest banks hold large portfolios of government securities and re-invest the proceeds
from these portfolios in similar securities. This practice results in an increase in these banks’ leverage, which
thus boosts their return on equity.

C. Supervision of the Microfinance Sector
54.
The microfinance sector has a complex oversight system. Multiple entities are involved in
licensing, regulating, supervising, and promoting the sector. The MOFE has the right to license an MFI, after
a qualified opinion is issued by the BCEAO. Progress in licensing MFIs has been, however, quite slow since
2005 (Figure 14). The supervision of the sector is under the responsibility of the MOFE, which exercises it
through a special unit in charge of decentralized financial entities (Cellule de surveillance des structures
financières décentralisées, CSSFD). The BCEAO, through its national branch in Cotonou, and the BC-WAEMU
perform the supervision of MFIs with deposits or loans exceeding CFAF 2 billion. The promotion of the
sector is the responsibility of the Ministry of Microfinance, Youth Employment, and Women. This ministry
elaborates and oversees the implementation of the national strategy for the development of the
microfinance sector. ALAFIA provides inputs on the regulation and promotion of the sector to protect the
interests of its members. Several donors are also involved in the financing of the sector or specific MFIs.

The
authorities regard the strengthening of the regulation and supervision of the microfinance sector as
a priority. The National Assembly adopted a new law, transposed from a union-wide regulatory framework
for MFIs, in January 2012 in the wake of the rapid expansion of the sector and the emergence of fraudulent
financial schemes. The framework tightens the conditions for creating an MFI, and gives enhanced
supervisory powers to the MOFE and the BC-WAEMU.26

26

“To prevent a re-emergence of Ponzi schemes, the government created a committee for financial stability and
rationalization of the microfinance sector (Comité de Stabilité Financière et d’Assainissement du Secteur de la

56.
Limited supervisory capacity and effectiveness. Efforts are under way to help unauthorized MFIs
to meet the criteria required for obtaining a license. The sector has gone through a serious crisis in
2010 because of illegal Ponzi-type schemes (Box 3). The reputational risk associated with these
unauthorized financial intermediaries is thus high, and it undermines consumer confidence in the
microfinance system.
Box 3. Benin: Ponzi Schemes
Financial Ponzi schemes (i.e., entities engaging in scams and fraudulent financial operations) began
operating at the end of 2006 and attracted deposits from the general public with the promise of high
returns. The first and the largest of these schemes—Investment Consultancy and Computing Services,
ICCS—collapsed in June 2010. The collapse caused some social tensions. Similar fraudulent schemes
collapsed later, causing further social tensions.
Fraud developed in the informal financial sector starting with unauthorized deposit taking entities. These
entities, which took various names and legal forms, did not state that taking deposits was their principal
purpose. They took advantage of the existence of widespread financial cooperative practices in the
informal economy (i.e., savings clubs called “tontines”) and thus the public was receptive to seemingly
lucrative returns offered by these informal institutions.
Illegally collected funds were estimated at CFAF 161 billion (14.7 percent of the deposits of the
authorized MFIs and banks), but the total amount of the deposits taken illegally may have been much
higher. These funds came from about 150.000 depositors. The average deposit was around CFAF
500,000. Collected deposits were initially used to pay high interest to depositors to entice large-scale
deposit collection. Later, some of the deposits were diverted to fraudulent purposes.
The authorities responded to the emergency by appointing an interministerial crisis committee and
seizing the assets of the entities and of their managers, some of whom were arrested. Funds deposited
by the illegal entities in banks amount to about CFAF 8 billion and have been frozen by the authorities.
In addition, about 120 vehicles and some real estate, whose value has yet to be estimated, were seized.
It is also possible that some of the funds invested in businesses may be recouped. The authorities’ intent
is to refund depositors with the proceed from these collection efforts.
The collapse of these schemes had limited impact on the banking system, where deposits continued to

THE GOVERNMENT SECURITIES MARKET
The regional government securities market has evolved positively since its establishment in 2001 and
has been regularly used by Benin over the last seven years. The market has two alternative issuance
methods. There is no secondary market in government securities. The regional authorities face the
challenge to enhance the depth and the functioning of the market, notably through redirecting the
market to long-term maturities, improving issuance predictability and coordination, and creating an
effective secondary market.
57.
Benin has been active on the primary regional government securities market since 2005. At
end-June 2012, outstanding treasury bills (T-bills) and T-bonds issued by Benin through the central bank
(auction) amounted to CFAF 225.2 billion and CFAF 98.8 billion, respectively. All T-bills were of one-year
maturity, with an interest rate of 5.8 to 6.5 percent. T-bonds issued so far have had 7 to 10 years of
maturity, with an interest rate of 5.5 to 6.5 percent. Of the outstanding securities issued by Benin through
auctions, Beninese banks held CFAF 188 billion (58 percent) at end-June 2012. Beninese banks also held
CFAF 263 billion worth of securities issued by other WAEMU governments.27
58.
The securities market is characterized by the existence of two alternative issuance methods.
Securities issuance can be done by auction through the BCEAO or by syndication through the CREPMF.
Auctions have several advantages over syndication: (i) they are more transparent and cost the issuing
government less; and (ii) auctioned securities are accepted as collateral in monetary policy operations. At
end-June 2012, Benin had an outstanding debt of 68 billion (17 percent of total securities) from T-bonds
issued through syndication in 2011, at 6.5 percent a year and with a 6-year maturity.
59.
The securities market is beset by a number of weaknesses. These include limited-term
structure, uncoordinated security issuance schedules, and absence of an effective secondary market that
could reduce the cost of borrowing.


Limited-term structure. Issued securities are concentrated in short-term maturities. Unlike T-bills,
T-bonds are of limited interest to banks, owing to their longer maturities. Banks have a
preference for investing in T-bills because they offer an attractive yield on relatively short
maturities, are considered risk-free in the calculation of the solvency ratio, and are accepted as

27

Benin’s issuance of private corporate bonds and shares on the regional financial market (based in Abidjan) is
limited. Only one Beninese company is listed on the stock market and there have been only four issuances of private
corporate bonds so far, totaling CFAF 37 billions, of which CFAF 4 billion was outstanding at end-September 2010
(last available information). However, Beninese asset management companies operate actively as intermediaries on
the regional financial market. Data provided by the Regional Council for Public Savings and Financial Markets
(Conseil Régional de l’Épargne Publique et des Marchés Financiers, CREPMF) indicate that Beninese asset management
companies held CFAF 476 billion of public and private bonds in their portfolios at end-September 2010.

collateral in refinancing operations with the BCEAO. Purchases of medium- and long-term
T-bonds are also made difficult by the prudential regulation on maturity transformation.28


Uncoordinated security issuance schedules. Governments are required to provide a schedule of
planned issuances to the BCEAO at the beginning of each year. The schedules are, however, not
binding nor coordinated among members.



Absence of an effective secondary market. Such a market is practically inexistent. Limited interest
in it is due largely to the above-noted structural excess liquidity at banks, and the lack of
infrastructure and a legal framework needed to secure transactions in such a market. The
establishment of a regulatory framework for primary dealers and repurchase operations (repos)
could contribute to the development of this market.

60.
The BCEAO is considering reforms to strengthen the operations of the regional securities
market. These reforms include producing reliable annual schedules of government securities issuance;
issuing all securities by auction; putting in place a network of primary dealers; establishing a legal
framework for repos; promoting foreign participation; and setting up a government securities issuance
coordination committee under the authority of the union’s Council of Ministers.

CHALLENGES TO MACROECONOMIC POLICY
The shallowness of financial markets in the WAEMU does not overly constrain fiscal policy in Benin,
but it offers little traction to monetary policy.
61.
Government financing is not overly constrained by the shallowness of Benin’s financial
sector because of the existence of a liquid regional market. There is currently no explicit ceiling on how
much government securities a WAEMU member may issue through auction or syndication. The union’s
monetary policy committee may, however, impose a limit on new issuances by union members through
the BCEAO. But even this constraint is not fully binding, because a government might still issue bonds
through syndication. The real limit seems to be in the absorptive capacity of the regional market. This
capacity is not unlimited and thus it could be tested in case a government needed to finance a large need
quickly, in response, say, to an unexpected shock. The test would be even more severe if several
governments were confronted with simultaneous shocks. Moreover, Benin’s T-bonds are mostly acquired
by domestic banks, which also have a limited absorptive capacity.29 This likely stems from external
investor’s low confidence in Benin’s long-term securities. A significant shift to long-term bonds could
potentially crowd out private sector lending.
62.
The existing empirical evidence is consistent with the view that there are strong a priori
reasons to believe that monetary transmission may be both weak and unreliable in shallow financial
systems, like in Benin. A survey of empirical evidence completed by Mishra and Montiel (2012) concluded
28

The prudential regulation requires banks to cover at least 75 percent of their long-term assets with long-term
resources (of two years minimum).
29

Almost all T-bonds issued through auction and outstanding at end-June 2012 were held by Beninese banks.

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BENIN

that there was very weak evidence for the effectiveness of monetary transmission in LICs in SSA, whether an
interest rate or the monetary base is considered to be the policy variable and whether identification of the
monetary policy shock is achieved through recursive or structural means. A study by Saxegaard (2006) on
excessive liquidity and effectiveness of monetary policy in the CEMAC, Nigeria, and Uganda, found that
involuntary excess liquidity (which is calculated as total excess liquidity minus estimated excess liquidity
held for precautionary purposes) weakened the monetary policy transmission mechanism in those
countries, and thus the ability of monetary authorities to influence demand conditions in those countries. In
the context of the WAEMU, Samaké’s study on Benin (2010) concluded that excess bank liquidity lowers
the effectiveness of monetary policy instruments through the credit channel. A recent study conducted by
Ouedraogo (2011) on WAEMU countries reached the conclusion that bank concentration negatively
affected credit supply and constrained the transmission of monetary policy in the union.
63.
Bank lending rates in Benin do not seem to be sensitive to changes in policy rates. Figure 15
shows that the two policy rates were revised down only two times since January 2009 (in June 2009 and
May 2012). The short-term interest rate on the money market (not shown in Figure 15 because too close to
the minimum rate of auctions) remained between the two policy rates and the minimum rate of auctions.
The recent changes in policy rates did not seem to have a notable impact on the average bank lending
rate, which has remained in the range of 10.8-12.3 percent since January 2009. This observation is thus
consistent with the empirical evidence presented above. However, it would need to be firmed up through a
more thorough analysis and over a longer period.
64.
Several factors limit the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission in Benin. The
monetary transmission mechanism, i.e., the channels trough which monetary policy actions are transmitted
to the ultimate objective of the policy, depends on two links: one between monetary policy actions and the
availability and cost of bank credit; and another link between the availability and cost of bank loans and
aggregate credit demand. In the context of Benin, these linkages seem to be weak because of the following
factors:



Structural excess liquidity. Excess liquidity in the Beninese banking sector was around
CFAF 37 billion (3.4 percent of bank deposits) on average during June 2009-June 2012
(Figure 10). In such a context, availability of liquidity is not a constraining factor on bank credit. A
cut in policy rates is unlikely to push banks to use the central bank’s refinancing facility to get
more and cheaper liquidity, as they have already non-remunerated excess reserves.
Consequently, the pass-through from the change in policy rates to bank lending rates and to the
availability of bank credit is likely to be weak.



Absence of an operational interbank market. The interbank market is supposed to fulfill the
essential function of lender of first resort to banks in need of liquidity. The absence of such a
market prevents a recycling of available liquidity among banks, thus limiting the volume of
credit that the whole banking sector can extend. The absence of an interbank market that can
play an arbitrative role between supply and demand of liquidity in the banking system makes
credit conditions less responsive to changes in monetary policy.



Insufficient competition in the banking system. In the case of a strong concentration in the
banking sector, a reduction in banks’ cost of funds resulting from a change in monetary policy
may be reflected in increased profit margins, rather than in banks’ lending rates.30



Limited link between the microfinance and banking sectors. A reduced cost of funds could be
used by microfinance institutions as an opportunity to acquire cheaper resources from banks to
expand their lending activity. Given their relative small size in the financial sector, weaknesses in
the supervision of this sector, and the limited link between the microfinance and banking
sectors, this channel would not, in the case of Benin, play a significant role in the effectiveness of
monetary policy.



Institutional and structural impediments to bank lending. In case of a cut in the policy rate or in
the reserve requirement, a poor institutional environment makes banks reluctant to reduce their
lending rate to attract new borrowers because of imperfect information about borrowers and
the resulting increase in the riskiness of the bank’s loan portfolio. The high level of NPLs on the
balance sheets of commercial banks, for which the banks are required to hold provisions, is an
important factor leading to reluctance to respond to change in monetary policy instrument.
Banks would need to sort out their legacy asset problems before they can raise lending to the
private sector.



Existence of a large informal sector. Besides the weak link between monetary policy and
availability and cost of bank credit resulting from the factors presented above, the link between
availability and cost of bank credit and aggregate credit demand is weakened by a large
informal sector in Benin. A reduction in bank lending rates may have relatively little effect on

30

Under limited competition, an increase in banks’ cost of funds would generate an asymmetrical effect, because
banks are likely to pass on the increase in lending rates instead of reducing their profit margins.

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BENIN

informal lending rates—customers of the informal sector cannot present the guaranties required
by banks to move from the informal to the formal financial system and thus cannot exert
downward pressure on the informal rates in the case of a cut in the policy rate. Only the
relatively small number of borrowers of the formal financial system would be sensitive to a
decline in bank lending rates.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FINANCIAL DEEPENING
The recommendations in this section focus on actions that could be implemented by Benin or put
forward by Benin to union decision-making bodies. They authorities welcomed this forthcoming study
and noted that its recommendations will be considered, especially since similar recommendations are
being debated at the level of the union. The recommendations below are intended to enhance financial
deepening, foster macro-financial stability, and improve macroeconomic policy effectiveness in Benin.
They build on previous IMF technical assistance (Box 4). Another pilot review, to be prepared in the
context of the Article IV consultation with WAEMU, will make recommendations on union-wide
issues.31
Box 4. Benin: IMF Technical Assistance to the Financial System
IMF staff has provided policy advice to Benin on financial sector issues through surveillance, technical
assistance, and program reviews. In the last two years, two IMF technical assistance missions visited
Benin in (i) September 2010 to advise on managing a crisis generated by illegal deposit-taking entities;
and (ii) December 2011 to carry out a diagnosis of the financial sector. The 2010 Article IV consultation
assessed the risks posed by banks that were not in compliance with prudential regulations, and by
unauthorized MFIs, which were operating fraudulent financial schemes. It advised the authorities to
take prompt action to mitigate these risks. Subsequent Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program review
missions assessed progress made in implementing the recommendations.
IMF staff advice also was provided on a range of issues related to the financial systems of the WAEMU,
with implications for Benin. A mission in May 2011 advised the BCEAO on the implementation of
recommendations made in 2007 under the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), public debt
management, macro-prudential supervision, and an operational framework for monetary policy. The
2012 Article IV consultation with WAEMU also examined risks and vulnerabilities faced by the regional
banking system, and progress made in bank supervision, monetary operations, interbank and
government securities markets, and union-wide financial deepening.

31

IMFa, 2012, provides union-wide recommendations that are relevant also to Benin and reports on the regional
authorities’ views on financial deepening (¶35-37).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BENIN

A.

Banking Sector

65.
Facilitate risk assessment. To encourage banks to extend credit to the private sector beyond the
limited circle of large businesses, financial information on borrowers should be made timely, available, and
reliable to help banks assess risks, particularly for SMEs and non-salaried clients. In this vein, work on
making the central registry of bad debts (Centrale des incidents de paiements) operational and on
establishing a credit bureau should be accelerated. A credit bureau for banks would help to rein in the
current proliferation of unreliable financial statements. A generalization of the existing unique tax
identification number (identifiant fiscal unique) would make it easier to centralize data on individual
borrowers.32
66.
Improve the legal infrastructure to support credit contracts and their enforcement.
Strengthening property rights and ensuring proper contract enforcement are critical elements for a better
protection of the legal rights of creditors. This would give banks the means to recover their collateral
through prompt and reasonably priced court procedures. The National Credit Council (NCC),33 together
with the Professional Bankers’ Association and concerned public entities (justice, police, tax administration),
could propose actions aimed at removing obstacles in this area.
67.
Enhance the quality, coverage, and dissemination of information on banks’ operating fees.
Without financial transparency, there cannot be any credible prospect for an active interbank market or an
attractive banking industry. Banks need reliable financial information that allows comparison among
players and over time in order to assess counterpart risks. Customers are also entitled to information on the
strengths and weaknesses of the bank to which they entrust their deposits. Providing financial information
to the general public and to the media is one way of developing healthy competition and a “financial
culture,” and promoting modernization of financial instruments. In the absence of a financial
communication agency, such as Reuters, an important step would be to encourage the prompt publication
of detailed and audited annual financial statements by banks, and interim financial information, at least on
a semi-annual basis. These statements could be posted in newspapers and on the internet to improve their
dissemination.34 The same goes for the publication of up-to-date bank charges and lending conditions, in
order to allow potential customers to shop around.

32

This recommendation is consistent with two structural benchmarks under Benin’s ECF arrangement with the IMF.

33

The NCC in Benin is composed of the Minister of Finance, a representative of the national branch of the BCEAO,
members of the monetary policy committee, the Director of the Treasury, and representatives of the banking
association, consumer associations, and academia. The NCC is an advisory body, which monitors the operations and
functioning of the financial system, and credit conditions. The NCC also advises on the macroeconomic framework
implemented by the authorities (BCEAO, 2012).
34

In some countries, banking supervisors offer space on their own web-sites where banks post their accounts under
their own responsibility. In other countries, banks are encouraged to post their financial statements in a timely
manner on their own web-site. In any case, financial statements may be published before formal approval by the
supervisory authorities, external auditors, or shareholders, provided these publications carry a warning on their
provisory status. Conversely, disseminating false financial data or fake statements should be sanctioned severely.

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BENIN

68.
Revise the prudential regulation on banks’ credit portfolio. No bank has been able to meet
this norm. Accordingly, it would need to be revised at the union-level to avoid bringing prudential
regulations as a whole into disrepute.
69.
Strengthen banking supervision. Effective banking supervision requires proper observation and
analysis, a decision-making body that can move promptly to take corrective action in case of need, and
means for enforcing that action. The fact that two banks have been operating in Benin with negative equity
over a long period and may continue to collect deposits to cover losses, is not consistent with this
approach. This situation distorts competition among banks and risks undermining public confidence in the
banking system. Concerned authorities should address this situation promptly.
70.
Strengthen macro-prudential oversight.35 The financial markets are influenced by developments
in the real economy. In particular, trends in the major economic sectors (port, cotton sector, construction,
etc.) and worker remittances have a significant impact. These developments—some of them cyclical—may
be out of phase with the factors underpinning regional monetary policy. Coordination of regional and
national policies should be enhanced to (i) track divergences between developments in the regional and
national economies; (ii) identify, analyze, and measure the consequences of these divergences; and
(iii) ensure that monetary policy objectives and prudential instruments converge on aligned incentives
(e.g., regulations on refinancing and on risk weighting, relative levels of interest rates, etc.). In light of its
composition and its advisory role, the NCC seems a suitable forum for developing proposals for macroprudential measures that could improve the impact of monetary policy and help protect macro-financial
stability in Benin.
71.
Promote innovative forms of banking. Introducing mobile payments on a large scale will require
enhanced provision of public infrastructure (in particular telecommunications) to reduce the cost of new
services and the expansion of financial services to reach underserved areas. Agency banking36 is another
innovative way of extending the reach of banks at low cost. These innovative forms of banking will require
an updated regulatory framework to allow their safe expansion.

B.

Microfinance Sector

72.
Strengthen data production and dissemination. The survey conducted in 2011 should be
updated and extended, and the CSSFD should be strengthened in its data gathering capacity, so that
stakeholders have a robust perspective of the sector. In particular, it is recommended to collect, and
regularly update, the number of clients (depositors and borrowers) and transaction details for each
identified MFI.

35

There are three main components to macro-prudential policy: (i) its objective, which is to limit systemic risk,
namely the risk of extended breakdowns in the provision of financial services with the consequent adverse impact on
the real economy; (ii) its coverage, which extends to the financial system as a whole, and its interaction with the real
economy; and (iii) its instruments, namely the prudential tools targeting sources of systemic risk (Interim report to
the G20, November 2010).
36

Agency banking involves an existing business facility (e.g., a shop) acting as an agent and providing limited
banking services on account of a bank (Veinard, C., 2010).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

BENIN

73.

Address vulnerabilities of the microfinance sector:



Resolve distressed MFIs. Some ten MFIs are currently in financial distress, mostly because of
governance problems, lack of proper internal controls, and inadequate management information
systems. The recent experiences of fraudulent financial schemes have undermined confidence in
the microfinance sector. Against this background, it is important that distressed MFIs be either
restructured or liquidated rapidly. This would send a strong signal to the whole sector.



Strengthen CSSFD. The capacity of the CSSFD should be strengthened through additional means
and technical assistance to increase the frequency of its on-site inspections.



Simplify licensing requirements and procedures to reduce the delay for obtaining a licence to less
than six months, as stipulated by the law. MFIs, which are not licensed, should move quickly to
obtain authorization. To facilitate completion of this procedure in six months, unlicensed MFIs
should be offered technical and material assistance to submit their applications in time and
proper form. Authorities should send a strong signal to the microfinance sector by closing
institutions which are operating illegally and are not in the process of being regularized.

74.
Increase the resources of MFI supervisory bodies. The regulatory framework for microfinance
has been reinforced with the National Assembly's adoption of new regional legislation in January 2012 and
its promulgation by the president in March 2012. The provisions of that law should now be put into effect.
MFIs that are not of a sufficient operating scale could be encouraged to merge or to be taken over by
licensed institutions. The resources and the capacity of the CSSFD should be boosted to cope with the
anticipated increase in the number of licensed MFIs. Similarly, the Committee on Financial Stability and
Rationalization of the Microfinance Sector (CFSASM), created in April 2012, needs to operate effectively to
accomplish its important mission.
75.
Provide MFIs with long-term funding. Because the resources of the MFIs consist essentially of
demand deposits, it would be appropriate to provide them with medium- and long-term resources
through an appropriate funding mechanism. Such financing should be made available to MFIs on a
commercial basis, along with the provision of supportive technical assistance. This role is successfully
played in many LICs by “apex institutions.” An apex institution is a second-tier (or “wholesale”) fund that
channels public resources to multiple retail financial providers—often MFIs—for on-lending. Apex
institutions typically have an objective of developing the institutional capacity of early-stage MFIs, by
providing grants and capacity-building assistance. They are generally a good solution in environments
where medium-to-long term funding is in short supply; for instance, where commercial banks do not have
confidence in MFIs’ creditworthiness. Apex facilities have become increasingly popular with LIC
governments, as well as with development finance institutions and multilateral development agencies.37
37

A CGAP mapping exercise identified 76 apex institutions in 46 countries. In 2009, the largest 15 of them disbursed
US$1.5 billion. Public funding was the main source of their resources. Typically, national finance ministries were the
main source of funding, followed by multilateral development agencies, and bilateral donors. In some exceptional
cases, apex institutions were funded by commercial banks or by non-governmental organizations and private
investors. Most apex institutions were funded with subsidized resources (grants, or loans at well below market
interest rates). As apex institutions grow, retained earnings become an increasingly important source of their funds.

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BENIN

The NFM, whose current setup and function resembles the concept of an apex institution, could potentially
be used to play this role in Benin to foster MFI lending to MSEs. However, its current strong bias towards a
microcredit approach focused on the poorest households would require adaptation to its contemplated
new role.
76.
Offer appropriate incentives to MFIs to reach out to underserved rural areas. These incentives
could take the form of government participation in (i) the purchase or construction of the necessary
infrastructure; (ii) the purchase of equipment (computers, safe deposit boxes, motor bikes); and (iii) in
certain cases, the temporary funding of the salaries of staff of the new units. External grants could be raised
for this purpose through the NFM.
77.
Allow MFIs to expand the range of their services. For the time being, union-wide regulations set
a limit of 5 percent of total assets on activities other than savings and credit services. By lessening this
constraint, MFIs could venture into new, profitable activities, such as microinsurance and money transfer.
This would contribute to financial deepening and breadth expansion.38
78.
Strengthen MFIs’ management capacity and human resources quality. The authorities, and
more specifically the Microfinance Ministry, should help MFIs reinforce their capacities, working perhaps
through ALAFIA, to raise their capacity to abide by governing regulations. MFIs should be helped to secure
information tools for their internal management and supervision.
79.
Take steps to educate the public in microfinance matters. Such education would be particularly
useful for low-income populations that are likely to benefit the most from microfinance services. They are
also the groups that are most exposed to fraud. The authorities should work together with MFIs in this
endeavor.

38

WAEMU authorities are reportedly considering raising the limit from 5 percent to 10 percent.

2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION AND FOURTH REVIEW UNDER
THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY ARRANGEMENT—
UPDATE OF THE DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Michael Atingi-Ego and
Peter Allum (IMF) and
Jeffrey Lewis and Marcelo
Giugale (IDA)

Prepared by the International Monetary Fund and the
International Development Association1

The update of debt sustainability analysis (DSA) confirms a low risk of debt distress. The projected
external debt indicators, despite a moderate deterioration owing to less favorable medium-term
growth and export prospects, remain below the policy-dependant thresholds under the baseline
scenario and stress tests. The inclusion of domestic public debt shows a gradual decrease in all debt
indicators confirming the conclusion of the external DSA. This assessment, however, critically
depends on the assumption that the authorities will continue to pursue prudent fiscal and debt
policies and will implement structural reforms to enhance competitiveness and growth.

1

Prepared in collaboration with the Beninese authorities. The fiscal year for Benin is January 1–December 31. The
previous DSA update was performed in August 2011 (IMF Country Report No. 11/243).

BENIN

KEY ASSUMPTIONS UNDER THE BASELINE SCENARIO
1.
The medium-term macroeconomic
outlook has been revised downward to reflect
a more challenging environment, but the
assumptions under the baseline scenario
remain broadly in line with those used in the
previous DSA. Near-term growth and export
perspectives have deteriorated moderately,
because of the continuing global crisis (Text
Table 1). Real GDP growth is still expected to
increase to 5 percent over the long term,
following the implementation of structural
reforms aimed at strengthening competitiveness
and improving public infrastructure. The primary
fiscal deficit2 and the non-interest external current
account deficit are expected to stabilize at
1¼ percent of GDP and at about 4 ½ percent of
GDP, respectively. Over the medium-term, it is
assumed that the authorities will continue to
benefit from sizeable concessional borrowing
from multilateral donors. Domestic public debt is
projected to start declining in 2013, owing to the
clearance of domestic arrears and the authorities’

prudent borrowing strategy.
2.
The large size of the informal sector
complicates the DSA for Benin. The large size of
the informal economy, and above all the large
amount of imports that subsequently become
unregistered exports to Nigeria, lead to an
overestimation of the external current account
deficit and to large residuals in the external debt
sustainability analysis.
3.
Risks to the baseline are skewed to the
downside. Externally, the deterioration of the
global environment could result in lower-thanexpected exports,3 foreign direct investment, and
remittances. Domestically, much will depend on
maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies and
implementing structural reforms that will boost
the economy’s supply response. The current
assessment also critically depends on the
authorities’ debt management capacity and the
availability of concessional external assistance to
finance investment projects.

The Beninese economy is becoming less dependent
on the cotton sector. For instance, the weight of
cotton in exports has steadily declined over the last
two decades, from 83 percent of exports in 1999 to
just 17 percent in 2011. This evolution confirms that
the risk related to cotton price volatility and financing
of cotton activities is relatively moderate.

EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. External Debt Sustainability
Analysis
4.
With all debt indicators expected to
remain below their relevant policy-dependent
thresholds, the most extreme shock scenario4
shows that some vulnerability persists
(Figure 1, Tables 1 and 2). Stress tests reveal
Beninese external debt suitability is vulnerable to
a one-time depreciation of the exchange rate
and an export shock. In the most extreme shock
scenario, the present value (PV) of the debt-toexports ratio is expected to increase significantly
without, however, breaching its threshold.5 The
other indicators are also sensitive to the most
extreme shock, although to a lesser extent. The
historical scenario shows another significant
vulnerability to external debt sustainability. 6

B. Public Debt Sustainability
Analysis
5.
Total (external and domestic) debt is
projected to decline gradually, owing to the
authorities’ strategy to repay securitized
wage arrears and to continue relying on
external concessional financing (Figure 2,
Table 3). Debt indicators are vulnerable to the
most extreme shock, calibrated as a significant
increase in other debt-creating flows (Table 4). All
debt ratios are sensitive to lower GDP growth
and primary fiscal balance assumptions.7

4

The most extreme test shock is calibrated as an
export shock equal to the historical average (2001–
10) of export growth plus one standard deviation (in
the same period), or a one-time, 30-percent nominal
currency depreciation. The shock is assumed to take
place in 2013-14. The average export growth is
computed for 2001–10 to avoid the end-of-thesample bias resulting from a substantial negative
shock to exports that occurred in 2011. Temporary
disruptions at the port of Cotonou contributed to a
major decline in export activity, 34 percent below the
2001-10 average export growth. This temporary
shock is not representative of past and future shocks.
5

Debt sustainability thresholds are determined by the
three-year average the Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating (3.5), which
classifies Benin as having medium-quality policies and
institutional frameworks.
6

Under this scenario, the key variables are held
constant at their 10-year average. In particular, real
GDP growth is assumed to be 3.6 percent; GDP
deflator growth (in U.S. dollar terms) 7.6 percent; the
non-interest external current account deficit

7.5 percent of GDP; and net foreign direct investment
flows 2.1 percent of GDP.
7

Real GDP growth and primary fiscal balance (in
percent of GDP) are projected to remain at their 10year average, i.e., at 3.6 percent and -1.4 percent,
respectively.

CONCLUSION
6.
The updated DSA confirms that Benin
faces a low risk of debt distress under the
assumptions of prudent macroeconomic
policies and timely, efficiency-enhancing
structural reforms. It is noteworthy that the
updated DSA presents a moderately worse debt
outlook than the previous DSA. The baseline and
alternative stress test scenarios continue to
indicate that external debt positions present low
vulnerabilities to shocks. The inclusion of

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

domestic public debt in the analysis confirms the
conclusions of the external DSA.
7.
The authorities agree with the staff’s
conclusions. They concur that debt sustainability
will depend crucially on improvements in
economic diversification, sustained growth, fiscal
consolidation, and a continuation of a prudent
borrowing strategy relying mainly on grants and
external concessional financing.

Sources: Beninese authorities; IMF and World Bank staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

1/ Some debt series may not be directly comparable to those presented in Table 1 of the staff report owing to different exchange rate and interest rate forecasts at the time of the preparation of this document.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues excluding grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to
be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision
and completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its
assistance committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of
interest income as defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is
linked to the implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion
point).

Safeguards Assessments:

The Central Bank of West African States
(BCEAO) is a common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAMU). The most recent
safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was
completed on March 1, 2010. The 2010 update
assessment found that the BCEAO continues to
have controls in place at the operational level.
The overall governance framework needed
nonetheless to be strengthened by the
addition of an audit committee to ensure that
the Board of Directors exercises appropriate
oversight over the control structure, including
the audit mechanisms and financial
statements. Such committee was established
after the completion of the assessment
following the Institutional Reform of the
WAMU and the BCEAO. Efforts to implement
fully the International Financial Reporting
Standards reporting framework should also be
pursued.

Exchange Arrangement:

Benin is a member of the WAEMU and has no
separate legal tender. The union’s common
currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the Euro
at a rate of CFAF 655.957 = EUR 1, consistent
with the official conversions rate of the French
franc to the Euro and the previous fixed rate
of the CFA franc to the French franc of CFAF
100= F 1. Effective January 1, 2007, the
exchange arrangement of the WAEMU
countries has been reclassified to the category
of conventional pegged arrangement from the
category of exchange arrangement with no
separate legal tender. The new classification
is based on the behavior of the common
currency, whereas the previous classification
was based on the lack of a separate legal
tender. The new classification thus only reflects
a definitional change, and is not based on a
judgment that there has been a substantive
change in the exchange regime or other
policies of the currency union or its members.
The exchange system common to all member
countries of the WAEMU is free of restrictions
on payments and transfers for current
international transactions subject to Fund
jurisdiction.

III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Weaknesses exist in the areas of national accounts, public finance, monetary statistics, financial
sector prudential indicators, and balance of payments.
Real sector statistics: Inadequate resources and weaknesses in data documentation and
methodology hamper the accuracy and reliability of the national accounts. Efforts to address
these shortcomings are ongoing. Benin participates in WAEMU’s harmonization of statistical
methodologies and in the GDDS project for AFRITAC West countries to implement the 1993 SNA.
Progress has been slow and the accounts for a few years still need to be converted. The West
AFRITAC missions in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 sought to accelerate the process and support the
compilation of the revised accounts. A statistical business register and an industrial production
index are being developed, but the implementation has been slower than expected. Consumer
price data, measured using the WAEMU harmonized consumer price index, are adequate for
surveillance. The methodology for the WAEMU harmonized consumer price index has been
revised to be consistent with other WAEMU countries with the assistance of AFRISTAT.
Government finance statistics: The quality of fiscal data is broadly adequate for surveillance, but
has some shortcomings in coverage, periodicity, timeliness, and accessibility. The authorities
report budgetary central government’s “statement of sources and uses of cash” for publication in
the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, one year after the reference year. The October 2008
and July 2009 STA-GFS missions found that the authorities had yet to compile general
government GFS to broaden coverage of nonmarket activities controlled by the government,
disseminate the GFS within one quarter after the reference quarter, and present the other major
GFS reports to facilitate linkages to other macroeconomic datasets (e.g., the balance sheet).
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary and financial statistics, compiled and disseminated
by the BCEAO, are broadly adequate and their institutional coverage is comprehensive, but
timeliness of reporting is weak. Accuracy is somewhat hampered by the use of 1990 sorting
coefficients to estimate cross border amounts of banknotes among BCEAO countries, which in
turn, are used to estimate currency in circulation and to adjust the net foreign assets of each
member country.
Balance of payments: External statistics are still affected by shortcomings that prevent an
accurate and timely assessment of current account transactions and capital and financial flows.
Recent improvements in applying the guidelines of the Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth
Edition, have not solved the problem. In November 2004, a STA technical assistance mission
noted that the human resources devoted to balance of payments statistics by the national agency
of the BCEAO were inadequate, and highlighted a series of methodological problems including
the use of untested hypotheses and reference bases, the limited coverage of direct investment,
and shortcomings in the compilation of net external assets and international investment position.
Balance of payments statistics are also disseminated with a lag of almost one year and the
international investment position data with a lag of 18 months. Some progress has been achieved
in the reconciliation of regional trade data with those of regional partners, and the compilation of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

BENIN

trade statistics has been enhanced by the installation of the ASYCUDA++ customs computer
system in all main border customs houses, the port, the airport, and some regional offices.
Progress is also needed in improving contacts with reporting bodies and enhancing the
management of human and technical resources. Financial account data can be improved by
extending the coverage of foreign assets of the private non-banking sector, expanding the
surveys of residents’ foreign assets, and using other data source, such as Bank of International
Settlements (BIS) statistics. The BCEAO has updated the compilation of commercial bank data on
payments involving nonresidents; however, these data are not used to produce annual balance of
payments statistics.
External debt data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but are comprehensive only for public
and publicly guaranteed debt. Data are collected by the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA),
which is responsible for signing international loan agreements and servicing the government's
external debt obligations. The CAA's database is fairly comprehensive and up-to-date, and
contains accurate stock data, and produces projected debt-service flows on a loan-by-loan basis,
but regular statements are not received from creditors.
B. Data Standards and Quality
Benin commenced its participation in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in
An FAD mission conducted the fiscal module of
2001; but since then has not updated much of
a Report on Observance of Standards and
its metadata. Measures have been taken to reCodes (ROSC) in May 2001.
launch this initiative in 2013.
C. Reporting to STA
Standardized Report Forms (in line with the Monetary and Financial Statistical Manual) are still
not regularly used to report monetary data to the IMF. Annual data for balance of payments and
international investment position are reported to STA with a lag of about one and a half years.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 26, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Benin
On November 9, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Benin.1 The Board also approved the fourth review under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement during the same meeting (See Press Release No.
12/425).

Background
Benin has consolidated and reinforced recent gains in macroeconomic management, but
significant challenges remain in accelerating economic growth and reducing poverty. Prudent
fiscal policy has kept fiscal deficits at manageable levels and has averaged a basic primary
surplus over the period 2010–June 2012. This policy, combined with the benefits of the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and the Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiatives (MDRI), has kept
public debt low, at about 32 percent of GDP. The external current account deficit has remained
broadly stable, and the balance of payments deficit was about 5 percent of GDP in 2011.
Real growth rebounded after the 2010 floods, to about 3½ percent in 2011 and is anticipated to
maintain this rate through 2012. Authorities have made some progress on structural reforms
and significantly improved disbursements of priority social expenditure. Challenges remain in
achieving public investment targets, infrastructure development, and promotion of private sector
activity.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

Appropriate monetary policy by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) has helped
keep inflation low at about 2½ percent in 2010-11. A significant increase in fuel prices imported
from Nigeria in January 2012 resulted in a jump in the consumer price index, but does not
appear to have a persistent inflationary impact. The recent spike in international food prices has
not had a notable impact in Benin, given the country’s ability to supply basic staples with
domestic production. Inflation is projected to remain below 3 percent in the medium term.
Recent events at the port of Cotonou and in the cotton sector have added uncertainty to the
current economic environment. The government took more direct operational control of the
cotton sector this spring because of governance concerns and anticipates an improved harvest
this year. Difficulties at the port with reform implementation, and governance concerns led to the
suspension of the import-verification program.
Benin’s commercial banking system is generally liquid. Provision of banking services is
supplemented by a large number of microfinance institutions, which account for 9½ percent of
total financial sector loans and supply services to households and microenterprises. To further
develop and strengthen the financial sector, better-defined property rights and more reliable
contract enforcement are priorities, together with improved supervision of banks and
microfinance institutions.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their prudent macroeconomic management.
Directors noted that, while Benin’s medium term economic outlook is favorable, it remains
vulnerable to regional and global developments. To address the challenges ahead and to
consolidate the gains thus far, they underscored the importance of continued commitment to
sound policies. Timely implementation of structural reforms will be necessary to boost growth
prospects and reduce poverty.
Directors commended the authorities’ overall prudent fiscal conduct. They welcomed progress
in revenue mobilization and improvements in expenditure management, which allowed the
authorities to meet their fiscal targets and undertake poverty related spending. These advances,
if maintained, will provide space for needed infrastructure investment and safeguard the low
level of debt. In this context, Directors underscored that wage policy should remain consistent
with medium term fiscal objectives. Directors also agreed that broad based customs reforms will
strengthen revenue collection. Accordingly, they called for a well designed reimplementation of
the import verification program.
Directors welcomed the enhanced review of the financial system and stressed that continued
efforts to strengthen financial sector stability are necessary to preserve a sound macroeconomic

3
environment and accelerate growth. They underscored the need to intensify financial sector
oversight and adopt measures to broaden access to financial services. In particular,
strengthening supervision of microfinancial institutions should be a priority.
Directors emphasized that structural reforms remain critical for improving competitiveness and
inclusive growth. They encouraged the authorities to make further efforts to enhance the
business environment, including through implementation of a revised framework for the cotton
sector, support private sector development, and address the infrastructure gap.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth Review Under ECF Arrangement for Benin
and Approves US$16.2 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fourth
review of the Extended Credit Facility arrangement for Benin and approved the immediate
disbursement of SDR 10.61 million (about US$16.2 million). The Executive Board also
concluded the 2012 Article IV consultation with Benin, which will be covered in a separate
Public Information Notice in due course. Today’s decision will bring to SDR 53.06 million
(about US$81.1 million) the total disbursed under the SDR 74.28 million Arrangement,
which was approved in June 2010 (see Press Release No. 10/243).
At the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussions, Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“Benin has made significant progress in consolidating macroeconomic stability under the
Fund-supported program. Economic growth is projected to maintain its pace, inflation
remains in check, and the external current account deficit has been broadly stable.
“All quantitative performance criteria and targets were met, but earlier reforms to the cotton
sector and a key component of the customs reform program have been suspended.
“Prudent fiscal policy has kept fiscal deficits at manageable levels and is projected to yield a
basic primary surplus in 2012. Public debt remains low at about 32 percent of GDP.
However, looking forward, it will be important to contain current expenditures, including on
public sector wages, to provide space for infrastructure spending and meet medium-term
fiscal objectives. Broad based-customs reforms will strengthen revenue collection. In this
context, a well-designed reimplementation of the import-verification program will be
important going forward.
“Improvements to the business climate and public investment will be necessary to boost
external competitiveness and economic growth. Further progress on structural reforms,
including implementation of a revised framework for the cotton sector, remains thus critical.”

Statement by Ngueto TirainaYambaye, First Alternate Executive Director for Benin
Nevember 9, 2012

On behalf on my Beninese authorities, I would like to express my appreciation to
Management and Staff for the open and constructive discussions with my authorities as well
as for the technical and financial support they are receiving. Despite difficult circumstances,
my authorities have continued to implement steadfastly the economic and financial program
under the ECF. Performance under the Fund-supported program has been satisfactory with
all quantitative performance criteria and targets at end-March and end-June 2012 being met.
My authorities remain committed to the medium-term objectives of the program and would
like to request conclusion of the fourth review under the ECF arrangement.

Recent developments
After two years of economic slowdown, activity in Benin accelerated in 2011 as growth
reached 3.5% up from 2.6% in 2010. Economic growth was driven by a revival in
agriculture, notably higher production of cotton, and in construction and public works
activity. It is worth recalling that the economy experienced several shocks in 2011 that
hindered the achievement of higher growth. Headline inflation rate remained under control at
2.7 percent below the 3-percent convergence criterion of the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAEMU). The current account deficit widened in 2011, from 8.2 percent
in 2010 to 10.3 percent in 2011 due to a sharp drop in cotton exports. Improved capital
account balance and foreign investment contributed to limit the overall balance of payments
deficit to 4.9 percent of GDP. At end-2011, the risk of a debt crisis remains low, as total
public debt ratio stood at about 30 percent of GDP thanks to a prudent debt management
policy.
Activity in 2012 has been adversely affected by the petroleum price shock in the informal
sector in January 2012, following the reduction of petroleum subsidies in Nigeria. As staff
explain, higher prices of informal fuel spread to transportation and food prices. Headline
inflation shot up subsequently and stood at 6 percent in January-July 2012. It is expected to
remain around that level through year-end. Growth projections for 2012 had to be revised
downward to 3.5 percent from 4.3 percent initially.
My authorities have continued to maintain a strong fiscal discipline in 2012. Expenditures
were kept within the program envelope. Furthermore, the social spending targets were met
thanks to the implementation of a better monitoring system. Revenues largely exceeded
targets thanks notably to improved tax and customs administration and the sale of a 3G
mobile phone license. As a result, the basic primary balance in the first quarter and the first
half largely exceeded their respective targets by more than 1.5 percentage point of GDP,
thereby strengthening fiscal buffers. It is worth stressing that the primary balance targets
were still met when receipts from the mobile phone license are excluded. My authorities
reviewed all tax and customs exemptions and have adopted an action plan for implementing
the recommendations of the review. There has been little progress on the modernization of

2

the tax and customs administration due to delays in external assistance disbursements by
donors. In order to avoid any further delays in the implementation of these reforms, the
government will fund related costs out of its 2013 budget.
In the financial sector, the banking sector remains well-capitalized, with ten out of the 12
banks in Benin having complied with the regional decision to increase minimum capital. One
of the noncompliant banks was placed under provisional administration and options are being
explored regarding the handling of the other nonconforming bank. Earlier this year in March
2012, my authorities closed one bank that lost its license in 2009 and was under provisional
administration since then. The regulation and supervision framework was strengthened with
the adoption of the two legislations on the decentralized financial structures and banking
regulation by the National Assembly in January 2012. As a result, all decentralized financial
structures, notably microfinance institutions are now under the supervision of the central
bank and the regional banking commission. My Beninese authorities will continue
collaboration with regional institutions for the restructuring of two banks in financial distress
and will monitor closely the microfinance institutions in difficulty.
The implementation of the reform agenda continued to advance. In particular, progress has
been made toward the adoption of the civil service reform strategy with the completion of all
the preparatory studies, notably that on the remuneration of civil servants in July 2012. The
reform strategy is now expected to be adopted by year-end. Progress is being made with
respect to public workforce management with the finalization of the pilot phase of database
of civil servants. With the assistance of the World Bank, this database will be extended from
the Ministry of Economy and Finance to the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service. As regards
the pension reform, the related draft law was transmitted to the National Assembly in
September 2012.
In monitoring and evaluating past reforms, my authorities took important decisions to
address weaknesses identified in their implementations. In particular, they decided to
suspend the framework agreement governing the cotton sector in March 2012 and took over
the management of the sector for the 2012/2013 campaign. This decision was motivated by
reports of operational failures in the implementation of this framework, which did little to
promote the development of cotton production. My authorities intend, in consultation with
the private sector, to develop by the beginning of the 2014/2015 campaign a new framework
that will promote an integrated development of the cotton sector by production zone, with the
objective of effective liberalization, enhanced competitiveness and greater governance
transparency. An innovation will be the establishment of a regulatory authority to ensure the
sector functions according to the principles set in the new framework. In this framework, the
government will continue to provide critical services in areas such as organizing and
providing support to producers, monitoring the provision of production inputs and gathering
statistical information. It is worth indicating that there is no direct fiscal cost of the
government’s involvement in the cotton sector, as the costs related to cotton campaign is
financed through the banking system, whose loans are being repaid with the proceeds of the
harvest.

My authorities also suspended in May 2012 the import-verification program (IVP) at the
Port of Cotonou. As indicated in the Letter of Intent and explained in the report, the decision
was driven by low technical performance, excessive fees for scanning and tracking services,
and delays in container processing since the inception of this program; which led to a
significant loss of competitiveness for the Port of Cotonou, as evidenced by the greater
preference by shippers and importers to unload and process their cargo at neighboring ports.
My authorities will adopt new modalities for implementing selected IVP services following
consultations with the private sector in Benin and neighboring countries making use of the
port. It is worth stressing that the one-stop window at the port introduced last year continues
to operate effectively and revenue performance has not been affected by the suspension of
the IVP.

Program for the remainder of 2012 and for 2013
My authorities will continue the implementation of their economic and financial program to
achieve their macroeconomic stability and sustainable development objectives, consistent
with the growth and poverty reduction strategy updated last year. They remain committed to
the macroeconomic framework supported by the Extended Credit Facility arrangement.
As staff rightly recalls, Benin is a net food and fuel importer and cotton exports represent a
large share of the country’s total exports, which makes it vulnerable to international
commodity price volatility and global demand developments. In addition, Benin has a long
and close trading relationship with Nigeria, which subjects its economy to major economic
developments in its neighbor. Assuming an improved external environment and continued
implementation of reforms envisaged in the program, growth rate is projected to accelerate
slightly to 3.8 percent in 2013, and 4.5 percent over the medium-term driven by higher
agricultural production and infrastructure construction. Inflation should drop below the
regional convergence criterion and current account deficit in 2012 and 2013 should narrow as
a result of higher volume of cotton exports.
My authorities will pursue a prudent fiscal policy with the objective of preserving fiscal
sustainability and strengthening fiscal buffers. They will continue to maintain discipline with
respect to current expenditure and the wage bill in particular while accelerating public
investment execution. Priority social expenditure will be monitored closely to reach the
related end-2012 program target. They will submit a draft 2013 budget that is consistent with
the Fund-supported program. They are committed to implement the recommendations of the
December 2011 IMF technical assistance mission. Progress in the modernization of IT
systems at the customs and tax administrations together with strengthened cooperation
between these two administrations are expected to yield higher revenues.
Next year should mark the completion of many of the abovementioned structural reforms. In
addition, my authorities intend to pursue reforms to improve the business climate, upgrade
infrastructure and diversify the economy. In order to further strengthen its financial system
supervision framework, my authorities will also ensure the promulgation of three regional

4

legislations on banking regulation, combating the financing of terrorism and sanctions for
violations involving checks, bank cards and other electronic payment methods.

Conclusion
To conclude, performance under the ECF at end-March and end-June 2012 has been
satisfactory. Going forward, my authorities remain committed to maintaining sound
macroeconomic policies and pursuing the implementation of critical structural reforms. My
authorities continue to count on donors’ support and technical and financial assistance in this
regard. As in the past, my authorities will take any further measure that may become
appropriate, in consultation with the Fund, for achieving program objectives. In light of the
program performance and the continued commitment to the program, I will appreciate the
Executive Board’s support of the completion of the fourth review under the ECF and Article
IV consultations.
