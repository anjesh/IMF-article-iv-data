INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
Spain—Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Martin Mühleisen
February 3, 2009

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: Spain has entered a sharp downturn in the wake of the drying up of
funding for the housing boom and large external deficit. Inflation is falling but remains
structurally above the euro average. Labor markets are adjusting with labor shedding.
Banks have weathered well the first impact of tighter funding conditions and weaker
asset quality owing to strong prudential cushions. The fiscal deficit is ballooning,
reflecting discretionary measures and a drop in important tax bases, including housing.
Challenges: The economy needs to shift from housing-led growth to a new model with
stronger productivity and competitiveness. Consolidation in the banking system is
likely. Fiscal policy needs to cushion the downturn while guarding sustainability.
Staff views: The large fiscal effort is helping to offset the drop in private demand. At
the same time, measures should focus not just on demand, but facilitate substantial
structural reform in labor and product markets as well, to boost supply and improve
competitiveness. Further, to strengthen confidence, plans to achieve fiscal sustainability
need to be spelled out. Prudential banking policies and credibility are strong, but
contingency plans are required to augment bank capital if systemic pressures arise.
Authorities’ views: The fiscal effort is commensurate with the size of the downturn. If
the recession worsens, more assistance may be needed. The banking system needs
support with funding, but does not need, at this stage, more capital. Lower unit labor
costs are pursued through increased productivity and better jobs matching, not through
wage moderation given lower average wages than in EU partners. Product and service
market reforms are underway as agreed with EU partner countries.

I. CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Spain was a growth leader
for nearly 15 years until 2008.
Contributing factors were peseta
devaluations in the early 1990s, EU
integration, euro adoption, swelling
immigration, rising incomes, and
easy funding that permitted a
housing boom.

2.
Sustainability weakened as growth became increasingly dependent on importing
labor and capital. Inflation exceeded the euro average. Productivity growth weakened as
structural reforms lagged during the upswing. The expansion centered on nontradables.
Households and companies became highly indebted. The current account deficit reached
10 percent of GDP by 2007 (Figure 1). With consistently negative external balances, the
international investment position (IIP) steadily weakened. 1
3.
What started as a soft landing turned into an abrupt unwinding of imbalances
with the global liquidity squeeze in mid-2007, posing a major macroeconomic challenge.
Following a gradual slowing in activity beginning in 2006, the financial crisis has reduced
funding for the external deficit and triggered a major bust in the housing market. With
construction activity collapsing, banks under pressure, foreign demand faltering, and
competitiveness weak, the economy now needs both cyclical support and deep structural
reform. The authorities’ challenge is to achieve this adjustment, and bolster competitiveness
to avoid getting stuck in a long stagnation, while guarding fiscal sustainability.
4.
The Socialist Party won reelection for a second term in March 2008. To address
the crisis, the government has opted for increasing fiscal spending, assisting bank funding,
initiating product market reforms, and improving job matching and active labor market
policies. The main opposition conservative party would prefer tax cuts and increased
financing for small and medium-sized companies. Both parties focus on short-term
stabilization without an overarching intertemporal strategy.
* * *
At end-2008, as the global economic downturn accelerated, downside risks

accumulated. Monthly indicators turned worse than expected with housing, industrial activity,
and durable goods (vehicle sales) bearing the brunt of adjustment. Unemployment is rising fast,
reaching 12.3 percent in November (Eurostat; Figures 2, 3). Bank funding tightened up
1

The IIP is expected to weaken further as suggested by Annex I on the external debt sustainability analysis.

again after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and continued losses in some large European
banks. Many economies, including Spain, are deleveraging, with fiscal balances weakening
as governments seek to soften the downturn.
6.
A combination of slumping credit demand and tightening bank lending is
slowing consumption and investment. With 98 percent of mortgages indexed to the
12-month euribor debt servicing costs first increased after the onset of the crisis in mid-2007,
before easing sharply in late 2008. The spike in food and energy inflation further sapped
disposable incomes and confidence. Construction investment slumped and machinery and
equipment outlays fell with the weakening sales outlook (Figures 4, 5).
7.
Spain’s external current account deficit has started to improve. The process so far
has been led by falling imports as domestic demand contracts. Net factor payments continue
to worsen with the lower IIP (Figure 6).
8.
Despite the slowdown, wage increases have outpaced the euro average, while
headline inflation converged from above to the euro average in December 2008. Spain’s
high energy intensity made the oil shock especially painful. Indexation transferred price
shocks to wages. Collective bargaining wages were rising at 3½ percent, but many contracts
then added retroactive compensation when prices rose above a limit. Hourly labor cost
growth is approaching 6 percent, compared with 3½ percent for the euro area as a whole
(Figure 7). Weakly contested output markets, segmented labor markets, and low productivity
raise costs and lower competitiveness. Inflation is now declining sharply with the drop in oil
prices and indexation is expected to be less onerous in 2009.
9.
The housing downturn, growing unemployment, and funding tightness have put
banks under pressure. Asset quality is weakening as building companies are failing, house
prices are declining, and unemployment is rising. Banks have used prudential cushions to
absorb shocks, but lower asset returns and higher funding costs are beginning to reduce
profitability. With banks, nonfinancial companies, and households all deleveraging, credit
growth has slowed sharply from 25 percent y/y in early 2007 to 7 percent in late 2008.
10.
The general government balance has switched from moderate surpluses to
sizeable deficits. The soft economy slowed revenue, while spending outpaced output. The
interest bonus from EU integration, lowering costs by over 3 percent of GDP, is no longer
helping. The debt ratio has bottomed out. The central government is relatively small with
subnational governments accounting for 2/3s of spending. Social security accounts have a
current surplus but actuarial deficit (Figure 8).
II. THE OUTLOOK
11.
There was agreement that the outlook is somber. However, while deleveraging and
global economic events exert downward pressure on growth, there were also upside
developments. These include the recent sharp drop in oil prices and euribor rates, and the

The staff has lowered its 2009 growth scenario further to a range between -1 and
-2½ percent with a baseline of -1.7 percent. During the mission, the staff had presented a
baseline of (at least) -1 percent, but subsequent data indicate that conditions have worsened
with a rebalancing from domestic demand to net exports at a time when foreign demand is

13.
The balance of risks around the staff baseline is on the downside, and the
forecast range is wide. The drop in oil prices and euribor are supporting disposable income,
but it is unclear how much finds its way into spending versus saving to restructure private
balance sheets—i.e. how long and deep deleveraging will be. The upside range assumes a
smaller increase in household saving than 2¼ percentage points assumed in the baseline; the
downside range assumes saving rates jumping by 3¾ percentage points. Further, downward
risks could materialize as external demand from the EU continues to weaken (2009 import
volumes from euro-area partners are currently projected to drop between 1.5–2 percent).
Furthermore, the slowdown in Latin America and other markets may feed back through the
significant interlinkages of Spain’s large banks (¶30), thus worsening domestic credit
conditions. Finally, high unemployment and extended slow growth would continue to put
pressure on Spain’s domestic banks as well, which could slow credit growth yet further.
14.
Without more reforms to increase flexibility, staff is concerned that Spain could
get stuck in a low-growth extended-adjustment (L-shaped) equilibrium. Such a scenario
has been experienced by Portugal, Germany, and Japan. If the structural inflation premium
over euro partners persists and deleveraging requires time, immigration could subside and
actual and potential growth remains weak. The cumulative loss of competitiveness and high
private sector indebtedness thus restrain growth. Construction, which has been the engine of
growth, is unlikely to rebound soon. The switch to higher productivity will likely be slow
with timid product and labor market reforms, as assumed in the staff’s medium-term outlook.
15.
The authorities expect a more V-shaped recovery. They note the higher population
dynamics in Spain relative to trading partners (immigration would still contribute to growth).
Spain’s attractiveness as a residential destination for many Europeans would support the
housing market to some extent, which could lead to a gradual recovery from 2010. So far,
Spanish export market share has held up relatively well—seen to reflect better
competitiveness than relative prices may indicate. The authorities view some of the inflation

16
differentials as catching up with trading partners (Balassa-Samuelson effects), but agree that
competitiveness should be improved. They prefer to focus on output market reforms to assist
productivity, with less emphasis on labor market reform.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
16.
The discussions centered on the deteriorating outlook on the back of the housing
correction and its implications for banking, fiscal policy, and structural reforms.
Interlocutors agreed that the housing market needs to stabilize to bolster the quality of bank
assets. Banks need funding access and sufficient capital to manage the effects of the crisis.
Fiscal policy is providing liquidity to the economy and propping up activity and employment
to the extent possible. Staff stressed the need to calibrate these measures in a long run
sustainability framework to assure a return to lower debt and boost confidence. In this vein,
structural reforms need to complement cyclical-support policies by lowering costs and
increasing productivity to raise growth potential. Several interlocutors remarked that the
political system was not interested in the long-run at this moment. Support for reforms was
said to be uneven, especially for labor reforms.
A. Housing 3
17.
Spain has achieved a major upgrade of its housing stock. The renewal in the
Spanish housing market reached a crescendo in 2006 when Spain started nearly 800,000
homes—more than Germany, France, Italy, and the UK combined. Construction value-added
reached 17 percent of GDP, more than double in other countries. Construction employment
was also very high, including using immigrant labor.
18.
However, the 2007 funding crunch brought the boom to a halt, and adjustment
will take time given a large inventory (Figure 9). Estimates differ. The authorities estimate
a stock of at least 600,000 unsold homes, to increase somewhat as new units are being
finished. The private sector estimates a stock of 1 million, compared with demographically
sustainable sales of some 400,000 homes a year. With peak housing starts nearing
completion, inventories will likely expand throughout 2009.
19.
House price data diverge—predictions of future house prices more so. Official
statistics on assessed value per square meter suggest that prices are now slightly down y/y. A
new official series on home prices per dwelling has started to show more substantial nominal
declines. Home prices by private assessors or average market asking prices suggest that
nominal home prices are already falling over 10 percent y/y. The staff is positing a scenario
of house prices falling by 30 percent in real terms over four years (peak/trough), and
construction activity to bottom out at the earliest in 2010. The authorities feel that this price

drop is too high due to housing market segmentation and downward price stickiness.
However, banks’ contingency plans closely match staff assumptions—an extended correction
with significant price declines.
20.

The implications are important:

•

Higher unemployment. Slowing construction may release 1 million workers (5 percent
of total employment in the economy).

•

Pressure on banks. Mortgage credit is 35 percent of loans; construction and real estate
company credit another 25 percent. Deteriorating asset quality is affecting the banks’
profitability, and funding, which depends heavily on mortgage-backed securities.

•

Weaker public finances. Escalating asset prices and transactions lifted revenue.
Estimates of sustainable revenues and the structural fiscal position have been too
optimistic, in staff’s view.

21.
The authorities have taken several measures to assist the construction sector.
They aim at creating jobs (including through public infrastructure), facilitating mortgage
refinancing, limiting foreclosures, 4 promoting the rental market, and expanding subsidized
housing. Many interlocutors among banks and analysts felt that these measures were useful
and timely.
22.
Staff agrees that the housing measures have been valuable, and sees some
further room for improvement. While home-ownership is (overly) subsidized through tax
deductions, the market for rentals is underdeveloped, hindering labor mobility, and there is
potential to absorb vacant housing stock. In this context, restrictions need to be relaxed, such
as the landlord’s obligation to automatically renew the lease during the initial five years (the
tenant can quit, but not the landlord), and capping of rent increases at CPI indexation.
Eviction rules are being clarified to protect homeowners while mediation is being revamped
to safeguard consumer rights. Staff cautioned against constructing more subsidized housing
at this time, which adds to supply, and does not always reach the vulnerable groups intended.
The authorities said that this keeps employment up and were in a market segment that did not
interfere with the free housing sector.

4

The authorities are working with attorneys and banks to lower refinancing fees; and are implementing a
program in which newly unemployed workers with dependents could defer half of their monthly payment for a
period of two years (to be amortized subsequently over 10 years). The deferred amounts would have government
guarantee.

19
B. The Banking Sector
23.
The banking sector has weathered well the initial impact of the global crisis
thanks to prudent regulation, sound supervision, and cautious retail-oriented business
models. On the asset side, Spain’s dynamic loan-loss provisioning helped build cushions
during good times (Box 1). Also, rigorous consolidation rules reduced incentives for
off-balance-sheet vehicles and banks avoided investing in opaque structured products. On the
funding side, banks used their extensive branch networks to gather deposits, but also issued
large amounts of asset-backed securities, mainly covered bonds. 5 It is estimated that the
dynamic provisions have

intervened (Tables 2 and
3, and Figures 10, 11).
24.
Nevertheless, financial market disruption has severely affected banks’ operating
models. The banks are restructuring their balance sheets. On the liability side, they have
intensified competition for deposits, stepped up recourse to the ECB (with another run-up at
end-2008), and availed of government funding assistance (below). On the asset side, they
slowed lending to the euro-area average growth rate, sold industrial participations, and
tightened credit standards while seeking workouts with distressed property developers.
25.
The authorities have taken measures to assist bank funding, rather than
purchasing bank assets or injecting capital (Box 2). Bank assets are mainly loans, which
are granular and less volatile than exotic products held in other banking systems. This
provides Spanish banks some time to adjust. At this stage, the authorities prefer not to
intervene directly by purchasing assets, because banks are best placed to manage these. For
contingency purposes, the authorities have adopted legal provisions for potential capital
support. They have refrained from capital injections so far and will continue to do so to the
extent possible to promote private sector market-based solutions first, and to avoid distorting
competition. Staff agrees. Indeed, the authorities expressed concern that government-led

Box 1. The Spanish Prudential Framework
Dynamic loan-loss provisioning has built buffers before the current stress materialized; and rigorous
consolidation rules have reduced incentives for off-balance-sheet vehicles. Both features are attracting
international attention.
Dynamic loan loss provisions–The Bank of Spain (BdE) has pioneered the use of dynamic provisions since
2000 to mitigate credit procyclicality. 1/ The principle recognizes that potential loan losses may exist from the
moment a loan is granted—and this requires a provision. Hence, Spanish banks are required to create two
provisions: specific, against identified losses or doubtful assets, and general, against potential losses. For the
latter, banks’ standard loans are subdivided into six risk categories with corresponding provisioning coefficients,
determined by historical experience of impairment and loss given default. In each quarter, banks are required to
set aside general provisions equal to the difference between a notional amount of provisions and the amount of
specific provisions accumulated during the period (notional provisions being a function of the flow and stock of
banks’ exposure in each risk category multiplied by the respective provisioning coefficient). The total stock of
general provisions is required to remain within predetermined limits. 2/ Dynamic provisioning helps build
cushions during expansions, which partially smooth bank profits and solvency over the business cycle. The
estimated €24 billion in provisioning cushions in banks resulted in nonperforming loan (NPL)-coverage ratios of
over 200 percent at the peak, compared with the EU average equivalent of just over 60 percent.

Securitization and consolidation practices–Securitization began in 1982 with initiatives to develop the
mortgage markets and has grown strongly since 1992. Before adopting IFRS in 2005, it was normal for banks to
effectively remove securitized loans from their books. In adopting IFRS, the BdE extended to individual
institutions the application of accounting criteria for the consolidated level. In addition, risk transfer and control
of special purpose entities were defined in strict terms. Both steps reduced incentives for off-balance sheet
securitization and capital relief.
________________________
1/ The framework was reformed in 2005 to comply with IFRS (Circular 4/2004).
2/ Currently the limits are 0 and 125 percent of bank exposures multiplied by their respective provisioning
coefficients (Circular 6/2008). The BdE maintains an indicative minimum level of 10 percent (Actualizado
Circular 6/2008).

23
recapitalization of weak institutions elsewhere had already created significant distortions in
the EU. In their view, Spanish vulnerability is on the funding side—especially wholesale
funding with forthcoming debt amortizations of about €170 billion in the next two years.
Thus, the authorities have put in place facilities to help banks cope with funding tightness and
increased deposit insurance together with EU partners to assist confidence.
Box 2. Bank Support Measures
Spain is assisting the banking system in line with the common framework agreed by euro-area countries:

•

The limit on deposit insurance was raised from €20,000 to €100,000. Moreover, the deposit
information system was strengthened to allow a timely response in emergencies.

•

A €30–50 billion fund was established to purchase high-quality securities issued by credit
institutions (FAAF). The auctions are modeled after, and complement, the ECB liquidity facilities,
but with longer maturities up to 3 years. Up to 25 percent of a tender may be allocated through
noncompetitive bids to credit institutions in proportion to their contribution to credit growth. Limits
have been envisaged to safeguard sufficient diversification in allocation among institutions. Four
auctions have been carried out with positive results in allocated amounts and spreads.

•

Government guarantees are provided for credit institutions’ new debt issues. The amount approved
is €100 billion to be used by mid-December 2009. A possible additional €100 billion might be
allotted in 2009 if market conditions do not improve. Pricing is agreed with EU partners as a
minimum of 50 basis points plus a factor that depends on the CDS spreads and/or the rating of the
originator. Many banks will participate in this program.

•

If necessary, credit institutions’ recapitalization may be carried out through the government’s
acquisition of nondiluting instruments such as preferred shares.

26.
Turning to 2009, it was agreed that Spanish banks face a very difficult year,
likely leading to bank consolidation. Balance sheet restructuring is contributing to the
slowdown. Several large real-estate developers have filed for bankruptcy. Impaired loans
have jumped, although from a very low base, eroding prudential cushions. CDS spreads have
widened (sometimes a thinly traded indicator) and bank share prices have dropped, reflecting
prospects of continued economic weakness and in property markets.
27.
Staff stress tests based on published data suggest that banks may face capital
needs—Bank of Spain’s results, using detailed internal data, are more benign, but the
authorities are not complacent. 6 The staff assumes that significant pressures will still build
on profits and asset quality in 2009 as the housing and growth downturn unfold. Staff noted
that there is a need for (fiscal) contingency plans to assist banks with capital. The authorities
viewed the severe scenario by staff as too pessimistic, especially regarding the assumption of
loan impairments rising rapidly to double digit NPL-ratios. This was in part because the

6

The background paper on the financial system describes the staff stress tests on credit risk.

24
authorities envisage a somewhat smaller downturn and housing price decline than staff, and
because regulations for loan impairment have been tightened relative to the early 1990s,
which results in higher NPL statistics for any given economic scenario today relative to the
early 1990s. Also, they thought the staff assumptions on loss given default (LGDs) too high
in comparison with historical experience for some loan categories; and that staff had
depressed the interest margin for bank earnings too much (it had remained stable so far). In
addition, the authorities emphasized that average loan-to-value ratios in mortgage lending
were moderate, and households were responsible for the debt not just with the property but
also with their income. Thus, the loss experience in home lending had always been moderate,
and more closely tied to unemployment than falling home prices.
28.
The Bank of Spain has stepped up its surveillance and the authorities are
prepared to act as needed to forestall systemic disruptions. Both off-site analysis (stress
testing and liquidity monitoring) and on-site examinations have been reinforced as the
authorities agreed that increased pressures will still come. In particular, supervisors share
staff concern about property developers. In anticipation, they have followed a conservative
approach to banks’ debt-to-equity (property) swaps with ailing real estate companies,
requiring the buildup of adequate capital and provision buffers.
29.
Savings banks (cajas) have regional concentration and particular exposure to
construction. NPLs in cajas are higher than for commercial banks, with some cajas in better
shape than others—the staff believes that some consolidation is inevitable to keep the caja
system functioning robustly, and to avoid large fiscal costs down the line. Further, and
following staff’s previous recommendations for more market exposure, cajas have made
progress with one institution issuing participation shares in mid-2008. The downturn in the
stock market has hindered further issuance, but staff recommended that they continue
attempts to bolster capital, as market conditions permit. Regulations of participation shares
should be simplified to make them more attractive to investors—especially regarding overly
complex dividend payout rules. Further, the 2006 FSAP had recommended allowing cajas to
issue capital instruments with voting rights, and eliminating the requirement for regional
governments to approve mergers of cajas (Table 4). The authorities said that they do not
perceive these elements as major stumbling blocks today, and would focus on immediate
needs. They noted that discussions on consolidation were indeed underway and this would
continue as the operating environment weakened, thus facilitating interregional mergers.
Representatives of cajas explained that these had never caused a systemic disturbance and
that no caja has ever failed, even though weaker ones have been absorbed through mergers.
30.
Santander and BBVA are international players and could face some risks from
abroad. Their profits have remained high so far, and they noted that their global
diversification, focused on relatively safe traditional retail banking, has been an element of
strength, rather than weakness. Still, bank representatives said that Mexico, Brazil, and Chile
are key markets for them, each with their own pressure points, to which they were responding
with dedicated adjustments. Santander has taken advantage of the crisis to expand its retail
banking model in the US and UK—it is now cutting costs in these ventures to improve
profitability and reduce risks. In November, at the height of the crisis, Santander placed
€7.2 billion in new shares to bolster its Tier 1 capital base, without government assistance.
Likewise, BBVA, which has been less aggressive in expanding its capacity, has placed over

25
€1 billion in preferred shares in December, and a similar amount in bonds in early January,
also without government assistance. Both banks were hit by the Madoff scandal, but direct
exposures are small. The authorities said that they were closely monitoring potential
spillovers from foreign markets into Spain via the large banks through close cross-border
cooperation with EU, US, and Latin-American supervisors (Figure 12).
C. Fiscal Policy
Short run
31.
The fiscal accounts have weakened sharply with several factors contributing—
hitherto overestimating the structural balance is among them. Since 2001, primary
spending has outpaced potential growth. Moreover, the housing boom created the impression
of a permanent strong tax base. With falling house prices and less homebuilding, revenues
will drop, including for local governments. Also, the ongoing rebalancing from domestic to
export demand will moderate the tax base.
32.
For 2008–09, the authorities have taken measures of 4 percent of GDP so far.
The last package, designed as part of the joint EU stimulus for 2009, is valued at 1.1 percent
of GDP. It focuses on labor-intensive local public works, assistance to the automobile
industry, and smaller measures. This impulse adds to the elimination of the wealth tax
(0.2 percent of GDP) effective from 2009. In staff’s view, the measures have been largely
cyclical (supporting demand), without

The authorities estimate a smaller structural deficit than staff, partly because
they have higher potential growth. 7 They pointed out that measures had been designed to
drop out of spending once the recession fades—an exit-strategy. Staff agreed that the
structural balance would decline again in the medium run if the spending boost is temporary

7

As noted in ¶15, the authorities see more favorable demographic prospects (including with continued
immigration), potential for productivity recovery, and competitiveness.

and no follow-up (maintenance) is required. In 2007, Spain legislated a fiscal rule that
requires a surplus if growth exceeds 3 percent and permits a small deficit when growth is
below 2 percent. Under current conditions, however, the authorities agreed that the fiscal
balance would swing into large deficits, exceeding the SGP limits. Both domestic and SGP
rules would require lowering the fiscal deficit in the future.
34.
There was considerable soul-searching how to proceed with fiscal policy in 2009
if growth were to deteriorate further. There are three sets of views, including among the
authorities. First, those that express puzzlement at further pressure, including from the Fund,
for even larger deficits. They note that Spain has been living beyond its means and
adjustment is necessary. Second, those considering that supporting the economy was
appropriate but that Spain has done enough. Third, those supporting additional measures if
the downturn worsens. Staff said that the circumstances were unusual and the large response
by Spain had been warranted so far to avoid a standstill.
35.
Proceeding, the authorities would first give the approved measures a chance to
generate their full impact. If more measures were necessary, they would consider transfers
to poor and liquidity-constrained families with high spending propensities (such as extending
unemployment support, welfare) and labor-intensive infrastructure spending to protect
employment. Fiscal multipliers so far had been low with resources (tax cuts) used by the
private sector for deleveraging, instead of spending. The authorities would endeavor to keep
measures timely and targeted, within a coordinated response with EU partners. Staff agreed
that while allowing automatic stabilizers to operate fully, fiscal policy needed to remain
cautious given that some fiscal powder also should be kept dry, as a contingency, to assist
banks with capital, if needed. If still lower growth materializes and the authorities decided
that further fiscal support were needed, staff stressed that this should be combined with
long-run fiscal, labor (such as agreeing with social partners on a program of wage moderation
and labor market liberalization), and product market reforms. This would help start a new
growth cycle with improved competitiveness and higher productivity to avoid a potential
L-shaped stagnation.
36.
In addition to the above-the-line measures, the authorities have taken
below-the-line measures to support housing, SMEs, and banks. The fully
government-guaranteed Official Credit Institute (ICO) and the Treasury have granted credit
lines and guarantees providing up to 4.9 percent of GDP in liquidity support through
end-2009 (additional to the deficit). The many extensions to its programs are challenging
ICO, which is small. Room to do more is limited if implementation is to remain of high
quality. Funding assistance to banks (FAAF and debt guarantees) is potentially large at
22.8 percent of GDP, if fully employed.

37.
The debt implications of the fiscal measures, credit lines, and guarantees are
large. The deficit is likely to stay elevated in the medium-term, with some improvement as
spending measures drop out in future years. Nevertheless, if all support is fully used, gross
debt and guaranteed debt would increase by €395 billion (34 percent of GDP) in 2007–09,
and the debt ratio could rise to 74 percent of GDP. The assets backing some debts are rated
AAA and AA, so potential losses were deemed small. Further, sunset clauses imply that the
guaranteed debt will fall quickly once the programs end, but staff felt that risk exposure,
given the weak economy, should not be downplayed. The sovereign spread over 10 year
Bunds has already increased from 7 to over 100 bp, and Spain’s long-run AAA sovereign
debt rating has been downgraded one notch by one rating agency, so caution is warranted.
Long run
38.
The authorities agreed that current economic policies do not secure long-run
fiscal sustainability. The authorities’ medium-term potential growth projections (around
3 percent a year) are higher than those of staff (2 percent a year), but similar beyond the next
decade. Spain faces growing dependency ratios, lower labor input, and slowing output growth
rates in the future. Immigration is more buoyant in the authorities’ medium-term projections,
which would push out into the future the effects of aging on growth and the fiscal position—a
delay, not a solution of eventual pressure. In the staff’s long-run framework (Figure 13), and
assuming a productivity recovery from low levels, potential growth could remain around
2 percent for some time before demographic slowing kicks in. Spain has one of the highest
aging costs among advanced countries and those in the EU Aging Working Group. Using

Staff recommended publishing an intertemporal public sector balance sheet as
part of the annual budget document to frame policies in a long run context. The balance
sheet would reflect current assets and liabilities and the NPV of future primary balances,
including aging costs, based on current policies. Staff calculations suggest that in 2007
Spain’s public sector net worth was -40 percent of GDP. However, with the large downshift
in the structural primary balance, the path of future primary balances significantly worsened,
leading net worth to drop to -147 percent of GDP in 2009 (even after clawing back some
expenditures in the medium term) (Table 6). Seen in this context, Spain has no fiscal space
for expansion, unless the authorities can commit to adjustments (parametric pension and

combination of progressive income tax increases and expenditure cuts in the non-aging
related budgets, including phasing out the mortgage interest deduction) that bolster the public
balance sheet. The authorities agreed that further steps in pension reform were necessary and
that plans to this effect were being developed in cooperation with social partners. Staff felt
that this effort might require a firmer push by the authorities.
D. Competitiveness and Structural Reforms
40.
Indicators suggest a competitiveness gap. Measures based on relative consumer
prices and unit labor costs point to an appreciation of 12–21 percent over Spain’s long-run
averages. Additional staff estimates based on the CGER methodologies indicate a gap of
11–22 percent. 9 These findings signal impaired competitiveness (Figure 15).
41.
Under currency union, improving competitiveness will take time. Instead of
repressing demand, it is preferable to implement labor and product market reforms to cut
costs and reallocate resources to more productive use for a vigorous recovery. The authorities
pointed out that some restructuring has taken place over the last decade as indicated by the
technological upgrade of exports and increasing specialization in high value-added services. 10
Nevertheless, they agreed that rapid import penetration points to some lack of
competitiveness in domestic markets (Tables 7 and 8).
42.
Ambitious labor and output market reforms need to be implemented jointly to avoid
income shifts, while accruing benefits through improved productivity and lower costs. Labor
reforms should focus on reducing wage indexation, which is inconsistent with currency union,
and propagates adverse shocks to wages. Reducing labor market segmentation would allow better
trained young cohorts to flow more quickly from fixed-term to better-paid permanent jobs,
thereby increasing returns to higher education (which are low). Staff also recommended allowing
opt-out clauses in collective labor agreements to be invoked earlier than is now the case, because
many companies cannot recover once they get close to bankruptcy resulting in a loss of all jobs
(Figure 16).
43.
The authorities were circumspect on ambitious macroeconomic labor reforms
without stronger support from social partners. Instead, they seek more microeconomic
adjustments with the aim to reduce unit labor costs by boosting productivity (denominator)
rather than wage moderation (numerator). The labor ministry favors improved job
intermediation, including with private firms, and boosting the effectiveness of active labor
market policies. Also, Spain wants to improve education, where test scores are below the EU
average and dropout rates are high. Staff welcomed these efforts, but noted that they would
require time to take effect and seemed almost peripheral to the competitiveness and
9

The authorities noted their reservations about CGER type estimates, given statistical and methodological
uncertainties of these estimates.

unemployment challenge at hand. In staff’s view, Spain needs urgent wage moderation to
lower costs, for which, however, there is no consensus.
44.
The authorities are proceeding with product market reforms. Product market
reforms seek to transpose the Services Directive, 11 reduce administrative burdens, improve
competition in professional services, and reform network industries (Figures 17–18). 12
Well-entrenched groups are opposing parts of these reforms, so striving for an ambitious
rather than piecemeal implementation is crucial.
Spain: Structural Reform Needs
Labor Market
•

Cut wage indexation to reduce the inflation differential with the euro area.

•

Invoke opt-out clauses earlier in collective wage bargaining agreements to preserve
jobs and prevent companies from declaring bankruptcy.

•

Equalize dismissal costs of temporary and permanent contracts at a low level to
reduce segmentation.

Goods and Services Markets
•

Liberalize services through an ambitious transposition of the European Services
Directive. Regional authorities need to ensure effective implementation

•

Eliminate restrictions to competition in professional services.

•

Reform network industries to improve competition. Electricity prices should recover
costs in contested and unbundled markets.

•

Reduce administrative burdens.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
After 15 years of impressive growth led by a housing boom, a sharp correction of
accumulated imbalances is underway. The challenge is major: with construction activity
collapsing, banks under pressure, foreign demand faltering, and competitiveness weak, Spain
needs both cyclical support and substantial reforms. The authorities' response has been
forceful in banking and fiscal policies, but they also need to bolster competitiveness to avoid
getting stuck in a slow-growth/high-unemployment equilibrium, from which lowering public
debt would be difficult.
11

Using a general equilibrium model, the authorities calculate that an ambitious implementation of the Services
Directive could reduce margins by an average of 3¾ percent and lift potential GDP by 1¼ percent—in the
steady state and compared with a no-reform scenario. Separately, simulations with a sectoral labor productivity
growth model performed by the OECD suggests that productivity growth could increase by close to 1 percent in
Spain, if it were to adopt product market regulations equal to those of less restrictive countries
12

The background paper on productivity growth elaborates these measures.

46.
Indicators suggest a substantial downturn in 2009, driven by deleveraging and
external weakness. High private debt and weak external competitiveness cause long
adjustments. Spain cannot devalue the currency to bolster competitiveness, so reforms that
cut costs and improve productivity are key. Because risks are on the downside, contingency
planning should include a worse-case scenario of even weaker growth, while specifying how
to secure fiscal sustainability (a V-shape for the fiscal balance).
47.
The housing sector correction is underway but will take time. New homes are still
coming on the market, pressuring home prices. Policies to activate the rental market are
welcome. Mortgage assistance to newly unemployed workers can help limit foreclosures.
Building more subsidized homes, however, is inadvisable as it adds to inventory and does not
always benefit those intended.
48.
Banks have held up well so far, including with timely government assistance.
Dynamic provisioning and rigorous treatment of off-balance sheet vehicles has helped banks
to absorb the first blows of the crisis. Now, NPLs are increasing rapidly and high reliance on
wholesale markets makes funding the Achilles' heel of the banking system. The measures to
assist funding (FAAF and bank debt guarantees) are large, have appropriate sunset clauses,
and their pricing is agreed with EU partners. Banks need to allocate credit without political
interference.
49.
However, banks' operating environment will become even more challenging and
the authorities need to be vigilant and prepare to act. Dislocated wholesale markets,
higher funding costs, deteriorating asset quality, slowing lending growth, and higher
capitalization demanded by markets weigh on the outlook, and consolidation is highly likely.
As a contingency, the authorities have established legal provisions to support banks with
capital assistance, but they wish to use market-based solutions to the extent possible and to
avoid distortions, which the staff supports. Nevertheless, capital injections should be used if
systemic pressures arise.
50.
Cajas and the two large banks have special characteristics and needs. Cajas high
dependence on local real estate activity creates vulnerability and staff believes that some
consolidation would be helpful. Indeed, more political acceptance of interregional mergers
would keep them healthy and in service to their communities. Further, cajas are encouraged
to issue more participating capital shares as conditions permit. For the two large banks, their
resilience has been impressive; they have strong, diversified retail franchises, but even they
got caught off guard by unforeseen events, so there is no room for complacency. Tight
cooperation with EU, US, and Latin-American supervisors remains crucial
51.
Fiscal policies have been bold but should seek bigger reform leverage. The large
structural measures, together with automatic stabilizers, have resulted in a sharply weaker
fiscal position. The shortcoming of the measures is that they have not achieved structural
reforms to increase growth potential and thus ward off the possibility of an L-shaped

39
stagnation. Further fiscal impulse—only if necessary, and in cooperation with EU partners, or
to assist banks—should be linked to structural reforms, to minimize their social costs.
52.
Fiscal policies need to be embedded in a long-run context to explain how policies
can be made sustainable. This could strengthen confidence and is important to avoid private
agents from turning Ricardian and to limit the increase in risk spreads. As a communication
device, the authorities should publish an intertemporal public sector balance sheet in the
annual budget, showing the debt already incurred, and the consequences of present policies
on the stream of future deficits (a forward-looking debt). Pension and other long-term fiscal
reforms are highly necessary to dampen aging costs and secure confidence in sustainability.
53.
Simultaneous product and labor market reforms require strong and full
implementation to deflate margins and lower costs. A persistent inflation differential with
euro partners reflecting high margins (returns to employers) and high unit labor costs (returns
to workers) has resulted in a competitiveness gap. The plans for product market reforms are
well taken and in line with EU partner countries toward a unified European market for goods
and services. The transposition of relevant Directives needs to be ambitious, and
implemented with vigor to address the inevitable opposition from special interests. The plans
for labor market reform are disappointing given the competitiveness and unemployment
challenge at hand. Spain needs extended strong wage moderation and structural
macroeconomic labor reforms, including the elimination of wage indexation, earlier adoption
of opt-out clauses from bargaining contracts to preserve employment, and a reduction in the
segmentation of labor markets between fixed-time and full-time contracts. Dismissal costs in
these job market segments need to be equalized at a low level to boost hiring and mobility.
54.

It is recommended that Spain remain on the 12-month Consultation cycle.

Macro Relevant Recommendations
Tighten provisioning or capital requirements for
nontraditional housing and construction loans

Adopt most conservative approach under Basel II for
industrial participations

Financial Sector Supervision
Ongoing reforms of the Statutes of the Autonomous
Communities should clearly maintain prudential and
supervisory responsibilities at the State level

Short term

Short term

Status as reported by the authorities

Circulars 4/2004 and 3/2008 provide a
prudent framework to address risks inherent
in nontraditional housing and construction
loans
Circular 3/2008 gives preference to VaR
approach although it is an option as indicated
in the EU Capital Requirement Directive and
Basel II framework

Short term

Despite some ambiguities, Statute revisions
basically maintain status quo whereby Bank
of Spain retains full responsibility for
prudential and supervisory tasks

Separate insurance supervision from the Ministry of
Economy

Medium term

A proposal to transfer solvency regulation to
the Bank of Spain and consumer protection
issues to the CNMV (twin peaks model) is
currently stalled

Delegate the authority to issue norms and sanction
violations from the Ministry of Economy and the Council
of Ministers to the respective regulatory agencies

Short term or within 12 Pending
months

Create an institutional mechanism for permanent and
continued coordination among the main regulators

Short term

Establishment of the Financial Stability
Committee

Appoint members of the CNMV's board to longer nonrenewable terms

Medium term

Pending

ANNEX I

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth
rate, ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt. Data on debt service and amortization used in the
calculations are estimated.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and nominal exchange rate changes (REER is unchanged).
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

2008 Article IV Consultation: A staff team comprising B. Traa (Head), K. Honjo,
M. Moreno-Badia, C. Henn (all EUR), and A. Giustiniani (MCM) visited Madrid on
November 28–December 9, 2008 to conduct the 2008 Article IV Consultation
discussions. Mr. Guzman and Ms. Valle, from the Spanish Executive Director’s
office, joined the discussions. For outreach, the mission met with parliamentarians,
trade unions, employers’ organizations, bankers, and independent analysts. The
concluding statement was published and the staff report is expected to be published as
well. The Consultation includes background papers on (1) Developments in the
Spanish Housing Sector; (2) The Spanish Banking System; (3) Long-Run Fiscal
Outlook and the Public Sector Balance Sheet; and (4) Productivity Growth and
Structural Reforms. The Consultation is also informed by the country report
No. 08/145: France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, Competitiveness in the
Southern Euro Area. Spain is on a standard 12-month cycle. The last Article IV
consultation discussions were concluded on May 16, 2007 (EBM/07/42–1).

VI.

Exchange Rate Arrangements and Restrictions: Spain’s currency is the euro,
which floats freely and independently against other currencies. Spain has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange rate
system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions, other than restrictions notified to the Fund under Decision No. 144
(52/51).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
Spain
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation with Spain
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Martin Mühleisen
March 6, 2009
The following information has become available since the preparation of the staff report. This
information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
•

Projections for real GDP growth are being revised down. In the last quarter of 2008,
growth was -1.0 percent (Q/Q) compared with -0.7 percent projected in the staff report.
With weak activity continuing in the first quarter, the staff now projects that growth in 2009
could be as low as -3.0 percent, compared with -1.7 percent in the staff report. Moderate
quarterly growth is expected to resume in the first half of 2010.

•

CPI inflation is declining faster than expected. Inflation was 0.7 percent (Y/Y) in
February, reflecting the demand downturn and lower energy prices. It is now slightly below
euro-partner countries, and expected to remain very low in 2009 on average.

•

Unemployment is increasing faster than expected. In the last quarter of 2008, the
unemployment rate jumped to 13.9 percent. The staff believes that unemployment could
peak at over 19 percent of the workforce in 2010.

•

Imbalances are declining. The private sector is strongly cutting debt (the stock of mortgage
credit is declining in nominal terms). Lower euribor interest rates and energy prices are
providing a boost to households, but the momentum of declining activity with increasing
unemployment is holding back spending. Toward end-2008, imports started falling at a
double digit rate. Exports are falling slightly less and the external current account deficit is
shrinking substantially.

•

Fiscal results. The authorities increased their estimate for the 2008 general government
deficit to 3.8 percent of GDP. With this shift, and considering the downward revision in
growth, the staff is now projecting a 2009 fiscal deficit of 7½ percent of GDP. Spain has
lost its AAA credit rating and the sovereign spread over 10-year German bonds has risen
from 80 to around 115 bp.

•

The banking system made substantial profits in 2008, but these began to decline toward
year-end. With the recession accelerating, higher unemployment, and a continued drop in
home values, impaired loans have risen to 3½ percent for the banking system as a whole.

2
Loan-loss-provision coverage has declined to 70 percent (from above 200 percent as of end2007). Funding conditions remain tight, and banks have placed some 20 billion euros in
high-grade securities with the government’s liquidity assistance fund (FAAF). Some banks
have made use of government guarantees to place debt.
•

Bank consolidation. As foreshadowed in the staff report, pressure on the banking system is
increasing. In particular, savings banks (cajas) are contemplating mergers, even among cajas
in different regions, which would be unprecedented. The Spanish authorities have stated
their preference for market-based solutions of weaker institutions, but they also are ready to
assist banks with capital injections if this were to become necessary.

•

Structural reforms. The OECD is updating its product and service market reform
indicators. In the latest findings, Spain has made good progress, advancing in the rankings
among countries. However, labor market reforms are stuck, and the employers and unions
are making limited progress in the “Social Dialogue.” The government continues to be
concerned that modifications in severance pay arrangements and other market flexibilizing
reforms would be akin to undermining worker’s rights. Nevertheless, as indicated in the
report, staff sees the rigid labor structures as one reason for Spain’s competitiveness
difficulties and high rate of unemployment, accentuated at this time by the weakness in
aggregate demand.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Spain
On March 11, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Spain. 1
Background
After 15 years of impressive growth led by a housing boom, the Spanish economy has entered
a sharp downturn in the wake of the global liquidity squeeze since mid-2007. With reduced
funding for the large external deficit and housing boom, what started as a soft landing turned
into an abrupt unwinding of imbalances. Private consumption slowed markedly reflecting
weakening disposable incomes, uncertainty associated with rising unemployment, and efforts
to reduce private debt (deleveraging). Housing investment has slumped as have outlays on
machinery and equipment. In turn, the external current account deficit has started to narrow
from a deficit of 10 percent of GDP in 2007, with a lower oil import bill and domestic demand.
The general government balance has switched from moderate surpluses in 2005–07 to
sizeable deficits, reflecting discretionary measures to assist the economy during the downturn
and a drop in important tax bases, including housing. The debt ratio is increasing quickly from
a recent low of 36.2 percent of GDP.
Banks are under strain and impaired loans are increasing, reflecting the housing market
downturn and growing unemployment. Wholesale funding remains tight and competition to
attract deposits is intense. While banks have weathered well the first impact of the global crisis
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

thanks to prudent regulation, sound supervision, and cautious retail-oriented business models,
their operating environment is becoming very difficult with the extended deep downturn. The
authorities have put in place a valuable package of assistance measures for banks. This
includes extending deposit insurance and providing direct funding (Fondo para la Adquisición
de Activos Financieros) and funding guarantees.
Despite the economic slowdown, wage and unit-labor costs are outpacing those in europartner countries and inflation remains structurally above the euro average. This reflects
several factors including insufficiently contested domestic output markets, segmented labor
markets, and relatively low productivity and competitiveness.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, following a long period of strong growth, the Spanish economy
has entered a severe downturn. While a gradual correction of the imbalances built up during
the boom years had already been under way, the global financial crisis has triggered their
abrupt unwinding. Directors expected the downturn in 2009 to be substantial, driven by
deleveraging in the private sector and weak external conditions.
Directors commended the authorities for their timely and substantial fiscal and financial sector
responses to help cushion the downturn. They emphasized that these efforts need to be
complemented by reforms to bolster competitiveness and to avoid a prolonged period of slow
growth and high unemployment which would make returning to fiscal sustainability more
difficult. They underscored the need for sustained efforts to reduce domestic costs and
increase flexibility and productivity, aimed at slowing the growth of unit labor costs.
Directors concurred that adjustment in the housing sector would likely take time. They
welcomed the authorities’ efforts to activate the rental market to lower vacancies, and to
provide mortgage assistance to newly unemployed workers in order to limit foreclosures. Most
Directors questioned the desirability of building more subsidized homes given that they could
add to inventory at this time.
Directors commended Spain’s early application of bold countercyclical fiscal policies, and
encouraged the authorities to build on these policies to achieve growth-enhancing reforms.
They felt that automatic stabilizers should continue to function freely. Given the projected
increase in the public debt ratio and the possible need for assistance to banks, further fiscal
stimulus measures should be considered only if warranted by a further worsening of the
downturn. These measures should be well-targeted and aim at facilitating structural reforms.
More generally, Directors underscored the need for fiscal policies to be anchored in a prudent,
long-term sustainability framework. They encouraged the authorities to publish an intertemporal public sector balance sheet as part of the annual budget documents, showing the
debt already incurred and the consequences of present policies on future deficits. Given the

3
high costs associated with an aging population, Directors stressed the need for pension and
other long-term reforms to ensure fiscal sustainability.
Directors stressed the need for a vigorous implementation of product and labor market reforms
to improve competitiveness, reduce the inflation differential with the euro area, and increase
productivity. They welcomed the plans for product and service market reforms that are in line
with a unified EU market for goods and services, and looked forward to the timely
implementation of the relevant Directives. Directors generally called for comprehensive labor
market reforms. In this regard, most Directors underscored the importance of wage moderation
and differentiation by reducing wage indexation, combined with reforms to bolster labor
flexibility, employment, and competitiveness.
Directors praised the timely banking assistance and strong supervisory and regulatory policies,
including dynamic loan-loss provisions, which have helped banks weather the crisis well.
Nevertheless, the challenge remains to assist banks through the very difficult operating
environment, and to curtail the excessive reliance on wholesale funding. Directors welcomed
the design of the liquidity and funding assistance to banks, with appropriate sunset clauses
and pricing, and enhanced deposit insurance, as agreed with EU partners.
Directors expected that deteriorating asset quality and higher capitalization demanded by
markets would continue to weigh on the outlook, and increase the likelihood of consolidation in
the banking system. They welcomed the authorities’ readiness to act as necessary, focusing
on market-based solutions to the extent possible, complemented with the provision of capital if
needed to forestall eventual systemic pressures.
Directors noted that the vulnerability of the savings banks, stemming from their dependence on
local real estate activity, calls for close monitoring. They welcomed the increased acceptance
of interregional mergers, and considered that greater use of participating capital shares, as
conditions permit, would bolster balance sheets. Directors welcomed the continued strong
resilience of Spain’s two largest banks, while stressing that tight cross-border cooperation with
EU, U.S., and Latin American supervisors will remain crucial in these testing times.
