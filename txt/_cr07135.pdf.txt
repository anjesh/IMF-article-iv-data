KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation, Third Review
Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, and Request for Waiver of
Structural Performance Criterion
Prepared by Middle East and Central Asia Department
(in cooperation with other departments)
Approved by David Owen and Scott Brown
October 19, 2006
• Discussions for the 2006 Article IV consultation and third review under the PRGF arrangement approved
in February 2005 were held in Bishkek during August 15–30, 2006. The team comprised Messrs. Neuhaus
(head), Naseer, Kumah, Ms. Morsy (all MCD), Messrs. Sadikov (PDR), Skaarup (FAD), and Solé (MCM).
Mr. McHugh, the incoming resident representative, joined some of the meetings. Together with an
overlapping World Bank team, the mission also discussed potential Completion Point triggers under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative.
• The mission met President Bakiev; the Prime Minister and First Deputy Prime Minister; the Ministers of
Economy and Finance and of Labor and Social Protection; the Chairman of the NBKR; other senior
government officials; as well as parliamentarians and representatives of civil society and the business and
donor communities.
• In recent years, macroeconomic policy has been generally consistent with the Fund’s advice, but the track
record on structural reforms and governance issues has been mixed. In concluding the 2004 Article IV
consultation in November 2004, Directors commended the government for the prudent economic policies
of recent years, after the emergence of severe imbalances stemming from the 1998 Russian crisis. They
underscored, nonetheless, the need for further fiscal consolidation to underpin external debt sustainability.
At that time, Directors also discussed the staff’s Ex Post Assessment of Long-Term Program Engagement.
In May 2006, the Board completed the second review under the PRGF arrangement on a lapse-of-time
basis and endorsed the authorities’ Second Annual Progress Report on their PRS and the staffs’ JSAN.
• The attached Letter of Intent and Memorandum of Economic Policies (Attachments I and II) set out the
authorities’ economic program through end-2007.The authorities have requested completion of the third
review and a waiver for nonobservance of an end-June 2006 structural PC.
• The Kyrgyz Republic has accepted the obligations under Article VIII Sections 2 (a), 3, and 4 of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for
current international transactions. The NBKR continues to maintain a managed float exchange rate regime.
In line with their recent practice, the authorities have agreed to publication of this report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The government has maintained macroeconomic discipline, despite lingering political
tensions. Year-to-date performance under the PRGF-supported program has been good.
Inflation has been in line with program projections and will likely remain below the
5.7 percent end-year target. Moreover, there are encouraging signs of a rebound in economic
activity. All end-June quantitative targets were met—in some cases by wide margins—owing
partly to buoyant tax revenue. All structural benchmarks have also been met to date. Staff
supports the authorities’ request for a waiver for nonobservance of the end-June structural
PC on the transfer of Centerra shares to the State Property Fund, based on the remedial
actions they have taken to effectively fulfill the spirit of the missed PC.
The policy discussions focused on the government’s economic plans and structural
reform priorities going forward and the supporting role expected from the Fund and
other donors. They also touched on the opportunities and risks posed by proposals to boost
development spending. The new Country Development Strategy seeks to spur private sectorled growth and poverty eradication in a low-inflation environment. To achieve these goals,
the authorities plan to deepen reforms to remove structural bottlenecks and address
governance issues, as well as to enhance the business climate and the transparency and
efficiency of public sector operations.
The authorities’ program for 2007 targets a decline in inflation to 4½–5 percent and
output growth of 5½ percent. To that end, they will pursue a prudent monetary policy,
maintain the managed floating exchange rate regime, and cap the primary and the overall
fiscal deficits at about 3 percent of GDP. The government expects HIPC and MDRI debt
relief to underpin debt sustainability and create fiscal space for additional poverty reducing
spending.
The program envisages further improvements in tax administration and public
financial management to support fiscal consolidation and enhance the quality and
targeting of public spending. Staff stressed the need to carefully phase in the fiscal
decentralization mandated by parliament, and to ensure that any additional development
spending financed by asset sales or new external loans is of high quality and fully integrated
into the budgetary process. The program also features further steps to enhance the operations
of the central bank and modernize the financial system. Staff urged the authorities to secure
approval of pending legislation to increase the central bank’s autonomy, complete the
revenue-neutral tax reform launched earlier this year, and introduce a best-practice tax code.
Staff considers the risks to the outlook—stemming mainly from an escalation of
political tensions or internal pressures to relax fiscal discipline and slow the reform
drive—to be manageable on balance. On this basis, it recommends completion of the third
review under the PRGF arrangement.

I. DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE LATE 1990S
1.
The shock from the Russian financial crisis of 1998 and the authorities’ weak policy
response to it seriously destabilized the Kyrgyz economy in the latter part of the 1990s. The
accommodating policy stance avoided a downturn in economic activity, at the expense of
stubbornly high inflation and a spike in the fiscal and external current account deficits,
financed by a rapid and unsustainable buildup in external public debt. The economic
turbulence and lax enforcement of prudential requirements led to a number of bank failures
as loan delinquency increased rapidly.

2.
From late 2001, however, the government reasserted macroeconomic discipline
and established a good track record under successive PRGF-supported programs.
Identifying the external debt overhang as a fundamental constraint, the authorities launched a
multi-year fiscal adjustment underpinned by improvements in tax administration, prudent
spending and a streamlining of the Public Investment Program that had in part driven the
debt accumulation, while seeking to create the conditions for a rise in private investment. A
firm monetary policy helped reduce inflation and maintain a broadly stable nominal
exchange rate.
3.
The authorities also introduced market-oriented reforms to enhance prospects
for economic and social development, including price and trade liberalization, state
enterprise privatization, and elimination of directed subsidized credits. As a consequence,
overall economic performance improved, aided by a rapid rebound in activity in Russia and
Kazakhstan and soaring international gold prices. Nevertheless, recurrent gaps in
implementation of envisaged reforms and festering governance problems weakened the
effectiveness and credibility of the Akayev administration, prompting its collapse during the
March 2005 Tulip Revolution.

RECENT PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM

4.
Real GDP grew by 3.5 percent year-on-year during January–August 2006, after
a small contraction last year; excluding the Kumtor gold mine, which recently suffered a
serious accident, output rose by 6.6 percent during the period. Inflation (5.1 percent in the
12 months ending August) has remained in line with the program. For the year as a whole,
the authorities expect to keep inflation below the target of 5.7 percent, but they have scaled
back their real GDP growth projection to 4 percent.

5.
Since early 2006, monetary policy has been conducted in an environment of
stronger-than-expected foreign exchange receipts and continued remonetization.
Sizable unsterilized intervention has sparked a 40 percent increase in reserve money in the 12
months ending September, well above the program’s indicative limits. Despite this
intervention, mirrored in a rise in gross foreign exchange reserves to $690 million by endSeptember (4 months of projected 2007 imports of goods and services), the som has
appreciated by 4.7 percent against the dollar since the beginning of the year; in real effective

8
terms, it has appreciated by nearly 5 percent since end-2004. Private sector credit has grown
rapidly in the year-to-date, albeit from a low base. Nonperforming loans have decreased from
over 13 percent of total loans at end-2002 to 8½ percent in mid-2006, but their level has
remained relatively high and edged up in recent months. The NBKR has gradually increased
policy interest rates, which are now positive in real terms.

6.
The external current account deficit has widened over the past two years, to an
estimated 11 percent of GDP in 2006, despite a surge in workers’ remittances. The
deficit is being financed by a rise in the net capital and financial account balance, resulting in
a buildup in gross foreign reserves and a strengthening of the currency. Part of the current

9
account deterioration reflects a revision in the statistical series on shuttle trade, which was
mirrored by a large increase in net financial capital inflows including errors and omissions.1
Imports have increased rapidly, sparked by rising world fuel prices and strong demand for
consumer goods and construction materials, buoyed by the recovery in nongold domestic
activity. Despite persistently high world gold prices, gold exports have sagged due to a
gradual weakening in the grade of the Kumtor mine pit under exploration and a recent
accident in that mine. By contrast, nongold exports, which suffered from the political
turbulence associated with the March 2005 revolution, have since recovered, driven by rapid
growth in Russia and Kazakhstan.

The PRGF-supported program remains on track. All end-June quantitative
performance criteria (PCs) were met, in some cases by wide margins (Table 1). In particular,
the primary fiscal deficit before grants undershot the half-year target by 1 percent of GDP as
a result of revenue gains from stricter tax enforcement at customs and robust import growth.
Despite a faster-than-expected increase in current expenditure, total spending was in line
with the program due to delayed execution of the investment budget. Based on preliminary
third quarter data and the thrust of the supplementary budget that will shortly be sent to
parliament, the authorities expect to comfortably meet the full-year primary deficit target
(3.3 percent of GDP). Strong payroll tax collections allowed the Social Fund to clear old
arrears and make nationwide pension payments current, despite a 2 percentage-point payroll
tax reduction in January. The half-year indicative limit on the electricity sector’s quasi fiscal
1

There are indications that recorded workers’ remittances may be underestimated (thereby overstating the
current account deficit). An ongoing regional survey on immigration and remittances is expected to shed more
light on this problem.

10
deficit (QFD) was met owing to rising cash collections, and the annual limit of 5.9 percent of
GDP will also likely be met, aided by the unification of household tariffs in May 2006.
8.
All structural benchmarks through end-September 2006 were also met (Table 3).
The authorities are requesting a waiver for nonobservance of the end-June structural PC on
transferring shares in the Centerra Canadian mining conglomerate (held by the Kyrgyzaltyn
SOE) to the State Property Fund,2 based on a legal finding that the transfer would not be
feasible; they noted that an April 21 Kyrgyzaltyn board resolution—prohibiting Centerra
share sales without government authorization and specifying that proceeds from any sales
should be used in accordance with government guidelines—effectively fulfills the spirit of
the missed PC.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Overview
9.
The Article IV consultation discussions took stock of past economic performance
and the upcoming challenges faced by the government in the remaining four years of its
current term. The discussions included a review of the government’s macroeconomic plans
and structural reform priorities featured in the updated poverty reduction strategy that is
about to be finalized (now known as the Country Development Strategy (CDS)), as well as
the supporting role expected from the Fund and other donors. They also touched on the
opportunities and risks posed by evolving plans to boost development spending, sparked by
the heightened expectations aroused by the Tulip Revolution.
10.
The authorities indicated that in the period ahead, they will seek to spur private
sector-led growth in an environment of low inflation. They plan, however, to maintain the
macroeconomic stability that has become entrenched over the past several years, after the
severe economic dislocations and a hyper-inflation episode experienced during the early
years of independence. The government’s economic strategy is anchored on initiatives to
eradicate poverty and corruption, as well as to improve the business climate and the
efficiency and transparency of public sector operations. Accordingly, fiscal space anticipated
from debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and MDRI and from further strides in
domestic resource mobilization will be accompanied by improvements in the quality of
public spending. At the same time, the authorities expect to scale up and better target poverty
reducing spending to facilitate achievement of the Millennium Development Goals
(Table 16). An overarching challenge facing the administration is to defuse lingering
political tensions and smooth relations with parliament, especially to secure passage of
essential legislation.

These shares are currently valued at $360 million or 13 percent of GDP.

11.
The authorities indicated that the Kyrgyz Republic has a good potential for
rapid economic growth in the coming years. In this connection, they noted that it will be
essential to maintain macroeconomic stability, deepen economic reforms, and diversify the
economy to reduce its vulnerability to external shocks. Staff concurred with this assessment
and stressed that fully exploiting this potential would also hinge importantly on stabilizing
the political situation, asserting the rule of law, and continuing to tackle deep-seated
governance issues. In this vein, staff projects average real GDP growth of 5.2 percent during
2006–11, on the back of a recovery in gold output from the problems experienced in 2005–
06 and the coming on stream of new mines, as well as sustained increases in the nongold

12
manufacturing and services sectors underpinned by productivity gains and new investment.3
Per capita income would then rise to $760 by the end of the decade, from about $280 in
2000.
12.
After launching a revenue-neutral tax reform early this year,4 the authorities
now plan to focus on further improvements in tax and customs administration that
might eventually permit further rate reductions—especially of the onerous payroll tax.
In addition, the authorities are embarked on improvements in public financial management
with donor assistance that should help improve the quality and targeting of outlays. In
particular, they will take steps to improve budget preparation and execution and the tracking
of poverty reducing and other outlays.
13.
Besides the ongoing financial system reforms described below, the government is
also poised to add momentum to other growth and macrocritical reforms. Several
actions aligned with the CDS are envisaged to address deep-seated energy and mining sector
problems; foster good governance and transparency; promote social development; and
enhance the business climate,5 while addressing sectoral bottlenecks in infrastructure and
agriculture. Some of these reforms are expected to be fleshed out over the coming months as
floating HIPC Completion Point triggers, with the expectation that they would be
substantially completed by end-2008. The authorities are also considering further measures
to improve labor market flexibility, in order to foster job creation and encourage legalization
of the economy (MEP, ¶22).
B. Short- and Medium-Term Economic Policies
14.
The authorities’ economic program for 2007 targets a decline in end-year
inflation to 4½–5 percent and real GDP growth of 5½ percent, premised on a recovery
in gold output and buoyant growth in agriculture, construction and services. The
monetary program assumes continued remonetization of the economy. It limits reserve
money

For details, see the Preliminary HIPC Initiative Document (see IMF Country Report No. 06/147).

The package included cuts in the corporate and personal income taxes and in the payroll tax, accompanied by
hikes in the rates of motor vehicle, nonagricultural land (pending), and liquor excise taxes (see IMF Country
Report No. 05/402).

A February 2006 government order convened an inter-agency commission tasked with proposing measures to
reduce barriers on business activities and streamlining the operations of law enforcement and regulatory bodies.

experience and prospects are summarized below. The results need to be qualified, however, given the
shortcomings in the database and the large (if declining) share of the underground economy. Growth is
expected to rebound and average 5.2 percent a year in 2006–11, assuming continued fiscal consolidation
to crowd-in the private sector and successful implementation of reforms, including to improve the
business environment. This would improve employment opportunities and living conditions and reduce
poverty in line with the CDS.

•

Output decline in the early 1990s was driven by capacity underutilization, factor diminution, and a
decline in total factor productivity (TFP) stemming from the severe dislocations associated with the
collapse of the USSR. Significant TFP gains spurred growth from the late 1990s.

•

Growth during 2006–10 would be driven by continued factor accumulation and productivity
increases. These dynamics are expected to be aided by fiscal consolidation and improvements in the
business environment. Factor accumulation would contribute 2 percentage points and the TFP
contribution to growth would increase to 3.3 percentage points, from a 2.9 percentage-point average
in 1999–2005. The capital stock would grow at an annual average of 3 percent, providing a
contribution to growth of 0.9 percentage points—a fourfold-increase from the average in 2001–05.
Labor productivity would also increase somewhat, supported by improvements in skills acquisition
(through enhanced on-the-job training), health conditions and greater labor market flexibility.

A staff sensitivity analysis (maintaining a 5 percent depreciation rate) shows that a 20 percent variation
in the initial capital stock would impact little on the distribution of factor contributions to growth—
yielding only a 0.2 percentage-point variation in medium-term real GDP growth. However, an annual
one percentage-point shortfall in capital stock growth would yield a more than proportionate decline in
output growth and limit medium-term factor accumulation and TFP growth.

14
growth to 22½ percent, consistent with broad money growth of 24 percent during the year
and a gain in net international reserves that would keep end-year gross reserves at 4.3 months
of projected imports of goods and services. The fiscal stance would be broadly unchanged
from 2006, with a primary deficit before grants of just under 3 percent and a similar overall
cash deficit, covered from external sources and privatization proceeds. As indicated in the
attached Memorandum of Economic Policies (MEP), the program includes quantitative PCs
and structural benchmarks through June 2007 and indicative end-year targets; the
quantitative targets may need to be updated at the time of the 4th review under the
arrangement early next year to reflect interim HIPC Initiative assistance after reaching the
Decision Point.
15.
Influential political leaders and interest groups have been advocating a vigorous
industrial policy, including rehabilitation of obsolete Soviet-era plants and promotion of
“strategic” sectors (e.g., fertilizer and cement plants). This would be accompanied by large
investments in infrastructure, such as a rail link from China to Uzbekistan crossing the
Kyrgyz Republic; expansion of power transmission lines; and installation of fiber-optics
cables. These projects would possibly involve FDI or external loans that are at an advanced
stage of negotiation. Furthermore, and echoing the public’s expectations of rapid results—
fueled by pent-up frustrations with the limited progress made by the previous government—
there are political pressures for injecting an aggregate demand stimulus into the economy,
especially through creation of a development fund to provide directed subsidized credits or
top-up the public investment program, which could be financed with the proceeds from asset
sales (especially the sizable public sector holdings of Centerra shares).
16.
Staff advised the authorities to limit direct intervention in the economy and
focus on creating a business climate conducive to private-sector led growth. It also urged
them to carefully assess the viability of large infrastructure projects, with assistance from
expert IFIs. Further, staff flagged the inherent risks of an active industrial policy (e.g.,
resource misallocation, forgone tax revenue, and rent-seeking), which would be exacerbated
by the governance problems that remain to be tackled. More generally, staff underscored that
any significant fiscal or credit stimulus financed by asset sales or external loans should be
transparent and closely aligned with the annual economic programs to safeguard near-term
macrostability and longer-term debt sustainability.
Fiscal and quasi-fiscal issues
17.
The 2007 budget bill sent to parliament in August, which is aligned with the CDS
and the Medium-Term Budgetary Framework published last May, envisages further
revenue gains stemming from stricter tax enforcement and passage of a pending bill
increasing nonagricultural land taxes. Staff urged the authorities to secure prompt passage
of the best-practice tax code before parliament to underpin further improvements in tax
administration (an end-March 2007 structural benchmark), and to resist political pressures to
weaken the State Tax Inspectorate and the Large Taxpayers Unit (LTU) (broadening the

15
coverage of the LTU is an end-September structural benchmark). Despite the recent gain in
tax receipts (which was, however, heavily tilted towards customs duties and VAT on
imports—partly reflecting better customs administration and introduction of simplified
procedures for shuttle traders), there is scope for further strengthening the Kyrgyz tax effort,
as evidenced by a comparison with the experience of several other CIS countries.

18.
The budget’s expenditure envelope features an average 10 percent increase in
government wages and pensions, which are still relatively low, and a rise in capital
spending in relation to GDP (MEP, ¶12–14). Social spending is expected to increase to
15¾ percent of GDP, from a projected 15½ percent in 2006, and priority expenditures could
be topped up if interim assistance under the HIPC Initiative becomes available in 2007. To
cushion the effect on vulnerable groups of phased adjustments in power tariffs during the
year (see below), the budget includes a social safety net equivalent to 0.4 percent of GDP. As
part of the ongoing civil service reform, the authorities intend to reduce the civilian
workforce (currently estimated at 25,000 persons) by about 10 percent over the next two
years and to introduce performance-based competitive salaries for key personnel, while
keeping the wage bill broadly constant relative to GDP over the medium term. Moreover, the
government plans to implement a Public Financial Management (PFM) action plan over the
next two years prepared in consultation with donors, focusing on strengthening budget
transparency and enhancing the tracking, monitoring, and reporting of poverty related
spending (an end-June 2007 structural benchmark).

16
19.
Parliament has mandated a gradual reduction in the retirement age with
potentially serious longer-term fiscal consequences, and overturned the June 2006
presidential veto to that bill. Faced with this stalemate, the government is refusing to
enforce this legislation and seeking World Bank assistance to design a broader pension
reform, possibly including a voluntary private pension pillar (Box 2). Besides helping ensure
the longer term financial viability of a downsized pay-as-you go system, the authorities
expect the reform to strengthen domestic savings and spark capital market development.
Staff stressed the need for a broad political consensus on the way forward, following an
ample debate on the trade-offs between lowering the retirement age, raising pension benefits
and further lowering payroll taxes.6 Should a fully funded private scheme emerge as a
consensus centerpiece of the reform, it would need to be phased in gradually to limit the
transitional fiscal costs.
20.
Parliament also passed a bill in 2003 mandating far-reaching fiscal
decentralization, a dormant measure slated to gather pace from 2007 (MEP, ¶15). The
plan is to move to a two-tier system comprising the center and local communities—
effectively bypassing the provincial (oblast) and municipal governments—to increase the
scope for decision-making at the grassroots level. The authorities see this as a political
imperative, despite the teething problems that will likely emerge. To safeguard
macroeconomic stability, staff advised them to phase in the process carefully and at a
measured pace, pari passu with the buildup in local government capacity, including
strengthening PFM at the local level and a clear demarcation of revenue sharing and
expenditure responsibilities of each government tier. Introducing a harmonized framework
for fiscal coordination and general government reporting would further facilitate the
transition to the two-tier system.
21.
The energy sector action plan just submitted by the authorities (as an endSeptember structural benchmark) features measures to put the sector’s financial
position on a sound footing, deliver reliable power supplies, and create the basis for
significant energy exports to neighboring counties (MEP, ¶16). A principal goal is to
reduce the electricity sector’s QFD to 5½ percent of GDP in 2007 (an indicative program
target).7 This should be achieved through phased adjustments of tariffs from late 2006 to
reach cost-recovery levels by 2010, and supporting steps to strengthen utility bill collections,
reduce technical losses and theft, and increase private participation in the distribution

6

In line with the priority it attaches to job creation, the government will reduce the payroll tax by 2 percentage
points in two equal steps in April and October 2007, to 27 percent, bringing it closer to the 25 percent mediumterm target.

7

According to the updated methodology on cost recovery tariffs agreed between the authorities and the World
Bank, the historical QFD series has been revised upwards and the 2006 deficit is now projected at 7.4 percent of
GDP (vs. the original forecast of 5.9 percent).

17

Box 2. Kyrgyz Republic: Pension Reform Issues
The foundations of the current pension system were set with World Bank assistance in 1997, comprising the
gradual introduction of a notional defined contribution system, a minimum guaranteed pension (12 percent of
the economy-wide salary) for all retirees, and stronger links between contributions and benefits. These measures
were supported by a phased increase in the retirement age from 60/55 years (men/women) to 62.7/57.7 years at
present and 63/58 years by 2007.
Earlier this year, however, parliament overturned a presidential veto on a bill lowering the retirement age to its
previous level by 2008. Realizing that this would jeopardize the pensions system’s long-term viability, the
government has so far not enforced the bill (estimated to entail an annual average cost of ¾ percent of GDP over
the next four years, rising further over time). More generally, easing retirement would run counter to
international pension reform trends, including in the CIS region as indicated in the comparator data below, and
complicate the achievement of the government’s twin goals of further reducing payroll taxes and enhancing
pension benefits over time.

The authorities are exploring the option of introducing a funded pillar to the pension system in 2008, which
would entail annual fiscal costs roughly estimated as rising from 0.1 percent to 0.5 percent of GDP during
2009–13, and stabilizing at that level until the system fully matures. This scenario would include a gradual
increase in the funded component of payroll tax contributions by 6 percentage points and a gradual reduction by
5 percentage points in the pay-as-you-go component. The World Bank has cautioned the authorities on the risks
of introducing a funded pension pillar before the prerequisites are fully in place, including a robust financial
market and capacity-building in portfolio management by participating institutions.
The fiscal costs of the funded pension pillar could be mitigated by increasing the minimum years of payroll tax
contributions for those seeking retirement or introducing base-broadening measures. For example, a permanent
increase in the coverage of payroll tax collections from a projected 24.5 percent of the economy’s wage bill in
2006 to about 26 percent would raise revenues by about ¼ percent of GDP. As a separate element of a broader
pension reform, the option of early retirement with reduced pensions could be considered as a step to lessen
pressures for reducing the general retirement age.

utilities. Meanwhile, the authorities are also reviewing World Bank proposals to strengthen
the financial position of the gas and coal sectors, possibly including the automatic passthrough of gas import costs and competitive tendering for multi-year procurement of
imported fuel.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
22.
The monetary authorities expressed satisfaction with the decline in inflation over
the past several months, and saw the rapid growth in money and credit aggregates as a
healthy manifestation of financial deepening. In anticipation of a further rapid increase in
credit to the private sector, the authorities will step up bank supervision, especially
monitoring financial soundness indicators closely and taking prompt remedial measures as
warranted. Nonbank financial institutions are also growing rapidly from a low base, and an
Agency for Financial Surveillance and Reporting was created in 2005 to regulate pension
funds, insurance companies, foreign exchange bureaus, and the securities market. The
authorities indicated that they plan to refine money demand forecasts, particularly to better
reflect the importance of dollarization and the large shadow economy. The NBKR will also
broaden the menu of monetary control instruments and price these instruments more flexibly
to keep liquidity expansion in check (MEP, ¶17). Increasing the NBKR’s autonomy is key to
underpin investor confidence, longer-term economic stability, and the momentum of
financial sector reforms, but prospects for passage of the enabling legislation before
parliament are uncertain.
23.
Although financial intermediation remains shallow by international standards,
the authorities are making good progress in modernizing the financial system (MEP,
¶18). In particular, they have embarked on a medium-term banking sector development
strategy with MCM and World Bank assistance, comprising actions to modernize the
payment system, nurture microfinance, and introduce a deposit insurance scheme in late
2008 (Box 3). In this connection, they have introduced a phased increase in bank capital
requirements and continued to strengthen bank supervision. They also plan to transition to
international capital measures and standards under Basel II guidelines after further
implementation of the recommendations of the 2005 Basel Core Principles assessment.
Initiatives under way include (a) establishment of a sounder legal foundation for use and for
seizure (in case of default) of collateral, to foster mortgage and other term lending; and
(b) preparatory steps towards introduction of an insurance scheme for small depositors by
late 2008. The authorities are also planning to pave the way for the development of Islamic
banking—so far virtually nonexistent in the country—in light of the interest of certain donors
in financing these operations. In the coming months, the NBKR will issue enabling
regulations on Islamic banking and train supervisors for its implementation, possibly with
MCM technical assistance. The gamut of financial sector reforms will be reviewed by the
joint Fund/World Bank FSAP update mission scheduled for October 2006.

19
24.
The authorities indicated that the small real appreciation of the som since end2004 had not materially affected external competitiveness. Staff concurred with this
assessment, based on the sustained increase in nongold exports and other indicators, such as
market shares and relative wage costs (Box 4). The officials noted that the managed
exchange rate float had served them well in dealing with strong net foreign exchange receipts
over the past months. In this vein, they expected to limit foreign exchange market
intervention mainly to smoothing fluctuations and securing the programmed international
reserve buildup. Staff cautioned that any significant aggregate demand stimulus (e.g., with
proceeds from asset sales or external borrowing) could further exacerbate pressures towards
a real appreciation of the currency, thereby underscoring the importance of buttressing
competitiveness over the medium term through productivity gains and economy-wide wage
moderation.

External Sector Issues
25.
To avoid a new cycle of debt buildup as the country seeks external debt relief,
the public sector will continue to refrain from nonconcessional external borrowing or
guarantees. The government will also ensure that any concessional public borrowing meets
the 45 percent floor on the grant element specified in the program (MEP, ¶23). Staff
underscored that the quality of large private investment projects in the pipeline should be
carefully vetted to forestall the potential emergence of contingent public sector liabilities.
The authorities are also taking steps to further enhance external debt management institutions
and procedures, including capacity building and formulation of a new external debt
management strategy by end-March 2007, a structural benchmark under the program (MEP,
¶24). To align the coverage of public debt with the requirements under the HIPC Initiative,
the authorities are conducting a survey of nonguaranteed external debt of public enterprises.

20

Box 3. Kyrgyz Republic: Financial Sector Reforms, 2000–06
In the aftermath of the Russian financial crisis, which led to bank failures in the Kyrgyz Republic, the monetary
authorities set up a debt and bank restructuring agency in 2000 as the sole liquidator of failed banks, and they
have since taken steps to enhance the resilience of the financial sector to shocks. The authorities also adopted a
regulatory response policy aimed at (a) ensuring transparency and predictability of regulatory enforcement,
while making it less prone to discretion and arbitrariness; and (b) reducing political maneuvering to circumvent
banking regulations. The broad reform agenda going forward includes steps to (i) encourage consolidation of the
banking system; (ii) enhance bank supervision and the NBKR’s autonomy; (iii) bolster the payment system; and
(iv) enhance confidence in the banking system and foster further financial deepening. Specific actions in these
areas are summarized below:
(i) Consolidating the banking system: In early 2006, the authorities increased minimum capital requirements
on banks to som 60 million ( $1.5 million); they are scheduled to rise further to som 100 million ($2.5 million)
from January 2008. They have also strengthened their assessment of banks’ compliance with prudential
requirements.
(ii) Enhancing bank supervision and the NBKR’s autonomy: The NBKR has taken steps to enhance bank
supervision, including hiring highly qualified staff and upgrading staff training. In addition, it has developed a
supervisory framework for market, country, and transfer risk as recommended by the September 2004 advisory
mission of MFD (now MCM); the NBKR has since instructed banks to maintain adequate capital to cover these
risks with effect from January 2007 and it has maintained close contacts with foreign bank supervisors,
particularly in Russia and Kazakhstan. The NBKR has also introduced regulations for consolidated supervision
to monitor risks faced by financial institutions, in line with the recommendations of the 2005 Basel Core
Principles for Effective Banking Supervision Assessment. A bill before parliament seeks to amend the central
bank charter to enhance its autonomy and ensure legal protection of its employees in performing official duties.
(iii) Bolstering the payment system: In 2006, the authorities formulated an action plan to develop the payment
system, including payment of utility bills and salaries of civil servants through banks—to be subsequently
extended to all payments to and from hospitals and schools. To support the gradual transition to payments
through banks, the NBKR will commission a bulk clearing and cash processing center by end-November 2006,
which will help extend the system of payments through banks to all public sector employees and enterprises. In
addition, the NBKR is moving ahead with plans to develop a real-time gross settlement system with World
Bank assistance, and it is preparing tender documents for general ledger development contracts to help develop
a nexus of payments and depository functions and enhance interbank operations.
(iv) Enhancing financial intermediation: To boost confidence in the banking system and protect depositors,
the NBKR is poised to introduce a deposit insurance scheme for small depositors by late 2008. Enabling
legislation on deposit insurance has already been submitted to parliament and the NBKR has drawn up the
modalities for commercial banks’ participation; it has also estimated the level of protection, the total cost and
the cost-sharing between banks and the government. To enhance debtor information gathering by lenders, the
NBKR created a Credit Information Bureau in 2000, which was transformed (with donor assistance) into an
independent credit bureau in 2003. Further, the authorities will issue a privatization tender for the Kyrgyz
Agricultural Finance Corporation by end-2006. More generally, the pace of financial deepening will depend on
progress in legal and judicial reforms, and establishment of effective contract enforcement mechanisms. The
authorities plan to amend the civil, housing and land codes and the laws governing collateral, to harmonize
provisions on collateralized lending by financial institutions and facilitate collateral seizure in cases of default.
(v) AML/CFT developments: New AML and CFT legislation entered into force in August 2006. The newly
established Financial Intelligence Unit is proposing enabling amendments to the relevant criminal codes.

21

Box 4. Kyrgyz Republic: Competitiveness Indicators
•

Competitiveness in purchasing power parity terms seems to have changed little in the past half
decade, as the appreciation of the som against the dollar and the Chinese yuan was largely offset by the
som’s depreciation against the Russian ruble and the Kazakh tenge. In real effective terms, the som
stayed broadly flat during the period. This came after a real appreciation in the mid-1990s (similar to the
experience of other transition economies whose currencies had become increasingly undervalued), and a
sharp depreciation during the 1998–99 Russian crisis. While the Fund’s INS series is based on a simple
average of 1999–2000 trade weights, the NBKR’s nominal and real effective exchange rate index is
built using a three-year moving average of trade weights excluding gold and energy exports.

•

Penetration of Kyrgyz exports in its three main trading partners (Russia, Kazakhstan and China), which
together account for over two-thirds of total exports, increased in 2003–04 (after a slump in 2001). Part
of this ground was lost in 2005, as Kyrgyz output and exports were buffeted by the March 2005 political
developments, but preliminary half-year data for 2006 suggest that nongold exports have increased
rapidly.

•

Trade-weighted relative wage costs have remained broadly unchanged since 2000, and remain lower
than during the preceding five years (within that period, Kyrgyz wage premia relative to the main
trading partners during 1995-97 shifted into sizable relative discounts in the aftermath of the Russian
crisis).

26.
The Kyrgyz Republic is an active member of regional integration initiatives
under the Eurasian Economic Community (EURASEC).8 During their recent summit in
Sochi, EURASEC members agreed to work towards a common energy market and develop a
concept paper on hydropower regulations in Central Asia. In addition, Belarus, Kazakhstan
and Russia are preparing the legal groundwork for introduction of a customs union. The
Kyrgyz authorities noted that they might join that union after other EURASEC members join
the WTO, so that their most-favored-nation import tariffs would be similar to the relatively
low rates applied by the Kyrgyz Republic—the first CIS member of the WTO.
27.
Despite a notable improvement in regional transit systems in recent years, the
authorities look forward to a further easing of costly external barriers to Kyrgyz
exports. They saw the agreement with Kazakhstan allowing permit-free cargo and passenger
transit through its territory as an important first step, but noted the scope for further
liberalization, especially regarding the payment of various fees and cumbersome truck
inspections. They also hope to secure an easing of very costly customs escort procedures
imposed by Uzbekistan on excisable goods (i.e., the vast majority) transported through its
territory.
Technical Assistance and Data Issues
28.
The authorities expressed appreciation for the TA provided by the Fund in
recent years, especially in the fiscal, financial sector and statistical areas (Appendix I).
Going forward, they count on assistance to follow up on the findings of the upcoming FSAP
update mission, as well as on Islamic banking and development of a government securities
market. The quality and timeliness of economic data have improved over the years, but there
is scope for further enhancing the quality of real sector and balance of payments data. The
Kyrgyz Republic subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards in February 2004,
and data provided to the Fund are generally adequate for program monitoring and
surveillance.
C. Capacity to Repay and Medium-Term Risks
29.
Despite a significant improvement in the Kyrgyz Republic’s debt indicators
since 2000, reflecting prudent debt management, fiscal consolidation, and the
concessional March 2005 Paris Club restructuring,9 the external debt burden remains
8

Other members include Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Armenia, Moldova and
Ukraine are observers.

9

Restructuring agreements have been signed with all Paris Club creditors. Regarding non-Paris Club creditors,
Pakistan converted all Kyrgyz debt into a grant and negotiations with China, India and Korea are advanced.
Progress in discussions with other creditors has been slow, despite best-faith efforts from the Kyrgyz Republic.

23
heavy. This is borne out by the joint debt sustainability analysis undertaken by Fund and
World Bank staffs (Annex I).10 The end-2005 ratios of the NPV of debt to GDP (46 percent)
and to government revenue (277 percent) exceed the sustainability thresholds set for lowincome countries in the same peer group of medium performers (based on the World Bank’s
Country Performance and Institutional Assessment index), namely 40 percent and
250 percent, respectively. By contrast, the ratios of the NPV of debt to exports (120 percent)
and of debt service to exports (7½ percent) are well below the indicative thresholds of
150 percent and 20 percent, respectively.
30.
All critical debt indicators are projected to fall under threshold levels in the next few
years in the staffs’ baseline scenario, and to continue improving throughout the projection
period, although their evolution is highly sensitive to the assumptions underlying the
projections or to shocks portrayed in stress tests. In addition, the Kyrgyz Republic has
established a record of timely servicing its obligations to the Fund, and its capacity to repay
the Fund going forward is expected to remain strong.
31.
Risks to the outlook (which appear manageable on balance) stem mainly from
possible escalation of political tensions or internal pressures to relax fiscal reform
discipline and slow the reform drive. These risks would be mitigated by greater
accountability and transparency from all branches of government. Continued engagement of
the donor community through a close policy dialogue and technical and financial support to
the reform effort could also play a part.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
After coping with the dislocations stemming from the collapse of the USSR and
the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the previous administration left a legacy of entrenched
macroeconomic stability. The government liberalized the economy early on and launched
other comprehensive structural changes, but the reform effort weakened over time and
serious governance issues were allowed to fester. This led to growing disenchantment of the
citizenry, culminating in the March 2005 Tulip Revolution.
33.
The new administration has shown commendable resolve in maintaining
macroeconomic stability, despite lingering political tensions. In particular, it has
displayed fiscal prudence and pledged continued adherence to market-friendly policies aimed
at fostering private sector-led growth and eradicating poverty. The authorities secured
approval of a revenue-neutral tax package (featuring rate cuts to ease the burden on capital
and labor) and unified household electricity tariffs, as part of a longer-term drive to put the
power sector on a stronger footing. Meanwhile, they have continued to modernize the
10

Domestic public debt at 7 percent of GDP is relatively low and not expected to materially rise in the
foreseeable future.

24
financial system and introduced a new legal framework to curtail money laundering and the
financing of terrorism.
34.
Performance in the year-to-date year under the PRGF-supported economic
program has been good. Inflation has remained in line with the program and is expected to
stay below the end-year target of 5.7 percent. The outlook for output growth during the year
has been scaled back to 4 percent because of an accident in a major gold mine, but there are
encouraging signs of a rebound in activity in other sectors. All end-June quantitative PCs
were met, in some cases by wide margins, owing partly to buoyant revenue from import
transactions, and all structural benchmarks have also been met to date. Staff supports the
authorities’ request for a waiver for nonobservance of the end-June structural PC on the
transfer of Centerra shares to the State Property Fund, based on the remedial actions they
have taken to effectively fulfill the spirit of the missed PC.
35.
Going forward, the Kyrgyz Republic’s new Country Development Strategy,
designed in consultation with domestic stakeholders and donors, provides a good
platform for action. The overarching purpose of the CDS is to realize the country’s
promising potential for growth in a low-inflation environment, while improving the lot of the
poor and moving towards achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Besides
political stability and firm adherence to the rule of law, progress in that direction will require
bold efforts to tackle governance issues, improve the business climate, and diversify the
economy under the stewardship of the private sector. The authorities should also proceed to
implement promptly the energy sector action plan designed with World Bank assistance. This
will be crucial to reduce the sector’s sizable quasi-fiscal deficit, provide adequate power
supplies to the growing economy, and tap into the considerable potential for regional energy
exports. Furthermore, staff would caution the authorities about the risks (in terms of resource
misallocation, forgone tax revenue, and rent-seeking opportunities) of the expansive
industrial policy that has been floated recently by influential business and political groups.
36.
Against this backdrop, the authorities’ economic program for 2007
appropriately seeks to maintain macroeconomic stability—targeting a decline in endperiod inflation to 4½–5 percent and a rebound in real GDP growth to 5½ percent. To
that end, the authorities plan to keep the primary fiscal balance before grants below 3 percent
of GDP—broadly unchanged from 2006. In addition, their prudent monetary program seeks
to moderate the growth of liquidity and secure a further buildup in international reserves that
would slightly raise the import coverage of gross reserves.
37.
The authorities plan to gradually divest their shares in the Centerra mining
conglomerate and use the proceeds to spur growth. These resources would likely be
channeled through a development fund that could be set up shortly, which would need to be
fully integrated into the general government budget and subject to close parliamentary
scrutiny. In this regard, topping up investment in high-yielding public projects seems

25
preferable to stoking the ongoing credit boom. Moreover, the government should refrain
from reintroducing directed subsidized lending by the financial system. In any event, it will
be important to closely align any additional poverty reducing spending made possible by
interim assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, as well as any additional aggregate
demand stimulus financed by asset sales or external loans, with the annual economic
programs. As such, some modifications to the 2007 economic program may be warranted at
the time of the fourth review under the arrangement in early 2007.
38.
In the fiscal area, the top priorities are to strengthen tax administration so as to
establish a solid foundation for fiscal consolidation, and to deepen the ongoing reforms
in public financial management—including improvements in budgetary design and
execution and in the tracking and targeting of poverty reducing spending. Meanwhile,
every effort should be made to secure approval of the increase in nonagricultural land taxes
and the best-practice tax code that are both before parliament, as well as to resist vestedinterest pressures for slowing the reforms of the State Tax Inspectorate and the Large
Taxpayers Unit. Furthermore, the authorities need to carefully phase in the fiscal
decentralization mandated by parliament to avert a loss in fiscal control, while seeking to
build capacity and clearly demarcating the fiscal responsibilities of each tier of government.
39.
The authorities’ continue to object to the reduction in the retirement age, despite
strong political pressures. To break the stalemate with parliament, the government would
be advised to continue working towards broad understandings on a fiscally sustainable
pension reform, while clearly communicating to the public the tradeoffs between lowering
the retirement age, on the one hand, and further reducing the payroll tax and increasing
pension benefits over time, on the other hand. Going forward, the pension reform proposals
under consideration should be carefully assessed with expert international assistance.
Creation of a voluntary, privately funded pension pillar could have positive spillovers on
private savings and capital market development, provided the appropriate prerequisites are
put in place beforehand and the new system is phased in gradually to mitigate transitional
fiscal costs.
40.
The authorities have successfully kept inflationary pressures in check, thanks in
part to continued remonetization of the economy. However, high international fuel prices
and the envisaged phased hikes in electricity and natural gas tariffs, as well as the prospects
for scaling-up the 2007 spending envelope (with resources from interim HIPC assistance and
additional asset sales or external loans) could rekindle price pressures and call for a tighter
monetary stance. The authorities should also continue strengthening bank supervision and
take remedial actions if the quality of loan portfolios deteriorates as a result of the ongoing
credit boom. More generally, the authorities’ plans to deepen financial reform are sound and
the upcoming FSAP update mission should provide a good opportunity to fine-tune them.
Meanwhile, staff urges the government to seek prompt passage of the amendments to the
central bank charter and pertinent legal codes aimed at strengthening the NBKR’s autonomy.

26

41.
Debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI could play an important role in
underpinning macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, while creating fiscal
space for additional poverty reducing spending. The authorities are taking welcome steps
to further enhance external debt management, and the program continues to preclude the
contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional external loans. To avoid a new cycle of debt
buildup and forestall the emergence of contingent public sector liabilities, the government
should also ensure that large private investments for which it may help secure external
financing are of the highest caliber.
42.
The managed exchange rate float regime maintained by the Kyrgyz Republic
has served the country well over the past several years. Staff concurs with the authorities’
assessment that external competitiveness as gauged by a number of indicators remains
broadly adequate. The authorities would be advised, nonetheless, to refrain from significant
unsterilized intervention in the near future, in order to help keep liquidity growth in check.
Over the longer term, it will also be important to buttress competitiveness by fostering
productivity gains and pursuing prudent wage policies.
43.
In sum, the new government has established a record of prudent macroeconomic
management during its first year-and-a-half in office. The challenge going forward is to
leverage these gains to enhance the opportunities for rapid, sustained economic and social
development. The structural reforms envisaged in the CDS, including those embedded in the
PRGF-supported program, provide a solid blueprint for action. Success in these endeavors
will hinge, however, on smoothing relations with parliament to secure passage of essential
legislation, and a skillful communication effort to forge a strong domestic consensus on the
reform agenda. While there are a number of risks in the outlook—stemming mainly from a
possible escalation of political tensions or internal pressures to relax fiscal discipline and
slow the reform drive—these risks appear manageable. On this basis, staff recommends
completion of the third review under the PRGF arrangement.
44.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with the Kyrgyz Republic take
place within 24 months, subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in
program countries.

ANNEX I. KYRGYZ REPUBLIC: JOINT IMF-WORLD BANK DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The staff’s debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that the Kyrgyz Republic’s external
debt continues to pose a heavy burden, placing the country at a high risk of debt distress.
The debt outlook remains highly vulnerable to exogenous shocks or reversals of the prudent
macroeconomic policies that have become entrenched in recent years. Accordingly, careful
debt management and donor support on highly concessional terms will be crucial to ensure
that debt indicators remain on a downward path.
1.
The DSA presented below was prepared jointly by Fund and World Bank staffs
in consultation with the authorities, using the joint Bank-Fund Low-Income Country
Debt Sustainability Framework (LIC DSF).1, 2 Macroeconomic assumptions underlying
the baseline scenario in this DSA (Box 1) are consistent with the framework presented in the
staff report for the 2006 Article IV Consultations and in the preliminary HIPC document
(IMF Country Report No. 06/417 dt. November 2006). The external debt data used for this
exercise were updated by staffs using information provided by the authorities for the stock of
debt as of end-2004 and information on disbursements and debt restructuring agreements
signed in 2005.3
I. Background: structure of external debt and developments in 2005
2.
The Kyrgyz Republic’s nominal stock of public and publicly guaranteed
external debt as of end-2005 is estimated at $1,918 million (79 percent of GDP). In
present value terms, this is equivalent to $1,133 million (46 percent of GDP), of which
72 percent is owed to IFIs and the remaining 28 percent to bilateral creditors.

1

There are important conceptual and methodological differences between a DSA conducted under the HIPC
Initiative and the LIC DSF. The latter is a forward-looking exercise aimed at helping frame sustainable, countryspecific borrowing and fiscal policies in low-income countries, while the former focuses on assessing eligibility
for HIPC Initiative debt relief and calculating its amounts using fixed uniform thresholds to ensure uniformity of
treatment across countries. NPV of debt under the LIC DSA is calculated using (a) a fixed 5 percent discount
rate, compared to currency-specific discount rates for HIPC DSA; (b) WEO exchange rate projections
(compared to fixed exchange rates as of the end of the base year; and (c) annual exports (compared to three-year
average of exports, net of re-exports) as the denominator in the debt burden-to-exports ratios. Findings of the
LIC DSA have no bearing on a country’s status under the enhanced HIPC Initiative (see www.imf.org)
“Operational Framework for Debt Sustainability Assessments in Low-Income Countries––Further
Considerations.”)

2

The last LIC DSA (external debt only) prepared by Fund staff was included in the request for the current
PRGF arrangement (IMF Country Report No. 05/119).

3

These data refer to public and publicly guaranteed external debt. The 2004 stock of debt was reconciled and
used in the DSA for the preliminary HIPC document.

51
3.
The March 2005 Paris Club agreement was a key factor influencing public
external debt in 2005. Paris Club creditors agreed to restructure the country’s bilateral
obligations on concessional terms and provided considerable immediate cash relief. On ODA
loans, they granted a 40-year repayment period with 13 years’ grace, at interest rates at least
as favorable as the original concessional rates. On non-ODA credits, they agreed to halve the
NPV, following either the debt reduction or debt service-reduction options. Further, to grant
temporary cash flow relief, creditors capitalized 80 percent, 75 percent, 70 percent, and
65 percent of interest accrued in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively, and extended the
repayment period to 23 years with a 7-year grace period. The authorities have completed
bilateral agreements with all Paris Club creditors and are currently conducting negotiations
with the remaining bilateral creditors. Staffs estimate that full participation of all bilateral
creditors at comparable terms would result in a reduction of about 40 percent in the NPV of
public bilateral debt.
II. External Debt Sustainability
4.
While the assumptions outlined in Box 1 underpin the baseline projections of
debt sustainability indicators, staff conducted a series of stress tests to assess their
sensitivity to less favorable scenarios. In addition to standard alternative scenarios and
stress tests embedded in the LIC DSA template, an additional Kyrgyz-specific test gauges the
impact of a sharp fall in gold price on debt indicators (recognizing that gold accounts for
one-fourth of total Kyrgyz exports), simulating the effect of a cumulative 40 percent decline
in gold prices in 2007–09, followed by a return to their baseline path thereafter. In addition to
accounting for the first-round impact of the shock on exports, the scenario factors in secondround effects by assuming a slowdown in growth and FDI and allowing currency
depreciation. The analysis also presents a scenario accounting for the impact of debt relief
under the HIPC Initiative and the MDRI on the Kyrgyz Republic’s debt sustainability, given
the authorities intention to seek relief under the HIPC Initiative.
5.
As noted below, the current debt burden places the Kyrgyz Republic at a high
risk of debt distress. Nevertheless, the baseline scenario shows a cautiously favorable
improvement in the external debt outlook over time. At 277 percent in 2005, the NPV of
debt-to-revenue ratio is above the policy based indicative threshold of 250 percent.4, 5 This
indicator and the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio would fall below their indicative thresholds by

4

The Kyrgyz Republic is rated as a medium performer based on the World Bank’s Country Performance and
Institutional Assessment Index. The relevant policy-dependent thresholds are 40 percent for the NPV of the
debt-to-GDP ratio, 150 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, 250 percent for the NPV of debt-to-revenue
ratio, 20 percent of the debt service-to-exports ratio, and 30 percent of the debt service-to-revenue ratio.

Macroeconomic Assumptions 2006–26
Annual real GDP growth would average 4½ percent, on the back of strong private
investment, including FDI, spurred by improvements in business climate. In the near term,
growth would be supported by a rebound in mining and the initial impact of reforms in the
energy sector, while services, primarily tourism-related, and a reformed energy sector would
underpin long-run growth. Consistent with the assumption of conservative fiscal and monetary
policies, long-term inflation would average 4 percent, and the Kyrgyz som would remain stable
against the U.S. dollar in real terms.
Following an accident in the Kumtor gold mine in 2006, exports are slated to recover,
growing by an average of 5.3 percent a year. In addition to normalization of Kumtor
operations, this recovery would be underpinned by the start of mining in other major gold
deposits and robust import demand from Russia and Kazakhstan, particularly for industrial and
processed food products. As this growth pattern would keep exports vulnerable to a depletion
of mining deposits, a sharp drop in world commodity prices, and natural disasters, export
diversification efforts need to be directed to creating an enabling business environment to
exploit the considerable export potential, particularly in tourism and hydroenergy. Long run
projections assume that a sharp drop in gold output from the expected closure of the Kumtor
mine in 2012–13 will be moderated by sustained gains in the tourism and energy sectors. In all,
by the end of the period, exports growth would stabilize around 4¾ percent a year.
Consistent with growth projections and expected FDI inflows, imports would grow at
5 percent a year. They would continue to be sourced mainly from CIS trading partners and
China, with oil products and consumer goods dominating the commodity structure.
The current account deficit is projected to narrow from 8¼ percent of GDP in 2005 to
5¼ percent in 2025. Buoyed by strong income growth in Russia and Kazakhstan, private
transfers—mainly worker’s remittances amounting to almost 15 percent of GDP in 2006—will
remain large, financing a significant share of the trade deficit. In the long run, a projected
narrowing in the current account deficit would be supported by fiscal consolidation and
increased private savings.
Net FDI would increase gradually to 3.5 percent of GDP by the end of the projection
period. While in the near term FDI would be concentrated in traditional sectors, like mining
and industry, business climate improvements should yield a more diversified structure of FDI
in the outer years. The foreign loan-financed part of the Public Investment Program would
decline from 3¼ percent of GDP at present to 2½ percent in 2026. International reserves would
stay at 4–5 months of imports.
Medium-term public borrowing—to finance Public Investment Program and fill
financing gaps—will be contracted on highly concessional terms, primarily from IFIs. Over
the DSA horizon, concessionality of new external public borrowing would gradually decline
from around 45 percent in 2006–10 about 17 percent in 2020–26, as more borrowing will be
contracted at less concessional terms from bilateral and commercial creditors.
Central government revenues (excluding grants) are projected at around 17½ percent of
GDP in 2006–10, and would increase gradually by a total of ¾ percentage points by 2026.

53
end-2006 and end-2008, respectively, and steadily decline further, continuing on a downward
path underpinned by the assumed fiscal consolidation and prudent debt management. Given
that the Kyrgyz Republic is an open economy with a high exports-to-GDP ratio, the NPV of
debt-to-export ratio would stay well below the corresponding threshold throughout the
projection period. With the anticipated closure of the largest gold mine, Kumtor, in 2012 or
2013, the ratio would increase somewhat at that time before falling to about 65 percent by
the end of projection period.
6.
Debt service indicators are expected to remain manageable throughout the DSA
horizon. This reflects the high concessionality of both existing multilateral debt and new
borrowing, as well as debt relief delivered by Paris Club creditors in 2005. In sum, the debt
service would amount to 5½ percent of exports (12 percent of revenues) in the medium term,
but reach 7 percent of exports (15 percent of revenues) during the later stage of the projection
period, driven by new borrowing and the repayment of previously restructured bilateral debt.
7.
Stress tests and alternative scenarios show the Kyrgyz Republic’s debt
sustainability as highly vulnerable to large shocks or less favorable assumptions. The
NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio stays above the threshold under almost all tests, while the NPV of
debt-to-revenue is especially sensitive to assumptions on export growth, projections of
nondebt creating inflows, and a combination of four standard tests (B4), breaching the
relevant threshold over the DSA horizon. Debt service burden ratios, however, prove
relatively more resilient under several scenarios, staying below indicative levels, although
they too deteriorate considerably by 2026. An alternative scenario (A2) suggests that a
2 percent higher interest rate on new borrowing would make debt unsustainable, with the
debt service burden becoming heavy in the medium term. The additional country specific
scenario (A3) designed by staff shows that the debt situation could also worsen in the event
of a sharp fall in gold price. All sustainability indicators would deteriorate over the medium
term, but the NPV of debt-to-exports and the debt service ratio would still remain below their
thresholds.
8.
Additional risks to the debt sustainability outlook would arise if the government
violated the program’s prohibition on the contracting of nonconcessional loans in order
to finance large investment projects under discussion with bilateral creditors.6 Even if
these loans were concessional, it would be important to ensure that the underlying projects
are viable, so as to safeguard debt sustainability.
9.
Under the enhanced HIPC initiative and subsequently the MDRI, the Kyrgyz
Republic could avail itself of a significant fiscal space that could be directed to poverty

nor potential returns from the projects being discussed were known to staff at the time of preparation of this
DSA.

reducing spending.7 Assuming that it reaches the HIPC decision point at the turn of this
year and the completion point by end-2008, debt service in 2007-2015 would decline from
4½ percent of exports (10½ percent of revenues), before any debt relief, to 2 percent of
exports (4 percent of revenues), after application of debt relief from both initiatives. The
relief would also improve sustainability indicators in the near to medium term, although, in
the outer years, the NPV of debt ratios would rise, reflecting new borrowing—primarily to
finance PIP projects.
III. Public Debt Sustainability
10.
Since external debt accounts for more than 90 percent of total public debt, the
public DSA results are similar to the external DSA findings. The public DSA assumes
further fiscal consolidation (measured by the primary balance) of about 1 percent of GDP
from 2006 to 2026, stemming from an increase in revenues of about 2 percentage points of
GDP due to stricter tax enforcement and better compliance. Almost half of the revenue
increase would finance higher pension outlays driven by the projected population aging,
whereas capital spending would increase by ½ percentage point of GDP and noninterest
current spending would remain broadly unchanged in relation to GDP. In this baseline
scenario, the NPV of public debt-to-GDP is about 50 percent in 2006 and stabilizes slightly
below 40 percent in the long term. The ratio of NPV of debt to general government revenue
declines from just under 200 percent in 2006 to about 140 percent in 2026, while the ratio of
the NPV of debt to central government revenue before grants would drop from 279 percent in
2006 to 214 percent by 2026. Standard stress tests show that current debt levels are highly
vulnerable to shocks to the economy and, under an alternative scenario with real GDP
growth for 2007 and 2008 of one half standard deviation lower than the baseline, the ratios of
the NPV of debt to GDP and the NPV of debt to central government revenue before grants
would increase to 85 percent and 463 percent, respectively, by 2026.
IV. Debt Distress Classification
11.
The Kyrgyz Republic is assessed to be at high risk of debt distress, as evidenced
by the NPV of debt-to-revenue and the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratios, which were above
their indicative thresholds at end-2005.8 Although these indicators are projected to
improve and move below the thresholds, they would approach or breach the thresholds if the
Kyrgyz Republic were to experience an exogenous shock or relax its prudent debt
management policy, as suggested by alternative scenarios and stress tests. Under the baseline
7

Estimates of the debt relief under the HIPC Initiative are from the HIPC Preliminary document, which used
end-2004 debt and government revenue data. Debt relief will be recalculated at the Decision point using end2005 data and will accordingly differ from the preliminary numbers used in this DSA.

This classification is based on the guidelines set out in “Operational Framework for Debt Sustainability
Assessments in Low-Income Countries––Further Considerations” (see www.imf.org).

55
scenario, the debt service burden would remain well below threshold, reflecting the high
concessionality of the Kyrgyz external debt and the 2005 Paris Club debt relief.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Memorandum items:
Grant element assumed on residual financing (i.e., financing required
above baseline) 8/
Central government revenues excluding grants (in percent of GDP)
Sources: Fund/Bank staff estimates and projections; and country authorities.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), noninterest current account in percent of GDP, and nondebt
creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the
same as in the baseline.
3/ Assumes a temporary 40 percent cumulative decline in gold prices in 2007–09 (which would revert thereafter to the baseline price path),
accompanied by a slowdown in growth, exports and FDI in mining as well as currency depreciation.
4/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its
baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
5/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
6/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
7/ Central government revenues excluding grants.
8/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

ATTACHMENT I
Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic
October 17, 2006

Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
In February 2005, the IMF Executive Board endorsed the Kyrgyz Republic’s threeyear economic program, and approved a new Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement in support of that program. The second review under the program was
concluded in May 2006 on a lapse-of-time basis.
2.
On behalf of the government of the Kyrgyz Republic, we hereby transmit the attached
Memorandum of Economic Policies (MEP), which includes program understandings reached
with the IMF, describes in detail the implementation of the program to date, and sets out the
objectives and policies that the government intends to pursue through end-2007. The MEP is
consistent with the revised Country Development Strategy (CDS) that is expected to be
finalized shortly. The government intends to make the contents of this letter and those of the
attached MEP and its Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), as well as the staff
report on the third review under the PRGF arrangement and Article IV consultations,
available to the public, and authorizes the staff to arrange for them to be posted on the IMF
website after completion of the review by the Board.
3.
The fourth review under the arrangement is expected to be completed on or after
February 15, 2007 and the fifth review on or after August 15, 2007. As noted in Table 1, we
have observed all the quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2006. However, a
structural performance criterion on the transfer of the Centerra shares held on behalf of the
nation by Kyrgyzaltyn JSC (a state enterprise) to the State Property Fund was not completed
on time. We have since taken steps to prohibit the sale of Centerra shares without
authorization from the government, as well as to ensure that the proceeds from any sale of
these shares will be utilized strictly in accordance with government instructions. We are
therefore requesting a waiver for nonobservance of this criterion. Quantitative performance

67
criteria, indicative targets and structural benchmarks through end-June 2007 are set out in
Tables 2 and 3 of the MEP. We request disbursement of the SDR 1.27 million tranche
available upon Board completion of the third review.
4.
The government of the Kyrgyz Republic will provide the Fund with such information
as the Fund may request in connection with progress in implementing the economic policies
and achieving the objectives of the program. The government believes that the policies and
measures set forth in the MEP are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program, but will
take further measures to that end if deemed necessary. During the implementation of the
current arrangement, the Kyrgyz Republic will consult with the Managing Director on the
adoption of any measures that may be appropriate, at the initiative of the government or
whenever the Managing Director requests such a consultation.

Very truly yours,

/s/
Feliks Kulov
Prime Minister
Kyrgyz Republic

ATTACHMENT II
Memorandum of Economic Policies for the Kyrgyz Republic
I.

RECENT ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

1.
The government’s economic program for 2005–08, supported by the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement approved by the IMF Executive Board
in February 2005, aims to achieve sustained and rapid economic and social development in a
low-inflation environment. This Memorandum reviews program implementation to date and
describes our policies for 2007, as well as the thrust of our economic strategy for the
remainder of this administration.
2.
The government has successfully maintained macroeconomic discipline and adhered
to the PRGF-supported program thus far in 2006. All end-June quantitative performance
criteria (PCs) were observed, in some cases with ample margins, and all structural
benchmarks through end-September were met (Tables 1 and 3). The government has taken
corrective measures to achieve the original purpose of the end-June structural PC on the
transfer of Centerra shares from Kyrgyzaltyn JSC to the State Property Fund.
3.
Economic developments in the year-to-date have been encouraging. Inflation
(5.1 percent in the 12 months ending in August) has remained broadly in line with the
program, economic activity has begun to rebound, and the buildup in foreign reserves has
been faster than expected. In particular, real GDP grew by 3.5 percent year-on year during
January–August led by the agricultural and nongold industrial sectors, while output growth
excluding the Kumtor mine was even higher at 6.6 percent, broadly in line with the trend in
recent years. Despite rising nongold exports, the external trade deficit widened in the first
half of 2006, driven by a rapid increase in imports sparked by the budding economic
recovery and rising world fuel prices (an improvement in the statistical coverage of shuttle
trade also played a part). Buoyed by workers’ remittances and private capital inflows, gross
reserves rose steadily, to $690 million by late September (or 4 months of projected 2007
imports of goods and services). For 2006 as a whole, we expect to meet the program’s
inflation target (5.7 percent), but due to a serious accident at Kumtor last July, we have
scaled back our real GDP growth forecast to around 4 percent.
4.
Year-to-date fiscal performance has been better than envisaged. This has resulted
partly from buoyant import and income tax receipts underpinned by steadfast implementation
of the new customs code, along with renewed efforts to curb evasion. Despite a faster-thanexpected increase in current spending, mainly on wages and on goods and services, total
spending has remained in line with the program owing to delayed execution of the
investment budget. Robust payroll tax collections have allowed the Social Fund to clear all
of its arrears, making nation-wide pension payments current despite a 2 percentage-point

69
payroll tax reduction last January. In all, the half-year target for the primary balance before
grants was met by a margin of about 1 percent of GDP. Based on preliminary results through
the third quarter and the supplementary 2006 budget to be sent to parliament in early
October, we expect to comfortably meet the program’s full-year fiscal target (a primary
deficit of 3¼ percent of GDP). Recognizing the importance of fiscal sustainability, the
government will seek prompt passage of the pending bill to increase nonagricultural land
taxes to ensure broad revenue neutrality of the 2006 tax reform package as programmed. To
pave the way for medium-term fiscal consolidation, the government will make every effort to
secure parliamentary approval of the new tax code bill by end-March 2007 (a structural
benchmark under the program). Moreover, despite political pressures, it will adopt
appropriate measures in order to continue to broaden the coverage of the Large Taxpayer
Unit (LTU).
5.
Since early 2006, monetary policy has been conducted in an environment of strongerthan-expected foreign exchange receipts and continued remonetization of the economy. In
these circumstances, the NBKR conducted sizable unsterilized intervention in the foreign
exchange market, though allowing the som to appreciate by 4.7 percent against the
U.S. dollar since the beginning of the year (in real effective terms, the som appreciated by
about 5 percent over the past 18 months). In addition, the NBKR has gradually increased
policy interest rates, which are now positive in real terms, while the yield curve has returned
to a more normal, upward-sloping pattern. Although reserve money increased by 40 percent
in the 12 months ending September 2006—well above expectations—and the expansion in
banking system credit to the private sector (albeit from a low base) has accelerated since the
beginning of the year, inflation has remained in line with the program.
6.
Financial sector reforms remain on track. To further enhance bank supervision, the
NBKR has established the supervisory framework to assess market, operational, country and
foreign exchange risks, and is improving its ability to stress-test banks. The activities of the
new Agency for Financial Surveillance and Reporting will be clearly demarcated to avoid an
overlap with those of the NBKR. Every effort will be made to secure approval of legislation
before parliament to enhance the NBKR’s legal independence and legal protection for its
employees in performing official duties (an end-December structural benchmark). Parliament
has already passed legislation to combat money laundering and financing of terrorism, and
the Financial Intelligence Unit is drafting the corresponding amendments to the criminal
code and other relevant legislation. As envisaged in the program, we will bring the Kyrgyz
Agricultural Finance Corporation (KAFC) to the point of sale and issue a privatization tender
for the company by end-2006.
7.
The program’s half-year target for the energy sector’s quasi-fiscal deficit (QFD) was
met with some margin, owing to a rise in cash collections of the distribution utilities. For the
year as a whole, the government expects the QFD to decline to 5.9 percent of GDP, from
7.6 percent in 2005 (both estimates based on the original marginal cost benchmark of

70
2.3.U.S. cents per kilowatt/hour), on the back of the unification of household power tariffs
last May and further efforts to bolster cash collections and curtail technical losses and theft;
using the updated benchmark of 2.66 U.S. cents per kilowatt/hour agreed upon with the
World Bank, the QFD would decline from 8.8 percent in 2005 to 7.4 percent in 2006.
II. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND ECONOMIC POLICIES FOR 2007
8.
Our economic adjustment and reform program for the remainder of this
administration is consistent with the Country Development Strategy (CDS), which extends
the national poverty reduction strategy to 2010, and the Country Assistance Strategy being
developed jointly by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and other donors. To
alleviate poverty and foster private sector-led growth, the government will maintain
macroeconomic stability and remove structural bottlenecks (particularly by improving the
business climate through better governance and transparency, civil service reforms, and the
establishment of an appropriate legal and regulatory framework), while minimizing its direct
intervention in the economy.
9.
For 2007, our economic program aims at securing real GDP growth of 5.5 percent,
limiting end-period inflation to a range of 4.5–5.0 percent, and slightly increasing the import
coverage of gross foreign reserves. Despite a rising fuel import bill, the external current
account deficit would narrow to 9¾ percent of GDP from an estimated 11 percent in 2006,
on the back of a rebound in export volumes and sustained workers’ remittances, and it would
be fully financed by FDI, other private inflows, and concessional assistance from the Fund
and other donors. To achieve these objectives, we will continue to pursue prudent fiscal and
monetary policies and seek to further reduce the quasi-fiscal deficit of the electricity sector.
The general government primary balance before grants will be limited to just under 3 percent
of GDP, with an overall deficit of a similar magnitude covered entirely from external sources
and privatization proceeds. Moreover, the NBKR will set limits on the expansion of its net
domestic assets, consistent with a slowdown in reserve money growth to 22½ percent by
year’s-end and a further foreign reserve buildup to keep gross reserve coverage at 4¼ months
of projected 2008 imports of goods and services (Table 4). We will also intensify structural
reforms to enhance the prospects for sustained growth and poverty reduction, and have
accordingly established structural benchmarks on certain financial sector and public financial
management reforms through end-June 2007 (Table 3).
10.
In order to lighten the burden of the Kyrgyz Republic’s external debt and free
resources for priority spending, the government is seeking to introduce a comprehensive debt
reduction effort. This includes a request, subject to agreement on detailed conditionality
triggers, for relief under the enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and
the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). A comprehensive set of measures should help
improve living standards and accelerate progress towards achieving the Millennium
Development Goals. This would include measures to enhance governance and transparency,

71
improve the business climate, foster the development of agriculture and infrastructure,
reform the energy and mining sectors, bolster public financial management, and spur
economic growth and human development. In order to reflect the interim assistance that will
be provided under the HIPC Initiative upon reaching the Decision Point (tentatively, at the
turn of the year), the quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2007 established herein
will be revised, as needed, at the time of the 4th review under the program to reflect the
utilization of these resources.
11.
We plan to gradually divest the country’s equity in the Centerra mining conglomerate
(equivalent at present to some $310 million or about 11.2 percent of GDP). This, in synergy
with the fiscal space from debt relief and large projects financed by FDI or private sector
borrowing from neighboring countries, is expected to significantly enhance growth
prospects. In April 2006, the government issued a resolution prohibiting the sale of Centerra
shares without government authorization and specifying that the proceeds from any sales of
these shares will be used strictly in accordance with guidelines set by the government. Going
forward, the government is determined to harness these resources for productive uses in a
manner consistent with macroeconomic stability and absorptive capacity. In this vein, the
government will specify —in consultation with parliament—the annual receipts from any
sales of Centerra shares to be channeled, through the central government budget, either
through the public sector investment program or as net lending to the financial sector
(possibly under an investment or development fund). To safeguard macroeconomic stability
and the soundness of the banking system, these operations will be fully integrated into the
PRGF-supported economic program, including the annual government budget (where they
will be treated as net lending or investment outlays) and the monetary program. More
immediately, the level and quarterly phasing of these resources and any adjustments that may
be warranted to the program for 2007 described in this Memorandum will be reviewed at the
time of the 4th review under the PRGF arrangement in early 2007.
A. Fiscal Policy
12.
Fiscal discipline has become firmly entrenched over the past several years and will be
maintained to underpin low inflation and debt sustainability. While the need to improve
social services and infrastructure is pressing, we will carefully prioritize public outlays and
strengthen expenditure controls. We will continue to intensify the tax effort by steadfastly
improving tax and customs administration and curbing evasion. General government tax
receipts are targeted to rise to 20½ percent of GDP in 2007, reflecting the full-year effect of
the increase in the nonagricultural land tax rates envisaged in late 2006 and further efforts to
strengthen tax enforcement; these measures would more than offset the effect of a
2 percentage-point reduction in the payroll tax (implemented in two steps in April and
October) during the year, to 27 percent, bringing it closer to the 25 percent medium-term
target. Outlays (excluding net lending) will be capped at 28½ percent of GDP, consistent
with an average 10 percent increase in government wages and a rise in central government

72
investment to 4½ percent of GDP. After the envisaged approval of the HIPC Initiative
Decision Point by the Executive Boards of the IMF and the World Bank, we will propose a
supplementary budget to parliament reflecting the fiscal space created by interim HIPC
Initiative assistance. We also count on a scaling up of concessional external aid, following a
consultative group meeting we plan to convene in Bishkek in the coming months.
13.
The 2007 budget will also feature a 10 percent average increase in pensions, with an
increase in the base pension component in January to bring it to the statutory level of
12 percent of last year’s wages. The Social Fund will not make any unprogrammed
drawdown in its deposits to finance pension increases beyond those already programmed,
and in the event that its revenues significantly exceed expectations, it will then give priority
to bringing forward the payroll tax cuts scheduled for April and October 2007. The
government reaffirms its commitment not to lower the retirement age, recognizing that any
reduction would be inconsistent with the long-term financial sustainability of the pension
system. Instead, it will forge a broad-based internal consensus on a comprehensive reform of
the pension system to be designed with World Bank assistance, including the phased
introduction over a number of years of a fully funded pillar (premised on establishment of an
appropriate legal and regulatory framework and development of suitable asset classes that
would ensure the security of the funds deposited), as well as a streamlining of social benefits
and a broadening in the coverage of social safety nets. This far-reaching reform could
include the option of early retirement with reduced pension benefits or an increase in the
minimum years of contributions for those seeking retirement.
14.
The new Medium-Term Budgetary Framework (MTBF) published in May 2006
outlines the strategy for developing health, education, social protection, agriculture, and
transport and communication, along with the broad criteria for identifying sectoral priorities
and deepening fiscal decentralization. This should enable better medium-term policy
formulation and coordination among ministries, help operationalize the CDS, and provide a
sound foundation for annual budget preparation. To focus spending on poverty reduction, a
new classification of poverty reducing spending will be included in the next MTBF. In
addition, the government will streamline the State Tax Inspectorate (STI) office network, and
increase the staff of the LTU, while raising its status to align it with other units that directly
report to STI management. The government has prepared an action plan for bolstering public
financial management, and continues to refocus reform efforts and enhance the annual
budgetary process; this plan will dovetail with the MTBF published in May 2006 and the
CDS that will be finalized later this year.
15.
In line with a law passed by parliament in 2003, the government is poised to add
momentum to fiscal decentralization from 2007, with a view to converging over time to a
two-tier system comprising local communities (aiyl okomotus) and the central government.
The process will be managed carefully to safeguard macroeconomic stability, delineate clear
revenue-sharing provisions and expenditure responsibilities at each tier, build local

73
government capacity, and eliminate local government interference in the appointment of
senior management staff of local tax offices and local branches of the ministry of economy
and finance. Extensive technical assistance and consultation on key policy issues with the
World Bank and other expert agencies will help align the implementation of fiscal
decentralization with international best practice.
B. Energy Sector and Quasi-Fiscal Issues
16.
As envisaged in the program, the government has submitted in September 2006 an
energy sector action plan designed in cooperation with the World Bank. The plan aims to put
the sector’s financial position on a sound footing, while delivering reliable power supplies
for domestic consumers and creating the basis for significant energy exports. To that end, the
authorities will seek to bolster utility bill collections, reduce technical losses and theft,
increase private sector participation in the sector, and they will adjust electricity tariffs under
a preannounced calendar to reach cost-recovery tariff levels by 2010. In this vein, and
according to the updated tariff methodology agreed by the authorities with the World Bank,
the sector’s QFD (an indicative target under the program) is slated to decline to about
5.5 percent of GDP in 2007, from an estimated 7.4 percent this year. As was the case with
the unification of the household tariffs earlier this year, future power tariff adjustments will
continue to be accompanied by social safety nets to mitigate their effects on the poorer
segments of the population.
C. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
17.
Price stability continues to be the overarching objective of the NBKR. The monetary
program for 2007, which is premised on further remonetization of the economy and seeks to
contain end-period inflation to a range of 4.5–5.0 percent, limits reserve money growth to
22½ percent consistent with broad money growth of 24 percent during the year. To keep
liquidity expansion in check, the NBKR will enhance the menu of monetary control
instruments, price these instruments flexibly, and maintain the managed exchange rate float.
The central bank will limit foreign exchange intervention to smoothing exchange rate
fluctuations and securing the programmed international reserve buildup.
18.
The NBKR will deepen financial sector reforms with technical advice from the IMF
and other donors. It has already introduced a phased increase in the minimum own-funds
requirement for banks, to som 60 million ($1.5 million) in January 2006 and som 100 million
($2.5 million) from January 2008. In light of a modest rise in the ratio of nonperforming
loans to total commercial bank loans from end-2004 to mid-2006, and partly in response to
the NBKR’s instructions, commercial banks have increased loan provisioning. Going
forward, and in anticipation of a further rapid increase in credit to the private sector, the
authorities will step-up bank supervision, especially by closely monitoring financial
soundness indicators and taking timely corrective measures if credit quality deteriorates

74
further. The NBKR will continue to take steps to improve the payments system, including
through electronic payment of all public wages and introduction of real time gross settlement
and batch clearing systems. The NBKR will also continue to monitor developments and
strengthen supervision over nonbank financial institutions according to its current legal
responsibilities, seeking particularly to foster orderly development of microfinance.
19.
The NBKR is poised to introduce a deposit insurance scheme for small depositors by
late 2008, and after passage of enabling legislation in the next several months, the NBKR
will communicate to banks the prudential requirements and statutory thresholds on
profitability, liquidity and risk levels for their bank participation in the scheme.
Conservatorship and subsequent liquidation of troubled banks will continue to be guided
strictly by the current legislation on conservatorship, liquidation and bankruptcy of banks. To
foster mortgage and other term lending, the government will submit to parliament
amendments (drafted by the NBKR) to the civil, housing and land codes, as well as to all the
laws governing collateral, strengthening the legal foundations for the use and for the seizure
of collateral in cases of default. It will also seek amendments to the civil code to recognize
the supremacy of banking legislation in cases of conflict with other laws, and implement
regulations for consolidated bank supervision that adequately monitor risks. The NBKR
plans a phased transition to international capital measures and standards under Basel-II
guidelines, after careful consideration of all prerequisites for its successful adoption and
further implementation of the recommendations made in the 2005 assessment of the Basel
Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. The financial sector development
program will be updated and streamlined in light of the recommendations of the joint
IMF/World Bank mission that updated the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in
October 2006.
20.
To foster development of the securities market, the volume of government securities
available to banks will be further increased. As part of the ongoing phased redemption of
government bonds, som 180 million of NBKR-held bonds were redeemed last April, and a
further som 200 million will be redeemed in 2007. To reduce the domestic interest cost to the
budget, the government will effect the early redemption of som 500 million in its liabilities to
the central bank in the next several months. The ministry of economy and finance and the
NBKR will propose a specific action plan to simplify the nomenclature of debt instruments,
drawing on recommendations of a recent IMF technical assistance mission. At the same time,
the authorities will ensure that any further restructuring of government liabilities to the
NBKR will not adversely impact the balance sheet of the NBKR.
D. Other Structural Reforms
21.
As stressed in the new CDS, eradicating corruption and fostering rapid private sectorled growth and poverty alleviation remain top national priorities. The government is working
closely with stakeholders and donors on policies to bolster fiscal management; improve the

75
efficiency and transparency of the mining sector; and address the nexus of governance and
business climate issues. Besides deepening civil service reform, the government will further
strengthen institutions tasked with fighting corruption, while toughening law enforcement;
reducing opportunities for bribes and rent-seeking, and increasing transparency in public
sector operations. Moreover, the government will continue to simplify licensing procedures,
streamline regulatory bodies, improve the autonomy and efficacy of the judiciary, and
strengthen property rights.
22.
The State Committee for Migration and Employment has reviewed the labor code and
recommended amendments to simplify hiring procedures. The authorities are considering
further measures to improve labor market flexibility, such as liberalizing provisions on
reduced working hours and job sharing. They have also approved a national employment
policy through 2010 that includes other forms of flexible employment, such as temporary
public works programs and creation of employment opportunities for youths, women and the
disabled. Enabling regulations for these flexible forms of employment are being prepared in
consultation with the International Labor Organization (ILO). Progress in these areas will be
discussed at the time of the 4th review under the arrangement.
E. External Debt Management
23.
While negotiations to attract large externally financed investments to the Kyrgyz
Republic, especially in infrastructure, industry and mining, are well advanced, the public
sector will continue to refrain from borrowing or guaranteeing external loans on
nonconcessional terms. In addition, any concessional external loans contracted or guaranteed
by the public sector will continue to satisfy the minimum 45 percent grant element specified
in the program.
24.
As it seeks external debt relief, the government continues to attach utmost importance
to safeguarding external debt sustainability, and it will further enhance external debt
management institutions and procedures. In particular, it will adopt a new medium-term
external debt management strategy (treated as an end-March 2007 structural benchmark),
building on the earlier one designed in 2001; the strategy will include maintaining the
45 percent floor on the grant element required on all new public borrowing, and requiring
local governments and public enterprises to obtain prior authorization from the ministry of
economy and finance to contract any external loans. In addition, the ministry of economy
and finance will build capacity on debt management issues; collect loan-by-loan data on
public enterprise debts that have hitherto not received government guarantees; and introduce
prudential guidelines for issuance of letters of guarantees on concessional external loans.
F. Program Monitoring

76
25.
The program will continue to be monitored through semi-annual reviews. For that
purpose, we propose quantitative PCs for end-June 2007, an indicative macroeconomic
program through end-2007, and semi-annual indicative targets for reserve money and the
electricity sector’s QFD. We have also proposed structural benchmarks for March and June
2007 (Table 3). Completion of the fourth review under the PRGF arrangement, scheduled for
spring 2007, will require observance of the end-December 2006 quantitative PCs shown in
Table 2. Quantitative PCs, program adjustors, data sources, and reporting requirements are
defined in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding.

ATTACHMENT III
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
The Kyrgyz Republic’s performance during the period January 1, 2005–
December 31, 2007 under the three-year PRGF-supported program will be assessed by the
IMF on the basis of the observance of quantitative performance criteria and structural
benchmarks. This updated memorandum and its attached tables define the quantitative
performance criteria and indicative targets under program supported by the Poverty
Reduction and Growth facility (PRGF) arrangement.1 This update reflects the changes made
to the program as specified in the Memorandum of Economic Policies (MEP) for the third
review under the arrangement.
2.
The program exchange rate of the Kyrgyz som to the U.S. dollar is set at som
39.5 = $1. The corresponding cross exchange rates and program gold price for 2007 are
provided in Table 11. For 2006, the program exchange rate of Kyrgyz som to the U.S. dollar,
and other currencies, as specified in IMF Country Report No. 06/235, remain unchanged.
I. Quantitative Performance Criteria
3.
The quantitative targets (i.e., quantitative benchmarks for end-September 2006 and
end-March 2007, and quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2006 and end-June
2007) presented in Tables 1 and 2 of the MEP are defined below.
Floor on net international reserves of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic
(NBKR) in convertible currencies
4.
The program contains a floor on the stock of net international reserves of the NBKR
in convertible currencies. This floor will be calculated as the difference between total gross
international reserves and total international reserve liabilities of the NBKR in convertible
currencies.
5.
Total gross international reserves of the NBKR shall be defined as the NBKR
holdings of monetary gold, holdings of SDRs, any reserve position in the IMF, and any
holdings of convertible currencies in cash or with foreign banks, and debt instruments
(including accrued interest). Amounts pledged as collateral or in swaps or otherwise blocked,
capital subscriptions in foreign financial institutions, and illiquid assets of the NBKR are

excluded. Also excluded are net forward positions, defined as the difference between the face
value of foreign currency denominated NBKR off-balance sheet claims on nonresidents and
foreign currency obligations to both residents and nonresidents. In addition, net claims on
other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries are excluded from the floor. For
program monitoring purposes, gross international reserves shall be valued at program
exchange rates and gold prices.
6.
Total international reserve liabilities of the NBKR in convertible currencies shall be
defined as outstanding liabilities to the IMF and other convertible currency liabilities to
nonresidents with an original maturity of up to and including one year. For program
monitoring purposes, total international reserve liabilities shall be valued at the program
exchange rates as described in paragraph 2 above. Thus calculated, the stock of net
international reserves in convertible currencies amounted to $416 million as of December 31,
2005.
7.
The program floors on the NIR of the NBKR in convertible currencies are reported in
Table 1 below.

defined in paragraph 9 below; (b) upward by 30 percent for any nonprogrammed cash grants;
and (c) upward/downward by 100 percent for any excess/shortfall in cash privatization
receipts in foreign exchange. Valued at the program exchange rate, the program cash
privatization receipts are equivalent to $5 million in each of the fourth quarter of 2006 and

83
2007. The total adjustment in respect of adjustors (a) and (c) is to be limited to $25 million,
valued at the program exchange rate.
9.
‘Net foreign financing and cash grants’ is defined as balance of payment support
loans, plus cash grants to the state government budget, plus any changes in the balance of
unused PIP funds held at the NBKR, minus amortization (excluding repayments to the Fund)
and interest payments on external debt made by the ministry of economy, and NBKR. This
definition applies to the adjustors to both the NIR and the NDA. The program cumulative net
foreign financing is given in Table 2. The balance of unused PIP funds was equivalent to
$0.03 million as of December 31, 2005.

Debt is understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement
through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the
obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future
point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the
contract. Debt can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows: (a) loans, i.e., advances of money
to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the
future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges
of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds,
and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements); (b) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the

25.
External debt ceilings apply to (a) the contracting or guaranteeing of short term
external debt (i.e. external debt with an original maturity of less than one year, except normal
import-related credits and NBKR reserve liabilities); and (b) contracting or guaranteeing of
nonconcessional medium- and long-term external debt (i.e., external debt with an original
maturity of one year or more). Disbursements by the Fund from the PRGF Trust are excluded
from the ceilings on external debt. Also excluded from these external debt ceilings is the
contracting or guaranteeing of new external debt that constitutes a rescheduling or
refinancing of existing external debt at terms more favorable to the debtor. The limit on the
contracting or guaranteeing of short-term external debt is zero on a continuous basis
throughout the period of the arrangement. The limit on the contracting or guaranteeing of
medium- and long-term nonconcessional external debt is zero as specified in Table 2 of the
MEP.
26.
For the purposes of the ceiling on contracting and guaranteeing new external debt,
any other agency acting on behalf of the state government will in particular include all
nonfinancial public enterprises with share capitals of not less than Kyrgyz som 100 million in
which the state government holds at least 51 percent of the share capital (The public
enterprises listed in Table 12 currently meet the foregoing criteria).
Ceiling on new external payments arrears
27.
For the purposes of the program, external payment arrears will consist of all
debt-service obligations (i.e., payments of principal or interest) arising in respect of any debt
contracted or guaranteed or assumed by the state government of the Kyrgyz Republic, or the
NBKR, or any agency acting on behalf of the state government of the Kyrgyz Republic since
the Kyrgyz Republic’s independence, including, without limitations, unpaid penalties,
interest charges or judicially awarded damages associated with these arrears owed by the
state government of the Kyrgyz Republic, or the NBKR, or any agency acting on behalf of
the state government of the Kyrgyz Republic, on imports received subsequent to
independence. The ceiling on new external payment arrears shall apply on a continuous basis
throughout the period of the PRGF arrangement.
II. INDICATIVE TARGETS
obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are
provided; and (c) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right to
use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the
property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present
value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property. Under the
above definition of debt, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make
payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation
that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.

89
Ceiling on reserve money
28.
For the purposes of the program, reserve money consists of currency issued by the
NBKR and balances on commercial banks’ correspondent accounts with the NBKR. The
indicative program limits are reported in Table 7 below.

Ceiling on the quasi-fiscal deficit of the electricity sector
29.
The quasi-fiscal deficit (QFD) of the electricity sector is defined as cost of production
minus cash revenues:
(1) QFD=Q*MC – R;
(2) Q = 1/(1-ℓ)*(∑ Ci);
(3) R = (∑ Ci) * T * Ccash,

where:
Q is the domestic supply (generation plus import minus export) minus normative losses;
MC is the marginal cost of production required for efficient supply of Q;
R is the total cash revenue;
∑ Ci is the sum of consumption by all end-users (households, industry, agriculture,
budgetary institutions, and other);
ℓ is the annual average loss rate of excessive (i.e., above normative) technical and
commercial losses in percent of Q;

90
T is the annual weighted average of posted (or nominal) tariffs for end-users; and
Ccash is the ratio of annual average cash collections to total billing to end-users.
30.
For the purposes of the program, the marginal cost of production is equal to
2.3 U.S. cents per kilowatt hour for 2006 and 2.66 U.S. cents for 2007, and normative losses
(including own-use) are defined as 15 percent of domestic supply. Total billing of end-users
is defined as consumption times the posted nominal tariff. The cash collection component is
the amount of bills paid in cash to the energy companies, and excludes any form of cash-tocash settlements, off-sets, barters, or other noncash payments. The indicative ceiling on the
quasi-fiscal deficit in the electricity sector is as follows (Table 8).

Ceiling on contracting or guaranteeing of concessional external debt
31.
The annual ceiling on the contracting or guaranteeing of new concessional external
debt by the state government of the Kyrgyz Republic or the NBKR or any other agency
working on behalf of the state government is set by the U.S. dollar nominal sum of project
loan agreements yet to be signed and agreed, plus balance of payments support loans
required to fill the external financing gap, as programmed. Pursuant to monitoring this
indicative target ceiling, the ministry of economy and finance will provide quarterly
information on the total nominal U.S. dollar value of: (a) new project and program loans
signed and agreed during the previous three-month period; and (b) new project and program
loans planned, but yet to be signed and agreed, during the previous three-month period. The
annual indicative ceilings on the contracting or guaranteeing of new medium- and long-term
concessional external loans for 2006 are specified in Table 9.

These ceilings are nominal debt lumped by the year in which their disbursements
commenced. For 2006, the limit implies contracting loans of which $30 million will start
disbursing in 2006, $83 million in 2007, and $92 million in 2008. The ceiling for contracting
and guaranteeing new concessional loans in 2007 will be adjusted upwards by full amount of
any shortfall from the ceiling for 2006.
32.
For program purposes, a debt is considered concessional if the grant element is at
least 45 percent, calculated by using currency specific discount rates based on the
Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs) published by the OECD. The average of the
CIRRs over the last 10 years will be used for debts with maturity of at least 15 years and the
average CIRR of the preceding six months will be used for shorter maturities.

Safeguards Assessments

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic
(NBKR) is subject to an assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement, which was
approved on March 15, 2005. An updated safeguards assessment of the NBKR was
completed on October 14, 2005. The assessment found that the NBKR’s safeguards
framework has been strengthened since the previous assessment completed in 2002.
However, a number of areas were identified where further steps would solidify the progress
achieved, which include improving oversight of the audit processes and the internal control
systems by establishing an audit committee, strengthening the legal framework for NBKR’s
autonomy, and enhancing the NBKR’s internal audit function.
X.

Exchange Rate Arrangements

The currency of the Kyrgyz Republic has been the som (100 tyiyn =1 som) since
May 15, 1993. The Kyrgyz Republic’s exchange regime is classified as a managed float with
no preannounced path for the exchange rate. The NBKR publishes daily the exchange rate of
the som in terms of the U.S. dollar, which is determined in the interbank foreign exchange
market. The Kyrgyz Republic maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for exchange
restrictions maintained for security reasons relating to the restriction of financial transactions
and the freeze of accounts of certain individuals or organizations associated with terrorism
pursuant to (i) relevant UN Security Council resolutions and (ii) the list of current terrorist
organizations designated by the U.S. Secretary of State. The authorities are in the process of
notifying these measures to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board decision No. 144-(52/51).
XI.

Article IV Consultations

The Kyrgyz Republic is on the 24-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation
discussions were held in August–October 2004 and were completed by the Executive Board
on November 19, 2004. At the same time, the Executive Board considered the staff’s Ex Post
Assessment of Longer-Term Program Engagement.

during the 2002 Article IV consultation. A ROSC Fiscal Transparency mission was held in
March 2001 and the ROSC Fiscal Transparency Module was published on March 13, 2002.
A ROSC Data mission was held in November 2002 and the ROSC Data Module was
published on November 10, 2003.

ANNEX II. KYRGYZ REPUBLIC—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of August 31, 2006)
1.
The last CAS covering FY03–06 has been completed in July 1st of this year and at
present World Bank Country team jointly with four development partners (ADB, DFID,
SWISS, and UN Agencies) is developing a Joint Country Support Strategy (JCSS) which
will cover the period FY 07–10. JCSS will be based on the government’s Country
Development Strategy (equivalent of PRSP –) which sought to capitalize on major reforms to
date while maintaining a reform and growth course that will reduce poverty and enhance
prospects for debt sustainability.
2.
International Development Association (IDA). Since the Kyrgyz Republic joined
the World Bank in September 1992, it has received commitments of $776 million for
38 IDA-funded projects, out of which $587 million have already been disbursed. Out of
19 operations totaling $480 million completed so far, seven structural adjustment credits
provided quick disbursing support for the government’s economic reform programs in
privatization, enterprise restructuring, agricultural policy, financial sector, public sector
resource management, pension reform and energy reform. Twelve investment operations
supported reform and rehabilitation of the telecommunications sector, social safety nets,
health, rural finance, private enterprises and livestock development.
3.
The active Bank portfolio in the Kyrgyz Republic comprises 19 operations with total
commitments of $254 million, of which $107 million (58 percent) remains to be disbursed.
Two projects: Village Investment Project and Reducing Technical Barriers for
Entrepreneurship and Trade have been approved by Board and became effective in FY07. In
addition to the country portfolio, the Kyrgyz Republic also benefits from the regional
HIV/AIDS project.
4.
Until the new JCSS is approved, the World Bank Group’s operational objective for
the next six months is to continue supporting the ongoing government’s efforts to improve
energy sector performance, the business environment, the banking sector, governance, public
expenditure management, intergovernmental finance, the pension system, social protection,
health, water and sanitation, and agriculture, and to enhance the portfolio performance. It
will continue assisting the government with economic sector work and capacity building.
5.
International Finance Corporation (IFC). The IFC strategy in Kyrgyz Republic
focuses on institution and capacity building through investment and technical assistance to
promote private sector development, especially small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs),
and support the transformation into a market-based economy. IFC’s portfolio in Kyrgyzstan
stood at $15 million with 77% in financial markets, 9% in general manufacturing and 14% in
agribusiness. The amount of total investments made to Kyrgyz economy since 1996 reached
$56.19 million.
Building upon IFC's initial investment in the financial sector, the Demir Kyrgyz International
Bank, IFC has played an instrumental role in establishing the largest bank in the country, the
Kyrgyz Investment and Credit Bank, with a $1.4 million equity investment. IFC developed a

6
strategic partnership with FINCA by investing a $1.0 million in a fund to support micro
enterprises. This investment was accompanied by technical assistance to FINCA to facilitate
its transformation and to the government to develop the appropriate regulatory framework.
The largest investment in the existing portfolio is the Kumtor gold mine, with additional
investments in a packaging plant Altyn-Ajydar. In 2002, under the Small Enterprise Fund
(SEF) procedure, IFC disbursed a direct investment into a pasta plant (Akun) in the amount
of $1.4 million. The IFC Board also approved in May 2002 a micro and small enterprise
facility for Central Asia, with IFC investment of $45 million. In the same year, the Central
Asia Small Enterprise Fund (CASEF) was set up in collaboration with other lenders. The
fund will provide equity, quasi-equity, and debt financing, as well as technical and
managerial assistance to growth-oriented SMEs. To date IFC has provided credit lines to
local banks as AKB Kyrgyzstan, Ineximbank and Kazcommertsbank for the total amount of
$5 million. With financial support from the Swiss Government, IFC draws upon the
resources of the Private Enterprise Partnership to advise on improving the business
environment, provide training and support services for SMEs, continue past efforts to
develop leasing activities, and support agribusiness for local and export markets. In January
2006 IFC signed an agreement to provide $2.2 million financing package to Micro Credit
Agency Bai-Tushum, one of Kyrgyzstan’s leading micro lending institution.
IFC has completed about 14 technical assistance projects with funding for the total amount of
$2.2 million in the areas of: (a) institutional and capacity building in the financial sectors
including leasing, microfinance; (b) creating favorable business environment for SMEs;
(c) improvement of investment climate; and (d) developing capacity building for tourism. In
2005 IFC launched two technical assistance projects to improve legal, regulatory and tax
framework for housing finance and leasing. It is also planed to start a regional technical
assistance project to improve corporate governance in enterprises of Central Asia.
6.
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). MIGA has supported private
sector development in the Kyrgyz Republic by extending guarantees to foreign direct
investments in four projects in the manufacturing, services, and mining sectors. Three are
currently outstanding—two related to airport services at Manas airport and a now defunct
airline. There is an on-going legal dispute between the investors and the Government
involving these two contracts. At the request of both parties MIGA has offered to mediate.
One related to the Kumtor gold mine. The total amount of foreign direct investment
facilitated by MIGA guarantees is over $360 million. MIGA has also provided capacity
building in foreign investment techniques to the State Committee on Foreign Investments
and Economic Development, under an initiative supported by the Swiss Government. MIGA
plans to continue to assist the development of the Kyrgyz Republic through its guarantee
program and capacity building. Data on the Kyrgyz Republic are also featured in MIGA's
Privatization Link service, which connects potential investors to information on companies
slated for divestiture via the Internet.

ANNEX III. KYRGYZ REPUBLIC––RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(ADB)
(As of August 31, 2006)
1.
The Kyrgyz Republic became a member of the ADB in 1994 and began receiving
assistance in the same year. The country has received 25 loans and 1 grant for a total amount
of $604 million (as of August 31, 2006). Seven out of the 25 loans are program loans totaling
$199.5 million provided to support policy reforms to facilitate the transition to a market
economy. The remaining 18 are project loans and one project grant totaling $404.5 million
provided to support various investment activities. At present, ten loans with approved loan
amount of $200.8 million are ongoing. These loans have an undisbursed balance of
$118.0 million as of August 31, 2006. All these loans were provided on concessional terms
from the Bank’s special fund resources—Asian Development Fund (ADF).
2.
ADB’s average annual lending level during 2002 and 2003 was $15.25 million. This
was much lower than the lending levels in the past, largely due to the government’s policy of
restrained borrowings as part of its debt strategy. This strategy envisages a reduction in the
size of the largely externally funded PIP from about 6 percent of GDP in 2001 to about
3 percent of GDP by 2005. ADB’s annual lending began with $40 million in 1994 and
reached the peak level of $89.2 million by 1997. Thereafter, lending levels fell slightly and
hovered between $65 million and $75 million through 2001. The level of assistance for the
block of two year 2005–06 was $60.8 million. The allocation for the block of two years
2007–08 is determined at $46 million. This program will be reviewed, based on the
availability of ADF funds and the rules governing grants, to make it consistent with the
Government’s debt reduction strategy and the limits on the PIP. In addition, ADB had
provided 64 technical assistance (TA) projects amounting to $37.5million as of today. Of
these, 17 are project preparatory TAs amounting to $11.3 million and the remaining 47 TAs
for $26.2 million are advisory TAs for capacity building, policy advice, institutional
strengthening and training. The Kyrgyz Republic has also received five JFPR Grants
amounting to $4 million.
3.
The performance of ADB’s portfolio is generally satisfactory, although one loan
was rated at risk. The scarcity of budgetary resources, and ceilings on the externally funded
PIP constituted the biggest risks to the country portfolio. ADB and the World Bank have thus
sought the removal of quarterly disbursement ceilings, which delay project implementation.
In August 2005, IMF agreed to be more flexible in determining annual targets for the PIP,
which is expected to improve portfolio performance.
4.
ADB’s assistance to the country has sought to support the development objectives of
the government’s National Poverty Reduction Strategy by fostering growth and providing
selective support for the social sectors. ADB’s strategy for 2006–08 supports government

9
approach to poverty reduction and accomplishment of Millennium Development Goals. In
particular, ADB’s social sector projects aim to improve access to pre-school and basic
education, primary vocational education, and maternity and child health services for the
poor.
5.
The allocation of ADF resources to the country is based on the government’s
attainment of performance targets (triggers) in five areas: (a) making steady progress in
macroeconomic management and structural reforms in the financial sector, and customs
administration; (b) making progress in prioritizing on-going PIP projects; (c) adhering to the
national debt reduction strategy; (d) finalizing the NPRS; and (e) implementing a package of
legal and judicial reforms for improving the investment climate for the private sector.
Accordingly, based on performance, allocation for the Kyrgyz Republic for 2005 and beyond
would range between $14.4 million and $32 million based on the availability of ADF
resources. ADB’s annual investment levels averaged $57.3 million during 1994–2004 and
fell down to $30.4 per year on average in 2005–06. From 2005 onward, up to 50 percent of
ADF assistance to the country will be in the form of grants.
6.
ADB coordinates its activities closely with the EBRD, IMF, IsDB, World Bank, the
UN System, and bilateral donors at all levels of development cooperation. There have been
significant strides forward in aid coordination since the last CG meeting held in Bishkek in
November 2002, when both the Government and the donors agreed to focus on improving
significantly coordination efforts. Since then efforts are being made to share sectoral and
operational information and better coordinate lending and technical assistance activities.
Since 2003, ADB and World Bank, which together account for over 75 percent of the PIP,
conducts a joint portfolio review. The Kyrgyz Republic is one of the partnership countries
selected for harmonization of donor procedures at the Rome conference on harmonization
held in February 2002.
7.
The Kyrgyz Resident Mission, which plays a pivotal role in aid coordination, is
participating in the working group set up by the Government to identify areas for
harmonization of donor procedures. The areas identified for harmonization in the immediate
future are: (a) procedures for procurement of goods and services; (b) financial management
and monitoring of projects; and (c) project implementation units. World Bank and ADB
procurement documentation has been harmonized in these areas.
8.
Starting from September 2005, ADB together with other major bilateral and
multilateral agencies (DFID, SDC/seco, UN, and WB) providing assistance to the Kyrgyz
Republic is developing a joint Country Support Strategy for the period 2007–10 to improve
donor harmonization and alignment, and ensure more consolidated donor assistance to the
country.

10
ANNEX IV. KYRGYZ REPUBLIC—RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (EBRD)
(As of August 31, 2006)
1.
The EBRD facilitates the transition to a market-based economy through its direct
support for private sector investment and key infrastructure, and targeted technical
assistance. Under its recently introduced Early Transition Countries’ Initiative (ETCI), which
is of particular relevance to the Kyrgyz Republic, the Bank is introducing innovative
instruments, and will consider smaller, more difficult projects. The ETCI also foresees
technical cooperation (TC) to support investment development.
2.
According to the Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic approved in November 2004, the
Bank’s priorities for the period of 2004–06 are to: (a) foster the private sector; (b) strengthen
the financial sector; (c) provide support for essential infrastructure; and (d) strengthen the
policy dialogue to improve the investment climate and support reform efforts.
3.
As of 30 June 2006, the Bank had approved 39 projects (including restructurings)
including EUR 766.7 million of investment out of which the Bank had financed 23 percent
for a gross commitment of EUR 174.1 million. During the past three years, the Bank
expanded its activities in the financial sector to include:
The Kyrgyz Micro and Small Enterprises Financing Facility (MSEFF). As of 30 June
2006, more than $108 million (cumulative) had been disbursed to 52,833 small and
medium-size enterprises via six participating local commercial banks. The bank has
now signed credits with non banking institutions—Bai-Tushum, KAFC and FINCA.
Equity investments in Ineximbank, Demir Bank, and KICB.
Expansion of Trade Facilitation Program (TFP). Four banks are participants in the
TFP.
In 2004, the Bank signed a cofinancing facility of $4 million to KICB. This new ETC
product is provided to meet financing needs of emerging medium-sized private
companies. The first sub loan agreement has been signed on December 26, 2005 for
EUR 450,000.
Other activities of the Bank include:
Five investments (equivalent to $3.1 million) via the Direct Investment Facility.
$20 million loan and $10 million sub debt, since converted into $17 m equity
participation in Centerra Gold (the Bank's senior loan have been fully repaid).
Loan to Hyatt-Regency Hotel, $6.3 million in 1997.
Loan to Interglass plant, $6 million in 2004.
Loan to Limatex (cotton-processing plant in Djalal-Abad), $1 million in 2005.
Loan to Raduga Invest (resort on Issyk-Kul lake), $6 million in 2005.
Although the Bank is currently unable to provide loans with sovereign guarantee the
Bank continues to monitor public sector projects:

11
Modernization of the telecommunications network ($7.9 million).
Two projects to upgrade electricity transmission networks in Issyk-Kul and Talas
regions ($63 million combined).
4.
The Bank also implements grant-funded TC to support its investment portfolio,
including the financial sector (including MSFF consultants among others), natural
resources/environment, agribusiness and infrastructure. Recent TCs include:
In telecoms, to advise on key reforms, including inter-capacity access arrangements;
Training for judges in commercial law;
Investor protection reform initiative;
Roll out of the Business Advisory Service and Turn Around Management programs,
providing consulting services to viable businesses.
5.
Finally, the Bank maintains an active dialogue with the government. For example, the
Bank was instrumental in founding the International Business Council, which is devoted to
working with the government on improving the investment climate. The Bank also has
provided guidance on legal reforms, such as the newly revised Law on Pledge.

ANNEX VI. KYRGYZ REPUBLIC—STATISTICAL ISSUES
General framework
1.
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The three institutions responsible for
collecting, compiling and disseminating macroeconomic statistics—the National Statistics
Committee (NSC), the ministry of economy and finance (MOF), and the National Bank of
Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR)—have legal and institutional environments that support statistical
quality, and their respective staff are well versed in current methodologies. Unlike staff
resources, however, computer and financial resources are generally not commensurate with
current needs and therefore constrain statistical development, especially for the NSC.

2.
The NSC maintains a comprehensive and regularly updated web site with data that
largely incorporate international methodological recommendations and adequate coverage
and timeliness (http://www.stat.kg). In February 2004, following improvements in
compilation and dissemination of the reserves template and external debt data, the Kyrgyz
Republic subscribed to the SDDS.
3.
A data ROSC mission in November 2002 assessed the data dissemination practices
against the GDDS and undertook an in-depth assessment of the quality of national accounts,
prices, government finance, monetary, and balance of payments statistics. The mission
concluded that the quality of the Kyrgyz Republic’s macroeconomic statistics had improved
significantly in the last few years. The authorities had established a good track record of
implementing recommendations of past technical assistance missions in statistics and had
demonstrated commitment to pursue plans and programs to further improve their statistics.
The mission recommended that a program of regular intersectoral consistency checks be
introduced to reduce the sometimes significant, unexplained discrepancies between the
government finance, monetary, and balance of payments datasets. The authorities’ response
to the data module ROSC (posted on the IMF website (www.imf.org/external/np/rosc)
includes an update on the status of implementation of the ROSC mission’s recommendations.
National accounts
4.
In general, dissemination of national accounts statistics is timely. Technical
assistance has been received from the IMF, EUROSTAT, OECD, the World Bank, and
bilateral donors. While significant progress has been made in improving the national
accounts estimation process, problems persist regarding the quality of the source data, due
mainly to excessively tight collection deadlines associated with the national accounts release
schedule. Efforts are needed to improve the quality of the source data for quarterly GDP
estimates. Moreover, subannual national accounts statistics are still prepared on a cumulative
basis rather than by discrete time periods. Difficulties also remain in properly estimating the
degree of underreporting, especially in the private sector. To improve the coverage and
reliability of primary data, work has been undertaken to introduce sampling procedures.

15
Improved sampling procedures have been adopted for household surveys and new report
forms are being introduced for the enterprise survey. The NSC has established a division of
sample surveys, which would assist in improving the sampling techniques.
Prices, wages, and employment
5.
The concepts and definitions used in the consumer price index (CPI), which has been
published since January 1995, are broadly consistent with international standards. The price
index covers all urban resident households of all sizes and income levels, but excludes rural
households, which comprise the majority of the population. The ROSC mission
recommended that the authorities expand the coverage of the CPI to include rural
households.
6.
The producer price index (PPI), which has been published since October 1996, is
compiled broadly in accordance with international standards, although its coverage needs to
be improved. The coverage of the PPI was broadened in May 1997 and is expected to be
further expanded in the coming years.
7.
Progress has been made in computing unit value indices for imports and exports.
Work continues with regard to computation of these indices using a standard index
presentation and the development of an export price index. However, problems in customs
administration have led to incomplete coverage of trade and the lack of an appropriate
valuation system. Moreover, the data processed by customs have suffered due to the use of
an outdated computer software system.
8.
Problems exist in the compilation of the average wage, especially with respect to the
valuation of payments in kind and the coverage of the private sector. Monthly and annual
data are not comparable because of different coverage and classifications. These problems
extend to employment data as well. The coverage of unemployment includes an estimate of
unregistered unemployed.
Fiscal accounts
9.
The scope of central government statistics falls short of international standards
because it excludes data for the Social Fund and the externally financed Public Investment
Program (these data are published separately). Other limitations involve the exclusion of
financial transactions with domestic banks and the discrepancies between the deficit and
financing data. While revenue and expenditure data generally accord with the GFSM 1986,
there are misclassifications in both categories (for example, some nontax revenues are
classified as taxes, and certain expenditure items are misclassified in the budget and treasury

16
accounts). Monthly GFS data for IFS publication have been reported up to June 2006.
Annual GFS data however, are reported for the GFS Yearbook, with the latest data being for
2005, covering budgetary central government and local government operations.
10.
The provision of data on public external debt service has improved. Data on actual
debt service, guaranteed debt service, outstanding debt and revised debt projections, are
provided on a monthly basis. The quality (including timeliness) of external debt data is
adequate. The External Debt Division of the MOF is now solely responsible for monitoring
external debt, and this division has benefited from on-site training provided by a Swissfinanced long-term consultant and the computerization of its database.
Monetary sector
11.
The 2002 data ROSC mission found that: (a) the residency criterion was not
uniformly applied, as the currency denomination was used to classify some transactions with
foreign and domestic units; (b) deposits with banks in liquidation were included in broad
money; and (c) source data did not provide sufficient information for a more detailed sectoral
breakdown (e.g., subsectorization of nonbank institutions as recommended in the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM)).
12.
An STA mission on monetary and financial statistics visited Bishkek during
April 27–May 11, 2004 to (a) follow up on the implementation of the ROSC mission’s
recommendations; (b) expand the institutional coverage of the broad money survey; and
(c) assist the NBKR in implementing the methodology in the MFSM. This mission found that
the NBKR had made substantial progress in implementing the ROSC mission’s
recommendations pertaining to monetary statistics. To address the outstanding issues, the
mission further recommended that the NBKR (a) improve the basic source data to allow for
proper classification of the transactions with foreign and domestic units; (b) fully implement
the MFSM’s methodology concerning accrual accounting; (c) exclude deposits with banks in
liquidation from monetary aggregates and classify them as restricted deposits; and (d) set up
a working group to follow up on consistency between monetary and balance of payments
statistics. The mission also recommended expanding the current broad money survey to
include the accounts of credit unions and microfinance companies.
Monthly monetary data for IFS publication are reported on a regular and timely basis.
13.
Since December 2002, monetary data have been reported electronically to STA. In 2005, the
NBKR began reporting its monetary data to STA using Standardized Report Forms, which
are designed in accordance with the MFSM’s methodology.

17
External sector
14.
Data on the balance of payments and international investment position are compiled
and disseminated on a quarterly basis. The 2002 data ROSC mission noted that the
compilation of balance of payments statistics broadly follows the Balance of Payments
Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5). The NBKR has good arrangements with other agencies to
ensure timely data flow. However, because of legal issues related to secrecy provisions, high
value transactions cannot be verified with respondents, limiting the ability to cross-check the
accuracy of data. Although the data collection program has been expanded in the recent past,
coverage deficiencies remain with respect to trade, services, and foreign direct investment.
The NBKR enterprise surveys lack an up-to-date register and have inadequate coverage of
enterprises, particularly those in free economic zones. There is also a need to improve
compilation procedures for achieving temporal consistency of data, and investigating and
reconciling discrepancies.
15.
The NSC conducts a quarterly sample survey for the estimation of shuttle trade, and
uses customs records on the number of people crossing the border with CIS countries to
derive the sample. However, the high value limits applied for free import of goods by
individuals have fostered a large shuttle trade, which has complicated estimation of this
activity.
16.
An STA mission on balance of payments statistics was in Bishkek during March15–
29, 2004 in response to the authorities’ request for technical assistance to address
compilation issues, and to assess training needs. The mission noted that while improvements
have been made in several areas, further improvements were needed in the international
transactions reporting system; data sampling methods; and data validation and coverage,
particularly on trade, services, private sector external debt and foreign direct investment. The
mission developed a questionnaire for collecting data on foreign direct investments and
provided guidelines on the collection of data on external debt.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
November 3, 2006
The following information has become available since the staff report was issued on
October 20, 2006. It does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Economic activity has continued to rebound, with year-on-year real GDP growth of
3.2 percent through September. Output growth excluding the Kumtor gold mine (which
suffered a serious accident) exceeded 6 percent, led by construction and services. Twelvemonth inflation in September edged up to 5.3 percent. Faced with buoyant remittances and
short-term capital inflows, the National Bank has continued its active unsterilized foreign
exchange intervention. As a consequence, reserve money growth accelerated to 43 percent in
the 12 months ending October and gross official reserves now stand at $730 million or
4.3 months of projected 2007 imports of goods and services. Bank credit to the private sector
expanded by 51 percent in the 12 months ending September.
2.
Tax collections through September rose well above program projections, sparked by a
rapid increase in receipts from import transactions; receipts from domestic taxes grew much
slower. Budgetary execution to date has been in line with the program. The first reading of
the 2007 budget bill planned for September has been delayed to November and the
government plans to submit a revised bill in late November, with input from a brief Fund
staff visit planned shortly. The authorities have indicated that the phased fiscal
decentralization slated to start next year has been postponed, pending progress in capacity
building and clearer definition of central and local government fiscal competencies.
3.
Preliminary data show that end-September 2006 indicative targets have been met with
margins, except for the ceiling on reserve money. The authorities met the end-September
structural benchmark on formulation (in close cooperation with World Bank staff) of an
energy sector action plan, but the plan continues to be debated inside the government and
will likely be revised in consultation with Bank staff. As described in the staff report, the
current version features phased tariff hikes and supporting measures to improve bill
collections and reduce technical losses and theft, with a view to curtailing the electricity
sector’s quasi-fiscal deficit. Contrary to earlier indications, the authorities missed the
benchmark on expanding coverage of the Large Taxpayers Unit, which only amounted to
56 percent of total tax revenue versus the target of 60 percent.
4.
The authorities have just increased the minimum wage to som 340 ($8.70) a month
effective January 1, 2007, from the level of som 100 that has been in place for many years.
The upcoming staff visit will discuss the implications of this unexpected measure (e.g., on
indexation of tax brackets and deductions).
5.
Negotiations are underway with Uzbekistan on its proposal to raise the export price of
natural gas from $55 per thousand cubic meters effective January 2007; Uzbekistan’s asking
price ($100 per tcm) would further widen the Kyrgyz Republic’s external current account
deficit by 1 percent of GDP in 2007.

2
6.
The recent joint Fund/Bank FSAP update mission found the financial system resilient
to external shocks in light of its strong capital base. It left specific recommendations to
deepen financial sector reforms, and cautioned against the proposed consolidation of
financial sector supervision under the fledgling State Agency for Financial Supervision and
Reporting.
7.
World Bank and Fund staff will initiate discussions shortly with the authorities on
Completion Point triggers under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. Meanwhile, the government
has intensified its internal outreach effort on the HIPC process to address widespread
concerns from civil society and parliament.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 07/3
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 8, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the
Kyrgyz Republic
On November 3, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2006 Article IV consultation with the Kyrgyz Republic.1
Background
The authorities have maintained macroeconomic discipline in recent years, despite a
challenging political environment. The overall fiscal deficit of the general government has
declined from 5 percent of GDP in 2003 to 3.9 percent in 2005 and it is targeted to decline
further to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2006. The external current account deficit has widened over the
past two years, to an estimated 11 percent of GDP in 2006, despite a surge in workers’
remittances. The deficit is being financed by a rise in the net capital and financial account
balance, resulting in a healthy buildup in gross official reserves to about 4.3 months of projected
2007 imports of goods and services at present.
Economic activity is rebounding in 2006, with year-on-year real GDP growth of 3.2 percent
through September, after a slight contraction in 2005; output growth excluding the Kumtor gold
mine (which suffered a serious accident) exceeded 6 percent, led by the construction and
services sectors. From 2003 to 2005, per capita GDP in U.S. dollar terms rose by one-fourth
and the poverty rate fell from 50 percent of the population to 44 percent.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Despite the 2005 rescheduling of the Kyrgyz Republic’s debt by the Paris Club of official
creditors, the country’s external debt burden remains high. Debt relief under the enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative is expected to alleviate that burden and create
fiscal space in the coming years for scaling up poverty-reducing outlays, to assist in meeting the
Millennium Development Goals. Social spending has already increased from 14 percent of GDP
in 2003 to an estimated 15½ percent in 2006.
Inflation, which has remained in the 3-5 percent range in recent years, is projected to rise
slightly to just under 6 percent during 2006. Remonetization has gathered pace in recent years,
but the financial system remains relatively shallow by international standards. Comprehensive
financial reforms are under way and are slated to gain momentum under the Fund-supported
program. The Kyrgyz Republic continues to maintain a managed exchange rate float. Active
unsterilized central bank intervention in the foreign exchange market since early 2006 in
response to a surge in workers’ remittances and short-term capital inflows has fanned monetary
expansion, and the authorities will need to tighten monetary policy in the period ahead to keep
inflation in check.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the Kyrgyz government for maintaining economic stability and pressing
ahead with reforms, despite the challenging political environment. Directors welcomed the
government’s commitment to build further on these achievements under the economic program
for 2007. This will involve continued prudent fiscal and monetary policies and structural reforms
to improve the climate for private sector-led growth and poverty reduction.
Directors welcomed the progress made in updating the Country Development Strategy (CDS)
with ample civil society participation, and extending it to 2010. They considered the reform
agenda outlined in the CDS as a good roadmap to achieve the Millennium Development Goals
and exploit fully the promising growth potential in a low-inflation environment. They urged the
authorities to work toward the steadfast implementation of these reforms, building on intensive
outreach to domestic stakeholders and with support from the international community.
Directors noted that, while fiscal prudence has become entrenched, further improvements in tax
administration will be essential to underpin fiscal consolidation. In particular, it will be important
to complete the 2006 tax reform, secure prompt passage of the tax code before parliament, and
resist pressures to dilute the programmed reforms in the tax administration agencies. Directors
encouraged the authorities to continue enhancing public financial management, especially the
budgetary process and the tracking and targeting of pro-poor spending within a context of
overall expenditure restraint. They took positive note of the authorities’ intention to phase in the
planned fiscal decentralization carefully and build local government capacity, in order to forestall
a loss of fiscal control.
Directors welcomed the programmed payroll tax cuts, which would foster job creation and
legalization of the informal economy. However, Directors expressed concern about the adverse
fiscal consequences of the proposed reduction in the retirement age. They called on the

3
authorities to forge a broad consensus in favor of a comprehensive pension reform aimed at
safeguarding fiscal stability and promoting domestic savings.
Directors took note of the joint Fund/World Bank debt sustainability analysis, which highlights
the Kyrgyz Republic’s heavy external debt burden. They noted that debt relief under the HIPC
Initiative and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative is expected to create fiscal space for scaling-up
poverty-reducing outlays, while underpinning debt sustainability. Directors, however, also
underscored that the government should persevere in its efforts to improve debt management,
continue refraining from nonconcessional borrowing, avoid the accumulation of contingent
liabilities, and ensure that externally funded investments are of the highest caliber. They also
underlined the need to align carefully any additional spending financed by asset sales or new
external loans with the program’s macroeconomic framework to help safeguard macroeconomic
stability and debt sustainability.
Directors commended the authorities’ success in keeping inflationary pressures in check, but
expected that a tightening of the monetary stance would be necessary to avert a spike in
inflation, in light of the recent easing in liquidity conditions and the envisaged hikes in utility
tariffs. They considered it appropriate for the central bank to maintain the managed exchange
rate float, while allowing for greater nominal exchange rate flexibility if the trend toward a further
real appreciation of the som persists. Directors saw scope for additional increases in policy
interest rates and a further broadening of monetary control instruments to keep liquidity
expansion in check.
Directors welcomed the resilience of the Kyrgyz financial system to external shocks, and the
authorities’ plans to deepen financial sector reforms, building on the findings of the recent
Financial Sector Assessment Program update. They encouraged the National Bank to continue
strengthening banking supervision, especially in light of the rapid credit growth. Directors looked
forward to the prompt passage of the pending bill to increase the National Bank’s autonomy as
a key step to bolster confidence and the credibility of monetary policy.
Directors supported the authorities’ intention to resolve governance weaknesses and
discourage rent-seeking behavior, both of which have diverted scarce resources and depressed
productivity growth over the years. In this context, they cautioned that an active industrial policy
could hamper the efforts in this area, and weaken the tax effort as well. Directors stressed the
need to improve the business climate to nurture private sector-led growth—including by
streamlining the regulatory framework, simplifying licensing and other administrative
procedures, and fostering regional integration. They urged the authorities to implement
steadfastly the energy sector plan to reduce the sector’s large quasi-fiscal deficits and provide
reliable power supplies for the domestic and export markets. Directors stressed that progress
on structural reforms will also remain key to strengthening and diversifying the export base,
thereby reducing the vulnerability to external shocks.

IMF Executive Board Completes Third Review Under the Kyrgyz Republic's PRGF
Arrangement and Approves US$1.9 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the third review
of the Kyrgyz Republic's performance under its economic reform program supported by a threeyear Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. In completing the review, the
Board approved the authorities’ request for a waiver for the nonobservance of the structural
performance criterion on the transfer of the ownership interest of KyrgyzAltyn JSC in Centerra
Gold Inc. to the State Property Fund.
The IMF's Executive Board approved the three-year arrangement on February 23, 2005
(see Press Release No. 05/40) for an amount equivalent to SDR 8.88 million (about
US$13.2 million). Completion of this review will enable the Kyrgyz Republic to draw an
amount equivalent of SDR1.27 million (about US$1.9 million), bringing total disbursements
under the arrangement to the equivalent of SDR 5.07 million (about US$7.5 million).
Following the Executive Board discussion of the Kyrgyz Republic’s economic performance,
Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair made the following statement:
“The authorities of the Kyrgyz Republic are to be commended for maintaining economic
stability and pressing ahead with reforms, despite the challenging political environment.
The economic program for 2007 seeks to preserve macroeconomic stability and deepen
structural reforms.
“While fiscal prudence has become entrenched, further improvements in tax administration and
public financial management are essential to underpin fiscal consolidation. The programmed
payroll tax cuts, aimed at fostering job creation and legalization of the informal economy, are
welcome. The authorities should now strive to forge a broad consensus on a comprehensive
pension reform that would safeguard fiscal stability and promote domestic savings. Steadfast
implementation of energy sector reforms will be key to reducing the sector’s large quasi-fiscal
deficit.
“Monetary policy will need to remain vigilant to avert a spike in inflation, in light of the easing
in liquidity conditions over the past months. The current managed float exchange rate system
continues to serve the country well, and the National Bank’s plans to broaden monetary control

-2-

instruments to keep liquidity expansion in check, deepen financial sector reforms, and improve
bank supervision are welcome. Prompt passage of the bill to increase the National Bank’s
autonomy would bolster confidence and the credibility of monetary policy.
“Going forward, it will remain important that the authorities persevere with their efforts to tackle
governance issues, enhance the business climate and social protection, and further advance debt
management, so as to improve the prospects for a rapid and sustained improvement in living
standards,” Mr. Kato said.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in each country's
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PRGF-supported
programs are consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and
social policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of
0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5½-year grace period on principal payments.

Statement by Thomas Moser, Executive Director for Kyrgyz Republic
Sadriddin Djienbekov, Advisor to Executive Director
November 3, 2006

1.
On behalf of our Kyrgyz authorities, we would like to thank the staff for their support
and the constructive policy dialogue. The Kyrgyz authorities have continued to maintain
macroeconomic discipline and implement the structural reforms supported by the PRGF
arrangement, in spite of the very challenging political environment. All quantitative
performance criteria and end-June structural benchmarks were met, with tax collection
running above and the fiscal deficit below program projections. The authorities have also, in
close cooperation with the World Bank, formulated an energy sector action plan, and the
program’s half-year target for the energy sector’s quasi-fiscal deficit (QFD) was met with
some margin.
2.
The authorities are determined to continue their prudent fiscal policy. In line with
staff advice, they intend to carefully phase in the fiscal decentralization mandated by
parliament and they have delayed for the time being the implementation of the process, while
they proceed to build capacity and seek a clearer definition of fiscal competencies. The
government has also suspended the implementation of the parliament-mandated reduction in
the retirement age and sought World Bank assistance to design a broader pension reform. In
addition, the government has intensified its outreach effort on the HIPC Initiative and
requested a ROSC mission on fiscal transparency.
3.
The recent increase in the monthly minimum wage from som 100 to 340 is mainly a
technical and symbolic measure, virtually without fiscal implications. The effective monthly
minimum wage paid by the government remains at som 450 a month, and all the budget
calculations, including the wage bill and pension benefit projections under the PRGFsupported program, have used a minimum wage of som 450. The increase will not influence
labor market conditions either, because the average monthly minimum wage paid in the
private sector (around som 1000) is substantially higher than the new minimum wage.
4.
The authorities are asking for a waiver for nonobservance of the structural
performance criterion on the transfer of the shares in the Centerra Canadian mining
conglomerate (held by the Kyrgyzaltyn SOE) to the State Property Fund, based on a legal
finding that the transfer would not be feasible. To effectively fulfill the spirit of the missed
performance criterion, the government has issued a resolution prohibiting the sale of Centerra
shares without government authorization and specifying that the proceeds from any sales of
these shares will be used strictly in accordance with guidelines set by the government. The
annual receipts from any sales of Centerra shares will be channeled through the central
government budget.
5.
Monetary policy is currently complicated by very strong inflows of workers’
remittances and private capital inflows and continued remonetization. The National Bank has
allowed the exchange rate to appreciate and gradually increased policy interest rates. To keep
liquidity expansion in check, the NBKR will enhance its menu of monetary control

2
instruments. The NBKR further intends to deepen financial sector reforms with technical
advice from the IMF and other donors. The authorities remain committed to make every
effort to secure approval of legislation before parliament to enhance the NBKR’s legal
independence and legal protection for its employees in performing official duties.
6.
The staff has been very helpful in discussing with our authorities the Kyrgyz
Republic’s new Country Development Strategy, which was approved recently by the
government. The upcoming discussions with World Bank and Fund staff on Completion
Point triggers under the HIPC Initiative will provide further opportunity for the government
to attend to the recommendations and concerns raised by the staff.
