EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In 2006, worsening economic performance and stalled reforms led to general strikes
and mass protests. Monetization of the budget deficit and extrabudgetary expenditure
resulted in money supply expansion of over 80 percent. Economic growth slowed, inflation
accelerated to the second-highest rate in sub-Saharan Africa, and international reserves fell
to less than one month of imports.
In the second quarter of 2007, a new government came into office with a mandate for
far-reaching reforms. The government initiated stabilization measures and launched a new
Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS-II) centered on improving governance that gained wide
domestic and international support. Together with a return of confidence in the currency,
the tightened fiscal and monetary policies halved inflation in less than six months.
Policy discussions focused on:
•

Conditions for higher growth and poverty reduction. The government needs to
consolidate economic stabilization; improve the business environment; adopt best
international practices (especially for the tax regime) to valorize Guinea’s potential in
the extractive industries; rehabilitate public utilities; and reinforce the country’s
economic institutions.

•

Medium-term fiscal strategy. Revenue collection needs to be boosted through tax
administration measures, and prospective debt relief would create fiscal space for
additional social and infrastructure investment spending. Public finance reform is a
cornerstone for improved governance and transparency and a more effective fiscal
policy.

•

Exchange rate. Foreign exchange market reforms and the buildup of foreign reserves
should enable the central bank to maintain the floating exchange rate while smoothing
daily exchange rate fluctuations. The real exchange rate does not seem to be
inconsistent with external sustainability, assuming continued aid, debt relief, and
prudent macroeconomic policies.

Staff supports the authorities’ request for a three-year PRGF arrangement. The design
of the PRGF-supported program is aligned with the PRS-II and is tailored to the
circumstances that make Guinea a fragile state; the goal is to allow Guinea to establish the
preconditions for sustained medium-term growth. Satisfactory completion of a solid set of
prior actions (including safeguards-related measures), a high degree of program ownership,
and broad support for the PRGF from Guinean authorities and civil society will help
mitigate the short-term risks, but significant risks still remain. Successful performance will
pave the way for the country to reach the HIPC completion point and benefit from MDRI,
which would reduce the external debt burden to sustainable levels.

5
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
A new government was formed in March 2007 with a definite popular mandate for
reform, after widespread and violent protests against rising inflation and poor governance
early in 2007. The government took immediate measures to re-establish control of economic
policies and quickly launched a short-term recovery program. Its main objectives were to
consolidate national unity and preserve peace; restore the rule of law and promote an independent
justice system; restore macroeconomic equilibrium; promote good governance and reinforce
administrative capacity; and mobilize resources for infrastructure development and basic services
delivery.
2.
The government quickly initiated discussions on a recovery program. A staff team
visited Conakry in April–May 2007 to assess the economic situation and discuss the economic
aspects of the recovery program. The scope of the stabilization measures and Prime Minister
Kouyaté’s stated commitment to reforms during a visit to Washington in June 2007 opened the
way for discussions of a program that could be supported by the PRGF.
3.
A new Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS-II) for 2007–10 was finalized in August
1
2007. It establishes good governance as the pillar of its strategy. The recovery program and the
PRS-II received backing and financial support from the international community at a donor
conference in Paris in July 2007, with part of the proposed medium-term financing made
conditional on a Fund-supported program.
II. BACKGROUND
4.
Despite a rich endowment of natural resources, Guinea is one of the world’s poorest
countries. It ranks among the lowest on the Human Development Index and other standard
indicators of development. Yet Guinea is estimated to house about one third of the world’s
known bauxite reserves,2 and it also has an abundance of gold, diamonds, iron ore, and uranium.
It also has yet to fully utilize its economic potential in agriculture, fishing, and forestry.
5.
Guinea’s fragility has been exacerbated by governance problems and external
factors, including regional instability. Governance and doing business indicators in Guinea
compare poorly with the average of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (Figures 1–2). The 2004 Ex Post
Assessment (EPA) and the authorities’ recent evaluation of the PRS-I, identified structural
deficiencies and insufficient political support as the main obstacles that prevented the country
from reaching its potential. Among the deficiencies are a poor business climate caused by
endemic corruption, inadequate legal protection, unreliable public services, and lack of basic
infrastructure; problems of absorptive capacity, notably for foreign-financed investments; and
insufficient and ineffective decentralization. Conflicts in neighboring countries and adverse
trends in external terms of trade have also contributed to the country’s ills.

and the fact that Guinea has

the HIV/AIDS crisis that has ravaged other parts of SSA. The overall disappointing results (in
particular in comparison with SSA) are due in part to stop-and-go macroeconomic policies that
led to several episodes of high inflation and, incidentally, a reduction in foreign aid flows. Since
2000, growth has not been sufficient to keep up with population.

8
7.
Guinea’s performance on the staff-monitored program (SMP) from April 2005
through March 2006 was satisfactory, but the reform momentum could not be sustained.
The tightening of fiscal and monetary policies to some extent reduced inflation, but policy
slippages in the last months of the program and the dismissal of the government in April 2006
slowed momentum and stalled the transition to a PRGF-supported program.

9.
The relaxation of fiscal efforts, compounded by a loose monetary policy, was the
main cause of the economic deterioration. As a result of overruns in current expenditure
(including substantial off-budget “sovereignty” outlays), the overall fiscal deficit (excluding
grants) deteriorated by more than 2 percent of GDP. The deficit was financed mainly by the
BCRG and, to a lesser degree, by the accumulation of domestic and external arrears. This and
the lack of enforcement of reserve requirements on bank deposits led to the rapid expansion of
reserve money, fueling inflation and exchange rate depreciation.

B. Developments in 2007 and Prospects for the Rest of the Year
10.
The general strike of early 2007 and the agreement that ended it, had a significant
economic cost. Several sectors of the economy, including services, were paralyzed for most of
the two months of protests. The agreement signed at the end of February by the previous
government, trade unions, and civil service organizations provided for measures to offset the
negative impact of past inflation, including an increase in government worker compensation. It
also featured a ban on exports of foodstuffs and fishing and forestry products, and a reduction in
the retail price of petroleum products for the rest of 2007.
11.
Economic activity is expected to recover slowly. Several sectors continue to be
constrained by frequent power outages and low government spending. However, most mining
companies were able to operate without significant interruption. Because of favorable weather
conditions, prospects for agriculture have remained good, despite the ban on exports.
12.
In the six months through September 2007, the authorities pursued fiscal and
monetary tightening to stabilize the

13.
Strict economic management contributed to rapid disinflation and a strong
appreciation of the local currency. Twelve-month inflation decelerated to 17 percent by
September and seems to be on track to reach the year-end target of 15 percent, despite foodrelated price increases. The Guinean franc appreciated by 40 percent in nominal terms in the
first half of the year, supported by confidence in the new economic management team and
discontinuation of BCRG purchases in the foreign exchange market.3 As economic activity and
imports resumed, some of the appreciation was reversed in the third quarter.

3

Moreover, the shortage of local currency banknotes in banks during the first months of 2007 brought foreign
currency notes back to the foreign exchange market and helped boost the exchange rate temporarily.

11
14.
The external situation is still precarious; official reserves are low and external
arrears are accumulating. In 2007, the underlying current account deficit (excluding
imports for large mining projects) is expected to further deteriorate in U.S. dollar terms,
reflecting higher oil import prices and the ban on agricultural exports. Balance of payments
developments have already led to a further drawdown on net international reserves to less
than two weeks of imports at the end of September 2006, and a further buildup of external
arrears, which were US$87.7 million at the end of September 2007, up from US$60 million
at the end of 2006.
15.
The new government initiated far-reaching reforms to improve transparency,
governance, and management of public resources. To restore financial control, monthly
expenditure ceilings were given to line ministries, automatic debits of treasury accounts by
the BCRG were suspended, and extrabudgetary expenditures were prohibited, as were ad hoc
tax or customs exemptions. The government initiated audits for most administrations,
including the BCRG. It also ordered a review of several mining contracts to check their
conformity with best international practices and the appropriateness of the government share
in mining revenue, and implemented measures related to the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI).4 High-level staffing changes requested by the new
government to improve efficiency and integrity in the public administration are pending.
16.
The authorities pushed forward with long-overdue reforms in the central bank.
In response to the preliminary results of an external audit, the BCRG and the treasury signed
an agreement reconciling mutual claims and setting the repayment and debt service schedule.
Recently, the BCRG revised some of its accounts to align them with the findings of a special
audit of monetary data. It is also taking early steps to strengthen its accounting and internal
control procedures, as recommended by the external audit and the recent IMF Safeguards
Assessment (see Box 1). The new central bank governor, who was appointed in May 2007, is
moving ahead with these reforms and has requested substantial technical assistance (TA)
from the Fund.

4

Guinea adhered to the EITI in 2005. The first EITI report auditing government revenue data from six mining
companies for 2005 was published in October 2007. It found that payments reported by the authorities and the
companies matched closely.

12
Box 1. Guinea: Safeguards Assessment Update for the BCRG
An update safeguards assessment of the BCRG completed in October 2007 confirmed the existence of
critical weaknesses that pose a high risk to the safeguarding of Fund disbursements. Among the
problems identified:
•

The external auditor expressed an adverse opinion on the bank’s 2006 financial statements noting that the
accounts were inaccurate and incomplete. Key information was not made available to the independent
auditor. The appointment of an external auditor was a recommendation of the 2002 safeguards
assessment.

•

Basic controls, especially for reserve management operations, are lacking.

•

The BCRG Board was not given enough information to fulfill its oversight responsibilities (in particular,
information from external audit findings and the Audit Committee were not made available to the BCRG
Board).

•

The BCRG lacks independence and has not been able to resist pressure from senior government
authorities to bypass the control system for government payments and credit, resulting in breaches of the
BCRG law and payments of sovereignty expenditures.

Strong mitigating measures were recommended by the safeguards assessment to address the systemic
control breakdowns and help mitigate the safeguards risks that are related to a prospective Fund
program. These measures aim to strengthen the BCRG’s governance and oversight arrangements, begin the
process of immediately addressing specific anomalies noted by the external auditor, and provide a basis to
calculate monetary data used for quantitative performance criteria. Immediate actions include:
•

Strengthen budgetary controls. The BCRG should not make any payments outside of approved budget
procedures. In particular, it should not make any payments for the government without prior authorization
from the minister of finance, economy and plan, or payments for the office of the Presidency outside of
the approved budget spending procedures.

•

Establish a separate account at the BIS to administer future PRGF disbursements.

•

Publish the 2006 audited financial statements with the external auditor opinion.

•

Complete a special audit of monetary program data for end-June 2007.

The special audit has already resulted in a substantial correction of foreign correspondent balances and
the identification of other unexplained differences in these accounts. For example, the audit report has
restated net foreign assets from negative GNF 25.9 billion (according to the BCRG) to negative GNF
82.9 billion, while also noting that they cannot confirm that all foreign liabilities have been reported.

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.
Many recommendations of the 2005 Article IV consultation remain relevant for
the current economic situation. While these recommendations had little impact on actual
policies until recently, the new authorities have promptly started to implement some of them,
including the tightening of monetary and fiscal policies, and the strengthening of public
finance management. Progress has started to be made on key other recommendations such as
improving tax and customs administrations, enhancing institutional capacities of the central
bank, intensifying reform of the public utilities and increasing flexibility of the retail
petroleum prices.

13
18.
The 2007 Article IV discussions focused on the central challenges for Guinea: (i) the
medium-term macroeconomic framework for reducing poverty; (ii) short-term budget
constraints and fiscal strategy; and (iii) monetary and exchange rate reforms.
A. Medium-term Framework and Poverty Reduction Strategy

20.
While the ambitious medium-term inflation targets seem achievable, staff
stressed that it will be vital that the government continue to refrain from new central
bank financing of the budget. The prudent fiscal stance is anchored in consolidation of the
basic primary fiscal balance, which is projected to increase to more than 4 percent of GDP by
2010. Monetary policy will complement the fiscal stance by keeping growth in the reserve
money close to nominal GDP growth, which will create enough room to increase credit to the
private sector.
21.
The consolidation of progress toward macroeconomic stabilization will
contribute to the medium-term strengthening of Guinea’s external position. The
underlying current account deficit is projected to increase to over 4 percent of GDP in 2008,
mainly on account of the rise in imports (boosted by growth, rising international prices for
petroleum and food products, and a projected increase in foreign-financed government
investment). The deficit will however stabilize at a reduced 2-3 percent of GDP in the
medium-term with the implementation of strict macroeconomic policies and the projected
increase in mining and agricultural exports. Together with the expected debt relief, this
would make possible the gradual buildup of gross foreign reserves to cover three months of
imports by the end of 2010.
22.
Improving the institutions that affect the mining sector is critical for growth
prospects to materialize. Several mining projects, most notably for bauxite and its

14
transformation into alumina and iron ore, are among the largest in Africa; they could bring in
up to US$27 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) over the next eight years and boost
export prospects. However, if that is to happen, the laws relating to mining must be clarified
and modernized. The authorities are working with development partners to revise the 1995
Mining Code and adopt a model contract consistent with international best practices,
especially for taxation. The model contract would also serve as a blueprint for the envisaged
renegotiation of current and pending contracts.
23.
Of vital importance in the medium term is improving access to and the quality of
public services, especially electricity delivery. In the World Bank’s 2006 Enterprise
Survey, almost two-thirds of companies responding—about twice the average proportion in
sub-Saharan Africa—identified the

authorities are working with
development partners to tap into the
country’s hydroelectric potential and to upgrade infrastructure to improve the performance of
Électricité de Guinée (EDG). The authorities also have committed to placing EDG on a
sound financial footing by improving management and introducing performance contracts,
paying bills promptly, eliminating cross-debts, and adopting appropriate tariff policies.5 They
are considering a similar commitment for the water sector.
24.
Staff argued that price controls were costly and ineffective in controlling
inflation, and removing the ban on some exports should not be delayed. The reduction in
the retail price of petroleum products that was decided in early 2007 carried substantial and
unsustainable opportunity costs for the government budget (especially in light of rising world
oil prices, which also spurred illegal re-exports to neighboring countries) and the balance of
payments.6 The ban on agricultural, forestry, and fishing exports does not have obvious shortterm gains for inflation, compounds Guinea’s external position, and might adversely affect
farmers’ incomes, especially the poorest.7 These sectors have significant growth potential,
their development would diversify the export base and increase employment opportunities
5

According to the World Bank, EDG’s losses from transmission and distribution were approximately
60 percent of production in 2004–05, and about 25 percent of bills are uncollected. The combined potentially
foregone revenues amounted to US$42 million in 2004.

A temporary subsidy scheme for rice imports was also implemented on social grounds in September–
October 2007.

for the poor. More broadly, staff emphasized that such controls may not succeed in protecting
the poor from adverse developments, whereas well-targeted subsidies would offer superior
and more cost-effective alternatives.
25.
A low-income country external debt sustainability analysis (LIC-DSA) confirms
that Guinea’s external debt is unsustainable without HIPC and MDRI debt relief
(see DSA Supplement). Based on debt at the end of 2006, the DSA finds that the country is
in debt distress. Even though external debt declined somewhat in 2005–06, it remained above
100 percent of GDP; full service of the external debt alone would have consumed as much as
53 percent of revenues. Assuming that Guinea reaches the HIPC completion point at the end
of 2008, full relief would reduce the NPV of debt by about 60 percent—putting it below the
policy-based thresholds—though the outcome would be vulnerable to exogenous shocks.
This argues in favor of a prudent external debt strategy that relies on grants and concessional
financing.
B. Fiscal Strategy
26.
Mobilizing more revenue will be crucial if Guinea is to reach its fiscal deficit
objectives. Revenues would need to reach 15.5 percent by 2010, an increase of more than
2 percentage points from 2007. Part of this increase will come from the projected expansion
of mining production,8 but the bulk will come from nonmining revenues. This can be
achieved by enhancing the financial and human resources devoted to revenue collection;
making the tax and customs directorates more accountable; enlarging the tax base; and
improving enforcement, particularly through tighter control over exemptions.
27.
Debt relief is expected to create the room needed for poverty-reducing spending.
Total government spending is projected to stabilize at about 17 percent of GDP, but its
composition will move away from interest payments on external debt toward priority capital
spending. Public investment is projected to increase by 3 percent of GDP through 2010,
consistent with the PRS-II objective of catching up on basic priority and growth-enhancing
infrastructure.
28.
The authorities’ wish to catch up on civil service employment and wages is
addressed within a moderate increase in primary current spending over the medium
term. Noting substantial hiring needs in social sectors and government remunerations that
are low by international standards, the authorities argued for a significant upfront increase in
wages and job creation. While finding merit in the argument, staff stressed that such
increases should be implemented in the context of carefully crafted sectoral medium-term
expenditure frameworks (MTEFs), and weighed against inflation risks and budgetary
constraints. It recommended that priority be given to merit-based remuneration (to strengthen
personnel management) and to moving more forcefully against ghost workers.
8

The planned tax audits of several mining companies could also bring in more revenue.

16
29.
Reform of public financial management (PFM) is a cornerstone of the strategy to
improve governance, transparency, and the effectiveness of fiscal policy. Staff welcome
the authorities’ intention to draft a comprehensive multiyear action plan based on a recent
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment and Fund TA
recommendations. It should cover budget preparation and approval (based in part on the
planned introduction of functional budget classification); budget execution procedures;
decentralization issues; ex ante and ex post controls; information sharing (especially between
the central bank and the government); debt management systems (including tracking the
stock of domestic debt, assessing arrears claims, and eliminating cross-debts); and liquidity
management (such as reinstating a single treasury account). Staff encourages the authorities
to adopt sectoral MTEFs that translate the PRS-II priorities into budgetary allocations for key
ministries. This would improve multi-year planning of investment projects and their recurrent
component, and help identify and remove bottlenecks in the execution of programs.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies and Financial Sector Reforms
30.
The authorities agreed that the causes of inflation were mainly monetary and
that, against the backdrop of a floating exchange rate, reserve money should be the
nominal anchor. Reserve money grew by an average of 31 percent for 2000–06 and by more
than 80 percent in 2006. The growth in reserve money encouraged lax fiscal policies through,
among other things, unsterilized purchases of foreign exchange for quasi-fiscal operations,
which undermined the value of the currency and fueled inflation and dollarization. In recent
years, dollarization itself has reinforced the pass-through impact of international price
increases to domestic prices.9 To reverse these trends and achieve low single-digit inflation in
the medium term, the BCRG will need to strictly align reserve money growth with nominal
GDP.
31.
Staff reviewed the classification of the exchange rate regime as a managed float
with no predetermined path. Guinea adopted a floating exchange rate regime in 2005.
Since then, there have been large swings in the official exchange rate against the dollar
(Figure 4). When the BCRG at times attempted to resist downward pressures through
administrative measures, the premium on the parallel exchange rate market widened. While
acknowledging that large swings were detrimental to the economy, the authorities concurred
that the floating regime was appropriate and that progress toward exchange market reforms
and continuing prudent macroeconomic policies should help re-establish the bank’s capacity

9

This is discussed in Gorbanyov, “The determinants of inflation in Guinea”, IMF Working Paper
(forthcoming).

to smooth daily fluctuations. Following the BCRG decision to eliminate its administrative
measures, the parallel market premium narrowed to about 4 percent at end-October 2007.
32.
While volatility and continuing structural changes make it difficult to assess the
equilibrium level of the exchange rate, the most recent exchange rate level seems
appropriate for external sustainability assuming continued aid, debt relief, and prudent
macroeconomic policies. The real exchange rate have steadily deteriorated for the last
25 years. Although standard econometric approaches do not provide a clear view of the
fundamental reasons for this depreciation trend (Box 2), it is likely to reflect a vicious circle
initiated by structural impediments (including poor governance, weak export performance,
uncontrolled aggregate demand driving imports) leading to depletion of official reserves and
the accumulation of external arrears, lost confidence in the local currency and rising
dollarization. All these factors further depreciated the exchange rate and accentuated the
external debt overhang. Attempts to break this vicious circle, including in the context of the
HIPC Initiative, were derailed by external (regional conflicts) and domestic (political
instability) factors. The appreciation of the real effective exchange rate since the beginning of
2007 is a significant deviation from this trend. However, rather than reflecting a temporary
deviation from an uncertain equilibrium exchange rate, it may instead signal increased
market expectations of a structural shift toward successful stabilization and reform, external
support and debt relief, and foreign direct investment (FDI).
33.
Staff and authorities concurred that Guinea’s financial sector, although
generally sound, is underdeveloped and will need considerable attention in the medium
term to boost its contribution to growth. Banks seem to have been resilient to recent
macroeconomic shocks, including the volatile exchange rate: commercial banks continued to
meet minimum capital requirements, and their foreign exchange exposure stayed within
prudential limits. However, the BCRG should more vigorously enforce other prudential
limits, such as those related to loan concentration, mainly by strengthening onsite
supervision. The BCRG also plans to better supervise microfinance institutions to ensure in
particular that they comply with the microfinance law adopted in November 2005. Apart
from stability issues, the authorities wish to draw up a medium-term strategy of reforms in
the financial sector in order to move away from a largely cash-based economy, address
dollarization issues, and create financial instruments for the private sector beyond external
trade operations. Guinea’s participation in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP),
for which the country applied recently, would provide useful information on which to base
the strategy.

19
Box 2. Estimating the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate (ERER)
Based on three ERER models, the real effective exchange rate (REER) is in relative equilibrium in
2006, as its gradual depreciation from 1980 through 2006 appears to reflect changes in fundamentals.1
However, ERER estimates for 2006 (and hence the sign and magnitude of the REER deviation from
equilibrium) are subject to substantial uncertainty.2 In at least one ERER model, the REER appears
undervalued as of end-2006, which would imply that the appreciation observed since end-2006 would
not lead to an overvaluation.

Mean Group Estimator, and FMOLS to the panel data Fully Modified OLS estimator.

More fundamentally, the REER appreciation may reflect market anticipations of a regime shift that
the backward-looking ERER methodology does not capture. The brisk appreciation of nominal and real
exchange rates in the first half of 2007 was due in part to “announcement effects” after the strikes; it has
since been partially reversed. However, the enhanced credibility of structural policy changes within the
context of a program relationship, the anticipation of debt relief and improved donor relations, and prospects
of mining exports increasing as a result of major investments may all have contributed to a more appreciated
exchange rate.

___________
1

The methodology uses the single-equation and panel data approaches described in Chudik and Mongardini (WP/07/90). For the single-equation estimation, the
observed change in the REER over the period is found to be due primarily to an increase in government consumption (as a percentage of GDP) relative to the
weighted average for trading partners. This increase is assumed to reflect a shift toward the consumption of tradable goods, which would cause the ERER to
depreciate. The contribution to the decline in the ERER of other standard variables, such as terms of trade, relative productivity, or debt service (as a percentage
of exports) is either negligible or not significant.

2

For example: when measured against the ERER based on the single-equation estimation, the 2006 REER was 19.4 percent overvalued, whereas it was 32
percent undervalued against the panel FMOLS estimation.

V. PROGRAM
34.
The objectives of the program are to (i) consolidate macroeconomic
stabilization; and (ii) strengthen institutions and policies to establish the preconditions
for sustained higher growth and poverty reduction. The design of the PRGF-supported
program is consistent with the PRS-II and is tailored to the circumstances that make Guinea a
fragile state. The objective of the first program year is to stabilize the economy through
appropriate monetary and fiscal policies while putting in place basic governance structures
and laying the foundation for private-sector-led growth. The program would also help the

20
country strengthen rapidly its external position through external support and debt relief. Once
basic controls have been put in place, the focus of the program would shift towards the
deepening of reforms, particularly to improve the quality of public services and policies, and
to facilitate the smooth functioning of markets. The exact content of the program in the outer
years will be shaped by Fund TA, notably in the areas of tax administration, PFM, and
financial sector reforms.
A. Economic and Financial Program for 2007–08
Fiscal policy
35.
Fiscal policy in the second half of 2007 will remain tight. The fiscal deficit
objective is consistent with the 2007 budget. Despite the negative impact on revenue of the
January–February strikes and tax losses generated by the administrative lowering of
petroleum prices, the government projects only a 0.4 percent reduction in total revenue to the
equivalent of 12.9 percent of GDP in 2007. The revenue outcome over the first nine months
of this year indicates that this is achievable.10 Spending picks up relative to the first half of
the year with the resumption of normal government activities. However, for the year as a
whole, expenditures (except those financed from abroad) are projected to drop significantly
as a percentage of GDP to avoid any new central bank financing and to keep other bank
financing to about 0.5 percent of GDP.

nonmining sectors. The ambitious revenue
targets also reflect a return to normal revenue collection after the turbulent months of early
2007, including the gradual resumption of the automatic petroleum pricing mechanism

performance. This may indicate that economic activity is returning to normal.

21
(MEFP ¶47, a performance criterion).11 They are further supported by efforts to broaden the
tax base and improve revenue collection (the budget makes significant financial resources
available to the revenue agencies). On the expenditure side, investments in basic
infrastructure are projected to increase substantially. The increase in the wage bill reflects
additional hiring, notably in the education sector; a uniform 10 percent increase in base
wages; and targeted salary incentives. Spending in general is biased toward priority areas.
37.
On the revenue side, the emphasis will be on modernizing the tax and customs
directorates and reducing exemptions.12 Modernization of the two revenue agencies will be
accelerated, in part by signing and enforcing performance contracts for managers and
establishing mutual collaboration, including exchange of data. Current tax and customs
exemption regulations will be monitored and strictly enforced; meanwhile, they will be
critically reviewed, especially those related to the investment code. Although revenues from
mining could also accelerate, this would depend on the outcome of the planned audits of
mining companies, the adoption of a new model contract and the ongoing renegotiation of
several existing contracts, and progress with the development of the large projects. However,
given the uncertain outcome of these developments, staff concurred with the authorities that
forecasts for mining revenues should be kept conservative and progress should be reassessed
in future reviews.
38.
The authorities will finalize a strategy and three-year PFM action plan before
2008 and will appoint a steering committee to ensure follow-up and accountability. This
strategy and its action plan will build on the recommendations from recent Fund TA
missions. Measures for the first year of the program include:13
•

Budget preparation: revising the budget nomenclature to make it possible to track
poverty-reducing spending; and promptly preparing key sectoral MTEFs (in the
health and education sectors particularly) and a medium-term budget framework to
ensure that 2009 budget allocations reflect PRS-II objectives. These measures would
also contribute to gradually increase Guinea’s capacity to absorb foreign-financed
investments.

•

Budget execution: continuing to prohibit off-budget spending; publishing a list
limiting the spending allowed under exceptional budget procedures; eliminating
private bank accounts of public entities; and reconciling personnel and payroll files.

11

This measure is projected to raise tax revenue by about 1/4 percentage of GDP in 2008.

12

13

See details in the MEFP: ¶30–34, and Box 2.

22
•

Accounting, audit, and financial information: adopting improved government
accounting standards; and periodically reconciling treasury account balances with
those of the BCRG.

•

Revising the regulatory framework (including the charter budget law) to reflect the
planned reforms.

Monetary and exchange rate policies
39.
A prudent monetary stance will complement efforts to stabilize the economy and
improve foreign reserves.14 For end-2007, the program seeks to limit the growth rate of
reserve money to about 12 percent, well below nominal GDP growth, to harness inflation
pressures and offset the excessive liquidity that built up in 2006. For 2008, reserve money
growth will be limited to about 15 percent, broadly in line with nominal GDP growth rates.
At the same time, the BCRG plans to increase its international reserves to one month of
imports. To do this, reserve requirements on bank deposits must be strictly enforced, and
liquidity management firmed up by making the liquidity committee more efficient (MEFP,
¶36).
40.
The floating exchange rate will be maintained, with appropriate central bank
interventions. Continued stabilization efforts and improved management are necessary to
restore BCRG capacity to smooth the erratic daily fluctuations that have been observed in
recent months. All BCRG interventions on the foreign exchange market will be fully
transparent and conducted only through commercial banks.
41.
Building an interbank foreign exchange market and enhancing the BCRG
capacity to manage foreign exchange and reserves are essential to achieve program
objectives. The BCRG will bring the management and internal controls on foreign exchange
operations up to international standards (as the safeguards assessment update report
recommends), including establishing oversight mechanisms and implementing segregation of
duties in the area that manages foreign reserves. It will also clarify foreign exchange
regulations and enforce them, especially those related to repatriation of export proceeds; and
will reorganize and modernize the foreign exchange department, beginning with formulation
of procedures for intervention in the interbank foreign exchange market.
42.
Staff discussed with the authorities ways to eliminate the existing multiple
currency practice (MCP). The authorities proposed to establish the official exchange rate as
the interbank market rate once there is one, which would eliminate the MCP. Meanwhile, the
central bank intends to use the official exchange rate only for accounting purposes and to
make all its foreign exchange transactions at the prevailing market rate in commercial banks’

recommended by the external auditor.

23
transactions with their customers on the previous day (MEFP, ¶39). While this measure
would improve transparency in the determination of the exchange rates used by the central
bank, staff determined that this measure would not eliminate the MCP unless the calculation
of the prevailing market rate is based on the same day's rates, which the central bank
considered technically difficult to implement.
Other structural reforms
43.
The government is working to improve Guinea’s business environment by
promoting transparency and good governance, implementing structural reforms in the
utility sector, and improving conditions for investing in the mining sector. Key measures
include:15
•

Implementing the anti-money-laundering law Parliament passed in 2006 and
publishing the activity report of the national agency for the fight against corruption;

•

Submitting a draft anti-corruption law that will mandate that high officials declare
their assets;

•

Lifting the ban on exports of agricultural, forestry, and fishing products (a structural
performance criterion);

•

Reinvigorating the privatization program;

•

Setting benchmarks to improve the performance of the electricity and water
companies (notably for operational performance and technical and commercial
losses) and conducting a tariff study;16 and

•

Finishing the draft of the standard mining contract and exploring ways of aligning
current mining contracts with the standard mining contract.

External sector policies
44.
The program assumes treatment of all external arrears. At present, Guinea is
current with its obligations to all but one multilateral creditors; it has obtained financing
assurances from the European Commission regarding the remaining arrears on a European
Development Fund loan managed by the European Investment Bank. Paris Club creditors

24
have recently provided financing assurances for the forthcoming PRGF-supported program
and signaled their willingness to renegotiate all outstanding payment arrears. The
government has also proposed in writing to private creditors to renegotiate outstanding
payment arrears in the context of the forthcoming program.
45.
The authorities intend to avoid any recourse to nonconcessional loans during the
program.17 The government has signed two loans totaling US$28.5 million on close-toconcessional terms to improve public transportation and reconstruct the electricity grid, and
has also guaranteed a short-term credit line for €25 million for equipment and repairs for the
national electricity company. The government explained that it had to find financing urgently
because the social situation was deteriorating; it has decided to abstain from raising new
short-term or nonconcessional loans with the prospect of a PRGF arrangement nearing.
46.
A new PRGF arrangement with the Fund would support the country in
overcoming protracted balance of payments problems, and could unlock interim HIPC
assistance and pave the way for debt relief. Disbursements would help improve the
precarious foreign reserves situation and support the country’s debt repayment capacity
(including to the Fund) while structural policies are put in place. The PRGF arrangement
would be catalytic, since delivery of interim HIPC assistance from the IMF and other donors
may resume as soon as the new PRGF arrangement is in place. The authorities have
requested the third tranche of interim HIPC assistance in the amount of SDR 4.848 million
corresponding to 20 percent of the total IMF commitment. The interim HIPC assistance will
cover eligible debt service falling due to the IMF over the next 12 months. Taken together,
these would eliminate most of the financing gap of the balance of payments in 2008.
Furthermore, if performance on the new PRGF arrangement is satisfactory, Guinea could
reach the HIPC completion point and benefit from the MDRI as early as the end of 2008.18
B. Program Features, Monitoring, Risks, and Safeguards
47.
The authorities have requested a three-year PRGF arrangement. New
disbursements would be equal to 45 percent of quota, consistent with Guinea’s status as a
fourth-time PRGF user. This access is justified by Guinea’s medium-term balance of payment
needs and the strength of the program, and is consistent with its projected capacity to repay
the Fund (Table 6). Disbursements would be phased in equal semiannual tranches once
reviews are completed (Table 9). The first review would assess performance on the criteria
for end–2007. The program would be monitored by quantitative performance criteria on the
17
18

The minimum degree of concessionality under the program is 35 percent.

According to preliminary assessment, Guinea would need to meet three remaining triggers to achieve the
HIPC completion point. The country would need to successfully implement the PRS-II for at least one year;
have a track record of six months of satisfactory performance under the PRGF; and satisfy the condition on
audits of large procurement contracts, together with the publication of their results.

25
basic primary fiscal balance, net domestic assets and net international reserves of the central
bank, nonconcessional borrowing, short-term external debt, and external arrears.
48.
The proposed prior actions and structural conditionality fall within the Fund’s
areas of expertise and are critical to achieving the economic objectives and mitigating
risks to the program. A large proportion of the structural conditionality is related to the
implementation of the safeguard assessment recommendations. The remainder is related to
actions aimed at regaining control of the budget, and ensuring that the 2008 government
revenue and official reserves targets can be reached.
49.
Adverse external developments, resistance from vested interests against reform,
and the fragile social environment are the main risks to the program. External risks
include further increases in world petroleum prices, a drop in world prices for aluminum and
gold, and regional insecurity. Government changes after the pending parliamentary elections
(yet to be scheduled) and renewed social unrest, particularly in the military, may elevate the
risk of fiscal slippage and slow reform.
50.
Satisfactory completion of a solid set of prior actions,19 a high degree of program
ownership, and broad support for the PRGF from Guinean authorities and civil society
mitigate the short-term risks. The timely implementation of prior actions was an early
indication of commitment to the program. Many structural and financial measures that the
program envisages originated with the authorities, thus attesting to program ownership.
Many high-ranking government officials, including the president and prime minister, and
civil society leaders have declared their support for the program objectives.
51.
The BCRG will continue to implement the recommendations of the recent audits
and the safeguards assessment update. 20 The BCRG is taking steps to improve financial
governance and strengthen internal accounting and control procedures (Box 1), including
reconstructing its accounting records to reflect the findings of the external audit of the 2006
accounts. It will also submit to Parliament by the end of June 2008 a draft law to modify the
BCRG statutes to increase its independence and limit its financing of the budget (a structural
performance criterion). The quantitative performance criteria on net international reserves
and net domestic assets of the central bank would be verified by an independent external
auditor until staff determine that controls are adequate. Similarly, the BCRG would retain
future PRGF disbursements in a separate account at the Bank of International Settlements
(BIS) that would be subject to strict internal approval and independent audit verification.
Guinea would continue to keep enough in its SDR account to cover forthcoming obligations
to the Fund.

C. Technical Assistance and Statistical Issues
52.
A multiyear program of Fund TA to support performance on the program is in
place. Fund TA will help the BCRG in a number of areas, ranging from accounting and
internal controls and audits to monetary policy and foreign exchange market reforms. The
Fund will also provide TA on tax administration, PFM reforms, and statistics. Fund TA is
coordinated with the World Bank and other donors TA in several areas, including central
bank reform, PFM, and mining taxation.
53.
The economic data are adequate for surveillance and program monitoring, but
need substantial improvement. The authorities are moving to make macroeconomic
statistics more robust. Following Fund recommendations, the national accounts data are
being revised, starting from 2003.21 Monetary data have been amended, reflecting revisions
in the BCRG balance sheet that the recent external audits recommended. Fiscal statistics,
notably the tracking of poverty-reducing spending, should improve soon, after a functional
classification for budgetary expenditures is introduced as planned. With Fund TA, the
authorities are also expected to step up efforts to improve balance of payments data.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
54.
After a satisfactory but short-lived policy track record, the authorities lost
control of the economy in 2006 as governance weakened in most areas. Significant
extrabudgetary spending financed directly by the BCRG fed a large monetary expansion. As
a result, the exchange rate plummeted, inflation reached the second-highest level among
African countries, the BCRG lost most of its foreign exchange reserves, and payment arrears
accumulated. The popular protest against these policies that culminated in early 2007 with
strikes and demonstrations opened the way to a reform-minded government.
55.
Over the past eight months the authorities have engineered an impressive policy
shift toward macroeconomic stabilization, transparency, and good governance. The
restoration of tight control on budget execution and the elimination of central bank financing
of the deficit have halted monetary expansion. Together with a return of confidence in the
currency, these policies halved inflation in less than six months. At the same time, the new
authorities have begun to improve governance, notably at the BCRG and in the mining
sector; initiated audits throughout the public sector; and launched an emergency program that
received strong international support.
56.
The new poverty reduction strategy has the appropriate priorities, most notably
governance. As noted in the JSAN, however, successful implementation will require the
design of well-prioritized action plans in critical areas, and close monitoring and evaluation.
21

Revised national accounts data are expected to be discussed with staff and eventually incorporated into the
macro framework during the first program review.

27
57.
Forceful and steady implementation of sound policies can boost Guinea’s growth
potential and contribute significantly to attainment of the authorities’ poverty
reduction goals. Reaching the envisaged growth targets will require (i) consolidation of
macroeconomic stabilization; (ii) improvement of the business environment (starting with
strict enforcement of laws and regulations and rehabilitation of public utilities); (iii) adoption
of best international practices to ensure the promising development of extractive industries
(including a new tax regime, revision of the mining code, a model contract, and continued
implementation of the EITI); and (iv) carefully targeted investment in public infrastructure
and projects to remove capacity constraints.
58.
Restoring Guinea’s external position, a critical short-term priority, will depend
on fiscal and monetary policies remaining tight. The BCRG should build official reserves
so it can absorb external shocks, smooth daily fluctuations of the volatile exchange rate, and
support the launching of the much-needed foreign exchange interbank market. The
government needs to contribute by achieving the targeted reductions in the fiscal deficit.
Active interest-based liquidity management and close coordination with the Treasury will
also be needed to keep monetary expansion within program limits.
59.
Reinforcing management of revenue agencies and restoring normal budget
procedures are essential if Guinea is to reach its ambitious revenue goals and keep
control over public spending. Broadening the tax base (in particular, reducing tax and
customs exemptions) and well-targeted tax audits and revenue collection efforts will not be
possible without expanded capacity. The government must also restrict recourse to
exceptional spending and procurement and enhance the tracking and recording of spending,
including poverty-reducing outlays, and controls on it.
60.
Another challenge will be to address the remaining vulnerabilities in the
BCRG’s safeguards framework, which pose a high risk to the proper safeguarding of
IMF disbursements. The external audits and the safeguard assessment update found a
breakdown in safeguards that reflected both the systemic override of existing controls and
procedures, and weaknesses in basic record-keeping. Overall, a system of strong internal
controls, financial governance, and accountability needs to be urgently re-established and
maintained at the BCRG. In response to these findings, the central bank has taken strong
short-term mitigating measures and adopted an action plan, a first step to a longer -term
solution. However, implementing the action plan will require substantial efforts, such as
making the best possible use of the substantial Fund TA program.
61.
Assuming adherence to policies as planned, the delivery of HIPC and MDRI
debt relief that Guinea is eligible for once its reaches the completion point can bring
external debt back to sustainable levels, possibly before 2009. The authorities should also
persevere with efforts to engage all their external creditors and seek debt relief from
multilateral and non-Paris Club bilateral creditors on HIPC terms. The recent recourse to
nonconcessional financing, although explicable by the strong pressure on the government for

28
immediate improvements in the population’s harsh living conditions, is regrettable and staff
welcome the authorities’ intention to cease such practice in the context of the prospective
program.
62.
Mindful of the prospective debt relief and of the largely untapped sources of
export and productivity growth, the staff considers the current level of the real
exchange rate to be adequate. The significant recent appreciation may simply reflect higher
market expectations of policy reforms, resumption of program assistance, and prospects for
early debt relief. The expected boost from exports of agricultural goods to neighboring
countries (once the ban imposed early this year has been removed) and the imminent launch
of several large FDI-financed mining projects also suggest that the current real exchange rate
can be sustained, provided economic stabilization and structural reforms continue. However,
the exchange rate trend will need to be monitored closely given the rapid structural changes
that are expected in the economy.
63.
The authorities should continue to improve the transparency in the
determination of the exchange rate and eliminate the existing multiple currency
practice. This will help restore confidence in the Guinean franc and create a sound basis for
successful reform of the foreign exchange market.
64.
Balance of payments and national accounts statistics are priority areas for
improvement, though plans to verify and revise BCRG and government accounts are also
expected to yield more reliable fiscal and monetary statistics and ease program monitoring.
65.
Given the firm policies adopted by the new government since April 2007 and its
commitment to home-grown reforms, the staff recommends approval of the authorities’
request for a PRGF arrangement and for additional interim assistance under the
Enhanced HIPC Initiative.
66.
The next Article IV consultation will take place in accordance with the July 15,
2002, decision on consultation cycles.

Contrary to other tables in this staff report, these projections do not assume that Guinea will reach the HIPC completion point at end-2008.
These obligations resulted from disbursements made before 2005 and therefore may be eligible for debt relief once
Guinea reaches the HIPC completion point and benefits from MDRI.

ATTACHMENT I: LETTER OF INTENT
Conakry, December 4, 2007
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
Since taking office on March 28, 2007, the Guinean government has implemented an
economic program designed to reinstate fiscal control, stabilize the economy, improve
governance, and launch a major program of structural reforms. The attached Memorandum
on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) sets out the policies that the Guinean
government intends to implement in the context of a medium-term program (covering the
period from July 2007 to June 2010) to consolidate macroeconomic stabilization, promote
growth, and attain the objectives defined in our second poverty reduction strategy paper. The
MEFP also sets out macroeconomic objectives, structural measures, and tracking indicators
for the first year of the program. A unit made up of senior staff, including from the Ministry
of Finance, the Economy and the Plan and the central bank, has been set up to monitor
implementation of the program.
To assist in the attainment of the above objectives and facilitate implementation of
the relevant policies, the government hereby requests an arrangement under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) in an amount equivalent to SDR 48.195 million
(45 percent of Guinea’s quota). The government also requests resumption of the interim
assistance granted by the IMF under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, specifically, the third
tranche of interim HIPC assistance in the amount of SDR 4.848 million.
The government undertakes to provide the IMF with any information that may be
necessary to monitor implementation of the proposed measures and attainment of the
objectives. The attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) sets out the
performance criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks of the program and
defines the relevant economic variables and the data to be reported to the IMF (see TMU,
Table 1). The first review of Guinea’s progress under this arrangement will be carried out no
later than end–April 2008, and the second no later than end–October 2008.

40
The government is convinced that the policies and measures set out in the attached
MEFP are adequate to achieve the program objectives. However, it stands ready to take any
further measures that may prove necessary. The government will consult with the IMF on the
adoption of these measures prior to any revision of the policies described in the MEFP, in
conformity with the rules of the Fund’s policies on such consultation.
During and after the program period and so long as Guinea has financial obligations
to the IMF for loans disbursed under this arrangement, the government will consult the
Managing Director, on its own initiative or at his request, to discuss Guinea’s economic and
financial policies.
The government consents to the publication of this letter, the MEFP, the TMU, and
the IMF staff report on the request for the conclusion of the arrangement under the PRGF.
Sincerely yours,

/sgd/

reduction strategy (PRS-I) adopted in 2002 did not yield all the expected results. The
incidence of poverty increased from 49 percent in 2002 to 54 percent in 2005. Economic
growth slowed from 4.9 percent on average in the latter half of the 1990s to an average
2.9 percent in 2000–06; inflation accelerated, to reach an annual rate of about 39 percent at
end-2006; and foreign exchange reserves fell to less than one month of imports. These
developments are explained in part by greater insecurity in the region (which required
increased military expenditure) and the terms of trade deterioration that our country
experienced during that period. Lax economic policies and the worsening of governance
problems, which were rapidly sanctioned with the suspension of external assistance and debt
relief (Guinea reached the HIPC Initiative decision point in 2000) were also key factors.
To date, economic stabilization and reform efforts, including implementation of the
April 2005–March 2006 staff-monitored program, have proved insufficient.
2.
Since taking office at end-March 2007, the government has adopted important
measures to stabilize the macroeconomic situation and put the country back on the
road to reform. We have acted quickly and resolutely to restore fiscal discipline, regain
control of monetary policy, and improve transparency and governance. We also decided in
May 2007 to launch a recovery program including a series of priority actions aimed at
economic, political, and social stabilization, to be implemented by end-2007. Currently,
inflationary pressures have abated and confidence in the domestic currency has been
strengthened.
3.
Our second poverty reduction strategy (PRS-II), which covers the period
2007–10, aims at reversing the upward trend of poverty observed since 2002 by
expanding and deepening the priority actions of the recovery program. This strategy is
based on: (i) improving governance and building capacity; (ii) accelerating sustainable
economic growth that benefits all; and (iii) developing basic public services. Growth policies
will be based on sound macroeconomic management and expedited structural reforms aiming
to promote private sector development. To ensure that the macroeconomic and financial
components of the PRS-II are implemented and to facilitate the mobilization of external
resources and the debt relief necessary for its success, we have drawn up a three-year
program for July 2007–June 2010, for which we request IMF support under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The purpose of this memorandum is to describe the
broad outline of that program and the actions that will be taken in the first year.

42
II. ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND REFORMS: RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The new government inherited a difficult economic and social situation. In 2006
the economic indicators continued to erode in the wake of the breakdown of governance,
owing in particular to a lax monetary policy and the lack of fiscal discipline. By year’s end,
inflation accelerated to nearly 39 percent on a year-on-year basis, GDP growth slowed to
2.2 percent, official exchange reserves shrank even further, and external arrears began to
mount again from mid-2006. The overall fiscal deficit widened to approximately 2.9 percent
of GDP and was financed by a very sizable increase in the central bank credit to the
government. As a result, monetary aggregates expanded rapidly and put increased pressure
on prices and the exchange rate, further encouraging the dollarization of deposits and
transactions.
5.
Certain measures adopted in the first quarter of 2007 to restore social peace are
proving costly in both economic and fiscal terms. In January 2007, inflationary slippages
and the level of corruption, which the public increasingly resented, triggered general strikes
and social unrest that brought economic activity and government operations to a halt for
several weeks. A tripartite agreement put an end to the strikes in February 2007, but at the
cost of reductions in taxes (on petroleum products and rice) and wage hikes that further
dampened the fiscal outlook. Moreover, temporary bans on exports of food and forestry
products had to be put in place in an effort to contain their prices, with adverse effects on the
balance of payments and the incomes of agricultural workers, among whom the poverty rate
is especially high.
6.
Beginning from April 2007, the new government took bold steps to stabilize the
macroeconomic environment, restore fiscal discipline, and tighten monetary policy. In
the area of government finance, the amount of central bank advances to the government
leveled off in reaction to the strict application of a monthly cash plan beginning in April;
extrabudgetary expenditure and ad hoc tax exemptions were prohibited; and nonpriority
expenditure was strictly controlled. This fiscal policy and stricter application of the reserve
requirement for bank deposits facilitated the tightening of monetary policy. These measures
have begun to yield positive results. Consequently, the Guinean franc has strengthened since
the beginning of the year and the inflation rate fell back to 17 percent in September 2007.
7.
The government also took resolute steps to enhance the transparency of
government actions and governance, including in the key extractive industries sector.
We decided to review the existing mining contracts, in view of the international best
practices, particularly with regard to the taxation of mining activities. The government
published the results of the audit of fiscal revenues from mining sector for 2005 (cf. site web
www.laurore.info) in the context of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
It decided to continue and even deepen audits pertaining to revenues for 2006 to determine
whether the payments made by the mining companies were strictly in line with their
contractual obligations. In addition, a full assessment of our public finance management

43
(PFM) was completed in 2007 and will serve as a major starting point for the reforms
envisaged in this area. Lastly, management audits of all government agencies are under way.
8.
The BCRG also began correcting the serious deficiencies in governance and
policies uncovered in the external audit of the 2006 financial statements and by the
expert commission appointed by the prime minister. Serious accounting errors are being
corrected and a plan to improve the internal control of the central bank operations was
adopted. Payments on behalf of the central government or other government entities
circumventing the approved budgetary procedures, especially those without the prior
authorization of the Minister of Finance, and the posting of such payments to reconciliation
or suspense accounts were prohibited. As provided by the law, the BCRG’s 2006 financial
statements have been sent for publication to the Journal Officiel on November 30, 2007.
III. MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
9.
To reverse the upward trend of poverty since the start of the decade, we intend
to promote stronger economic growth. Our objective is to lower the incidence of poverty
to 49 percent in 2010 from 54 percent in 2005. To accomplish this, we will need to achieve
average annual real GDP growth of 5.3 percent over the 2008–10 period, compared to
2.6 percent in 2004–06, to enable an average increase of 2.3 percent in per capita income per
year. This growth target will be sustainable only if we restore the stability of prices (inflation
will be lowered to 15 percent by end-2007 and gradually to 5 percent by end-2010) and
strengthen our external position (gross foreign exchange reserves should increase to the
equivalent of 3 months of imports of goods and services by end-2010). We plan to achieve
these targets by implementing strict macroeconomic policies, improving conditions for
private sector development, and carrying out major infrastructure programs to remove the
main obstacles to growth.
10.
The primary fiscal objectives will be to increase government revenue and
reorient expenditure toward the priority sectors defined in our strategy, to the extent
that this is compatible with macroeconomic stability and the reduction of public debt.
The weight of public debt service in public expenditure—the main cause of the fragility of
government finances—should be brought to a sustainable level. This assumes, first, a prudent
debt strategy based on the elimination of external and domestic arrears, the exclusive use of
concessional financing sources to meet external financing needs, the expected substantial
relief from our external debt, and the restructuring of government obligations to the central
bank. We also plan to gradually bring the basic primary fiscal balance to more than 4 percent
of GDP. Accordingly, the government aims to increase tax revenue by at least 2 points of
GDP over the course of three years to 15.5 percent in 2010, primarily by expanding the tax
base and improving the tax collection, including in the mining sector. To achieve this, the
government will continue reducing tax and customs exemptions, particularly through a
thorough revision of the investment code, and will modernize the revenue-collecting units
and enforce controls over them by applying performance contracts.

44
11.
The additional resources mobilized from reduction in debt service and donor
support will be used primarily to increase expenditure in the priority sectors,
particularly those that affect the access of the poor to basic social services (education and
health) and the social safety net protecting vulnerable segments of the population. These
expenditures will gradually increase from 35.5 percent of primary expenditure in 2006 to
42 percent in 2010. A youth employment program will be launched and the development of
public infrastructures will be accelerated.
12.
Monetary policy will focus on the objective of controlling base money growth.
Such a policy will provide the economy with a solid nominal anchor for controlling inflation.
It will be greatly facilitated by the elimination of all financing of the Treasury by the central
bank, so that a sufficient margin will be maintained for the development of bank financing of
the economy. New permanent deposit and refinancing facilities will be introduced and the
central bank’s policy rates will be regularly adjusted to accommodate monetary policy
requirements. Our priorities in the foreign exchange policy will be to maintain the current
floating exchange regime while continuing to restore confidence in our currency. This will
create conditions for gradually replenishing our exchange reserves and improving the market
mechanisms upon which the valuation of our currency is based.
13.
In view of the strong potential of Guinea’s mining sector, the establishment of a
transparent and stable framework to promote investment in this sector will underpin
the primary outlook for sustained medium- and long-term growth. Reform of the mining
code and the adoption of model contracts will be the main components of that framework.
Several major projects financed by foreign direct investment are planned to increase the
capacity to produce bauxite and alumina, as well as develop iron ore deposits. These
investments are expected to be spread over the coming eight years and could total an
estimated US$27 billion, approximately half of which being carried out during the term of
the program. Although the operations of these projects will begin after 2010, their
construction should contribute significantly to growth in the next three years.
14.
The maintenance of an open trade system is an important element of our growth
and export diversification strategy. The government already aligned its tariff with the
WAEMU common external tariff in 2005 and participates actively in other regional trade
integration initiatives. In particular, it supports the rapid creation of a free trade area in the
ECOWAS countries. The government also plans to follow up on the recommendations of the
Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) in order to reduce the obstacles to domestic and
international trade. The DTIS identified agriculture, fisheries, and tourism as export
diversification sectors. The build up of export capacities in agriculture and fishing will create
employment opportunities and income for rural population where poverty is the most
widespread. In this context, we will remove all restrictions on exports of these products and
of forestry products by end-2007. The effort will also involve the development of adequate
infrastructures and warehousing facilities, better service coverage throughout the country,
and promotion of the provision of services to exporters. The government will implement a

45
forestry development strategy both to promote an efficient timber industry and to protect the
environment.
15.
The objectives of our program cannot be achieved without an improvement in
governance and in the quality of government and central bank policies. Initially, this
improvement will involve the clarification and enforcement of existing laws and regulations.
First and foremost, this concerns fiscal management (including all revenue and expenditure
phases) and management of the central bank (including reestablishing accurate accounting
and strict internal control, as well as transparent operating by the foreign exchange market).
With assistance from the IMF and our development partners, reform and modernization plans
will be implemented in the first year of the program in these two areas, together with efforts
to combat corruption and reform the civil service, public enterprises (in particular EDG and
SEG), and the judiciary.
16.
The government will continue to improve the management of the civil service
with a view to controlling the wage bill, establishing ethical rules, and promoting a
performance culture. It will make a special effort to remove ghost workers. A staff
redeployment policy will be implemented to remedy the overstaffing observed in certain
departments and to meet the needs of priority sectors. In the context of modernizing human
resources management, instruments for forward-looking management of skills and of
positions (organic frameworks) will be developed and more sustained efforts will be made to
provide staff training. A motivating compensation system will be developed and put in place
to promote a merit and performance-based culture.
17.
The government aims to restore the viability of public enterprises that are in
difficulty, particularly in the electricity sector and, to a lesser extent, in the water and
telecommunications sectors. This will first require rehabilitation of the existing
infrastructures and improvement of the quality of service, while at the same time eliminating
the implicit and explicit government subsidies they have been granted. Based on the audits
currently under way, performance contracts will be adopted or updated for these three
enterprises. These contracts will call for the restoration of financial equilibrium, including
through anti-fraud efforts and the adjustment of tariff rates.
18.
The resumption of our privatization program will allow for increased private
sector participation in economic and social development. The public sector remains
heavily involved in the economy. The government holds stakes in 45 public enterprises. Over
the 2007–10 period, it is expected that government holdings in about 25 enterprises will be
privatized. Finally, the government holds a major share of improved and unimproved real
estate property in the country, which is a major impediment to the access of businesses and
private individuals to land. The management of the improved real estate property will be
centralized and placed under the direct authority of the ministry in charge of government
holdings. An inventory will be taken and lease rates will be revised upwards to reflect market
value. In addition, the program to sell off such property will be reactivated with complete

46
transparency, and all revenue from the sale of government assets will be deposited in the
Treasury account, as required by law.
19.
Aware of the crucial role of a properly functioning judiciary in implementing the
poverty reduction strategy and promoting the private sector in the economy, the
Government will deepen reforms already under way with the assistance of its
development partners. In particular, this will involve effective application of the uniform
acts of the OHADA treaty, notably the act concerning banking law. Moreover, cases of
misappropriation of funds uncovered in the aforementioned audits will be submitted to the
courts.
20.
The stability and development of financial intermediation are key to the success
of the program. At present, the payment system is outdated; the access of enterprises to
credit is more or less limited to the financing of imports of petroleum products and rice; there
are no medium-term loans, particularly for SMEs; and microcredit is available only to a
small proportion of the population and is disconnected from the banking system. In addition
to reorganizing the central bank, we plan as quickly as possible to draw up a plan to reform
the financial sector. Accordingly, we have submitted a request for participation in the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) managed by the World Bank and the IMF.
IV. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROGRAM FOR THE PERIOD JULY 2007–JUNE 2008
21.
The priorities for the first year of the program will be to implement the
emergency program and to prepare and begin carrying out action plans in the priority
areas outlined above. First, this will involve building on the progress made in stabilizing the
economy and strengthening the authority of the central government in all domains. We will
return promptly to best practices in the matter of governance, based on the enforcement of
laws, regulations, and court decisions and, if need be, the strengthening of existing laws and
regulations. We will also undertake specific programs—financed in large part by
development partners—to restore minimum access to water and electricity and to rehabilitate
public equipment and infrastructure destroyed in the social unrest that occurred in early 2007.
22.
We foresee the resumption of growth (in early 2008), in tandem with our
continuing macroeconomic stabilization efforts. In the second half of 2007, the pace of
growth will remain relatively slow owing to the gradual fiscal adjustment and restrictions on
exports of certain products. In 2008, growth will likely get a new impulse from the recovery
of private investment, particularly in the mining sector, as a result of the expected
improvement in the business climate and the restoration of the macroeconomic stability. Our
program therefore projects growth of close to 5 percent in 2008. The inflation rate, which we
aim to lower to 15 percent by end-2007, should continue to fall and amount to no more than
10 percent by end-2008. Finally, the foreign exchange reserves of the BCRG will gradually
increase to 1.0 months of import coverage by end-2008. The fiscal, monetary, and foreign
exchange policies applied in the first year of the program, as well as the structural and
governance reforms, are described in the following.

47
A. Fiscal Policy
23.
Strict observance of the 2007 budget law, approved by the National Assembly in
July 2007, is key to fiscal consolidation. The budget provides for a reduction in the overall
deficit (excluding grants, on commitments basis) from 4.3 percent of GDP in 2006 to
1.7 percent of GDP in 2007, a fiscal adjustment that is in line with our macroeconomic
stabilization objective. The basic primary balance surplus (excluding grants, interest on debt,
and externally financed expenditure) will be 3.0 percent of GDP, with total revenue
equivalent to 12.9 percent of GDP and current primary expenditure equivalent to 8.7 percent
of GDP.
24.
The budget is based on revenue-enhancing measures, particularly in the
nonmining sector. Fiscal controls have been strengthened, especially for enterprises that
have declared successive losses over the course of several years. Application of the unique
identification number of the taxpayer has been systematized, particularly at the customs. The
tax and customs exemptions granted under the investment code and other agreements will be
no longer extended without prior approval of the Finance Minister and verification of their
conformity to the existing legislation. All nonconforming exemptions will be eliminated by
end-June 2008 at the latest.
25.
Budget expenditure in 2007 reflects government priorities. Spending in the
priority sectors is projected to increase from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2006 to 3.7 percent of
GDP. The budget also calls for more realistic appropriations for sovereignty expenditures
and for water and electricity consumption, as well as expenditure covering part of the cost of
the legislative elections to be held in 2008 (GNF 73 billion, of which GNF 58 billion from
foreign sources).
26.
The 2007 budget does not envisage further reliance on central bank advances, in
line with the authorities’ intention to prohibit such financing in the charter of the
central bank. Advances and all claims of the central bank on the government as at June 30,
2007 were consolidated and securitized in August 2007. The securitization agreement
provides for reimbursement over a maximum term of 20 years for securities unrelated to
foreign exchange losses. The budget envisages moderate reliance on net issuance of treasury
bills to banks to facilitate the repayment of previously rescheduled domestic debt as well as
the repayment of domestic arrears. Similarly, the budget calls for the clearance of all external
arrears.
27.
Execution of the 2007 budget will broadly conform to the original budget law. To
deal with rising international prices and fulfill the preceding government’s commitments to
social partners, the government has established a time-limited program of price subsidies for
several staple goods, including rice and sugar, amounting to approximately GNF 20 billion,
financed by reallocation of other subsidies and government transfers. Moreover, the
government plans to undertake the equivalent of GNF 83.3 billion in additional expenditure
by end-2007 under the emergency program decided last May, to be financed entirely with

48
external assistance. The budget execution will continue to be subject to strict monthly
monitoring in the context of treasury committee meetings under the aegis of the prime
minister. As the 2007 budget law reaffirms, new spending commitments will not be made
after November 30, 2007 to avoid the issuance of payment orders after the end of the
calendar year. The government will keep the stock of pending treasury payments, including
pending repayments of VAT credits and domestic debt payment arrears, below a ceiling of
approximately two months of basic nonwage primary expenditure.
28.
The 2008 budget that we submitted to the National Assembly on October 11,
2007 will extend the adjustment efforts begun in 2007, with the basic primary balance
kept above 3.3 percent of GDP. The projected growth of revenue will facilitate the
reorientation of expenditure toward the priority sectors and will make any recourse to central
bank financing unnecessary, all this to avoid compromising our macroeconomic stabilization
objective.
•

On the revenue side, we project a slight increase in mining receipts (from
3.4 percent of GDP in 2007 to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2008) as a result of the delayed
effect on revenue of the increase in international prices of bauxite and alumina. As a
precautionary measure, we do not foresee any effect in 2008 from the proposed
revision of certain mining agreements. Conversely, all the measures we will take to
boost the productivity of revenue collection agencies and expand the tax base should
result in an increase in nonmining revenue of the order of 1.1 points of GDP.

•

On the expenditure side, the budget calls for a significant increase in capital
expenditure and, with regard to current expenditure, a decrease in subsidies and
military expenditure in favor of the priority sectors—education first and foremost. A
large part of the increase in the wage bill will be aimed at overhauling the system of
bonuses and incentives, particularly for managerial level staff to narrow the sizable
gap vis-à-vis the private sector. We will also honor all commitments made by the
government in 2007 regarding the hiring of contractuals in the civil service and
improving the situation of teachers.
B. Tax Administration and Fiscal Management

29.
The government plans to expedite the modernization of the tax and customs
administrations based on the recommendations of IMF technical assistance missions. A
list of performance indicators will be drawn up by end-December 2007 with each of the
revenue collection agencies; quarterly targets will be set and the necessary resources will be
made available. Financial incentives for staff will be increased. In addition, effective
cooperation between the two administrations will be established and the computerization of
the various tax offices will be accelerated. Regarding nontax revenue, the government will
review all the existing revenue appropriations granted to public enterprises and will return to
the Treasury any appropriations that are not justified. Box 1 contains detailed information on
the planned key measures.

49
Box 1. Guinea―Key Tax Revenue Measures for 2007–08
•

Adoption of performance contracts between revenue collection agencies and the Ministry of Finance for
2008, based on performance indicators pertaining to fiscal control and tax collection for the National Tax
Administration (NTA) and reduction of exemptions and efficiency of revenue collection for the National
Customs Administration (NCA) (December 2007).

•

Strengthening of revenue collection procedures, including through the effective use of notices to third
parties for uncooperative taxpayers.

•

Review of the conformity of tax conventions with the existing legislation and enforcement of its application
(cancellation when enterprises do not honor their commitments) (June 2008).

•

Amendment of the Customs Code to incorporate international best practices and reflect the adoption of the
new customs tariff based on the WAEMU common external tariff (Article 24); adoption of implementing
regulations, particularly those related to exemptions from conventions and exceptional regimes (June 2008).

•

Application of international standards to customs clearance procedures under the transit regime and
enhanced inspection of goods under that regime and the suspension regime (December 2007).

•

Elimination of reference values for rice, wheat, sugar, and cigarettes (with modification of excise taxes and
of the tariff classification to adjust the overall levy accordingly) and use of the transaction value in the
clearing of goods, in accordance with Article VII of the WTO agreement on customs valuation (2008
Budget Law).

•

Establishment of direct computer access for the NTA to individual customs records (June 2008).

•

Adoption of the decree establishing the powers of the NTA’s department for medium-size enterprises
(December 2007).

•

Monitoring by the NTA of the results of programmed management audits of the accounts of mining
enterprises over the 2000–06 period.

30.
The government wants to make a decisive break with past practices and apply
basic international standards to public finance management (PFM). To accomplish this,
a reform strategy and a 2008–10 priority action plan for the improvement of PFM will be
finalized by December 2007. This plan will be prepared and monitored by a steering
committee and a support unit within the framework of an international partnership. It will
cover the entire expenditure procedure from budget preparation to submission of the budget
review law to the National Assembly, as well as execution, audit and supervision procedures,
and data reporting.
31.
Measures in the PFM area will be adopted without delay, specifically to enhance
budget preparation and execution and the activities of the audit teams. To ensure the
incorporation of PRS-II objectives in the budget, the Budget Directorate will draw up
medium-term expenditure frameworks beginning with the preparation of the 2009 budget.
The introduction of a functional budget classification will allow for better identification and
better tracking of poverty reduction expenditure. The regular procedure for executing public
expenditure, which now covers only a small fraction of expenditure, will be rehabilitated and
the use of exceptional procedures will be limited; in particular, the simplified procedure
applicable to procurement contracts will be eliminated. In addition, the ongoing
decentralization of expenditure payment authorization to the sectoral ministry level will be

50
completed in 2007. The transparency of government accounting and of the Treasury balance
will be enhanced. The responsibilities of the audit teams and, in particular, of the financial
supervision unit, the General Finance Inspectorate (IGF), and the General Government
Inspectorate (IGE) will be clearly defined and delineated and their performance more closely
monitored. In the 2008 budget we have given the IGF and the IGE the resources they will
need to improve their performance. We will also ensure that the findings and
recommendations of their reports are followed up and we will publish their annual activity
report. The specific measures to be implemented in 2007–08 are summarized in Box 2.
Box 2. Guinea―Key Public Finance Management Measures for 2007–08
Budget preparation
•

Revise the budget classification to conform it to the classification recommended in the IMF Government Finance
Statistics Manual and identify poverty expenditure on that basis (March 2008).

•

Prepare an overall medium-term budgetary framework and expenditure frameworks for the health and education
sectors, linking budget appropriations to sectoral programs and objectives in time for preparation of the 2009 budget
(March 2008). The preparation of expenditure frameworks for other priority sectors will be spread out over the
2009–10 period.

Budget execution
•

Prohibit all extrabudgetary expenditure.

•

Issue a decree stating which expenditures are eligible for simplified procedures, including those without prior
commitments (December 2007).

•

Place in service a secure computer link between the Treasury and the BCRG to increase transparency and the ensure
prompt processing of financial transactions (end-January 2008).

•

Complete the decentralization of the administrative expenditure phase of the budgetary process (end-December
2007).

•

Resume consolidated cash management by returning to the Treasury the accounts of government entities and public
institutions currently held in commercial banks and at the central bank, including project accounts recording
counterpart entries of the national development budget (June 2008).

•

Prohibit overdrafts in all Treasury accounts, except those controlled by senior government accountants (on a
continuous basis).

Accounting, budget audit, and financial information pertaining to the budget
•

Complete the government chart of accounts update (June 2008).

•

Standardize the Treasury balance accounts (June 2008).

•

Each month, verify the balances of the accounts of revenue collection agencies at the central bank (on a continuous
basis).

•

Within a period of one month, carry out a monthly reconciliation of the balances of government accounts at the
BCRG with the Treasury balance (on a continuous basis).

Legal framework

•

Adapt the fundamental law concerning budget laws and the general regulation on government accounting to the
reforms under way (June 2008).

32.
We will also continue reforming the public procurement system with World
Bank support. The aim of the reform is to rationalize the legal framework, entrust
management to decentralized and deconcentrated levels so that the units currently involved
retain authority only to ensure the regularity of procurement and the effectiveness of contract

51
performance. A revised public procurement code will be submitted to the National Assembly
by end-June 2008. To enhance transparency, we plan to publish the results of all invitations
to bid on procurement contracts within 30 days of the end of each month starting from
January 2008, and a quarterly audit report on the largest public procurement contracts
according to a sampling method agreed with the World Bank (within a period of three
months, beginning with the first quarter of 2008). We hope thereby to meet one pending
trigger for the HIPC completion point.
33.
We will also adopt measures to strengthen the domestic debt management
systems. The primary measures in this area will relate to: (i) strengthening the monitoring of
domestic public debt and arrears; (ii) audits of domestic claims on the government which are
in dispute, if necessary with the assistance of qualified audit firms; and (iii) update of the
2005 audit of domestic arrears and implementation of a plan to clear such arrears.
34.
The government intends to realize major savings through stricter management
of its personnel and thus free up resources to hire staff in the priority sectors. The
following measures will be taken to that effect:
•

Regularization of personnel records by reconciling the civil service record with that
of the payroll department (March 2008).
•

Removal of ghost workers by periodically reconciling the list of actual active staff,
certified by each ministry, with the staff on the records of the payroll department
(December 2008).
C. Monetary and Foreign Exchange Policy

Monetary policy
35.
The disinflation objective will be pursued through firm control of base money
growth by the central bank. In 2007, our goal will be to keep the money supply expansion
well below the nominal GDP growth, to harness inflation pressures and offset the excessive
liquidity that built up in 2006. In 2008, the goal will be to roughly align the growth of the
money supply with nominal GDP growth. Achieving these targets will be facilitated by our
decision to eliminate definitively any new advances from the BCRG to the government.
Considering our goal of gradually rebuilding the central bank’s net foreign assets, the
program projections allow for a sufficient margin of increase (around 36.1 percent in 2007)
for net credit to the private sector.
36.
To achieve our monetary policy objectives, we plan to energize our liquidity
management and strengthen the existing indirect monetary policy instruments and
coordination between the central bank and the Treasury. The BCRG will make a special
effort to manage bank liquidity, primarily by issuing central bank bills and (depending on the
needs of the Treasury) Treasury bills. Accordingly, it will reactivate the bank liquidity

52
monitoring committee and will keep its policy rates at levels compatible with its monetary
objectives. The BCRG will also ensure that commercial banks continue to scrupulously
observe the required reserve ratio (currently 9.5 percent) and will apply the regular sanctions
for noncompliance, if necessary. It will consult IMF staff should adjustments of that ratio or
of policy interest rates prove necessary.
37.
With IMF assistance, the BCRG will complete its indirect monetary control
mechanism. Two permanent deposit and refinancing facilities will be put in place to provide
flexibility in determining the interest rates of Treasury bill and TRM auctions. The caps on
commercial bank lending and deposit rates will be eliminated by end-December 2007.
Exchange policy
38.
The authorities want to base the determination of the exchange rate to market
mechanisms, while at the same time minimizing exchange rate volatility. Until April
2007, loosened monetary policy and central bank purchases of foreign exchange outside the
banking sector contributed to the depreciation of our currency and to a rising premium on the
parallel market. Early in the year, the local currency appreciated considerably as a result of a
temporary shortage of banknotes, the expectation of economic reforms created by the
political handover, and, in the second quarter, the drastic reduction of the central bank’s
foreign exchange purchases. Today, the central bank is seeking to gradually rebuild exchange
reserves through transparent interventions on the official market.
39.
The central bank will address the operational problems of the official foreign
exchange market and make a special effort to reduce the sizable exchange rate
premium between the official and parallel market rates. First, it will publish the details of
the official exchange rate calculation and its application. The central bank transactions
(including with the government) will be made within the limit of 1 percent around the daily
average exchange rate applied by the commercial banks. Moreover, it will launch an
interbank exchange market. An exchange market agreement (convention de place) was
signed in September 2007 by all banks to establish the basis for conducting foreign exchange
operations among them. A framework for the efficient and transparent conduct of central
bank exchange operations on that market will be put in place shortly with IMF support. The
reduction of the parallel market premium and stricter enforcement of the exchange
regulation, particularly with regard to capital transactions, should make it possible to halt the
trend toward the dollarization of our economy, to domicile a larger proportion of export
earnings in banks and thus develop the interbank market. As soon as possible, the
determination of the official exchange rate will be based on that market’s transactions.
Bank supervision
40.
The central bank will increase its surveillance missions to banks and insurance
companies. It will step up off-site audits and on-site inspections of banks. The new bank
chart of accounts will take effect on January 1, 2009. An action plan to rehabilitate the

53
insurance sector and reform the insurance code will be prepared by end-June 2008. Daily
tracking of the exchange position of banks will be instituted.
41.
The development of microfinance will be encouraged. With AFRITAC technical
assistance, the central bank will conduct a new survey of the locations of microfinance
institutions throughout the entire national territory. It will also upgrade its financial data
reporting system, strengthen the service capabilities of the bank supervision directorate, and
will draft implementing regulations for the new law on microfinance.
D. Reform of the Central Bank Governance
42.
Building on the work of the panel of experts appointed by the prime minister
and with IMF assistance, the government has undertaken a complete reform of the
central bank.1 This reform will focus in particular on the central bank’s charter, its
administrative organization, its accounting and internal and external control procedures, and
the transparency of the information it produces. To that end, a package of measures will be
taken during the first year of the program:

1

•

Application of international standards to the oversight management and accounting
of the foreign exchange reserves, and reorganization of the central bank’s Foreign
Exchange Directorate (January 2008).

•

Implementation of the recommendations of the external audit of BCRG financial
statements at end-2006 to correct accounting errors and reform internal control
procedures (end-2007).

•

Establishment of a reliable internal audit system under the supervision of the Board
of directors of the central bank, through the adoption of an internal audit charter and
the effective organization of the audit committee (October 2007).

•

Submission to parliament of a draft law amending the charter of the central bank in
order to clarify its responsibilities, guarantee its independence, ensure the
transparency of its operations, and prohibit any financing of the government
(June 2008).

•

Finalization of the audit of the 2007 financial statements and publication on the
Internet of the financial statements and audit reports for 2006 and 2007 (August
2008).

•

Establish an external audit policy that provides for ongoing annual audits of the
BCRG’s financial statements in accordance with International Standards on

This reform will focus in particular on implementing the recommendations of a the recent IMF safeguards
assessment mission.

54
Auditing. Prepare an action plan for implementing International Financial Reporting
Standards as the BCRG’s financial reporting framework (June 2008).
E. Other Structural Reforms
43.
The focus will be on the electricity and water sectors, telecommunications, the mining
sector, the privatization of public enterprises, the promotion of good governance, and
combating corruption.
44.
With the support of our development partners, from 2008 we expect to enhance
the financial situation in the EDG and SEG, while improving their management and
services provided. By end-2007, the two enterprises will agree with their supervisory
ministry and the finance ministry on quantitative targets for 2008 regarding operational
deficit and reduction of technical, commercial, and payment collection losses. Efforts will be
stepped up to eliminate the fraudulent use of water and electricity. Sufficient appropriations
were programmed into the central government budget to pay for water and electricity
consumption and instructions will be given for the timely payment of invoices. The situation
of cross arrears with the government at end-June 2007 will be updated and a settlement plan
will be adopted in 2008. If necessary tariff rate adjustments will be made on an urgent basis
in early 2008 so that the enterprises can reach their financial objectives. In addition, the
ongoing study of the overall policy on electricity and water rates will be completed by endJune 2008 with a view to rationalizing the rate structure by end-2008.
45.
The legal framework governing the operation and output of the mining sector
will be revised. Model contacts based on international best practices will be finalized with
World Bank assistance by end-April 2008. They will clearly delineate the exceptions
provided for in the 1995 Mining Code for projects exceeding US$50 million. The
government will undertake to revise the existing contracts to harmonize and align them with
international standards, based on these model contracts. The taxation of the mining sector
will be reviewed and amended in consultation with the IMF and the World Bank.
46.
The government envisages to finalize several privatization deals during the first
year of the program. The government plans to prepare for sale some or all of its holdings in
at least four companies: GHI (Novotel), Union Guinéenne d’Assurance et de Réassurance
(UGAR), Société Mixte de Carburant Aéronautique de Guinée (SOMCAG), and Société de
Production Chimique (SOPROCHIM). The government also plans to sell Hôtel Niger, Hôtel
Camayen, and the real estates including Hôtel Kaloum. The sale of some of the government’s
shares in Banque Populaire Maroco-Guinéenne (BPMG) and in Société des Ciments de
Guinée is also planned for 2008. In addition, the Société de Production d’Allumette de
Guinée (SOPAG) will be liquidated by end-December 2007.
47.
Through end-June 2008, the government will gradually reinstate the
formula-based mechanism for monthly adjustments of petroleum products prices in
line with international prices. This mechanism will contribute to ensuring continuous

55
supply and to regularizing the tax regime applicable to petroleum products. The
government’s outstanding debt vis-à-vis distribution companies at end-2006 will be
reconciled as soon as possible, and settled as agreed in principle by both parties. If needed, a
margin to settle losses incurred by distribution companies in 2007 will be introduced in the
formula.
48.
The following measures will be adopted to improve transparency and
governance and combat corruption:
•

Publication of audited reports in the context of EITI for 2006 (by end-June 2008).

•

To promote ethical rules, adoption of a civil service code of professional conduct
and specific charters for tax staff (June 2008).

•

Submission to Parliament of an anti-corruption law, specifically providing for the
mandatory declaration of assets for certain categories of senior officials (June 2008).

•

Promulgation of decrees on the powers and operation of the Audit Office and the
status of its judges; this institution will also be provided with necessary resources,
and its financial autonomy will be confirmed (during 2008).

•

Completion of ongoing audits in all ministerial departments and publication of the
summary report, including the list of cases submitted to the courts (early 2008).

•

Promulgation of U.N. and African Union anti-corruption agreements (during 2008).

•

Promulgation of the anti-money laundering law passed by the National Assembly in
2006 and establishment of the financial intelligence unit provided for in that law
(during 2008).

•

Publication of the activity report of the national anti-corruption agency (March
2008).
F. External Financing

49.
The government will take all necessary steps to meet its obligations to external
creditors in accordance with the established timetable and address all outstanding
arrears. Regarding debt service to the IMF, the BCRG will continue the quarterly
prepayments to its SDR account to cover all payments falling due in the following quarter.
50.
The government will ask all its external creditors to approve generous debt relief
measures, which will enable it to finance its program. We have asked Paris Club creditors
to reinstate the debt service relief and negotiate the settlement of external arrears (including
arrears on post cut-off debt) in the context of the prospective PRGF-supported program. We
have also applied to other bilateral creditors for debt relief on at least comparable terms. The

56
government is also asking for resumption of the interim assistance granted by the IMF under
the enhanced HIPC Initiative. The authorities request the third tranche of interim HIPC
assistance in the amount of SDR 4.848 million.
51.
To cover the financing requirements of the program without running the risk of
once more compromising the sustainability of our external debt, the government will
only contract assistance in the form of concessional loans and grants beginning in the
final quarter of 2007. The nonconcessional assistance that Guinea was forced to obtain in
recent months to finance crucial imports will not be renewed. If our assumptions concerning
rescheduling/relief of the above-mentioned debt are correct, the first year of the program,
covering the period up to end-June 2008, will be fully financed. We expect that the financing
gaps in the last two years of the program will be financed by additional assistance from
donors, once this program is approved, and by additional external debt relief when we have
achieved the HIPC Initiative completion point.
G. Improvement of Economic Statistics
52.
Better statistics are needed to monitor the program, particularly with regard to
the national accounts, the balance of payments, and monetary statistics. With support
from the IMF and AFRITAC, revised national accounts with a new price base will be
published up to 2005 by end-2008. In accordance with the new PRS-II, the government will
adopt an overall plan to make significant improvements in the quality of macroeconomic
statistics and develop appropriate poverty indicators. We plan to ask donors to provide
financing for this plan.
H. Risks
53.
Attainment of the program objectives may be affected by the vulnerability of the
Guinean economy to exogenous shocks, such as terms of trade fluctuation or the
resumption of armed conflicts in neighboring countries. The government believes that
implementation of the present program will enhance its capacity to (i) respond appropriately
to such shocks, by strengthening monetary and fiscal safeguards and the country’s external
position, and (ii) mobilize additional external resources. Moreover, as indicated in the PRS-II
(section on risks), the government will endeavor to strengthen consensus among political and
social players concerning its poverty reduction strategy and the objectives of this program, to
ensure its complete success, regardless of the outcome of the coming elections.
I. Program Monitoring
54.
The government plans to complete the actions indicated in the attached Table 1
prior to consideration, by the IMF Executive Board, of Guinea’s request to conclude a
three-year arrangement under the PRGF. To date, all the prior actions except one have
been completed.

57
55.
Program implementation during the first year of the PRGF arrangement will be
monitored with the quantitative and structural indicators listed, respectively, in the
attached Tables 2 and 3. The definitions of the relevant variables are contained in the
Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU, Attachment II). Program implementation
and actual economic results compared with programmed objectives will be discussed in two
annual reviews, the first to be concluded by end-April 2008 (in accordance with the
performance criteria established for December 31, 2007) and the second by end-October
2008 (in accordance with the performance criteria established for June 30, 2008). A unit that
includes senior staff of the Ministry of Finance, Economy and Planning and the central bank
has been set up to monitor program implementation.
56.
It is understood that the first disbursement under the PRGF arrangement will
be available, upon the request of the Guinean government, immediately following
approval of the arrangement by the Executive Board. The second disbursement will be
subject to fulfillment of the performance criteria established on December 31, 2007 and
conclusion of the first review. The third disbursement will be contingent on meeting the
performance criteria established on June 30, 2008 and conclusion of the second review.
Additional performance criteria and structural benchmarks may be established in consultation
with Fund staff during the first review. The timing, reviews, and other conditions governing
disbursements for the second year will be determined in the second review of the
arrangement.
57.
In the first year of implementation of the PRGF-supported program, the
Guinean government will refrain from:
a.

imposing new exchange restrictions or tightening existing restrictions;

b.

introducing multiple currency practices (MCPs) and modifying existing MCPs;

c.

imposing or tightening import restrictions for balance of payments reasons;

d.

concluding bilateral payment arrangements contrary to the Article VIII of the IMF
Articles of Agreement.

ATTACHMENT III. TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (TMU)
December 4, 2007
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This technical memorandum sets out the understanding between the Guinean
authorities and the staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concerning the definition
of quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for the program supported by the
PRGF arrangement, as well as the type of data to be reported to the IMF.
2.
The quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and cut-off dates are set out
in Table 2 of the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP).
II. MAIN DEFINITIONS
A. Quantitative Performance Criteria
3.
The basic primary fiscal balance is calculated as the difference between
government revenue excluding grants and the government’s basic primary expenditure.
The definitions of terms in bold above are consistent with the definitions of the Government
Financial Operations Table (TOFE), the method of calculation of which is described in
Section V below.
4.
The net domestic assets (NDA) of the BCRG are, by definition, equal to the
difference between base money (defined below) and net foreign assets (NFA) of the BCRG,
both calculated at the program exchange rate as indicated below. NFA are equal to the
difference between the gross foreign assets of the BCRG, including foreign assets that are not
part of reserve assets, and the foreign liabilities of the BCRG (in other words, NDA=base
money – NFA, based on the BCRG balance sheet).
5.
The net international reserves (NIR) of the BCRG are, by definition, equal to the
difference between the reserve assets of the BCRG (i.e., external assets immediately
available to and controlled by the BCRG, in accordance with the fifth edition of the IMF
Balance of Payments Statistics Manual), and the foreign exchange liabilities of the BCRG
vis-à-vis residents and nonresidents (including the foreign exchange deposits of local banks
with the BCRG). In the context of the program, the BCRG’s reserve assets in gold will be
valued at the price in effect on June 29, 2007 (US$650.50 per ounce) for the second half of
2007 and at the price on December 31, 2007 for 2008. On the dates of valuation, the
equivalent in U.S. dollars of other reserve assets and liabilities in foreign exchange will be
calculated at the program exchange rate, i.e.: for the second half of 2007 at the exchange rate
in effect on June 29, 2007 between the U.S. dollar and the Guinean franc (GF 3,360/US$),
the SDR (US$1.51557/SDR), the euro (US$1.3505/€ ), and the other currencies published in

63
International Financial Statistics; and for 2008, at the exchange rate in effect on
December 31, 2007.
6.
Medium- and long-term external debt contracted or guaranteed by the
government or the central bank is defined as the amount of external debt (see Section C
below) contracted by the government or the central bank with a maturity of one year or more
during the period under review. Debt is considered concessional if it has a grant element
equivalent to 35 percent or more using the currency-specific commercial interest reference
rate (CIRR) on the currency of the loan and following the methodology set out in staff
papers.1 This definition does not apply to financing granted by the IMF.
7.
Short-term external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government or the
central bank is defined as the stock at a specific date of external debt owed or guaranteed
by the government or the central bank with an initial contractual maturity of less than one
year. Regular suppliers’ credits linked to imports are excluded from this definition for the
purposes of the program, as are deposits in foreign currencies at the central bank.
8.
External arrears of the government or the BCRG include all debt-service
obligations (principal and interest) arising from loans contracted or guaranteed by the
government or the BCRG that are due but not paid on the due date, and unpaid penalties or
interest charges associated with these loans. For the purposes of this performance criterion,
an arrear will be defined as a payment which has not been made within 30 days after falling
due.
9.
Extrabudgetary expenditure is defined as central government spending for which
there is no budget appropriation or legal authorization.
B. Indicative Targets
10.
Payments pending are outstanding expenditures assumed by the Treasury
(see definition below) and not yet paid, including reimbursements of VAT credits, and
arrears on domestic debt that are recognized by the government.
11.
Expenditure in priority sectors includes spending under Title 2 (wages and
salaries), Title 3 (goods and services), Title 4 (transfers and subsidies), and Title 5
(domestically financed investment) by the Ministries of (i) Justice and Human Rights,
(ii) Agriculture, Livestock, Environment, Water Resources, and Forests, (iii) Fisheries and
Aquaculture, (iv) Public Works, Urban Planning, and Housing, (v) Public Health, (vi) Social
Affairs, Status of Women and Children, (vii) Education and Scientific Research, and

1

A more detailed discussion of the concessionality concept and a calculator to estimate the grant element of a
financing package is available at the IMF website at http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/conc/index.htm.

64
(viii) Energy and Hydraulics. This expenditure also includes spending under Title 6
(Financial Investment and Capital Transfers) by the Ministry of Public Health as well as
utility charges for water, electricity, and telephone (Title 3 of the ministries listed above).
However, they exclude spending under Title 4 and Title 6 in connection with university
instruction.
12.
Base money includes deposits of local banks and the private sector with the BCRG
(including bank’s required reserves) denominated in Guinean francs or in foreign currency,
central bank money in circulation in Guinean francs, and the cash holdings of local banks in
Guinean francs. Amounts in foreign exchange are converted into Guinean francs at the
program exchange rates (as defined in the paragraph on net international reserves).
C. External Debt
13.
As indicated in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to
Foreign Debt adopted by the IMF Executive Board on August 24, 2000, for purposes of the
program, “debt” will be understood to mean current, i.e., not contingent, liabilities, created
under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services; these payments will
discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. External debt
can take a number of forms, the primary ones being the following:
•

loans: advances of money to the obligor by the lender on the basis of an undertaking
that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ or suppliers’ credits) and temporary
exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the
obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the
collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements, official swap
arrangements, or leases);

•

suppliers’ credits: contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered or services
are provided; and

•

leases: arrangements under which property is provided that the lessee has the right
to use for one or more specified periods of time, which are usually shorter than the
total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the
property. For the purpose of this memorandum, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period
of the agreement, excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or
maintenance of the property.

65
14.
Under this definition of debt, the arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages
arising from failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are
also considered debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt
under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.
III. ADJUSTMENTS TO PROGRAM TARGETS
15.
The NIR and NDA targets of the program are calculated on the basis of the projected
amounts of net external assistance. For the purposes of the program, net external assistance
is defined as the difference between: (a) total budgetary assistance (grants and loans) and the
impact of debt relief granted by external creditors after June 30, 2007; and (b) total external
debt service payments owed after relief already obtained. The impact of future debt relief
excludes all debt relief under the HIPC (including interim assistance) and MDRI Initiatives.
16.
The floor on NIR and the ceiling on NDA will be subject to simultaneous adjustment
if disbursements of net external assistance (as defined above) differ from program
projections. The floor on NIR will be adjusted upward (downward) and the ceiling on NDA
downward (upward) and by an amount equal to the surplus (shortfall) in actual net external
assistance compared to expected net external assistance. For the purpose of calculating the
adjustment for NDA, the amount of net external assistance will be converted into Guinean
francs at the program exchange rate. For a shortfall in net external assistance, the total
downward adjustment of NDA will be capped at the equivalent of US$20 million at the
program exchange rate.
IV. INFORMATION FOR PROGRAM MONITORING
17.
The information concerning the implementation and/or execution of structural
benchmarks under the program (specified in Table 3 of the MEFP) will be reported to the
IMF African Department within two weeks following their scheduled implementation date.
The status of implementation of all other structural measures pertaining to the program will
be transmitted within 30 days after the end of each month.
18.
The authorities will send the data summarized in Table 1 to the IMF’s African
Department within the time limits set out in that table. Barring any indication to the contrary,
the data will take the form mutually agreed by the authorities and the IMF. The authorities
will supply the Fund with any additional information that its staff requests in connection with
monitoring performance under the program.

66
V. DEFINITIONS FOR THE TOFE
19.
Unless otherwise indicated, the government is defined as the central administration
of the Republic of Guinea and does not include local administrations, the Central Bank of the
Republic of Guinea (BCRG), or any other public entity with autonomous legal personality,
including government administrative agency.
20.
Government revenue includes tax and nontax revenue. It does not include external
grants and revenue from privatization (recorded as financing). Tax and nontax revenue are
defined on a cash basis, in accordance with the IMF Government Finance Statistics Manual
(GFSM) 1986, section IV.A.1, using the following categories. For tax revenue, the main
categories are taxes on income, profit, and dividends (Title 1); taxes on property (Title 2);
taxes on international trade (Title 3), including import duties, the export duty (droit fiscal de
sortie), the surtax on consumption, the liquidation levy (redevance de liquidation) and
penalties related to international trade; taxes on goods and services (Title 4), including
general sales taxes, value-added taxes on domestic sales and on imports, the single tax on
vehicles (TUV), the tax on financial transactions, taxes on petroleum products, and export
taxes on mining products, including the tax on mining products, taxes on diamonds, and
taxes on precious metals. Other tax revenues (Title 5) include stamp taxes and revenue from
recording fees. Tax receipts also incorporate the taxes assumed by the State for the purchase
of externally financed capital goods. Nontax revenue consists of royalties and dividends
(excluding revenue from the sale of telephone licenses), administrative duties and fees and
fines and forfeitures (Title 6), and other nontax revenues (Title 7), including incidental
revenue and capital revenue (Title 8). Capital revenue includes revenue from the sale of
government assets, excluding revenue from privatization.
21.
Starting in 2008, government expenditure is measured in the stage of assumption
(prise en charge) by the Treasury, regardless of the execution procedure followed. Under
regular or simplified procedures, the expenditure is assumed by the Treasury immediately
after the payment order (ordonnancement) is issued; in the case of decentralized government
appropriation (délégations de crédit) or payments without prior payment order, assumption
occurs at the time of recording of the payment order (mise en paiement), and in the latter
case, no expenditure will be measured at the basis of the regularization orders (mandatements
de régularisation). For reimbursements of VAT credits, assumption occurs when those
requests are transmitted from the National Tax Directorate to the Treasury. For 2007,
government expenditure is measured on a commitment (engagement) basis. Government
expenditure includes all expenditures of the central government, including subsidies and
transfers to autonomous public entities, and loans granted or onlent by the government to
public enterprises and other sectors of the economy, net of repayments on such loans.
22.
Basic primary expenditure is defined as total budgetary expenditures less domestic
and external interest outlays, and expenditure financed with foreign loans or grants or
counterpart funds.

67
23.
Bank financing includes (i) central bank financing of the Treasury, i.e., the
change in the Treasury’s net position at the central bank (TNP1) including the HIPC account
but excluding the change in the net position of “satellite” government accounts at the central
bank; and (ii) commercial bank financing of the Treasury, which includes the change in
the stock of Treasury bills held by banks and excludes the change in the net position of
“satellite” government accounts held in commercial banks.
24.
Nonbank financing includes (i) amounts paid to resident holders of government
securities; (ii) amounts owed to holders of government securities which have been
rescheduled under an agreement signed by the two parties; (iii) revenue from privatization,
including revenue from the sale of telephone licenses; (iv) advances of mining receipts
received (positive sign) or paid out (negative sign); (v) suppliers’ credits falling due in more
than three months received (positive sign) or repaid (negative sign); and (vi) the retirement of
other domestic debt.
25.
External financing includes (i) disbursements of external loans; (ii) principal owed
on government external debt, (iii) relief and rescheduling of government external debt, minus
HIPC assistance obtained from multilateral institutions, which are considered part of grants;
and (iv) change in foreign assets.

ATTACHMENT IV. JOINT IMF-WORLD BANK DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Guinea is in debt distress, and would remain at a high risk of debt distress into the medium
term in the absence of the country’s reaching the Completion Point under the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative and benefiting from the Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiative (MDRI). If the HIPC
Completion Point is reached by end-2008, the external debt burden will decline to a sustainable
level from that point. Results of the public sector DSA indicate that Guinea’s domestic debt is
significant but is expected to decrease over time.1
A. Background
1.
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) updates the analysis of the external and
public debt of Guinea that was carried out in 2005.2 It applies the methodology of the FundWorld Bank debt sustainability framework (DSF) for low income countries. In accordance with
the framework, this DSA compares the expected trajectory of debt indicators with the thresholds
for countries with weak policies and institutions (Table 1).3
2.
Guinea reached the decision point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in
December 2000, qualifying for US$545 million (in NPV terms) in debt relief. In 2001–02,
interim debt relief was provided by all main creditors including the IMF, the International
Development Association (IDA), the African Development Bank (AfDB), and Paris Club
members. After the PRGF went off-track at end-2002, many creditors, including the majority of
Paris Club members, discontinued interim relief. At the same time, the AfDB continued interim
relief but eventually exhausted resources allocated to that purpose. Only IDA and two Paris
Club creditors continued providing interim relief to date. As a result of policy slippages and
dwindling debt relief, Guinea has had difficulties servicing its external debt since 2003.
3.
At end-2006, Guinea’s public and
publicly guaranteed external debt was
US$3,188 million, or 101.5 percent of GDP.
Multilateral creditors accounted for 63 percent of
the total, with the IDA and the AfDB group
accounting for more than four-fifths of the
multilaterals’ share (Figure 1). The Paris Club
group of creditors accounted for 28 percent of total,
while non-Paris Club and commercial creditors
made up the rest. Like many HIPC countries, the

70
currency composition of Guinea’s external debt
leaves it vulnerable to changes in the U.S. dollar
exchange rate against major international
currencies. With 78 percent of the external debt
denominated in Euro, Yen and SDR (Figure 2), the
depreciation of the U.S. dollar against major
international currencies since the decision point
has increased the U.S. dollar value of the debt.
4.
The external debt service arrears reached
nearly US$191 million at end-2006 (Figure 3).
The Paris Club members accounted for 90 percent
of the arrears, and commercial creditors and
multilateral institutions for 5 percent each,
including 1 percent for IDA (there was no overdue
obligation to the IMF).4 Arrears to the Paris Club
members accrued on both pre-cut-off and post-cutoff debts. The former largely represents arrears on
payments covered by the interim HIPC assistance
that was discontinued by a majority of creditors
after the PRGF program went off-track at end2002.

B. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Baseline scenario
5.
The baseline macroeconomic framework underpinning this DSA assumes
implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, focusing on those
aimed at improving governance. The average growth assumption (5 percent during 2008–27) is
also predicated on measures to remove bottlenecks to the business climate, invest in
infrastructure, and promote the provision of electricity and other basic services. In addition, the
implementation of large mining projects is expected to lead to the gradual expansion of mining
production from 2010 onwards (Box 1).5

4
5

Arrears are defined as payments past due date. This may differ from the definitions applied by the creditors.

The baseline is consistent with the macroeconomic framework envisaged for the period 2007–10 in the context of
a program to be supported by a PRGF arrangement and the 2007 consultation under the Article IV of the IMF
articles of agreement. However, the latter reflects the impact of the debt stock reductions under the enhanced HIPC
and MDRI initiatives that would result from Guinea reaching the HIPC completion point. The HIPC completion
point and MDRI debt relief is presented here in the alternative scenario.

71
6.
Consistent with current guidelines,6 the baseline scenario assumes only interim flow
relief in 2008. It is projected that some creditors will provide interim HIPC debt relief
according to the HIPC decision point and the subsequent Paris Club debt agreement.
7.
Under the baseline scenario, Guinea is in debt distress (Table 1, Figure 4). At end2006, the debt burden indicators were well above the indicative policy-based thresholds. Also,
the country has accumulated substantial external arrears in the recent years. In the baseline
scenario, several debt burden indicators are projected to remain above the thresholds for the next
10–12 years.7 In particular, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is estimated at 186 percent at end2006, well above the indicative threshold of 100 percent, and is not projected to go below this
threshold until 2020. However, the ratios of debt service to export and revenues can fall below
the thresholds as soon as in 2008 reflecting both the projected resumption in interim HIPC debt
relief by some creditors and a projected increase in fiscal revenues (Box 1).

The thresholds are based on the empirical finding that low-income countries with stronger policies and institutions
tend to have a higher debt carrying capacity. See IDA and IMF, “Operational Framework for Debt Sustainability
Assessments in Low-Income Countries—Further Considerations” (IDA/R2005–0056), April 2005.

72

Box 1. Guinea: Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA
Real GDP growth is projected to pick up from the average of 3½ percent in the past ten years to
an annual average of 5 percent over the projection horizon. The higher growth is predicated on
government’s planned policies to consolidate macroeconomic stability, upgrade and expand public
infrastructure, and strengthen governance. Also, several large mining projects are currently in the
implementation stage; they are expected to boost production capacity from 2010 onwards.
Average annual inflation as measured by the CPI is expected to decelerate sharply from 35 percent
in 2006 and an expected 23 percent in 2007 to single-digit levels in 2009 and to stabilize at 5
percent from 2011 onwards. This inflation projection reflects the authorities’ commitment to
refraining from monetary financing of the budget deficit and strengthening the central bank
capacity to use policy instruments for controlling monetary aggregates.
The GDP deflator is expected to be broadly in line with the CPI inflation, while the GDP deflator
in U.S. dollar terms will take into account the US inflation, projected to remain within 2–3 percent.
This implies a stabilization of the real exchange rate from 2008. For 2007, however, the baseline
scenario envisages a strong increase of the nominal GDP in U.S. dollar terms consistent with the
appreciation of the local currency in the first ten months of the year.
Export growth is projected to average at about 7 percent over 2007–10 and about 8 percent over
2011–27. The medium-term export projections are affected by the large investments in the mining
sector. Excluding official transfers, the external current account deficit is assumed to expand
from 6.5 percent of GDP in 2006 to 15.2 percent in 2011 and then gradually decrease to 13 percent
by 2027, reflecting the projected increase in FDI-related imports over this period.
The primary fiscal surplus (including grants) is projected to stay positive over the medium term,
gradually decreasing from 2.4 percent of GDP in 2007 to 1.2 percent in 2010 and to 0.7 percent on
average in 2011–27. The envisaged broadening of the tax base and strengthening of customs and
tax administration would help raise revenue by about 3 percentage points of GDP over the next
five years. At the same time, public expenditures would have to increase to address the substantial
social and infrastructure needs of the country.
Donor support is projected to increase, assuming the timely implementation of the authorities’
new poverty reduction strategy. New grants and concessional loans are expected to be mobilized in
equal proportions on top of the already committed financing, which is biased towards loans. For
the new loans, the average grant element is projected to remain significantly above the standard
threshold of 35 percent for the time of the possible new PRGF arrangement (2007–10), and would
slowly decline thereafter.

8.
The baseline macroeconomic projections are subject to significant risks. A
relaxation of fiscal and monetary policies and protracted delays in the strengthening of the
central bank and public finances or in the implementation of an effective regulatory and
attractive tax frameworks for key sectors of the economy would put into question the
assumptions on growth, external support and official reserve accumulation. They would also
increase Guinea’s external vulnerability.

73
9.
Guinea’s debt burden indicators are particularly sensitive to exogenous shocks and
a reversal to historical trends. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the baseline debt burden
indicators are most vulnerable to exogenous shocks to export growth and to a one-time
depreciation of the Guinean franc against the U.S. dollar. Under these most extreme stress tests,
debt ratios exhibit a significant level increase and are slower to return to policy-based thresholds
(see the most extreme stress tests in Figure 4). Sensitivity to exchange rate assumptions is also
illustrated in a scenario where key macroeconomic variables remain at their historical averages
from 2007 onwards. Under this scenario, Guinea’s external debt ratios would snowball,
reflecting mostly the assumed continuation of the sharp real exchange rate depreciation that
Guinea experienced over the past ten years.
Alternative scenario envisaging HIPC completion point and MDRI
10.
An alternative scenario that simulates HIPC and MDRI debt relief indicates a
sharp reduction in the risk of debt distress at the expected HIPC completion point
(Figure 4, HIPC/MDRI scenario). The HIPC debt relief would reduce projected annual debt
service due to Paris Club creditors by about three quarters.8 Upon reaching the HIPC completion
point, the country will also become eligible for debt relief under the MDRI, which would writeoff all debt obligations to IDA incurred up to end-2003, and the IMF and AfDB debt obligations
incurred up to end-2004.9 The implementation of HIPC and MDRI debt relief at end-2008
would eliminate about 60 percent of Guinea’s outstanding external debt at end-2008 (in net
present value terms). This would proportionally reduce Guinea’s external debt ratios at end2008, which would remain well below the policy-based thresholds afterwards (Table 1).
11.
Even after the completion point is reached, Guinea’s debt sustainability will remain
vulnerable to adverse exogenous shocks—especially from exchange rate fluctuations—and
policy reversal. This highlights the importance of rapid achievement of the Completion Point,
sustained implementation of sound fiscal, monetary and structural policies, and a prudent debt
strategy, which includes contracting external loans only on concessional terms.
C. Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis
12.
Guinea’s domestic debt is significant but is expected to decrease over time. At end2006, identified government domestic debt amounted to about 15 percent of GDP, of which
about three quarters consisted of advances from the central bank, the rest being treasury bills
owned by commercial banks (6 percent) and securitized arrears to the private sector
(20 percent). The baseline macroeconomic scenario assumes a reduction in the level of domestic
debt, as a result of the projected fiscal consolidation and elimination of central bank financing of
the budget.

8

The staff estimates for HIPC completion point debt relief are based on authorities’ data and subject to loan data
verification and confirmation in the detailed pre-completion point debt analysis (HIPC DSA).
9

The MDRI does not impact the status of new debt accumulated to multilateral creditors after those dates.

74
13.
The debt sustainability analysis shows a relatively rapid improvement of public
sector debt indicators (Table 4). The NPV of public sector debt is projected to decline from
over 80 percent of GDP at end-2006 to half this level in 2012. Similarly, the debt service-torevenue ratio decreases from about 78 percent of the government revenues in 2006 to 31 percent
in 2012. The sensitivity analysis indicates, however, that the pace of debt reduction may be
significantly affected by policy reversal or exogenous shocks, which would increase the risk of
debt distress over the medium term. In the no reform scenario, in which the primary balance is
maintained at its 2006 level , debt burden indicators remain well above the baseline scenario,
although they continue to improve over time. A one-time 30 percent real depreciation in the
Guinean franc and real GDP growth at historical level minus one standard deviation in 2008–09
(the most extreme stress tests) would also generate a significant increase in the debt burden
indicators (Figure 5).
D. Conclusion
The debt sustainability analysis concludes that under the baseline scenario Guinea
is and would remain at a high risk of debt distress into the medium term in the absence of
the country’s benefiting from the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Reduction
Initiative (MDRI). Under the alternative scenario assuming that the HIPC completion point is
reached by end-2008, the external debt burden would decline to a sustainable level from that
point. However, even after benefiting from HIPC and MDRI, Guinea’s debt sustainability would
remain vulnerable to adverse exogenous shocks and policy reversals. These conclusions
highlight the importance of a rapid attainment of the HIPC Completion Point, sustained
implementation of sound macroeconomic and structural policies, and a prudent debt strategy.
Results of the public sector DSA indicate that Guinea’s domestic debt is significant but is
expected to decrease over time. The sustainability analysis indicates, however, that the pace of
public debt reduction may be significantly affected by policy reversal or exogenous shocks.

Average

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Strong appreciation of the local currency in 2007 boosted the nominal GDP in U.S. dollar terms, which greatly contributed to the reduction of external debt to GDP ratio.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments due divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are derived over the past 10 years.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator ( U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and nondebt creating flows.
Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are
the same as in the baseline.
3
Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline
level after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4
Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5
Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6
Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

VIII. Safeguards assessments:
Pursuant to Fund policy, the Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea (BCRG) was subject to
an updated safeguards assessment in conjunction with a new PRGF arrangement. The
safeguards assessment report that was completed on October 21, 2007, confirmed the
continued existence of critical vulnerabilities in the BCRG safeguards framework, which
would pose a high risk to the proper safeguarding of IMF disbursements. Overall, a system of
strong internal controls, financial governance, and accountability needs to be urgently reestablished and maintained at the BCRG. The assessment recommends measures that should
help mitigate the safeguards risks, though significant risks would still remain. The BCRG has
agreed to implement critically important measures as prior actions for the PRGF. Several
other recommendations will become performance criteria and structural benchmarks for the
program, and staff will monitor their implementation as part of program conditionality.

34

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts can not be added.

35

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

IX.

Exchange arrangements:

The regime is classified as a managed float with no predetermined path for the exchange rate.
As of March 2006, the central bank calculates the official reference exchange rate daily as
the weighted average rate of foreign exchange transactions in the banking sector and
authorized foreign exchange bureaus (though the latter were excluded from the calculation
starting in September 2007). Guinea continues to have a multiple currency practice arising
from the absence of a mechanism to prevent a potential deviation of the exchange rate used
by the BCRG in its foreign exchange transactions from the exchange rates used by the
commercial banks in transactions with their customers. The official reference rate is applied
only for accounting purposes.

ANNEX II. IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
(As of October 31, 2007)
Partnership in Guinea’s development strategy
1.
Guinea’s development strategy is laid out in the government’s Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper II (PRSP II), which the government issued in August 2007. The staffs of the
World Bank and the Fund have prepared a Joint Staff Assessment Note (JSAN), which sets
out staff views on priority areas for strengthening the PRS over the coming years. The PRSP
II rests on three pillars: (i) improving governance and institutional and human capacitybuilding; (ii) expediting growth and expanding employment and income opportunities for all;
and (iii) improving access to high quality social services.
2.
The Fund and the World Bank cooperate closely, within their own mandates, in
helping the government to implement its medium-term poverty reduction and growth
strategy. The Fund leads the policy dialogue on macroeconomic policies. The World Bank
takes the lead in areas of structural reform, such as electricity and water services, mining
sector policies, public financial management, health, education, rural development,
governance issues, telecommunication, private sector development, and capacity building.
Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy
3.
The Bank is working on an interim strategy for Guinea as a lending framework until
2009, when a new full fledged Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) will be drafted. The
fragile political environment in Guinea recommended a more temporary approach via an
interim strategy. Until there is an interim strategy Bank assistance to Guinea is still guided by
the CAS that was approved by the Board in June 2003 and expired in 2006. The CAS was
based on three scenarios, high case, base case, and low case. Given the volatile and fragile
political environment in Guinea since 2003, only the low case scenario was realized because
the government has been unable to make significant progress in resolving macroeconomic,
fiscal and governance issues since then. In this case any assistance was limited to
safeguarding the progress achieved in sectors vital to poverty reduction; there was no budget
support or infrastructure financing.
4.
IDA in 2001 provided its most recent budget support in the form of a Structural
Adjustment Credit (SAC IV). Provision of budget support operations (PRSC) assumed
continuing sound macroeconomic performance and reforms. However, macroeconomic
management has deteriorated seriously since mid-2002, and the Fund’s PRGF-supported
program went off track in December 2002. Contributing factors were overspending related to
security outlays, lax monetary policies, and a fixing of the exchange rate, which led to rising
inflation and an abrupt decline in gross reserves. Structural reforms came to a halt. The
wavering macroeconomic policies, compounded by lower earnings derived from mining of
bauxite and other commodities, led to slower GDP growth, which averaged 2.7 percent

87
between 2002 and 2006. Since early 2005 the government has been making incremental
progress toward stabilizing the macroeconomic aggregates, improving governance, and
resuming structural reforms. An IMF staff-monitored program was successfully implemented
from April 2005 to March 2006. The new government under Prime Minister
Lansana Kouyaté plans to address obstacles to development in Guinea through an ambitious
reform program based on a new PRSP. The main objectives are to stabilize the economy and
improve both governance and service delivery.
5.
As of October 2007, IDA had approved 67 credits for Guinea, of which 2 were for
transport and infrastructure; 14 for energy, mining, water, and telecommunications; 3 for
strengthening the country’s management capability; 5 in public sector/governance; 14 in
financing rural development; 4 in the urban sector; 5 for health; 7 for education; 1 for social
protection; and 3 in the financial sector. The total value of these projects was about
US$1,498 million equivalent, of which US$1,383 million have been disbursed. During the
period FY98–07, the Board approved 2 adjustment operations (a Public Expenditure
Management Adjustment Credit and the Fourth Structural Adjustment Credit) and
13 investment operations: the National Rural Infrastructure Project, Decentralized Rural
Electrification, Electricity Sector Efficiency Improvement Project, Education for All, Village
Community Support Program, the Capacity Building for Service Delivery Program, the
Microfinance LIL, the Pre-Service Teacher Education LIL, the Urban Project, and the
Population and Reproductive Health Project. The Bank’s current portfolio in Guinea reflects
its PRSP priorities. It comprises seven projects totaling US$219 million, of which
US$60.3 million are in the form of a grant, and US$108 million remain undisbursed. The
Capacity Building for Service Delivery Project (US$19 million, with an undisbursed balance
of $14.3 million) closed on June 30, 2004, but was retroactively extended to May 31, 2005 to
permit financing of a forensic audit. The nonlending program includes fiduciary assessment;
a public expenditure review (PER); analysis of public finance management and audit
systems; a poverty assessment; a development policy review; a study on decentralization; and
a social and vulnerability assessment.
6.
The proposed World Bank lending program for FY07–09 will support electricity and
water projects and focus on capacity building.
Bank–Fund collaboration in specific areas
7.
IMF and World Bank staffs collaborate in supporting the government’s poverty
reduction strategy and structural reforms. As part of its assistance to Guinea through lending,
country analytic work, and technical assistance, the Bank supports policy reforms in the
following areas in collaboration with the Fund.
Public expenditure management

8.

Improvements in public expenditure management have been a priority of the Guinean
government since 1996. The Bank, the Fund, and other donors have worked closely to give

88
the government the support needed for institutional and policy reforms. The Fund leads the
dialogue on tax policy; the Bank focuses on strategic resource allocation and the operational
efficiency of public expenditures. To enhance strategic resource allocation and operational
efficiency, the Bank has helped the government prepare the medium-term expenditure
framework (MTEF) and is supporting a reinforcement of the budget process and
decentralized allocation of resources to propoor priority areas. After a Country Procurement
Assessment Review (CPAR) in 2002, a Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) in 2003 focused on public expenditure management systems, the auditing of public
finances, and related governance issues. The CPAR and the CFAA were complemented by a
comprehensive PER in 2004. The PER was managed by the Bank, enjoyed strong
government ownership, and benefited from extensive consultation with beneficiaries and
development partners in close collaboration with the Fund and the AfDB. The Fund has
added to this work through interventions via AFRITAC and other missions providing
technical assistance and analysis of revenues, customs, and public financial management.
Poverty and social impact analysis
9.
The selection of reforms to be analyzed in coming years will be based on the
importance of the expected poverty and social impacts of each reform, the prominence of the
issue in the government’s agenda, the timing and urgency of the reform, and the amount of
national debate surrounding the reform. The 2002 household survey was completed in the
first half of 2005, making it possible to better identify determinants of poverty and their
interdependency and to track impact on poverty over time. The government published an
updated poverty diagnostic in July 2006. A second household survey should be initiated soon
to take stock of trends since 2002 and to improve the data available for poverty and social
impact analysis. Work is under way to strengthen the government’s monitoring capacity.
Public service reform and improved service delivery
10.
In recent years the Government of Guinea has started a number of initiatives to
improve administrative performance and foster accountability, transparency, and integrity in
the public sector. The Bank and other donors supported these efforts through (i) the
Economic Management Technical Assistance Project, 1993–2000 (Projet d’Appui à la
Gestion Economique et Financière – PAGE); (ii) the Capacity Building for Service Delivery
Project, 2000–04 (Projet de Renforcement des Capacités Institutionnelles pour une Meilleure
Prestation des Services - PRCI); (iii) governance and corruption surveys launched by the
former Anti-Corruption Commission (Conseil National de Lutte contre la Corruption –
CNLC); and (iv) a grant to strengthen the capacity of the Finance Committee of the National
Assembly and the Chamber of Accounts.
11.
These reforms aim to improve service delivery and financial accountability through
capacity building and support to the decentralization process. However, the impact of PAGE
on public service efficiency and effectiveness was limited, and the PRCI was suspended in
August 2003 because of corruption, leaving most of the results indicators unachieved. In

89
contrast, a corruption survey finalized in 2005 has informed the current government’s
strategy to improve governance.. Progress has been made in building the capacity of the
Parliament Finance Committee and the Chamber of Accounts.
12.
Cooperation between the Bank and the Fund covers those areas where public sector
reform has a direct impact on fiscal stability, public sector financial management, and
governance.
Trade reforms
13.
The Bank and the Fund are also working together to help Guinea establish a progrowth trade framework. While the Fund has taken the lead in tariff reforms, the Bank and
other donors are trying to foster trade through the Integrated Trade Framework. The Bank is
also involved in a dialogue with WAEMU on trade reforms at the regional level.

ANNEX III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Economic and financial data provided to the Fund are generally adequate for program
monitoring and surveillance, but there is room to improve both the internal consistency of
fiscal data and their consistency with monetary accounts.
2.
The country participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS); its
metadata were first posted on the Dissemination Standard Bulletin Board (DSBB) on
December 12, 2003. However, because the metadata posted on the DSBB were compiled in
March 2002, plans for improvements and metadata for all data categories need to be updated
3.
In recent years more detailed government finance data have become available, but
serious statistical problems remain, particularly in the compilation of real sector and balance
of payments statistics. Changes in the financial system in recent years have adversely
affected the quality of data for deposit money banks. Although a law on statistics that
organizes the institutional setting for producing statistics at a decentralized level was
approved in 1995, neither the National Direction of Statistics (DNS), responsible for
coordinating the production of statistics, nor a technical committee responsible for providing
recommendations on the statistical program—both created by the new law—seem to have
improved the quality of statistics.
Real sector statistics
4.
Real sector statistics are weak, incomplete, and published with insufficient timeliness
to support economic policy making. Only the monthly consumer price index (CPI) is
published in a timely manner (see below); other statistics are published less frequently and
less regularly, and are often not reliable. Some of the series are available on the DNS
website.37 Monthly surveys of mining, industrial and agricultural production are produced
with long delays. Employment and population statistics are only published annually. A
program to reinforce the national accounts is being undertaken with the assistance of the
regional technical assistance center (West AFRITAC) and the Gesellschaft für Technische
Zusammenarbeit (GTZ). The work is expected to lead to the production of annual inputoutput matrices. Recent mission by West AFRITAC helped the authorities prepare
provisional estimates for the new base year – 2003 and complete the provisional national
accounts estimates for the period 2003-05.
5.
A monthly CPI for Conakry is available, with a one-month lag. Export prices are
estimated on the basis of information supplied directly by the mining companies, and import
prices are based on a weighted average of partner country export prices. Exchange rates are
reported daily.

See http://www.afristat.org/ins-guinee/index.htm.

91
6.
Additional data on the agriculture sector have been published sporadically in the form
of Food and Agriculture Organization/United Nations Development Program surveys. No
data on employment or labor costs are published.
7.
In March 2000, a mission presented detailed recommendations to improve real sector
statistics. The mission identified the lack of resources for compiling current statistics and
insufficient training as the main causes of weakness in the statistical system. Guinea has
drafted an action plan to address these weaknesses, but financial resources for many of the
measures have yet to be identified.
Balance of payments statistics
8.
The authorities have implemented some of the recommendations made by a balance
of payments statistics mission in May 1995. Notably, coverage of trade in services, private
transfers, and capital flows has been expanded by surveying service providers and large
companies every year. However, the survey is not comprehensive, and there are no sanctions
for failure to respond. In view of the difficulties encountered in compiling annual statistics,
the mission’s recommendation that data be compiled quarterly has not yet been implemented.
9.
Merchandise trade statistics are reported in the standard Harmonized System of
Customs Classification, net of imports by diplomats and transit trade. In spite of the
technically advanced method of presentation, the data are inconsistent with actual
developments in the country. Some of these inconsistencies may be due to smuggling, as
Guinea’s borders are porous. Weaknesses in balance of payments statistics also affect
national accounts data. The national accounts are based on trade data that include transit
trade and imports by diplomats and thus overestimate the openness of the economy.
However, the national accounts use estimates of trade in services that are well below those
estimated on the basis of the surveys conducted by the BCRG. At the request of the
authorities, STA scheduled a balance of payments statistics technical assistance mission in
early 2007, but the mission was postponed for security reasons.
Government finance statistics
10.
The Ministry of Finance, the Economy and Planning compiles comprehensive
monthly central government budgetary data on a cash basis for revenue and on commitment
and cash bases for expenditure. AFR receives preliminary data within one month. Budgetary
data are often not internally consistent. Consolidated central government operations data
originate in the Treasury.
11.
The budget includes the bulk of all government operations, although it excludes a
number of “satellite” accounts that are not directly incorporated into the budget. There are
also significant differences between the national definition of general government and that
provided in the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). Moreover,
autonomous funds, such as the Road Fund, are only partly incorporated into the budget. For
the Road Fund, the largest autonomous fund, 100 percent of resources are “committed”

92
through the budget and transferred from the budget to the fund. Actual disbursements are
made at the discretion of the Road Fund (though monitored through its account at the central
bank). The fuel tax is not earmarked for the Road Fund, but it is received by the general
budget and transferred to the Road Fund through the budget.
12.
The latest data published in the GFS Yearbook are for 1999 and are on a cash basis
only. Guinea does not report fiscal data for publication in International Financial Statistics
(IFS).
Monetary accounts statistics
13.
Monthly data on monetary authorities, deposit money banks, and interest rates are
provided to AFR with a one-month delay; but they are not provided to STA with the same
time lag. Beginning in 2001, the authorities undertook regular reporting of monetary data for
publication in IFS. After a deterioration in 2003, the authorities started reporting monetary
data for publication in IFS more often, but not monthly. However, reporting again
deteriorated in 2006. The latest monetary data published in IFS are for September 2006.
14.
In August 2006, as part of the authorities’ efforts to implement the methodology in
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, the BCRG reported to STA monetary data for
the central bank using the Standardized Report Form. STA reviewed these data and provided
comments to the authorities; a response is pending.
15.
Developments in the financial system over the last few years, including the
liquidation and restructuring of a number of banks, are not fully reflected in the monetary
statistics, partly because of problems in collecting data. The authorities have made some
progress in adopting the recommendations of a STA mission that visited Conakry in 2000,
but further work is needed to update and otherwise strengthen the reporting practices of
deposit money banks, especially those relating to classification of nonperforming loans.
16.
STA will conduct a follow-up monetary and financial mission during November
19–30, 2007 to address outstanding issues, including preparation of the SRFs for reporting
monetary data to STA.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
December 21, 2007
1.
This statement reports on developments, including the status of the only remaining
prior action, since the issuance of the staff report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation and
the requests for a program under the PRGF and additional interim assistance under the
Enhanced HIPC Initiative. The thrust of the staff appraisal has not changed.
2.
On December 13th the central bank opened an account with the Bank for International
Settlements that will be used to receive the PRGF disbursements. In doing so, the authorities
have fully met all the prior actions for approval of the PRGF. On December 17 th the
Executive Board of the central bank ratified ex ante and ex post controls on the use of this
account.
3.
The latest available information suggests that the economy continues to stabilize.
Year-on-year inflation was 15.3 percent at the end of November and is on track to meet the
projected 15 percent at the end of the year. Since the beginning of November, the exchange
rate used in commercial bank transactions has fluctuated in a range of 4,150 and 4,400
Guinean francs per U.S. dollar—about 30 percent stronger than during the same period last
year. The premium on the parallel market exchange rate has declined to 2 to 3 percent.
4.
Fiscal and monetary performance appear to be on track to meet the 2007 targets.
Preliminary data as of October suggest that revenues were below the authorities’ projections
by 0.2 percentage points of GDP, because mining revenues fell short. In response, current
spending was adjusted and the deficit outturn was lower than projected. Spending
commitments were stopped at the end of November, as the law envisaged. This will make it
easier for Guinea to meet this year’s target for the basic primary balance. Reserve money
increased by 10.2 percent in the first 10 months of 2007, which is in line with projections.
5.
On December 7th the Parliament adopted the budget for 2008; budget projections are
consistent with the 2008 program targets, most notably the basic primary balance and total
noninterest expenditures. The large increase in public investment that was projected in the
draft budget has been slightly reduced (by about 0.1 percentage points of GDP) to make
room for more government purchases of goods and services, which were tightly compressed
in 2007.
6.
On December 5th the President of Guinea signed a decree to reorganize ministries and
other government bodies. This removed a major impediment to reforming operations and
improving public governance. The decree keeps the central bank under the administrative
authority of the Presidency, in line with the current law; the authorities intend to submit to
Parliament a new law to strengthen central bank independence—a structural performance
criterion by the end of June 2008.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
17 January 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation
with Guinea
On December 21, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Guinea.1
Background
In March 2007, a pro-reform government took office, following widespread strikes and
protests that brought the economy to a standstill in early 2007.
The government change comes after a period of slowing growth, increasing inflation,
and deepening poverty in Guinea, in spite of the country’s large economic potential in
the extractive industries, as well as in agriculture, fishing, and forestry. Average annual
real growth slowed to 2.9 percent in 2000–05, from 4.9 percent in 1995–99; inflation
reached the double digits; and the incidence of poverty increased to 54 percent, from
49 percent.
The economic slide continued in 2006. Real growth slowed to 2.2 percent, and inflation
accelerated to almost 40 percent. The overall fiscal deficit, excluding grants,
deteriorated by almost 2 percentage points of GDP and the overall balance of payments
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
deficit widened by a similar margin. Central bank financing of the budget drove a
monetary base increase of more than 80 percent, fueling inflation and contributing to the
depreciation of the Guinean franc. With external debt remaining at unsustainable levels,
arrears to several external creditors have continued to accumulate.
On taking office, the new government promptly reestablished financial controls, put in
place tight stabilization policies to reduce the fiscal deficit, phased out central bank
financing of the budget, and curtailed monetary expansion to below nominal GDP
growth. The government also launched an economic recovery plan and a new Poverty
Reduction Strategy designed to improve transparency and governance (including at the
central bank) and to strengthen the management of public resources.
The renewed economic discipline and the return of confidence in the currency are
expected to bring inflation down to 15 percent at end-2007. Economic activity is
projected to recover slowly from the impact of the strikes, with real GDP expected to
grow by almost 5 percent in 2008, from 1½ percent in 2007, as prospects improve in the
mining sector. This projection assumes that reforms advance as envisioned, with the
ban on exports of foodstuff and fishing and forestry products being lifted promptly. As
the economy stabilizes, Guinea’s external situation from 2008 on should improve, as
should its prospects of benefiting from international debt relief.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the new government for engineering an impressive
shift in policies over the past eight months to support macroeconomic stabilization and
reverse the deterioration in economic performance and governance that occurred in
2006. Directors noted that the recent improvement in economic discipline, including
restored control of budget execution and avoiding monetary financing of the deficit, had
contributed to rapid disinflation and a strengthening of the Guinean Franc. They viewed
that continued solid policy performance would promote economic growth and help
stabilize the external situation.
Directors agreed that the priorities set out in the authorities’ new poverty reduction
strategy are appropriate. Successful implementation of the strategy will depend on wellprioritized action plans, and close monitoring and evaluation. They underscored that the
consolidation of macroeconomic stabilization, an improved business environment, the
adoption of international best practices for the development of extractive industries, and
targeted infrastructure investment will play a critical role in achieving growth targets.
Directors stressed the importance of rehabilitating public utilities. They welcomed the
authorities’ implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
Directors observed that an appropriately tight fiscal policy will be essential to further
stabilizing the economy and shoring up Guinea’s external position. In order to meet the
ambitious targets set for non-mining revenues, revenue collection will need to be

3
improved and the tax base broadened. The reinstatement of normal budgetary
procedures will be essential to maintaining control over public spending and eliminating
extrabudgetary outlays.
Directors viewed that the maintenance of a tight monetary policy will be critical to limiting
inflationary pressures and improving Guinea’s external position. The associated buildup
of official reserves will help absorb external shocks, smooth daily fluctuations of the
volatile exchange rate, and support the launching of a much-needed foreign exchange
interbank market. The use of indirect instruments of monetary policy, along with close
coordination with the Treasury, will provide needed support in limiting monetary
expansion.
Directors underscored the importance of addressing the serious deficiencies revealed
by the recent external audit of the central bank accounts and the safeguard assessment
update. They welcomed the strong mitigating measures already taken, and encouraged
the authorities to follow through with their action plan for addressing the remaining
vulnerabilities in the safeguards framework. Directors looked forward to Guinea’s
participation in the FSAP, which will support the strengthening of the financial sector.
Directors concurred with the debt sustainability analysis prepared by the staffs of the
Fund and of the World Bank, which shows that the delivery of debt relief under the
enhanced HIPC and MDRI initiatives can bring external debt back to sustainable levels.
They encouraged the authorities to take the necessary steps to promptly reach the
HIPC completion point and qualify for debt relief under these initiatives. Directors
emphasized that Guinea should persevere with efforts to engage all its external
creditors and to seek debt relief from non-Paris Club creditors on HIPC terms. They also
welcomed the authorities’ intention to avoid external borrowing on nonconcessional
terms.
Directors considered the current level of the real exchange rate to be adequate, given
the prospective debt relief and the largely untapped sources of export and productivity
growth. They encouraged the prompt removal of the remaining bans on exports of
agricultural, forestry and fish products by year-end, in order to strengthen Guinea’s
external position and improve employment opportunities for the poor. Directors called for
the elimination of the existing multiple currency practice.
Directors stressed the need for continued efforts to improve the provision of economic
and financial data, in particular in the area of national accounts and balance of
payments statistics.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 21, 2007

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves US$75.2 Million PRGF Arrangement and Additional
Interim HIPC Assistance for Guinea
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year,
SDR 48.195 million (about US$75.2 million) arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) for Guinea in support of the government's economic program. The
decision allows an immediate disbursement to Guinea of an amount equivalent to SDR
6.885 million (about US$10.7 million).
The Board also approved the disbursement of SDR 4.848 million (about US$7.6 million) in
interim assistance under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. It is intended that
PRGF-supported programs are based on country-owned poverty and reduction strategies
adopted in a participatory process involving civil society and development partners and
articulated in a Poverty Reduction Strategy paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that
PRGF-supported programs are consistent with a comprehensive framework for
macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF
loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a
5½-year grace period on principal payments.
Following the Executive Board discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director
and acting Chairman, said:
“The Guinean government has implemented, since March 2007, an impressive policy shift
toward macroeconomic stabilization, reversing the deterioration in economic performance
and governance that occurred in 2006. This shift has already contributed to rapid disinflation
and the appreciation of the Guinean Franc. Continued solid policy performance will promote
economic growth and help improve Guinea’s external situation.
“The authorities’ program of economic and financial policies aims to further stabilize the
economy and strengthen Guinea’s external position. This will entail the maintenance of tight
fiscal and monetary policies, including no new central bank financing of the budget.
Achieving these results and meeting the associated ambitious targets set for non-mining

2
revenues, will depend on improved revenue collection, and a broadening of the tax base.
Normal budgetary procedures will be restored, in order to better manage public spending.
“The implementation of monetary policy will be facilitated by the introduction of indirect
instruments. A targeted increase in official reserves will help absorb external shocks, smooth
daily fluctuations of the volatile exchange rate, and support the launching of a much-needed
foreign exchange interbank market. The swift implementation of the central bank’s action
plan to strengthen internal controls and improve basic record keeping will help address
important vulnerabilities in its safeguards framework.
“The authorities have set governance as a key priority. This and other reforms to improve
the business environment are crucial to unlock Guinea’s growth potential and reach the
ambitious poverty reduction goals that have been set. Efforts to align the legal framework
for mining activities with international best practices and continued implementation of the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative are welcome steps in this direction, along with
the rehabilitation of public utilities.
“Once Guinea has taken the necessary steps to qualify for the completion point of the HIPC
initiative, the delivery of debt relief under the enhanced HIPC initiative and the Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative would bring external debt back to sustainable levels. In parallel,
engagement with all external creditors will continue, including on debt relief from non-Paris
Club creditors on HIPC terms. Restoring debt sustainability will also depend on reliance on
limiting financing to grants and external borrowing on concessional terms,” Mr. Portugal
said.

3
ANNEX
Recent economic Developments
Despite a rich endowment of natural resources—the country houses about one third of the
world’s bauxite reserves and has significant deposits of gold, diamonds, iron ore, and
uranium—Guinea remains one of the world’s poorest countries. The country’s fragility has
been exacerbated by governance problems and external factors, including conflicts in
neighboring countries.
GDP growth slowed in 2006 and by year-end, inflation reached 39 percent, the second
highest in sub-Saharan Africa. High inflation was accompanied by rapid depreciation of the
Guinean franc. Higher import prices widened the external current account deficit despite
rising prices for bauxite and alumina. The overall balance is estimated to have deteriorated
by almost 2 percent of GDP, reflecting higher external debt obligations and lower
disbursements on externally financed investments. The relaxation of fiscal efforts,
compounded by a loose monetary policy, was the main cause of the economic deterioration.
Program Summary
The government’s new economic program seeks to consolidate macroeconomic stabilization
and strengthen institutions and policies to establish the preconditions for sustained higher
growth and poverty reduction. Once basic controls have been put in place, the focus of the
program will shift towards the deepening of reforms, particularly to improve the quality of
public services and policies, and to facilitate the smooth functioning of markets.
The prudent fiscal stance will continue in 2008. The government projects an increase in the
basic primary balance to 3.3 percent of GDP, from 1.3 percent in 2006 and 3.0 percent in
2007. Monetary policy will complement this stance by limiting the growth rate of reserve
money to be broadly in line with GDP growth. The program will also rapidly strengthen the
country’s external position through external support and debt relief.
Reaching the ambitious revenue target will require modernizing the tax and customs
directorates and broadening the tax base. The authorities will adopt measures to strengthen
budget preparation and execution; improve accounting, audit and financial information; and
revise the regulatory framework. Building an interbank foreign exchange market and
enhancing the central bank’s capacity to manage foreign exchange and reserves are also
essential. Other structural reforms focus on enhancing management of the mining sector and
on the promotion of good governance.

Statement by Laurean Rutayisire, Executive Director for Guinea

December 21, 2007
I. Introduction
The Guinean authorities would like to thank Management and staff for their support to
Guinea’s efforts towards sound macroeconomic and structural policies.
Guinea experienced in January and February 2007 the deepest general strikes and mass
protests in its history, due to the continued deterioration of the population’s living
standards. The strike was ended with the appointment of a new government headed by a
new Prime Minister, whose mandate was to restore good governance, implement economic
and financial reforms and resume cooperation with the international community, including
through a Fund-supported program. Strongly committed to reverse the economic situation
and put reforms back on track, the new authorities implemented an emergency recovery
program, in order to curb the rise of inflation, restrain public expenditure and restore
confidence with donors leading to strong mobilization of resources for infrastructure
development and basic services delivery. In particular, a cash budget was adopted; extra
budgetary spending suppressed and control on public expenditure strengthened with a ban
on central bank financing. As a result, the economy was stabilized, as demonstrated by the
resumption of economic activity and imports, sharp drop of inflation from 40 percent by
end-December 2006 to 17 percent by September 2007, containment of government
spending within its monthly revenue envelope, return of confidence in the national currency
and the initiation of discussions with staff for a new PRGF-supported program. I should
also mention that all prior actions to the PRGF which have been agreed with Staff have all
been implemented.
July this year, Guinean authorities organized a donor round table in Paris in order to
mobilize donor support for the country’s emergency recovery program (July-December
2007) and the second PRSP for the period 2007–10. The outcome of this round table has
been satisfactory as the donors made substantial pledges to bridge the financing gaps.
In order to strengthen their efforts to reinstate fiscal control, improve governance and
implement needed structural reforms to boost economic growth, the Guinean authorities are
requesting a three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction Strategy and Growth
Facility (PRGF). They also call on the resumption of the interim assistance granted by the
IMF under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, in particular, the third tranche of interim HIPC
assistance. The well-documented debt sustainability analysis has highlighted the debt
distress of Guinea. The authorities are hopeful that successful performance in implementing
a new PRGF program will enable them to reach in a near future the HIPC completion point
and benefit from MDRI which would reduce the external debt burden to sustainable levels.
II. Recent Economic Developments
Lack of external assistance along with laxed fiscal and monetary policies led to a deep
deterioration of the economy in 2006, which fueled the general strike in early 2007. In 2006,

2
real GDP growth slowed, inflation reached 39 percent, gross foreign reserves amounted to
two weeks of imports, large amount of domestic and external arrears accumulated and the
external current account widened, despite the increase in bauxite and alumina prices. On the
fiscal front, the overall deficit deteriorated further and was mainly financed by the central
bank, which led to high inflation and exchange rate depreciation. To reverse this situation
and put the needed reforms on track, the new government strongly supported by all
stakeholders, notably the trade unions and civil service organizations, took tightened fiscal
and monetary measures to stabilize the economy.
The strong commitment of the Guinean authorities to adjustment and reforms in order to
stabilize the economy and restore stakeholders’ confidence has translated into significant
progress in the fiscal and monetary areas as well as in the structural reforms. Due to past
policy shortfalls and to the strikes which affected all economic sectors, real GDP growth is
projected to rebound to less than 2 percent in 2007. However, inflation decelerated to
17 percent in September and the target of 15 percent set out for year-end will be reached.
Public expenditure is contained within ceilings given to line ministries, automatic debits of
treasury accounts by the central bank were forbidden and extra budgetary spending were also
prohibited as well as ad hoc tax and customs exemptions. Financial audits for most public
entities, including the central bank were initiated in addition to the review of several mining
contracts with a view to check their conformity with best international practices and the
appropriateness of the government share in mining revenue.
With regard to the management of the central bank, the authorities are implementing the
recommendations made by the external audit and the recent IMF safeguards assessment. In
this context, the treasury and the central bank signed an agreement reconciling mutual claims
and setting the debt service schedule. Bold steps are being taken to strengthen the accounting
and internal control of the central bank. The authorities have also called on the Fund for
technical assistance in these areas and foreign exchange management as well. Furthermore, it
is important to note that new organizational charts have been designed and approved by
presidential decree for all ministries, in order to improve efficiency in the public
administration. These new charts will be fulfilled by new high level staff committed to
integrity and reform agenda.
III. Medium-Term Program and Policies for 2008
In order to reverse the trend of poverty observed since 2002, the authorities have adopted
their second poverty reduction strategy (PRS-II) covering the period 2007–10. This
strategy is based on improving governance and building capacity, accelerating
sustainable economic growth and developing basic services. In particular, the objectives
set out by the Guinean authorities are to lower the incidence of poverty to 49 percent in
2010 from 54 percent in 2005; achieve over the period 2008–10 an average annual real
GDP growth of more than 5 percent, restore price stability in targeting 15 percent by end2007 and 5 percent by-end 2010 and strengthening the external position in building gross
foreign exchange reserves equivalent of three months of imports by end-2010.
Furthermore, needed structural reforms will be fully implemented to improve the
environment for the development of the private sector and major infrastructure programs

3
will also be carried out to remove the main obstacles to economic growth.
1. Fiscal Policy and Debt Sustainability
The authorities are strongly committed to strengthen the newly restored fiscal discipline.
Based on this progress, the authorities intend to increase government revenue and redirect
public expenditure towards the priority sectors, while preserving macroeconomic stability
and the reduction of public debt. In this context, the basic primary fiscal balance will be
gradually brought to more than 4 percent of GDP. To this effect, tax revenue will be
increased to reach 15.5 percent of GDP in 2010 by expanding the tax base, improving the tax
collection, including the mining sector and reducing tax and customs exemptions. More
specifically, the authorities intend to revise the investment code, modernize the revenue –
collection units and enforce controls over revenue collection services by applying
performance contracts.
On the expenditure side, spending in the priority sectors will be increased on the basis of
resources mobilized from reduction in debt service and donor support. A youth employment
program will be launched and the development of public infrastructure will also be
accelerated. The authorities intend to reduce subsidies and military expenditure, while
increasing wage bill to overhaul the system of bonuses for managerial level staff and narrow
the sizable gap vis-à-vis the private sector. The execution of the budget will continue to be
subject to strict monthly monitoring in the context of treasury committee meetings under the
aegis of the prime minister. On the other hand, the authorities will apply basic international
standard to public finance management. To this end, a reform strategy and a 2008–10
priority action plan will be finalized by end-2007. This plan will cover the expenditure
procedure from budget preparation to submission of the budget review law to the National
Assembly. To ensure the incorporation of PRS-II objectives in the budget, a medium-term
expenditure framework is under preparation beginning with the budget of 2009.
The authorities welcome the debt sustainability analysis. They concurred with staff that in the
absence of the country’s benefiting from the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and the MDRI;
Guinea will continue to be in debt distress. Indeed, the protracted accumulation of external
arrears and the low level of official reserves demonstrated the fragility of the Guinea’s
external situation, which highlights the importance of a rapid attainment of the HIPC
completion point, sustained implementation of sound macroeconomic and structural policies
and a prudent debt strategy. The authorities are hopeful that the delivery of HIPC and MDRI
with the attainment of the completion point before 2009 will help bring down the external
debt to sustainable levels. They are committed to prudent debt management through reliance
on grants and highly concessional loans for future financing needs. They will also seek
assistance to help them upgrade the public debt management capacity.
2. Monetary, Exchange Rate and Financial Policies
The authorities’ main monetary policy objective is to contain inflation at a very low level. To
this end, the central bank is committed to pursue firm control of base money growth. In 2008,
measures designed to align the growth of the money supply with nominal GDP growth will

4
be implemented. To facilitate the implementation of these measures, the authorities have
already prohibited any new advances from the central bank to the treasury. In the same vein,
the existing indirect monetary instruments will be strengthened as well as the coordination
between the central bank and the treasury. The central bank will also energize its liquidity
management through the issuance of central bank bills and treasury bills besides the
activation of the liquidity monitoring committee. The compliance by the commercial banks
of the required reserve ratio will be strictly observed and, if necessary, the ratio or policy
interest rate will be adjusted.
The floating exchange rate policy will be maintained. In this respect, the authorities are
committed to build an interbank foreign exchange market and enhance the central bank
capacity to manage foreign exchange and reserves. Based on the recommendations made by
the external audits and the safeguard assessment, an action plan has been designed to
strengthen the central bank in these areas. A strong technical assistance from the Fund is
needed to help the central bank to further enhance its accounting and internal controls as well
as monetary policy and foreign exchange market reforms. The authorities welcome the
multiyear program of Fund technical assistance to support their efforts. They are also
committed to further enhance transparency in the determination of the exchange rate and
eliminate the existing multiple currency practice.
In order to promote the development of the financial sector and boost its contribution to
growth, the authorities will design a medium-term strategy for the sector. They intend to
modernize the payment system, address dollarization issues and introduce financial
instruments necessary for the promotion of the private sector. The authorities are hopeful that
the FSAP for which they have applied would provide useful information on which to base the
reforms in the financial sector. In the meantime, they will vigorously enforce the banking
supervision as well as the supervision of microfinance institutions, with a view to ensure
their compliance with the prudential regulation.
3. Structural Reforms
In 2008, the Guinean authorities will step up their efforts to improve the climate for business
and investment by promoting transparency and good governance and implementing needed
structural reforms. In particular the focus will be on the electricity and water sectors,
telecommunications, the mining sector, the privatization of public enterprise and combating
corruption. With the support of the development partners, the financial situation and
management of the utilities’ companies will be strengthened. The legal framework governing
the mining sector including the taxation is under revision with the assistance of World Bank
in order to be harmonized and aligned with international standards. On the other hand, it is
envisaged to finalize several privatization deals during the first year of the program.
The authorities are also committed to gradually reinstate the formula-based mechanism for
monthly adjustments of petroleum products prices to better reflect international prices and
alleviate the budget. The outstanding debt towards oil companies at end-2006 will be
reconciled and settled as agreed by stakeholders. Measures envisaged in the area of
transparency, good governance and combat corruption include the publication of audited

5
reports in the context of EITI for 2006; adoption of a civil service code of professional
conduct and specific charters for tax staff; completion of ongoing audits in all ministerial
departments and publication of the summary reports including the list of cases submitted to
the courts; promulgation of UN and African union anti-corruption agreements and
promulgation of the anti-money laundering law passed by the National Assembly in 2006
and establishment of the financial intelligence unit provided in that law.
IV. Conclusion
The Guinean authorities are determined to pursue their efforts in implementing sound
policies and far-reaching reforms, with a view to achieve sustained economic growth and
fight the poverty facing the population. Under their emergency recovery program, the
macroeconomic situation has been stabilized. To supplement the authorities’ efforts, a strong
and sustained assistance from the international community is needed. In this respect, the
authorities are hopeful that progress made so far will be supported through a new PRGF
program, in order to enable them to reach the completion point under the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative and benefit from the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). The authorities are
grateful for the valuable technical assistance received from the IMF and are strongly
committed to implement policy measures set out in the PRGF-supported program. They
continue to count on their development partners to enhance the macroeconomic stability and
reform process and to achieve the MDGs.
