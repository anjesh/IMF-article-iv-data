Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with Suriname

December 22, 2009
•
Background. Economic growth is estimated to have decelerated to 2½ percent in 2009,
from 5.3 percent during 2002-08. Inflation fell to below 1 percent, from almost 15 percent in
2008, on the back of lower international food and fuel prices. The external current account
balance is estimated to have shifted from a surplus of 4 percent of GDP in 2008 to a deficit of
2 percent in 2009. International reserves are likely to strengthen to 5¼ months of imports at
year’s end. Public debt has fallen from almost 37 percent of GDP at end-2005 to a projected
19 percent at end-2009.
•
Focus of consultation. Discussions focused on the effects of the global economic
environment on Suriname and the appropriate policy response. Staff noted that prudent policies
have provided Suriname with some space to implement countercyclical policies, in an effort to
cushion the impact of the global crisis. However, in the context of rapid expenditure growth, staff
advised the authorities to delay the implementation of the second phase of the civil service wage
reform. The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to the reform, but saw room for a phased
implementation. The mission also encouraged them to unify the exchange rates. The authorities
did not favor any change in this area prior to upcoming elections.
•
Exchange system. Suriname has a dual exchange rate system, comprising the official and
commercial markets. The official market, in which the Suriname dollar has been set at
SRD 2.745 per US$1 since 2006, is used for government external financing and debt service
operations. In the commercial market, which covers all other current account transactions, the
currency is allowed to trade within the range of SRD 2.78-2.80 per US$1.
•
Mission. The team that visited Paramaribo during October 19-31, 2009 comprised Gamal
El-Masry (head), Yi Wu, and Nazim Belhocine (all WHD). Anne Joseph (OED, Senior Advisor)
participated in the policy discussions. The team met with Minister of Finance Humphrey
Hildenberg; Central Bank Governor André Telting; the Ministers of Agriculture, Home Affairs,
Natural Resources, and Planning; other senior government officials; and representatives of the
private sector, labor, the diplomatic community, and the opposition.

I. BACKGROUND AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
1.
Over the past decade, social peace
and a broadly benign external environment
have helped promote social and economic
development in Suriname. The country
ranks 97th out of 182 countries in the UNDP’s
2009 Human Development Index. Suriname’s
economy has been dominated by the mineral
and energy sectors (gold, alumina, and oil,
primarily), which account for about 30 percent
of GDP. Over the years, the production of
rice, shrimp and fish, bananas, and lumber has
lost importance in economic terms, but
remains an important employer.

transportation weigh heavily in the CPI
(55 percent), and their domestic prices have fallen rapidly over the past twelve months. More
recently, an uptick has been registered in the price of these goods, but core inflation has
continued to level off.

The external current account balance is estimated to have shifted from a surplus
of 4 percent of GDP in 2008 to a deficit of 2 percent in 2009 (Figure 2). The trade surplus
narrowed significantly, despite an increase in gold and oil exports. Lower alumina exports
allowed for some crude oil used in the refining process to be redirected for exports and, as a
result, crude oil exports rose by around 35 percent in volume terms. In the capital account, a
drawdown from the Netherlands Treaty Fund was used in August 2009 to clear longstanding
arrears with Brazil, totaling US$118 million. Taking into account the recent SDR allocations
of about US$125 million, international reserves were estimated at the equivalent of
5¼ months of imports at end-2009, up from 4¼ months in 2008.

Box 1. Recent Developments and Outlook in the Energy and Mining Sectors
Suriname’s economy remains dominated by the mining and oil sectors. In 2008, alumina, gold,
and oil exports amounted to 55 percent of GDP and accounted for some 95 percent of total exports of
goods. Bauxite mining is the oldest sector, and the production of alumina dates back to the early 20th
century. Oil production began in 1980 by Staatsolie, a state-owned company, while gold production by
the formal sector started in 2004.
The production of alumina sharply contracted in 2009. The expected exhaustion of bauxite
reserves in the mines around Paranam by 2010 prompted SURALCO (a subsidiary of ALCOA) to
lower production levels by 40 percent, pending the development of a new mine in eastern Suriname by
2013. In July, SURALCO bought out BHP Billiton’s 45 percent share in their joint venture, and the
government is considering to partner with SURALCO by taking a minority stake. The new company
would develop a bauxite mine in the eastern Nassau region, with estimated reserves of 10 years.
Negotiations are also ongoing between the government and various companies over the exploitation of
large bauxite deposits in the Bakhuys mountains in western Suriname.
Gold production has become the main source of export earnings. Gold production from the formal
sector at the Rosebel Gold Mines (a subsidiary of Canada’s IAMGOLD) started in 2004. It is now
reporting a production capacity of 365,000 ounces/year, with reserves to last at least 20 years.
Negotiations for the establishment of a joint venture (SURGOLD) between SURALCO, the Newmont
Mining Corporation, and the government of Suriname are well advanced. Initial exploration points to
possible reserves of up to 3 million ounces in the eastern Nassau region. The much larger informal
gold sector accounts for 60 percent of total gold production. It is weakly regulated and largely
untaxed. Gold extracted by miners is sold to

production-sharing agreements with
Staatsolie. Suriname’s oil output in 2008 reached a record high of 5.9 million barrels, making it
broadly self sufficient. Suriname exported 45 percent of its crude oil production, while importing
processed petroleum products of about equal value. Staatsolie has an ambitious investment program
for the next four years, to expand its refining capacity and intensify exploration. Geological surveys
estimate the potential oil reserves in the Guyana Basin at 15 billion barrels.
The mineral sector is a major contributor to fiscal revenue. Total tax and nontax revenues from the
three major mining companies accounted for 36 percent of total fiscal revenues in 2008. Tax revenue
from SURALCO is expected to decline substantially during 2009–10, due to both lower alumina
production and prices. Government revenues from Staatsolie, boosted in 2009 by delayed large
dividend payments covering 2008, are projected to decline in 2010. In contrast, revenues from
IAMGOLD are expected to continue to grow as a result of both higher gold volume and prices.

growth, including from the buoyant

reduction in alumina output depressed tax revenues in 2009. Indeed, the revenue
situation would have been even worse, if not for exceptionally high dividend receipts
from the state-owned oil company Staatsolie and from the central bank.

•

Expenditures: The cyclical deterioration in public finances in 2009 was amplified by
a surge in noninterest current spending arising from: (i) civil service wage increases
starting in March 2009 (3.1 percent of GDP, see Box 2); (ii) higher spending on
goods and services (2.5 percent of GDP); and (iii) elevated pension and other transfer
payments, including for a mortgage subsidy scheme covering 2009–10 (1.2 percent of
GDP).

Box 2. Civil Service Wage Reforms
In 2009, Suriname embarked on a wage reform effort, as part of a wider civil service
reform agenda. The wage reform was the culmination of many years of discussions between
the government, consultants, and civil service unions, while the wider civil service reform
program was developed with the assistance of foreign donors to streamline the civil service
and increase its efficiency. The objective of these efforts was to improve the competitiveness
of civil servants’ pay, while at the same time making the civil service leaner and more
efficient over time, including through natural attrition.
The first stage of the wage reform (FISO-1) was launched in March 2009, with
retroactive effect to January 1, 2008. It involved the grading of some 40,000 civil servant
positions based on five criteria (skills and training; inconvenience; contact with others;
management duties; and responsibilities), with the view to placing them into eleven pay
grades, with three sub-grades each. Since the authorities had provided the assurance that no
position under FISO-1 would be graded below its previous pay-grade, the exercise resulted in
a considerable upward adjustment for nearly all positions. Thus, starting in March 2009,
positions in various branches of the civil service were successively upgraded, with one
month’s additional wage adjustment paid every month for 14 months to cover the back
period from January 2008 through February 2009. As a result, the wage bill is expected to
increase from SRD 760 million in 2008 to about SRD 980 million in 2009.
The second phase of the wage reform (FISO-2) is scheduled to be implemented in early
2010, with retroactive effect to January 1, 2009. The objective of FISO-2 is to decompress
the wage bill. Consequently, the ratio between pay-grades would rise by providing wage
increases to the higher civil service grades of up to 45 percent. While the overall additional
cost of FISO-2 is still unclear, it is estimated that the wage bill would go up by at least
another 20 percent. If back-pay provisions similar to FISO-1 are assumed, the impact on the
wage bill in 2010 could be substantial. Accordingly, full implementation of FISO-1 and
FISO-2 would result in a cumulative expansion of the wage bill by more than 50 percent,
equivalent to 5.4 percent of 2009 GDP over two years.

Public debt has declined significantly in recent years. Healthy fiscal surpluses,
together with robust economic growth and the clearance of longstanding arrears with bilateral
creditors, have helped reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio from 37 percent of GDP in 2005
to around 19 percent in 2009. This ratio is currently one of the lowest in the region. As a
result of the clearance of Brazilian debt arrears—US$118 million, including a write-off of
US$44 million—Suriname only has remaining bilateral arrears with the United States
(estimated at US$31 million, or 1 percent of GDP, half of which in the form of accumulated
penalties).

II. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
The medium-term economic outlook for Suriname is favorable. The mission
prepared with the authorities a medium-term macroeconomic framework predicated on fiscal
prudence, with the view of attaining fiscal balance by the end of the projection period. This
scenario includes gradually phasing in the second stage of the wage reform program, starting

11
in 2011 (see below). After a further small deterioration in 2010, mainly reflecting carry-over
effects from the countercyclical policies initiated in 2009, the fiscal accounts would
progressively improve and revert back to a small surplus beginning in 2014, as economic
output and commodity prices recover. Over the medium-to-long term, revenues would be
expected to benefit from a permanent boost from a higher level of government participation
in the alumina and gold sectors (Appendix I). The external current account balance would
deteriorate in the near term before rebounding beginning in 2013, when large bauxite and
gold mines come on stream. The expansion of Staatsolie’s oil refining capacity would also
help reduce the need for imported refined petroleum products beginning in 2013. Under this
scenario, both the public and the external debt levels remain low and manageable over the
medium term, at below 23 percent of GDP and 11 percent of GDP, respectively. By returning
back to debt levels at the end of the projection period, similar to those going into the current
downturn, this framework would provide the authorities with stable finances and welcome
space to react to future shocks. Thus, even under standard and combined shocks, the public
debt would not rise above 33 percent of GDP.

Economic risks to the outlook are broadly balanced for the near term, and tilted
to the upside for the medium term. In the recent period, local gold production has surged in
response to high prices, while the economic recovery in Asia has helped support alumina
prices. In the short run, downside risks to the economic outlook are associated with the
possibility of a slower global recovery than anticipated. There is also a risk that, in the run-up
to the May 2010 elections, government spending on wages and goods and services increases
excessively. Additional budgetary costs could also arise in connection with the need to
recapitalize two state-owned banks and resolve the problems facing CLICO-Suriname (see
below). Over the medium term, large capital projects by the government and Staatsolie are
expected to sustain growth through 2013, when a major increase in alumina and gold
production is expected (Box 1).
9.
There are some political risks and uncertainties associated with the 2010 general
elections. The newly elected legislature, the National Assembly, will be charged with
choosing the President of the Republic by a two-thirds majority. If it fails to do so after two
attempts, the election of the President will be referred to the larger People’s Assembly. The
latter, which is empowered to elect the President by a simple majority, comprises Members
of the National Assembly, as well as local and districts councilors. Given Suriname’s indirect
and complex process for electing the President, there is a risk that the new office holder may
not be determined for an extended period following the parliamentary elections. There is also
a risk of political stalemate if the President is elected by the People’s Assembly and does not
muster the support of the National Assembly.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
10.
Policy discussions focused on the effects of the global economic slowdown on
Suriname and the appropriate policy response. There was broad agreement that the
authorities’ prudent management of the economy in recent years, during the commodity
boom, was providing them with some fiscal space to respond to the global crisis. Discussions
thus focused on how best to use this space without placing undue pressure on resources. Staff
also discussed with the authorities their investment plans in the oil and mining sectors.
A. Fiscal Policies
11.
With low public debt levels, Suriname has space to implement countercyclical
fiscal policies. Staff took the view that, in order to be effective, fiscal policies needed to be
timely, targeted, and temporary. There was agreement with the authorities that the relaxation
of the fiscal stance in 2009 had provided a welcome boost to domestic demand, at a time
when the economy was growing below potential. At the same time, there was a recognition
that fiscal policy needed to take into account the country’s capacity constraints and that the
fiscal impulse would need to be withdrawn once the recovery was well entrenched. In that
context, staff’s main messages to the authorities were to:


(i) delay the second phase of the wage reform program, planned for early 2010, until
the fiscal accounts had stabilized;



(ii) resist pressures to further boost spending ahead of the May 2010 elections, and
rein in current spending in 2010 and over the medium term;



(iii) strengthen tax collections, including by making use of CARTAC technical
assistance in this area; and



(iv) prudently expand foreign borrowing to finance the government’s expected
investments in infrastructure and the mining sectors.

Revenue
12.
In 2010, public sector revenue is projected to return to more normal levels than
in 2009, when weaker direct tax revenue was more than offset by exceptionally high
nontax revenue. Tax collections are expected to benefit marginally from the pickup in
economic activity and domestic demand, while nontax revenue would revert back to historic
levels. In an effort to enhance business activity, the authorities were considering reducing the
corporate tax rate from its current level of 36 percent. The staff advised the authorities to
resist such a reduction. It noted that, with over 75 percent of all corporate tax revenue
collected from just three large companies in the mineral sector, such a tax rate reduction
would essentially amount to a transfer payment to them. The staff took the view that such a
cut was not advisable at a time of significantly weaker public finances.

13
Current spending
13.
Staff projections show that, under prudent policies, noninterest current
spending would rise from less than 20 percent of GDP in 2008 to around 24 percent in
2010. Although an important part of the increase is related to the wage reform, other
recurrent outlays are also registering strong increases:


The mission estimated that the implementation of the first phase of the wage reform
(FISO-1) led to an increase in the wage bill of 29 percent in 2009 (Box 2), boosting
the wage bill to 12 percent of GDP in 2009.



The second phase of the civil service reform (FISO-2) is scheduled to be
implemented in early 2010, with retroactive effect from January 1, 2009. Staff
computations showed that full implementation of FISO-2 would have the effect of
raising the wage bill to 13-14 percent of GDP. Thus, the staff recommended
postponing the reform and implementing it gradually over several years.



Expenditure on goods and services is estimated to have risen from 5 percent of GDP
in 2008 to 7½ percent in 2009. The staff suggested a more moderate path in 2010.

14.
The mission recommended postponing the FISO-2 reform by at least one year
and implementing it gradually. The staff underscored its support for improving the
competitiveness of civil service pay. This would help enhance the recruitment and retention
of qualified staff and increase efficiency in the civil service. However, the staff argued that
implementing the full second stage of the reform in early 2010, as scheduled, would lead to
an excessive widening in the fiscal deficit. It would also drive up private sector wages and
likely lead to higher inflation, thereby undermining competitiveness. The staff therefore
recommended implementing FISO-2 over a period of 3-4 years, beginning in January 2011.
15.
The mission also advised the authorities to curb the rate of growth of nonwage
current spending. The staff noted that the purchase of goods and services as well as other
components of current spending, including civil service pensions, had grown very rapidly in
2009. Some of these increases would put a permanent strain on the country’s fiscal accounts.
The staff recommended phasing in programmed increases in civil service pensions over
several years, to avoid jeopardizing macroeconomic stability. With respect to the increase
registered in 2009 in subsidies and transfers, the staff noted that it was largely attributable to
a mortgage subsidy scheme introduced in early 2009. The staff considered that this increase
was justifiable, given that the scheme, designed to promote low-income private home
construction through the provision of subsidized mortgage interest rates, was temporary
(through end-2010) and well targeted.
16.
The authorities expressed their concern with the deterioration in the fiscal
accounts. In particular, they acknowledged the risks that this posed of igniting a new wave
of inflation. They explained that the wage agreements had been reached after lengthy

14
deliberative consultations with civil society. While reiterating their intention to implement
the wage reforms, they noted that these agreements also contained a clause allowing them to
delay their implementation, if justified by fiscal considerations. The authorities explained
that they would aim to curb expenditures to prevent a large budget deficit, including by
delaying the implementation of FISO-2, even though pressures will be mounting for higher
government spending in the run-up to the May 2010 elections.
Capital projects
17.
Capital spending, which has been broadly stable at around 5 percent of GDP in
recent years, is projected to rise in the coming years. Large investments are either
underway, or expected to begin in the near future, for infrastructure and in the mining sector.
The staff and the authorities agreed that public investment programs should be implemented
in a sustainable way and consistent with the country’s absorptive capacity. Implementation of
these projects will also raise the country’s growth potential. The staff welcomed the
government’s program of enhancing vital infrastructure, such as roads and port facilities. It
advised the authorities to seek to finance them through concessionary loans or grants. The
authorities concurred, noting that most large public investment projects were being financed
through concessionary foreign loans.
Public debt
18.
Suriname’s public debt is projected to remain relatively low, at 21 percent of
GDP by end-2010. Given that a significant proportion of the debt is at concessionary terms,
the interest bill of the government is low, at around 1 percent of GDP. Staff encouraged the
authorities to clear the remaining outstanding bilateral arrears with the United States. It noted
that clearing these arrears would help improve Suriname’s credit ratings and reduce the costs
of external commercial borrowing. The authorities explained that they had offered to pay the
principal and interest, and asked the United States to waive the penalties, similar to the
arrangements that they had reached with other donors.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
19.
The staff noted that, if the deterioration in public finances were to be larger than
anticipated, there would likely be a need to tighten monetary policy. Notwithstanding the
sharp decline in inflation, the mission advised the authorities not to ease the monetary policy
stance at this stage, given that domestic demand is being boosted by government expenditure.
At the same time, private sector credit growth remains relatively strong, at 17 percent. The
staff cautioned that, should the fiscal situation deteriorate further, the authorities might need
to consider tightening monetary policy through an increase in reserve requirements. The staff
also recommended developing a secondary market for government securities, to gradually
move toward relying on open market operations as the main monetary policy tool. It
encouraged the CBvS to seek technical assistance to strengthen its capacity in this area.

15
20.
Estimates of the equilibrium real effective exchange rate indicate that the rate in
the official market may be slightly overvalued (Box 3). Suriname has a dual exchange rate
regime, comprising the official and the commercial markets.2 In addition, there is an
unofficial parallel market, in which the currency has been slightly more depreciated than in
the official market by 5-7 percent in recent months. The spread in the parallel market rate has
widened in recent months, which analysts generally explain by the growing uncertainty
surrounding the May 2010 national elections. The observed depreciation in the parallel
market appears to be also consistent with the results of the estimation of the equilibrium real
effective exchange rate. These estimates suggest that, at end-2008, the official rate was
slightly overvalued. Suriname also has extensive capital controls aimed at shielding the
country from volatile capital movements.3
21.
The mission encouraged the authorities to work toward gradually unifying the
official and commercial foreign exchange markets. It also advised them to use the
flexibility provided to them under the de jure managed-float regime to allow the unified
exchange rate to find its equilibrium level. The CBvS could intervene, as needed, to smooth
out fluctuations in the rate. The staff noted that Suriname’s current comfortable reserve
position provided a good opportunity for such a move. The authorities agreed that unifying
the official and commercial exchange rates would help reduce distortions. However, they did
not support allowing the rate to float at this stage. They cautioned that such a shift would
need to be gradual, as the upcoming election cycle was expected to bring additional
uncertainty to the markets.
Financial Sector
22.
The Surinamese banking sector has weathered the global financial crisis
reasonably well. It remains insulated from global finance, mainly because of its very limited
external exposure to risky financial instruments and investments. In the recent past,
commercial bank profitability has declined somewhat, in line with the weakening in domestic
demand. The nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio for the banking sector as a whole rose
moderately, from 7.9 percent at end-2008 to 8.5 percent in September 2009. While banks
generally appear well capitalized, conditions in individual banks vary considerably. In
particular, two small state-owned banks are significantly undercapitalized. The mission
encouraged the authorities to recapitalize them promptly, given that the cost to the budget
would be small, at about 0.4 percent of GDP. The authorities explained that they were
2
3

The spread between the official and commercial rates is generally less than 2 percent.

All capital transactions require the approval of the Foreign Exchange Commission (FEC). Such
controls apply to the contracting of foreign capital and money market instruments, derivatives, and
credit. In particular, all inward or outward real estate transactions are subject to approval by the FEC.
These capital controls may also explain in part the spread between the commercial and unofficial
parallel market rates.

16

Box 3. Assessments of the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate and Current Account
The real effective exchange rate has appreciated markedly
since 2008. This follows two years of a broadly stable real
effective exchange rate. Suriname’s lack of sufficiently long
series for an adequate set of economic fundamentals precludes an
analysis of the equilibrium exchange rate based on a single
country model of the real exchange rate. Using CGERs’ estimates
to implement the macrobalance approach would be unsuitable,
because these are primarily based on a sample of non-mineral
producers.

PPP-based estimates also point to a slight

overvaluation of the currency. The exchange rate is
somewhat above its expected value (by about 10 percent) in a sample of over 150 countries.1 The
performance of the tradable non-mineral sector is mixed, suggesting that the exchange rate is broadly
in equilibrium. Non-mineral exports have grown at single digit in volume terms during 2007–08,
while healthy growth has been registered in tourism and banana and rice exports.

This result differs from that in IMF Country Report No. 07/87, primarily because of revised PPP estimates of GDP by the World Bank.

planning to do so in the near future. They also agreed with the staff on the need to strengthen
the supervision of the financial sector as a whole.
Although dollarization exposes the financial system to risks arising from
potential currency mismatches, banks appear to be relatively well protected. After
several years of decline, bank deposit dollarization has edged up in recent months. The share
of foreign currency-denominated deposits rose

allowed to hold in interest-bearing accounts
abroad. As a result, banks’ net foreign exchange position is broadly in equilibrium. In an
effort to reduce dollarization in the economy, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has also
recently announced that it will vigorously enforce regulations requiring that all goods be
priced in Surinamese dollars.
23.

24.
As a whole, the foreign reserves coverage of the banking system has improved
substantially. Official international reserves have increased significantly in recent years, to
about US$800 million at end-September 2009, equivalent to 5.3 months of imports. This
development has contributed to a sharp increase in the foreign reserves coverage of the
banking system, from 87 percent of banks’ foreign currency deposits at end-2005 to
153 percent at end-September 2009.
25.
In the rest of the financial system, early action will be needed to resolve the
problems of CLICO-Suriname. Following a run by depositors and policyholders in July, a
court approved a moratorium on payments by CLICO-Suriname, a subsidiary of the troubled
Trinidadian conglomerate Colonial Life Financial (CLF). This decision provided the
authorities with some time to facilitate the possible take-over of CLICO-Suriname by another
local insurance company. The mission encouraged the authorities to resolve the situation
expeditiously, to help stem the deterioration in its balance sheet and avoid possible contagion
to other financial institutions. Such a resolution should aim at minimizing the cost to the

Despite the sharp decline in U.S. interest rates since 2007, foreign currency deposit rates in
Suriname have remained broadly unchanged over the past three years, at 3-3½ percent. Lending rates
on operations in U.S. dollars have also remained broadly unchanged, at 9½-10 percent.

budget, while at the same time addressing the risk of moral hazard by enforcing market
discipline on policyholders and investors, who sought large gains at high risks.
26.
The mission recommended that Suriname participate in the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP). Such an exercise would assess the health of the financial
sector and make practical recommendations on how to strengthen bank and nonbank
supervision. It would also make recommendations toward the introduction of indirect
monetary policy instruments. The authorities agreed on the merits of an FSAP exercise, and
formally requested that an FSAP mission visit Suriname as soon as possible.
C. Public Investment in the Mining Sector and Structural Issues
27.
The mission supported the authorities’ plan to increase Suriname’s share in the
exploitation of its natural resources. Under these plans, which enjoy wide public backing,
the government will undertake sizeable investments in the mining and energy sectors,
primarily as a minority shareholder in private ventures. This would give Suriname an
opportunity to boost its share in the development of the country’s natural resources, and
ensure a greater flow of revenue to the government for the benefit of the broad population.
The staff encouraged the authorities to also consider alternative fiscal measures to boost the
government’s take in the mining sector. It noted that any direct equity investment entailed
some risks to the government, and should be undertaken within the context of a long-term
comprehensive growth strategy of diversification, and economic and environmental
sustainability.
28.
The staff encouraged the authorities to diversify the country’s economic base in
the medium term. Such a diversification would help steer the economy away from overreliance on the mining sector, and toward new opportunities for growth and employment. To
this end, the mission welcomed the ongoing increase in the number of hotels and eco-tourism
activities, demonstrating considerable growth potential in the tourism industry. Likewise, the
rice and banana sectors continue to hold promise for growth and employment.
29.
To further enhance long-term growth, staff recommended the adoption of
structural reforms, which the authorities broadly endorsed. These reforms would aim at
strengthening public finances and improving the efficiency of the Suriname economy over
the medium term:


Strengthening revenue administration. Following up on the mission’s
recommendations, the authorities have requested technical assistance from CARTAC to
do preparatory work in early 2010 on options to improve the efficacy and administration
of indirect taxes. This work would enable the successor government to take informed
decisions on the way forward soon after taking office.

19


Restructuring of public companies. Sustained efforts have been undertaken in this area.
The restructuring of the state-owned rice company is almost complete, and the full
privatization of the banana company is scheduled to take place in 2010.



Improving the business environment. Suriname lags behind its neighbors with regard to
a business-supportive environment. In its 2010 Doing Business Report, the World Bank
placed Suriname 155th among 183 countries, the lowest ranking in the Caribbean region.
The mission called on the authorities to intensify their efforts to reduce red tape and
excessive bureaucratic steps associated with the establishment and running of private
businesses. It emphasized that simplifying business licensing requirements and
procedures would encourage greater domestic and foreign private investment.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL

30.
Suriname has weathered the global economic crisis relatively well. While output
growth fell below potential in 2009, it is estimated to have remained positive. Weaker
activity in the alumina sector was partly offset by stronger performance in the gold and
construction sectors. Inflation pressures have diminished markedly, and private credit
expansion has eased. While the external current account balance has shifted to a deficit, this
deficit was relatively small in 2009, and international reserves are at comfortable levels.
31.
The prudent policies that were implemented in recent years provide Suriname
with some space to undertake countercyclical fiscal policies. The authorities have reduced
the public debt-to-GDP ratio to one of the lowest levels in the region, providing them with
some room to relax the fiscal stance in order to cushion the impact of the global slowdown.
In order to be effective and sustainable, such a relaxation will need to be consistent with
macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability.
32.
In that context, there is a need to avoid undue increases in fiscal spending.
During 2009, fiscal outlays grew rapidly, reflecting the implementation of the first phase of
the civil service wage reform, higher pension payments, and sharp increases in subsidies and
in purchases of goods and services. The staff is concerned that the full implementation of the
civil service reform in the months ahead could lead to excessive pressure on resources and
set off an inflationary process. Delaying the implementation of the second stage of the civil
service reform by at least one year, and implementing it gradually thereafter over a period of
several years is advisable. The staff also recommends bringing the growth of other current
outlays under control. It advises against weakening tax collections through undue reductions
in the corporate tax rate and supports the authorities’ efforts to strengthen tax administration,
including with technical assistance from CARTAC.
33.
Monetary policy appears appropriate. However, if fiscal spending is not restrained
in the months ahead, or if the rate of spending growth increases, there may be a need for an
early tightening in monetary conditions. The staff encourages the authorities to develop a

20
secondary market for government securities and gradually move over the medium term
toward relying on open-market operations as the main monetary policy tool. Staff estimates
suggest that the Suriname dollar may be slightly overvalued, although the computations
suggest that this is within the margin of error. The staff encourages the authorities to work
toward gradually unifying the official and commercial market exchange rates, and to
introduce more flexibility in the exchange rate regime. The staff does not recommend
approval of the multiple currency practices, as there is no timetable for their removal.
34.
The Surinamese banking sector has weathered the global financial crisis
reasonably well. While banks generally appear well capitalized, NPL ratios have increased
slightly and conditions in individual banks vary considerably. The staff encourages the
authorities to promptly recapitalize the two undercapitalized small state-owned banks and to
resolve the situation in CLICO-Suriname expeditiously and at a minimum cost to the budget.
It welcomes the authorities’ plans to strengthen the supervision of the financial sector and
supports their request for an FSAP in the near future.
35.
The medium-term prospects are favorable, with large investment projects in
infrastructure, and in the mining and oil sectors. Over the medium term, the external
current account balance is expected to shift to a robust surplus, benefiting from a sustainable
boost in exports from large mining projects in the alumina and gold sectors. The staff
encourages the authorities to continue financing public sector investments through foreign
concessionary financing. It also endorses the authorities’ plan to increase Suriname’s share in
the exploitation of its natural resources. Such investments can be justified by the country’s
low public debt ratio and comfortable reserve position, and would ensure a greater flow of
revenue to the government for the benefit of the broad population. The authorities are
encouraged to intensify their efforts to simplify business licensing requirements, which will
help promote investment.
36.
The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Suriname be
held on the standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. ILLUSTRATIVE MEDIUM-TERM PROJECTIONS AND
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSES (DSAS)
The staff conducted debt sustainability analyses, based on a plausible medium-term outlook
that was discussed with the authorities.
A. Government Finances
Key assumptions
Revenue is projected to decline over the next three years, and rebound starting in 2013,
when the new bauxite and gold mining projects come on stream. Revenue collections will
be further boosted by the government’s expected participation in the gold and alumina
sectors, and higher revenue from the state oil company after the completion of its new
refinery. In the outer years, indirect revenue collections are also assumed to increase
marginally.
Meanwhile, the fiscal position will gradually improve through fiscal consolidation.
FISO-2 is assumed to be implemented gradually over a number of years, capping the annual
nominal wage growth at about ten percent. Spending on goods and services and on subsidies
and transfers will also be brought under control. The improvement in revenue collections,
starting in 2013, will help offset the expected drying up of financial assistance under the
Netherlands Treaty Fund. The latter will lead to a reduction in grants-financed capital
expenditure. In contrast, more spending associated with the government’s participation in the
mining sector is expected, which is reflected in higher net lending during 2010-13. The
overall fiscal deficit is projected to gradually decline to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2012. Once
higher mineral revenues kick in, starting in 2013, the fiscal balance is expected to improve
rapidly and turn positive in 2014.
The DSA assumes continuation of prudent public debt management. In particular,
external debt is assumed to be contracted in line with the country’s implementation capacity
and at favorable terms.
Assessment of the fiscal DSA
Public debt remains manageable, although the debt burden could increase considerably
under standard shocks. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase moderately
over the next few years, before declining in 2013, when higher mineral revenues are
expected. During the whole projection period the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to remain
below 23 percent. On the other hand, the debt burden is sensitive to standard shocks. For
example, a permanent ½-standard-deviation shock applied to the real interest rate or primary
fiscal balance could push up the debt-to-GDP ratio to 32 percent.

B. Balance of Payments
Key assumptions
The medium-term outlook is based on the assumption of a broad continuation of present
policies, amid a sizeable increase in output beginning in 2013, as three major new projects in
the non-renewable resources sector come on line. The main assumptions are the following:
•

Potential output is estimated at 5 percent. The economy will be growing below potential
up to 2012, while alumina production remains below production capacity and the global
recovery slowly gains momentum. In 2013, SURALCO is expected to increase its
production of alumina back to the 2008 level. In addition, Staatsolie’s new enhanced
refining capacity will come on stream in the same year. Finally, the new gold mine
SURGOLD is assumed to start production in the Nassau region in 2013. These projects
will boost GDP above potential by 2½ percent.

•

Inflation is expected to remain steady, at 5½ percent a year.

•

The increase in imports of capital and intermediate inputs related to the three projects
outlined above will keep the current account in deficit through 2012. The reserve
coverage will nevertheless remain stable, at about 5 months of imports, as capital inflows
from FDI remain robust. In 2013, the current account balance will turn positive and reach
4¾ percent of GDP. The reserve coverage will rise to 7 months of imports by 2014.

•

The steady decline in grant inflows reflects the drying up of financial assistance from the
Netherlands Treaty Fund.

Assessment of the external DSA
The path of the external debt remains flat at around 10 percent of GDP throughout the
projection period. This debt represents less than half of the total public debt. The debt ratio is
particularly sensitive to a non-interest current account shock, as the three major projects in
the non-renewable resource sector are undertaken through 2012, increasing the current
account deficit and the financing needs. Should the external current account balance be
weaker than assumed, the external debt would reach 33 percent at the end of the projection
period. On the other hand, a real depreciation shock of 30 percent would only raise the
external debt to 18 percent of GDP by 2014.

APPENDIX II. SUMMARY OF INFORMATIONAL ANNEXES
Discussions
The 2009 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Paramaribo during October 20–30. The
mission met with the Minister of Finance, Mr. Humphrey Hildenberg; the Governor of the Central
Bank of Suriname, Mr. André E. Telting; the Minister of Natural Resources, Mr. Gregory Rusland;
the Minister of Planning and Development Cooperation, Mr. Ricardo van Ravenswaay; the Minister
of Internal Affairs, Mr. Mauritz Hassankhan; the Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Kermechend
Raghoebarsing; senior staff of several government ministries and agencies; and representatives of the
private sector, labor, the diplomatic community, and the opposition. The staff team comprised Gamal
El-Masry (Head), Yi Wu, and Nazim Belhocine (all WHD). Ms. Anne Joseph (OED) joined most of
the policy meetings.
Fund Relations and Exchange Arrangements
The last Article IV consultation with Suriname was concluded on June 2, 2008 (IMF Country Report
No. 08/131). The country has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. Suriname
has a dual exchange rate regime, comprising an official and a commercial foreign exchange rate. The
official rate (SRD 2.745 per US$1) is used for official transactions such as debt service. The
commercial rate is used by commercial banks and cambios. The commercial SRD/US$ rate has been
very close to the official rate in recent years at the suasion of the CBvS. Suriname maintains two
multiple currency practices—one arising from the potential for the spread between the official and
the commercial rates to exceed two percent, and the other from the existence of a special rate for
imports of baby milk.
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and World Bank Group
The IADB is the largest multilateral lender operating in Suriname at this time. As of November 2009,
Suriname's outstanding debt to the IADB stood at US$69 million. The most recent IADB Country
Strategy with Suriname was approved in 2007 and covers the period 2006-10. The main thrust of the
IADB strategy has been to support policy and institutional reforms as the basis for promoting privatesector-led growth. In addition, this approach has been supported by an active technical cooperation
program.
World Bank involvement in Suriname has been limited. The last activity consisted of setting up an
investment promotion agency in October 2004.
Statistical Issues
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Although the quality
and timeliness of economic statistics has been improving in recent years, national accounts estimates
are published with very long lags, and there is still no breakdown of the national accounts from the
expenditure side. In addition, data on external services and private capital inflows are subject to
significant deficiencies. Due to capacity limitations, data on the country’s international investment
position are not available

Nonfinancial Relations with the Authorities

Exchange rate arrangements
The national currency is the Suriname dollar (SRD), which replaced the Suriname guilder in
January 2004 at a conversion rate of 1,000 guilders per SRD. Suriname has an official and a
commercial exchange rate. The official rate of SRD 2.745 per U.S. dollar is used for official
transactions such as debt service. The commercial rate is used by commercial banks and
cambios. The commercial SRD/US$ rate has remained very close to the official rate in recent
years at the suasion of the CBvS. Suriname maintains two multiple currency practices—one

ANNEX II: SURINAME: RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of November 30, 2009)
In 1980, Suriname joined the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), which at present is
its largest multilateral lender. As of November 2009, Suriname’s outstanding debt to the
IADB stood at US$69 million, mostly on Intermediate Fund Financing (IFF) terms.
The most recent IADB Country Strategy with Suriname (2006-10) was approved in 2007 and
highlighted three equally important pillars: development of the public sector; development of
the private sector; and integration of the interior. The first two pillars consolidate the thrust of
the former Country Strategy (2000-05) by continuing to target weaknesses in the policy and
institutional framework that constrain Suriname’s development and thereby promote privatesector-led growth. The third pillar focuses on integrating communities living in the interior of
Suriname more fully into national development and raising their living standards.
Structural reform projects
Public sector. Given the large size and importance of the public sector, in June 2004, the
IADB approved a US$5 million loan to Suriname to support the strengthening of public
sector management, which is considered a critical element of institutional reform in the
country. Technical Cooperation (TC) resources complement the loan by elaborating a road
map to help guide implementation of the public sector reform project.
Decentralization and strengthening local government. A second loan in this area was
approved in 2008 to assist certain districts with improving their self-management, including
financial and tax systems and management of capital investment. With the approval of a
district tax law, the program will support implementation of a simplified tax administration
system in certified districts. Committees will be created to engage citizens in the decisionmaking process as participants—a key factor for achieving greater transparency and
accountability in the districts. The program will also support the implementation of
community-based basic infrastructure investment projects and services.
Financial relations
The active loan portfolio consists of 10 operations, totaling US$132 million, a year-on-year
increase of 136 percent as two new operations were approved for a total amount of
US$76 million. The average age of the loans in the entire portfolio is 5.1 years. However,
when four operations (Decentralization of Local Government I, Low Income Shelters I,
Census and Community Development Fund) exit the portfolio at the end of 2009, the average
age will fall to 3.0 years, which is relatively young. The undisbursed portion of the loan
portfolio in execution, US$85 million, is entirely from the Ordinary Capital lending window
(non-concessional) with IFF subsidy.
The TC portfolio for Suriname (including the Multilateral Investment Fund) comprises
38 operations (US$13.5 million), of which 53 percent has been disbursed. The TC portfolio
grew by 9 percent since September 30, 2008, with approvals totaling US$1.2 million.

ANNEX III. SURINAME: STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provided to the Fund has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for
surveillance purposes.
National Accounts: Difficulties in data collection and long delays in the provision of source
data affect production approach GDP estimates. The lack of timely, reliable source data on
price indices for tourism services, transportation and communication also adversely affects
production-based GDP estimates.
GDP estimates by expenditure approach were compiled with the assistance of the CARTAC.
However, the expenditure breakdown of national accounts is still limited, and there is also no
reconciliation between the national accounts and the balance of payments, which combine to
preclude an accurate evaluation of the savings and investment balance.
Government finance statistics: The only public finance statistics available are those for the
central government. Estimates for revenue and expenditure components differ significantly
among the Ministry of Finance, the Treasury Department, the Central Bank, and the Central
Paymaster data, increasing the uncertainty about the fiscal position. Therefore, a substantial
amount of additional information on government finance statistics is needed to derive an
accurate and timely picture of the fiscal position from above the line.
The institutional coverage of fiscal statistics needs to be broadened to the nonfinancial public
sector so as to get a better indicator of fiscal risks associated with all public sector debt. The
actual number of public enterprises remains difficult to determine, and most of these
enterprises do not produce accounts on a timely basis. Available public debt statistics cover
only debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary and Financial statistics are broadly adequate
for surveillance, and more recently, timeliness has been improved to two weeks for the
central bank accounts and two months for the accounts of other depository corporations.
External sector: External sector statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance. Although
the data compilation of balance of payments statistics is good in general, there still remains
some shortcomings such as weak data collection, under coverage, misclassification, and
deviations from the balance of payments manuals. While trade data are relatively reliable,
data on services and private capital inflows suffer from poor compilation systems. Estimates
of the components of the financial account (especially private external debt) also need to be
improved.

7
II. Data Standards and Quality
Suriname participates in the GDDS.
No data ROSC is available.
III. Reporting to STA
Suriname does not report fiscal statistics for inclusion in either International Financial
Statistics, or Government Financial Statistics Yearbook.

January 28, 2010
Statement by the Staff Representative on Suriname
Executive Board Meeting
February 3, 2010
The following information was made available to staff after the staff report (SM/09/308) was
circulated to the Executive Board in late-December 2009. This information does not change
the thrust of the staff appraisal.
•
CPI data. Inflation ended the year 2009 lower than staff had projected, with the
12-month increase at 1.3 percent, and average inflation for the year at -0.1 percent. These
compare with projections in the staff report of 5.7 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively, as
staff had expected higher food and fuel prices in the last quarter.
•
Foreign reserves. Net international reserves stood at US$763 million at end-2009,
broadly in line with staff projections (US$778 million).
•
Monetary data. Data through November 2009 indicate that private sector credit
growth has continued to moderate to 16.1 percent, from 17 percent in September (y/y).
However, broad money growth picked up from 22 percent in September 2009 to 29 percent
in November (y/y).
•
CLICO Suriname. The Surinamese insurance company Self Reliance has acquired
the shares of CLICO Suriname’s general and life insurance companies. The Minister of
Finance has provided a general commitment that the government would provide financial
support to Self Reliance, if the need arises. The specifics of this commitment have not been
made available.
•
FISO-2. As of this week, the new wage structure has not yet been implemented. A
final decision on whether, or in what way, further wage reforms should be implemented now
rests with the President of the Republic.
•
Credit ratings. Standard and Poor’s has just issued a new ratings report, reaffirming
its foreign currency rating of B+ and local currency rating of BB-, both with positive
outlooks. S&P’s praised Suriname for its achievements in strengthening the country’s
institutions and improving macroeconomic fundamentals. It confirmed that Suriname fares
significantly better than peer countries with similar ratings on a number of indicators,
including GDP growth, public finances, and public debt. S&P’s noted that Suriname’s
foreign currency rating could be raised in the future, if the country’s economic policies
remain stable after the elections.

February 1, 2010

Statement by Mr. Nogueira Batista and Ms. Des Vignes on Suriname
Executive Board Meeting
February 3, 2010

On behalf of our Surinamese authorities, we thank staff for the quality of the dialogue
with the authorities and for the candid report.
Suriname’s economy has performed relatively well despite spill over effects from the
global financial and economic crisis. Following several years of robust economic
activity, the economy slowed in 2009 on account of falling commodity prices - oil
and alumina - and lower alumina output. GDP growth is estimated at 2.5 percent
(1.4 percent in per capita terms). At the same time, inflationary pressures eased
considerably, with the average CPI rate falling from 14.6 percent in 2008 to
-0.1 percent in 2009. This sharp deceleration was mainly due to the reversal in the
trend of rapidly rising international food and fuel prices, and to a lesser extent to
declining domestic demand as credit to the private sector moderated. Short-term
variations of the inflation rate are dominated by changes in food and fuel prices given
the large weight of these items in the CPI, as is usually the case in developing
countries. Inflation ended the year well below staff’s expectations. The staff report,
dated December 29, projected the end-of-year CPI inflation to reach 5.7 percent. One
month later, we learn that the end result was only 1.3 percent due to lower than
expected food and fuel prices. On the other hand, the external current account
weakened considerably reflecting lower volumes of alumina export and falling
international commodity prices. Despite the deterioration in the current account,
international reserves strengthened thanks to the SDR allocation. The fiscal balance
also registered a deficit partly because the authorities adopted an expansionary fiscal
policy. Total public debt remained, however, under 20 percent of GDP, and is mostly
domestic.
Prudent macroeconomic management and surpluses in the external and fiscal
accounts in previous years enabled Suriname to weather the international crisis.
Economic results up to 2008 were remarkable, as can be seen from the data provided
in the staff report. Suriname’s current account surpluses, for instance, reached
7.5 percent of GDP in 2006-2007 and 3.9 percent of GDP in 2008. International
reserves have increased continuously since 2005, in absolute terms and as a

-2-

proportion of imports. The international reserve coverage of the banking system (the
ratio of gross reserves plus bank holdings of liquid external assets to foreign currency
deposits at banks) rose sharply, from 87 percent in 2005 to 153 percent in 2009.
Moreover, Suriname maintains extensive capital controls to protect the economy from
the volatility of capital flows.
The fiscal accounts were also strong. The central government had overall surpluses
averaging almost 2 percent of GDP in 2006-2008. Public debt fell from more than
40 percent of GDP in 2003 to less than 18 percent in 2008. Suriname’s debt ratio is
one of the lowest in the region, as mentioned by staff. Furthermore, since a significant
share of the debt is in concessional terms, the government’s interest bill is modest,
around 1 percent of GDP.
These circumstances provided space for countercyclical fiscal policy in 2009. Staff
expects the fiscal gap to widen further in 2010 due to the erosion in revenue from the
bauxite industry and increased spending on goods and services. However, the deficit
should narrow over the medium term as fiscal consolidation measures are adopted.
Given the present challenging circumstances, the authorities have to decide how to
proceed with the second stage of the civil service wage reform. The President of the
Republic is now leading discussions on this issue. Further, the authorities have put on
hold plans to reduce the corporate tax.
Suriname continued to demonstrate commitment to debt sustainability with a debt
reduction policy aimed at creating opportunities for future development financing on
favourable terms. To safeguard against the growth in debt levels, the authorities have
ensured that most of the foreign loans contracted for large public investment projects
will continue to be on concessional terms with low interest payments obligations
going forward.
Arrears on public debt have declined substantially, from as much as 7.9 percent of
GDP in 2005 to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2009. Following the settlement of arrears to
Brazil of US$118 million (including a write-off of US$ 44 million) in August 2009,
the United States is now the only outstanding bilateral creditor to be settled. The
arrears with the United States will be eliminated once a decision can be reached with
respect to the treatment of the penalties. The Surinamese government would like the
United States to show the same flexibility that other creditors have shown. It is
willing to pay principal and interest in full, but has asked penalties to be waived, in
line with arrangements it has already reached with other creditors.

-3-

Over the medium term, Suriname will focus on growth and macroeconomic stability
while maintaining fiscal prudence. In spite of the risks, the growth outlook is
favourable given government initiatives to boost output in the mining and non-mining
sectors in the medium to long-term. To enhance the longevity of the bauxite industry,
the government has established its own mining company, Alumsur, and is considering
acquiring shares in the Paranam refinery. Further, the government plans to set up an
integrated bauxite industry in the western region of Suriname where significant
bauxite reserves have been found. In the oil industry, the state-owned oil company,
Staatsolie, has allocated approximately US$970 million towards increasing
exploration activity, expanding the refinery and augmenting the capacity of the power
plant over the period 2008 to 2012. Meanwhile, given the favourable international
price of gold, exploration activity has stepped up both in the formal and informal
sectors. Preliminary explorations by the gold mining company, Newmont, in the
eastern part of the country have yielded promising results.
Initiatives are also ongoing in agriculture, construction and tourism to boost output in
these areas. Tourism has been a source of some diversification of the economy. A
number of new hotels and facilities have been built in recent times, while a number of
other facilities are being completed. The eco-tourism facilities of Fuungu-Island have
been upgraded to international standards. In addition, the government continues to
invest in upgrading and expanding the physical infrastructure of the country in
support of its growth objectives.
The stance of monetary policy remained appropriate in 2009 and looking ahead the
authorities are prepared to tighten monetary policy as circumstances warrant. The
current exchange rate regime has served the country of Suriname well. The
authorities note the merit in Staff’s suggestion that the official and commercial
foreign exchange markets be unified but do not believe that now is the appropriate
time for this, particularly with elections due in May 2010, and prefer a more gradual
approach. It should be noted that the difference between the two rates has been small
in recent years. The other minor multiple currency practice arises from the existence
of a special rate for imports of baby milk.
Although there has been some weakening in asset quality and profitability, the
financial system remained adequately capitalized in 2009. Nonetheless, the undercapitalization of the two small state-owned banks remains a concern and the
authorities have indicated that steps will be taken to recapitalize them soon.
Dollarization is a source of weakness, but the share of foreign currency deposits and
loans is gradually declining. In recent years, in order to discourage lending in foreign

-4-

currency, reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits have been more than
twice as high as effective reserve requirements on national currency deposits.
Measures are also being taken to strengthen the supervision of the financial sector.
Currently, a draft Financial Institutions Act and Foreign Exchange Act are under
review, while an Act on Insurance Companies is being prepared. In addition, an
agreement has been reached between a local insurance company, The Self Reliance
Insurance Company, and CL International (Trinidad), allowing Self Reliance to
acquire the shares of CLICO Suriname. The government has expressed its willingness
to lend financial support to the Self Reliance Company if this becomes necessary. The
authorities have requested that a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) be
undertaken to assess the health of the financial sector in Suriname.
A number of structural reforms are in train. The government has earmarked a number
of public companies for restructuring and presently work is ongoing towards
privatization of the banana company and restructuring of the rice company. Technical
assistance from CARTAC has also been requested towards improving the efficacy
and administration of indirect taxes.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation
with Suriname
On February 3, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Suriname. 1
Background
After growing at an annual rate of 5−6 percent over the past two years, economic activity
weakened in 2009 in the context of lower alumina and oil prices and a sharp output decline in
the alumina sector. However, economic growth is estimated to have remained positive at
2.5 percent, supported by buoyant activity in the gold and construction sectors. Inflation has
fallen sharply, thanks to lower international food and fuel prices and softer domestic demand,
and is estimated to have averaged less than 1 percent during 2009. The external current
account balance deteriorated from a surplus of 4 percent of GDP in 2008 to a deficit of
2 percent of GDP in 2009. International reserves rose to over 5 months of imports at end-2009,
in part reflecting the SDR allocations of about US$125 million.
The fiscal balance is estimated to have shifted from a surplus of 2 percent of GDP in 2008 to a
deficit of 1.75 percent of GDP in 2009. Revenue has been holding rather well, with a decline in
tax revenue more than offset by exceptionally high profit transfers from the state-owned oil
company and the central bank. However, in 2009 expenditures rose substantially, particularly

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

noninterest current spending. Public debt has declined considerably in recent years and is
estimated at 19 percent of GDP at end-2009.
Reflecting in part higher government spending financed by the central bank, growth in reserve
and broad money supply has picked up in recent months. Given its limited exposure to the
international financial market, Suriname’s banking sector has weathered the global financial
crisis reasonably well. While the nonperforming loan ratio for the banking sector as a whole rose
moderately in 2009, most banks appear well capitalized. The dollarization of the banking sector
has been declining over the past few years, but remains high, with deposit and credit
dollarization ratios at end-September 2009 at 43 percent and 54 percent, respectively.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Suriname has weathered the global economic crisis relatively
well, with strong performance in the gold and construction sectors and international reserves
remaining at a comfortable level. Directors praised the authorities’ prudent macroeconomic
policies, which have helped reduce the level of public debt to among the lowest in the region,
while providing room to implement countercyclical policies during the global slowdown. Looking
ahead, Directors agreed that Suriname’s medium-term prospects are favorable, with large
alumina and gold projects expected to come on stream. The key challenge will be to sustain the
economic recovery and enhance the long-term growth potential, while ensuring continued
macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability.
Directors considered that the fiscal expansion in 2009 was appropriate to boost domestic
demand, but encouraged the authorities to avoid unsustainable increases in spending. Directors
recommended a more gradual implementation of the second phase of civil service reform, given
its potentially inflationary impact. They supported the authorities’ efforts to strengthen tax
administration, including through technical assistance from the Caribbean Regional Technical
Assistance Center (CARTAC). Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to postpone the
reduction in the corporate tax rate, as this would adversely affect tax collections. They
encouraged the authorities to continue working toward normalizing relations with all creditors.
Directors viewed the monetary policy stance as broadly appropriate. They cautioned that
monetary conditions might need to be tightened if fiscal spending were to threaten
macroeconomic stability. Over the medium term, Directors encouraged the authorities to
develop a secondary market for government securities and gradually move toward marketbased monetary policy tools.
Directors noted the staff’s assessment that the Suriname dollar may be slightly overvalued.
They encouraged the authorities to work toward gradually unifying the official and commercial
market exchange rates, and moving over time to a more flexible exchange rate regime.
Directors noted that Suriname’s banking sector remained generally well capitalized and
appeared to be resilient to the global financial crisis, with non-performing loan ratios rising only
moderately. They advised the authorities to strengthen the capital base of two small state-

3
owned banks. Directors welcomed the acquisition of CLICO-Suriname’s operations by a local
insurance company, and encouraged the authorities to facilitate their smooth integration into the
new parent company at a minimum cost to the budget. Directors supported Suriname’s request
to participate in an FSAP review.
Most Directors supported the authorities’ plans for more public participation in the mining sector,
noting that it would increase the share of revenue generated from the country’s natural
resources. At the same time, Directors encouraged the authorities to intensify their efforts to
improve the business environment and diversify the economy so as to promote greater privatesector led growth. They advised the authorities to continue financing public sector investment
through concessional external borrowing.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
