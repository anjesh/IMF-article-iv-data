Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with Mauritius
Approved by David Nellor and Adnan Mazarei
November 9, 2005
•

The 2005 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Port Louis during
September 1–14, 2005. The mission met with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister
of Finance and Economic Development, the Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, other
senior government officials, and representatives of the private sector and trade unions.

•

The staff team consisted of Mr. Schwidrowski (head), Mss. Schumacher and Barkbu
(EP), and Messrs. Hoveka and Yang (all AFR). Mr. Ismael (Senior Advisor,
Executive Director for Mauritius) also participated in the discussions.

•

The authorities have implemented a number of recommendations made in earlier
Article IV consultations, including steps to boost fiscal revenue and strengthen the
legal and regulatory framework for the operations of the Bank of Mauritius (BoM)
and the financial sector. That said, the considerable policy challenges posed by the
deterioration of Mauritius’s external environment related to the recent phasing out of
trade preferences will require the implementation of a broad agenda of structural
reforms and fiscal consolidation.

•

Mauritius accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 (a), 3, and 4, on
September 29, 1993, and its exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. Mauritius also maintains
a liberal capital account. It last used Fund resources in July 1986 and settled all its
repurchase obligations in May 1991. Since June 2002, Mauritius has been included as
a creditor in the IMF’s financial transaction plan.

•

Appendix I presents an assessment of public and external debt sustainability.
Mauritius’s relations with the IMF, including technical assistance, are summarized in
Appendix II, and its relations with the World Bank Group in Appendix III. The quality
and timeliness of Mauritius’s reporting of core data and other economic and financial
statistics are, in general, satisfactory for conducting surveillance. Statistical issues are
discussed in Appendix IV, and progress toward the Millennium Development Goals is
presented in Appendix V.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Adverse external developments are affecting the economy. The phasing out of
trade preferences for textiles and sugar and the recent surge in world oil prices have
led to a worsening of the external current account, some loss of reserves (albeit from
a comfortable level) and depreciation of the exchange rate, and a slowdown of
economic activity.

•

The fiscal outlook for 2005/06 (July–June) has also deteriorated, owing to lower
projected revenue collections (associated with lackluster activity) and the
widening deficit of a state-owned enterprise related to the suspension of
adjustments in retail petroleum prices to reflect import costs in early 2005.
Without corrective measures, the overall public sector deficit could widen to about
7 percent of GDP, compared with a sustainable level of about 3 percent of GDP.

•

The new government that took office in July 2005 recognizes the need for
fundamental reforms to boost competitiveness and ensure fiscal sustainability
over the medium term. Building on some first steps, it expects to develop a
comprehensive policy agenda over the next few months, including in difficult areas
such as labor market reforms.

•

The authorities agree on the need to tighten fiscal and monetary policies in the
short term in order to safeguard macroeconomic stability. They are aware that the
appropriate level of the exchange rate is key to regaining competitiveness and
protecting international reserves.

•

To address the short- and medium-term challenges, they have indicated interest
in a closer dialog with external partners, including the IMF. They have requested
staff to provide intensified policy advice and technical assistance, including on
measures to boost fiscal revenue and monetary operations.

I. RECENT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The economy has been increasingly affected by the phasing out of textile quotas
(Box 1) and, more recently, by higher prices for imports of petroleum products. Growth
has fallen during the past few years, reflecting a marked contraction of activities in the export
processing zone (EPZ), dominated by textile manufacturing, and unemployment has risen
(Figure 1). The surplus of the external current account has recently turned into a deficit,
owing to a decline in exports and a price-related surge in imports of petroleum products.
2.
The real effective exchange rate has depreciated, and net official foreign reserves
have dropped (although they remain at a relatively comfortable level), owing to the

Box 1. Mauritius: Impact of Elimination of Trade Preferences
The textile and clothing industry in Mauritius
benefited from the Multi-Fiber Agreement, which
restricted exports from countries with lower
production costs. Because of its higher labor cost,
Mauritius is expected to lose market share to more
competitive suppliers such as China and India, whose
textile exports were restricted by the quota system.
The EPZ sector has already started to feel the impact
of the quota phaseout. The EPZ sector, which grew on
average, by more than 6 percent a year during 1995–2000,
contracted by 18 percent during 2001–04. Following the
expiration of textile quotas at end-2004, EPZ exports fell
by 12 percent in the first quarter of 2005, compared with
the same quarter of 2004, and employment fell by
13 percent during the same period as enterprises shut
down. In comparison, most other major textile-exporting
African countries (Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, and
Swaziland) have suffered much smaller declines or just a
slowdown of textile exports.
The sugar sector will also experience difficulties
because of the planned reduction in EU sugar prices
in the European Union (EU). Mauritius’s sugar export
price to the EU (its main market) has been guaranteed at
more than three times world market levels for a given
quota during the past decade.1

3.
The 2004/05 (July–June) cash budget deficit of the central government was
maintained at 5 percent of GDP, as targeted, but a broader definition of the public
sector deficit shows a worsening overall situation. This is also worrisome as public sector
debt levels are already high. Specifically, the suspension of an automatic price adjustment
mechanism for petroleum products in early 2005 during the run-up to general elections,
coupled with rapidly rising import costs, resulted in an operational deficit of the State
Trading Company (STC) that amounted to 0.6 percent of GDP.1 In addition, a sizable amount
of government debt was converted from short-term obligations to longer-term debt (with
interest payable upon maturity), significantly reducing interest payments on a cash basis.2
Fully accounting for the STC deficit and for cash interest payments on an accrual basis
would have increased the overall fiscal balance to about 6½ percent of GDP.
4.
Prior to the July 2005 elections, the outgoing government approved a budget for
2005/06 that was based on an optimistic growth outlook. It envisaged a cash deficit of the
central government of just below 5 percent of GDP and began to implement wide-ranging
reductions of import duties on consumer goods. Plans were announced to eliminate all import
duties over the next few years.
5.
The opposition Social Alliance coalition won the elections with a clear majority.
In light of the adverse external developments, it had stressed the need to identify new sources
of growth, mitigate the social impact of the economy’s needed transformation, and reduce
unemployment, including through the promotion of small and medium enterprises and a
focus on attracting foreign direct investment.

1

A mechanism to adjust retail prices in line with import prices on a quarterly basis was
introduced in April 2004. The STC holds a monopoly for imports and sales of key
commodities, including petroleum products, flour, and rice. The STC covers its financing
needs through domestic commercial loans, which are subsequently offset through budgetary
transfers. The second large public enterprise, the Central Electricity Board, has, at present, a
satisfactory financial position, which is attributable partly to increases in electricity charges
in 2004.
2

The conversion of short-term to three-year treasury paper reduces cash interest payments by
about 1 percent of GDP a year during 2004/05–2006/07 but leads to an increase of cash
interest payments of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2007/08.

II. REPORT ON POLICY DISCUSSIONS
7.
The policy discussions focused on the short- and medium-term risks to sustained
growth posed by the phasing out of trade preferences for textiles and sugar. They also
covered the recent surge of world oil prices. To maintain high growth rates and to reverse the
recent rise in unemployment, the authorities recognized the need for comprehensive
structural reforms to diversify the economy and enhance competitiveness. Macroeconomic
stability would also need to be safeguarded to help preserve social cohesion and create a
favorable investment climate.
A. Medium-Term Outlook and Challenges
8.
The new authorities are hopeful that, with appropriate macroeconomic and
structural policies, a number of sectors could significantly increase their contribution to
growth over the next few years. They recognize the need to attract significant foreign direct
investment to these activities; to this end, they are taking steps to improve the overall
business climate by streamlining business permits and the current investment incentives
scheme. These sectors are tourism, financial services, information and communications
technology (ICT), and products and services related to fishing activities (Box 2).
Box 2. Mauritius: Sources of Growth
In light of the decline in textile and sugar activities, a number of industries with significant growth
potential have been identified which could enable Mauritius to resume a pattern of high and job-creating
growth in the medium term.
•

Tourism: In the short term, the authorities expect to increase overall hotel occupancy by
admitting additional airlines during the high season and tapping into new markets, including in
the region, during the low season. In the medium term, they expect benefits from adding
conference and shopping activities to the traditional holiday tourism concept. The sector may
create significant job opportunities, including for lower-skilled workers.

•

Financial services: Efforts are under way to negotiate bilateral tax agreements with emerging
economies in Africa and Asia to enhance the attractiveness of offshore activities. Focused training
efforts are needed to meet the sector’s human resource requirements.

•

Information and communication technology: While still limited in its contribution to GDP, the
sector is developing rapidly, focusing on business process outsourcing, software development,
and call centers that benefit from Mauritius’s ethnic and linguistic diversity. The sector is not
expected to provide significant employment opportunities but will likely boost the economy’s
overall productivity.

•

Seafood hub: Efforts are under way to develop Mauritius into a regional platform for the storage,
processing, and distribution of seafood and to offer repairs and maintenance services to fishing
boats. The employment effects are potentially significant.

- 10 -

9.
In welcoming these initiatives, the staff stressed the need to take early and
decisive action, particularly in structural reforms, so as to remove impediments to
growth and boost overall competitiveness. Such efforts need to be underpinned by
macroeconomic policies geared toward maintaining stability and moving toward a
sustainable fiscal position. In the structural area, measures are required to increase labor
market flexibility so as to facilitate the movement of workers currently hampered by
cumbersome firing rules. Such efforts should be accompanied by well-targeted training
programs for the largely unskilled jobless and school graduates to create the competencies
needed in the expanding sectors. The authorities should also explore the extent to which the
current centralized wage-setting mechanism (with its focus on using inflation as a floor for
wage increases) is compatible with allowing wage adjustments to reflect productivity
changes at the plant level (see below). The withdrawal of the public sector from commercial
activities over the medium term could also provide opportunities for growth and job creation.
10.
In the fiscal area, the staff pointed out that there is ample room to reduce the
fiscal deficit through steps to boost the revenue base and curb expenditures,
particularly on transfers and subsidies. In this regard, particular attention needs to be paid
to ensuring full cost recovery by public enterprises that are providing public utilities or
commercializing certain commodities (such as petroleum products), so as to avoid indirect
budgetary pressures.
11.
The authorities recognized the need to develop a comprehensive policy agenda
early on in order to bolster investor confidence. They agreed that the stakeholders needed
to examine thoroughly the key elements of the reform agenda. They were confident that
concrete steps in the main areas would be identified in early 2006 to guide the preparation of
the 2006/07 budget.
12.
To illustrate the benefits of early and decisive reforms, two medium-term
scenarios were discussed. Under the “baseline” scenario, with the existing policy agenda,
real GDP growth would remain at about 3 percent, insufficient to create significant
employment opportunities. A slow recovery of exports would be unable to reverse the current
account deficit and the associated loss of reserves. The fiscal deficit would worsen over time,
and public sector debt would become unsustainable.
13.
The “strong reform scenario” assumes that the fiscal deficit is gradually reduced
to sustainable levels, creating, in conjunction with early labor market reform, renewed
momentum for private sector activity. Real GDP growth would return to about 5 percent
following the period of adjustment to the reduction of trade preferences. The current account
would recover over time from the deterioration of the terms of trade, driven mainly by
strengthening exports, following a modest real depreciation of the currency.

In the strong reform scenario, fiscal adjustment would be achieved as follows.
Revenue would stabilize at about 20 percent of GDP, as the already announced gradual
elimination of import tariffs is offset by a broadening of the base for income and
consumption taxes (see
Central Government Finances under the Strong Reform Scenario
(In percent of GDP)
below), and the
implementation of a modern

Box 3. Mauritius: Fiscal Sustainability
Mauritius’s domestic public debt has increased rapidly over the past decade, raising concerns about debt
sustainability in the medium term. The debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 72 percent at the end of June 2005, up
from 55 percent in 1995, reflecting persistent budget deficits over the period 1996-2005 (averaging about
5 percent of GDP a year).
Mauritius’s public debt will
continue to rise unless significant
steps toward fiscal consolidation
are implemented. The planned cuts
on import tariffs without corrective
measures would reduce government
revenue by about 2 percent of GDP
over the medium term, while overall
spending would increase, partly
owing to an expected increase in
interest payments from about
4 percent currently to about
7 percent of GDP by the end of the
decade. The resulting widening of
the budget deficit would push the
debt-to-GDP ratio to over
80 percent, threatening to
macroeconomic stability and private
sector development.

To return public debt to a more sustainable path, the central government would have to reduce its overall
budget deficit gradually to about 3 percent of GDP through a combination of revenue-enhancing and
expenditure-reducing measures. Under this assumption, the debt-to-GDP ratio would be reduced to about
60 percent by the end of the decade, keeping public debt on a sustainable path under virtually all standard stress
tests (see Appendix I). However, should growth not pick up as envisaged, debt levels would remain virtually
unchanged—if growth were 1½ percentage points lower than projected, the debt-to-GDP ratio would not fall
significantly below 70 percent of GDP, stressing the need for further fiscal consolidation.

B. Fiscal Issues
15.
Regarding the 2005/06 budget, the authorities were concerned that less buoyant
economic activity would lower revenue collections below original projections. They also
recognized that the emergence of a sizable and widening deficit of the STC, while not
directly affecting the central government balance, would jeopardize Mauritius’s overall fiscal
position.
16.
They proposed to offset the shortfall in revenue collections by reducing capital
outlays while carrying out a broader review of their medium-term spending needs and
priorities. On the STC deficit, they recognized the need to adjust to petroleum retail prices
periodically; owing to the mechanism’s suspension for about six months in 2005, they
considered that the initial retail price adjustments would need to be substantial.

- 13 -

17.
The staff encouraged the authorities to move on both fronts without delay. On
the quarterly automatic adjustment of petroleum prices, it recommended that they consider
more frequent adjustments or adopt a formula using a moving average of import prices, so as
to smooth the impact of price adjustments.
18.
The staff also recommended using the review of the 2005/06 budget to take the
first steps toward fiscal sustainability. While the authorities recognized the need to begin
moving toward a sustainable fiscal deficit, they stressed that they needed time to define a
comprehensive strategy. They expect to have a medium-term plan in place by early 2006,
when preparations for the 2006/07 budget begin.
19.
Overall, the authorities agreed that they had significant scope to reduce the
fiscal deficit by broadening the revenue base and streamlining outlays for transfers and
subsidies. The staff advised the authorities on concrete steps (already identified by FAD
technical assistance) to strengthen tax administration, and urged them to conduct a thorough
review of current transfers and subsidies, with a view to better targeting individuals with
identified needs and realizing budgetary savings (Box 4). The staff also recommended
improving debt management, including through a further diversification of debt instruments
so as to tailor them better to investors’ needs; this step could result in some budgetary
savings. The authorities agreed to explore all proposals.
20.
The authorities also reported that they intended to review efforts to implement a
medium-term expenditure framework. Earlier efforts to develop medium-term spending
plans had lost momentum, and only limited progress has been made in some ministries (such
as education). The staff welcomed this initiative, emphasizing that it would help to prioritize
outlays in a coherent manner, and encouraged the authorities to seek technical assistance in
this area (including from the World Bank).
21.
The staff encouraged the authorities to review the current pension system.
Although not an immediate issue, Mauritius’s aging population could lead to a significant
rise of fiscal liabilities over the medium term. The authorities noted that they were already
examining various reform options, with assistance from the World Bank.

- 14 -

Box 4. Mauritius: Fiscal Measures to Ensure Sustainability
There is ample scope to reduce the fiscal deficit to sustainable levels through steps to broaden the tax
base and streamline expenditure. The authorities should consider the following concrete actions.
Broadening the revenue base
•

Reduce the value-added tax threshold to annual sales of MUR 2 million

•

Lower the threshold for large tax-payers to an annual turnover of MUR 100 million

•

Streamline current income tax breaks and credits

•

Update taxpayer register and enforce filing by all registered taxpayers

•

Introduce advance tax payments for all businesses

•

Establish the Mauritius Revenue Authority in line with international best practices; strengthen
the audit function and clear accountability of all services to its Director General make its
Director General accountable for all services

Streamlining expenditure
•

Strengthen the financial health of public enterprises to reduce their reliance on budgetary
transfers

•

Review a large number of untargeted subsidies and transfers and limit budgetary support to
well-defined low-income or other needy segments of the population

C. Exchange Rate, Money, and Banking Issues
22.
The BoM agreed that the exchange rate needed to play a central role in
facilitating the country’s adjustment to a less favorable external environment. Although
not ruling out the need for intermittent intervention—given the openness of capital markets—
to smooth possible excessive short-term pressures on the rupee, they concurred with the
staff’s advice to allow the exchange rate to move to a level that was in line with the country’s
deteriorated external environment and to shield foreign reserves. This would help bolster the
economy’s competitiveness (Box 5).
23.
In light of the ample liquidity situation, the staff recommended tightening
monetary conditions so as to help reduce inflationary pressures (Box 6). This would also
help to increase the effectiveness of monetary policy (see below). In concurring with this
recommendation, the authorities noted that fiscal adjustment would be required to make
sufficient credit available to the private sector.

- 15 -

Box 5. Mauritius: The Real Effective Exchange Rate and
Preferential Trade Arrangements
Despite rising unit labor costs and other input prices over the past 25 years, textile and clothing and sugar
producers have remained competitive because of preferential trade arrangements. Global textile quotas
favored Mauritius and kept textile prices high, and sugar trade arrangements with the EU and the United
States guaranteed high sugar export prices. These implicit subsidies on Mauritius’s export prices have
positively affected the terms of trade and the external account balance.
Against the background of this favorable

study compared the real effective

exchange rate that is consistent with the
long-run trends of the domestic and
130
external balances with the observed real
effective exchange rate.1 The study
120
reveals that the actual exchange rate has
been close to its equilibrium value,
110
indicating the appropriateness of
exchange rate policies given the

fundamentals. This said, the study shows
that domestic factors, particularly

persistent fiscal deficits and rising labor
costs, necessitated a depreciation of the real effective exchange rate over time.

Actual
Equilibrium

2000

2005

The end of the preferential trade agreements has a permanent, adverse effect on Mauritius’s terms of trade.
The restoration of external balance would require a depreciation of the real effective exchange rate. If the
exchange rate is not allowed to depreciate sufficiently, the country’s external and savings-investment
balances will deteriorate. Reforms implemented to bolster competitiveness would reduce the required extent
of the exchange rate’s depreciation.
1

See the companion Selected Issues paper for a detailed analysis of Mauritius’s real effective exchange rate.

Box 6. Mauritius: Determinants of Inflation
A study examined data between 1977 and 2004 to identify the key domestic and external determinants of
inflation.1 It found that changes in broad money had a strong impact on inflation, whenever supply exceeded
money demand (the latter has grown strongly during the period under consideration, largely reflecting rapid
financial deepening). By contrast, and in line with earlier findings by the BoM, the pass-through of exchange
rate changes to domestic prices was found to be limited.
The results confirm the need to keep the increase of the money supply in line with changes in demand to
avoid inflationary pressures. Regarding the limited impact of the exchange rate, the result may underestimate
the current pass-through because domestic price controls were more common in the past. This said, the
remaining administered prices only delay the needed adjustments.
1

See the companion Selected Issues paper for a more comprehensive analysis.

- 16 -

24.
Accordingly, the staff encouraged the authorities to manage liquidity more
actively. Noting the authorities’ concern that the BoM had so far relied on its own securities
for its open market operations, which entailed significant costs to the BoM, the staff stressed
that the use of these instruments was indispensable as long as alternatives had not been fully
developed and accepted by the market. It also noted that the BoM’s financial position had so
far not been jeopardized by the use of these instruments.3 The authorities are looking forward
to IMF technical assistance to diversify their range of instruments.
25.
More active liquidity management would also strengthen the BoM’s efforts to
use interest rates to signal the desired stance of its monetary policy. At present, the BoM
uses the Lombard rate for signaling purposes, but it has been unable to influence other key
market interest rates. The staff suggested that the BoM move toward short-term rates as the
operational target while underpinning its signaling through interest rates by managing
liquidity more actively. The authorities concurred with the thrust of this recommendation.
26.
The authorities are monitoring closely the effects of the deteriorating external
environment on the financial sector. The exposure of Mauritian banks to the textile and
sugar sectors has declined steadily over the past few years, to around 14 percent of bank
loans. Provisioning requirements have been strengthened, resulting in a reduction of the ratio
of nonperforming loans to capital and reserves. The authorities expect that possible further
provisioning needs would be met from profits (which are comfortable), without affecting
capital.4 Nevertheless, the BoM is considering heightened collateral requirements for new
lending, and is closely monitoring a comprehensive set of financial indicators.
27.
Regarding the potential effect of an exchange rate depreciation on the banking
system, the staff agreed that the small net open position in foreign exchange suggests a
limited degree of vulnerability.5 That said, the authorities were encouraged to begin
collecting information on corporate debt-to-equity ratios and the currency composition of
corporate debt, so as to assess the indirect credit risk that could arise from the credit
worthiness of firms borrowing in foreign currency.
28.
Overall, the financial system is liquid and well-capitalized. The authorities have
recently begun to publish key financial soundness indicators on a consolidated basis.
29.
The monetary authorities indicated that they did not intend to adopt a formal
inflation-targeting scheme until they had addressed institutional issues, external
conditions had improved, and fiscal consolidation was well under way. They welcomed
the forthcoming technical assistance from MFD to help them meet the preconditions for such

a step, including inflation forecasting and modeling capabilities, more effective monetary
policy instruments, and sufficiently deep and diversified capital markets.
30.
The BoM has made progress in implementing the Banking Act and the BoM Act
(both approved in 2004). Both Acts reflect recommendations by the FSAP conducted in
2002 and subsequent technical assistance. Specifically, the autonomy of the central bank was
strengthened; rules for an orderly resolution of failed banks were introduced; and provisions
were made to enable the BoM to apply sanctions against cases of noncompliance with
AML/CFT (anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism) regulations.6
The new banking regulations include guidance on credit classification for provisioning, credit
concentration limits, credit risk management, and related-party transactions. The authorities
intend to establish a deposit insurance.
31.
Regarding offshore financial activities, the authorities have moved toward a
single license for domestic and offshore banks and intend to harmonize the tax
treatment of both activities shortly. The unified treatment of all banking activities is
expected to enhance the overall attractiveness of Mauritius’s financial system.
D. Structural Issues
32.
Discussions focused on labor market issues and the role of the public sector in
commercial activities, with an emphasis on their role in fostering economic growth. The
outlook for the textile and sugar sectors and the authorities’ plans to restructure them were
also reviewed.
33.
On labor market issues, the need to increase labor flexibility and the effects of
the centralized wage-bargaining system on labor costs were reviewed. The authorities
concurred with the staff’s view that labor flexibility would facilitate the deployment of
workers from declining to expanding sectors. In that regard, the staff urged the authorities to
carefully review current hiring and firing rules. In recognizing the need for such a review, the
authorities stressed that more flexible rules had already been applied to the EPZ and that
similar arrangements were envisaged for the ICT sector.
34.
Regarding the centralized wage-settlement mechanism, the authorities
emphasized that it was geared toward offsetting some loss of purchasing power, while
additional decentralized negotiations would allow wages to better reflect sectoral
differences in productivity. The World Bank is analyzing the impact of the wage-settlement
mechanism on labor costs in the whole economy and at the sectoral level. The staff
encouraged the authorities to quickly advance the policy actions in this area, taking into
account the rising trend of labor costs over the past few years, as well as private sector
6

BoM regulations require all banks to apply the higher of the home or the host country’s
AML/CFT requirements.

- 18 -

concerns about the impact of the current wage-settlement arrangements on employment and
investment.
35.
The staff agreed with the authorities that the current unemployment benefit
system did not discourage job searches because there were no recurrent unemployment
benefits. The current system consists largely of lump-sum payments to individuals when
their job terminates; the payments increase with the years of employment, but the amounts
are not large enough to discourage the unemployed from searching new jobs. The authorities
underscored that overall benefits were insufficient to sustain extended periods of
unemployment.
36.
The role of the public sector in commercial activities was also discussed. The
authorities explained that the country’s small market size and lack of competition in certain
activities called for the involvement of public enterprises to ensure a steady supply of key
commodities at a reasonable cost. The staff encouraged them to consider measures that could
attract additional private sector interest in these areas, with a view to strengthening growth
and investment. Generally, the authorities agreed that the financial soundness of public
enterprises needed to be monitored carefully so as to avoid costs to the budget.
37.
On textile and sugar activities, the authorities explained their restructuring
plans and accompanying measures aimed at mitigating the impact of the phasing out of
trade preferences. On textiles, they were encouraging firms to cooperate in business
planning, market development, and financial restructuring to strengthen their operations;
some had already succeeded in moving to higher-quality products and had secured long-term
contracts with international high-end retailers. In the context of bilateral trade negotiations
with a number of emerging markets, the authorities were seeking access for Mauritian textile
products to certain high-quality segments of these markets.
38.
Efforts are also under way to restructure the sugar sector. The authorities have
encouraged firms to move toward the production of goods with higher value added (such as
refined sugar) and to explore fully the scope for side products that could be used for energy
generation (such as ethanol).7 To reduce costs, the authorities intend to implement a program
to combine plantations into larger, more efficient units and to support investment in
irrigation. They were also hopeful that negotiations with the EU could result in more gradual
price reductions and some financial support for their restructuring efforts.
39.
The staff recognized the need for a sectoral strategy that would take into account
the potential loss of employment and livelihoods for a large number of smallholder
households. However, the staff urged the authorities to use great care in designing sectoral
7

Mauritius’s electricity needs.

- 19 -

measures to avoid creating any disincentives for existing sugar activities. In the current
difficult fiscal situation, the authorities need to minimize their recourse to fiscal incentives.
E. External Sector Issues
40.
The authorities have begun to phase out all import tariffs to bolster external
competitiveness. Furthermore, they have embarked on bilateral trade negotiations with
major Asian economies (India, Pakistan) to secure market access for their textile sector. They
are aware of the need to coordinate these steps with the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) to
avoid conflicts with regional trade arrangements. There have been no other changes to
Mauritius’s trade and exchange system since the last Article IV consultation.
41.
Mauritius is not very vulnerable to shocks to its external debt-servicing capacity
because its external public debt is low (14½ percent of GDP). Nonetheless, the authorities
were encouraged to strengthen their collection of detailed data on private external debt so as
to make future vulnerability assessments more comprehensive.
42.
Despite the deterioration of Mauritius’s external environment, largely as a result
of the erosion of trade preferences, the authorities saw no need to consider financial
support from the Fund, including under the IMF’s Trade Integration Mechanism
(TIM), at this stage. They pointed at the comfortable reserve level, equivalent to 6 months
of imports, and expressed their confidence that a strong reform package would prevent a
further significant worsening of their external and reserve positions. However, they asked for
closer IMF involvement in designing and implementing reform measures.
F. Statistical Issues
43.
Mauritius’s data availability is adequate for surveillance purposes. Recent
discrepancies between monetary and fiscal statistics and the emergence of significant errors
and omissions in the balance of payments data has been addressed. The authorities have also
begun to publish quarterly national accounts data. On the staff’s suggestion to move the
fiscal accounts to an accrual basis, they considered that further technical work was needed,
particularly on the valuation of public sector assets and liabilities. Regarding external debt
data, the authorities should explore discrepancies between official and external data (which
indicate that the total stock of external debt could be higher than officially recorded).
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
44.
Economic conditions in Mauritius and its outlook have deteriorated markedly
since the last Article IV consultation as a result of adverse external developments. The
effects of the phasing out of trade preferences for textiles and sugar and the recent surge in
world oil prices pose significant policy challenges in the short and medium term. Economic
management is further complicated by the country’s high domestic public debt, which
severely limits the scope for using fiscal policy to reenergize the economy.

- 20 -

45.
The new government’s recognition of the need for fundamental reforms to boost
competitiveness and ensure fiscal sustainability is welcome. A comprehensive policy
response, combining appropriate macroeconomic and structural reforms, will be required. It
would also help to restore investor confidence early on. As the authorities recognize, they
need to redouble their efforts to attract foreign direct investment to the sectors that could help
rekindle growth and job creation.
46.
A more flexible labor market will be key to facilitating the transition of workers
from declining sectors to growing ones. Hiring and firing rules for the entire economy need
to be adjusted to the more flexible standards applied to some sectors, and the impact of the
current centralized wage-settlement mechanism on labor cost and competitiveness must be
examined without delay. These efforts need to be underpinned by well-targeted training
programs so as to provide growing sectors with skilled workers.
47.
A medium-term fiscal strategy needs to be formulated as soon as possible to
move the public sector deficit toward sustainable levels. The authorities are encouraged to
follow through with their plan to gradually phase out all import tariffs, also to bolster
competitiveness, but need to implement measures to offset the associated revenue loss. There
is ample scope to broaden the tax base and streamline expenditure while protecting the needs
of disadvantaged groups more effectively through well-targeted transfers and subsidies. The
financial soundness of public enterprises needs to be monitored carefully to avoid any cost to
the budget.
48.
Immediate measures need to be put in place to avoid a further deterioration of
Mauritius’s overall fiscal position in 2005/06. The authorities need to reinstate the
automatic price adjustment mechanism for domestic retail prices of petroleum products
without delay and should begin implementing revenue-enhancing measures that have already
been identified. The schemes to support the textile and sugar sectors that are under
consideration should not lead to additional budgetary outlays.
49.
Over the short term, monetary and exchange rate policies will play a crucial role
in supporting external competitiveness while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The
exchange rate needs to be allowed to move to a level commensurate with the worsened
external environment and to protect international reserves. In parallel, liquidity conditions
should be tightened to keep inflation low.
50.
The risks to the banking sector from the deteriorating external environment
require constant monitoring. While the authorities have stepped up efforts in this area,
further actions, including the collection and monitoring of corporate debt information, are
required.
51.
The staff agrees that the current conditions are not favorable for moving to a
formal inflation-targeting regime. Before such a step should be seriously considered,
monetary policy instruments have to be sharpened, the external environment needs to
become more predictable, and fiscal consolidation should be advanced. Meanwhile, the

- 21 -

authorities are encouraged to work with forthcoming technical assistance from the IMF to
meet the technical preconditions for such a step.
52.
The staff stands ready to support the authorities’ reform efforts through
stepped-up policy and technical advice, including, as requested, in formulating of the
macroeconomic framework and budget for 2006/07.
53.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard
deviation shocks. Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables
in the baseline and scenario being presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also
shown.
2/ Permanent one-fourth standard deviation shocks are applied to real interest rate, growth rate,
and current account balance.
3/ Onetime real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2006/07.

IX. Exchange Rate Arrangement
The currency of Mauritius is the Mauritian rupee, and the exchange rate regime is a managed
float with no preannounced path for the exchange rate. The exchange rate is currently
determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The exchange arrangement is free of
multiple currency practices and restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions. Mauritius also maintains a liberal capital account. On
September 22, 2005, the US$1 was equivalent to MUR 28.88.
X. Article IV Consultation
Mauritius is on the standard 12-month cycle. The last Article IV consultation discussions
were held during March 19–April 1, 2004. The staff report (Country Report No. 05/281,

APPENDIX III

World Bank Group
(As of September 22, 2005)
The Bank Group strategy and lending operations
1.
A member of the World Bank since its independence in 1968, Mauritius is a
development success story. In 1968, the country was poor, with a nominal per capita income
of about US$260. Today, nominal income per capita is US$5,100. The country graduated
from the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's soft-lending arm
for the poorest countries), in FY1975, and the last IDA credit was made in July 1974. In
the 1980s, the World Bank supported macroeconomic and sectoral policy reforms through
quick-disbursing loans. After the success of the structural adjustment effort, the country
turned to more traditional project lending.
2.
The World Bank's role in Mauritius is evolving, reflecting the country's past success
in gaining access to capital markets. Because of its relatively high income, Mauritius is one
of only a few African countries eligible for International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development loans (most African countries borrow from the IDA). The World Bank
currently has one active project totaling $12.4 million in the environment sewerage and
sanitation sectors, of which $7.6 million was disbursed as of August 29, 2005.
3.
The Bank also supports the government of Mauritius through analytical and advisory
assistance. The Bank has carried out a country procurement assessment review, a public
expenditure review to assess the sustainability of the new economic agenda, a transport
action plan, and a report on modernizing the pension system. The Bank has also been
supporting the government with a medium-term economic framework (MTEF), and a labor
market study. An investment climate assessment and country economic memorandum are
under way.
4.
The World Bank’s last country assistance strategy (CAS) from May 7, 2002,
supported the government’s five-year Economic Agenda for the New Millennium (NEA),
with policy advice and direct budget assistance, around the three objectives of (i) increasing
Mauritius’s competitiveness; (ii) bringing about deeper social development and social
cohesion; and (iii) preserving and protecting Mauritius’s fragile environment. A new Bank
strategy for Mauritius is under preparation.
5.
The International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) main focus for future activity in
Mauritius is support for financial market deepening and development and advisory work and
investments in private infrastructure. IFC is also actively seeking projects with Mauritian
sponsors investing elsewhere in Africa. In 2003, IFC began an advisory mandate for
structuring private participation in the water and sewer utility, but this project is currently on
hold, awaiting a decision from the Mauritian government. IFC has committed no new
investments since 1996; the portfolio has steadily decreased as investments have been repaid
and/or exited and now consists of two equity positions for a total of US$1 million. IFC is
currently discussing the provision of a US$75 million line of credit to a local bank. It is also

- 43 -

APPENDIX III

exploring ways and means to provide technical assistance support to the textile industry,
following the end of the Multi-Fiber Agreement.
6.
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has been actively supporting
Mauritian investors venturing abroad, particularly into sub-Saharan Africa. The agency is
working to further strengthen relations with the local business community, creating synergies
that will continue to support development into the Southern African Development
Community region and other regions of Africa. For the second year running, the Board of
Investment (BOI) office has supported and facilitated MIGA’s missions to Mauritius. These
missions have firmly put MIGA as a value adding institution to cross-border investors to and
from Mauritius. The BOI office has helped to identify more than 30 investors with the
potential to use MIGA services. Mauritian investors have benefited substantially in recent
years from MIGA guarantees for their investments in continental Africa and elsewhere, with
total gross exposure currently at US$53.1 million, and net exposure at US$48.1 million, for
projects in Burundi, Mozambique, and Pakistan.
7.
Mauritius is not an active participant in World Bank Institute programs, but
discussions are under way to help position the country as a global knowledge hub.
IMF-World Bank collaboration in specific areas
8.
Overall, the staffs of the IMF and the World Bank maintain a collaborative
relationship in supporting sound budgetary and fiscal management. The World Bank is
supporting the government’s MTEF, has prepared a public expenditure review, and has
provided just-in-time advice on a budget framework paper to lead the 04/05 budget cycle,
which feeds into the IMF’s work on budgetary management and macroeconomic policy.
Cooperation is also taking place on financial sector reforms and trade and labor market issues
(the World Bank completed a Trade Mauritius Membership in SADC Note in FY04 and is
undertaking a labor market review).
Areas in which the World Bank leads
9.
World Bank support is demand driven. Areas where it has taken the lead are related to
specific sector advice, such as the environment, sewerage and sanitation, education and
training, social welfare, pensions, the transport sector, MTEF, health, insurance,
procurement, restructuring the EPZ sector, and privatization, as well as through a number of
analytical studies as described above, including an ongoing investment climate assessment.
Areas in which the IMF leads
10.
Areas where the IMF takes the lead role relate to policy advice and reforms with
respect to (i) overall economic policy advice and targets for macroeconomic targets (ii) tax
policy and administration (iii) budgetary accounting (iv) treasury procedures (v) public sector
wage policy and (vi) monetary management and exchange rate policy. The Bank team

- 44 -

actively participates in discussions between the IMF and the government in these areas,
however, especially with respect to the setting of overall macroeconomic targets.

APPENDIX IV

Mauritius: Statistical Issues
The quality and timeliness of Mauritius’s reporting of core data, as well as of other economic
and financial statistics to the IMF is, in general, satisfactory for conducting surveillance.
Efforts are under way to improve the frequency and quality of fiscal data, particularly their
consistency with monetary sector data. The authorities already publish economic data for
Mauritius, including a monthly bulletin published by the Bank of Mauritius (BoM) and a
number of statistics reports published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), which are
accessible on the Internet. Mauritius started participating in the IMF’s General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) in September 2000. Metadata updates were received in
September 2005 and are currently being reviewed by IMF staff. The authorities have shown
interest in subscribing to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), but
improvements in the periodicity and timeliness of several data series are required before
subscription can take place.
Real sector
Mauritius’s annual national accounts are based on the concepts and definitions recommended
by the System of National Accounts 1993. National accounts data are prepared by the CSO on
a calendar-year basis and cover all transactions categories except financial transactions.
Estimating GDP on the basis of production uses the ratios from the Census of Economic
Activities (CEA), which are compiled every five years. Following the 2002 CEA, a major
revision of the national accounts was undertaken and completed in September 2005. Most
government operations and external transactions other than goods are recorded on a cash
basis rather than on an accrual basis. GDP estimates on the basis of expenditure are not
derived independently because household final consumption expenditure is determined as a
residual. Although the household budget survey, complied every five years, generates an
independent estimate, this estimate is considerably lower than the one resulting from the
commodity-flow approach. GDP volume change is published as real growth rates over the
previous year. Following IMF technical assistance in 1999 and 2000, the CSO started to
compile national accounts on a quarterly basis from 1999, and publication started in
August 2005. Improvements in the timeliness and quality of domestic production indicators
are still needed.
The consumer price index is regularly rebased as consumption patterns and relative prices
change. In July 2002, a new series of the consumer price index was introduced (July 2001June 2002=100), with weights derived from the 2001/02 household budget survey that
followed the Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose to classify
goods and services. Producer price indices of agriculture and manufacturing, input costs of
construction, the wage rate, and employment have been developed, but are not reported to the
IMF for publication in its International Financial Statistics (IFS).

- 46 -

APPENDIX IV

Government finance
Mauritius continues to be a regular and timely reporter of fiscal data for surveillance,
including quarterly data and annual projections. The July 2001 mission to collect data for the
ROSC highlighted statistical improvements needed in the fiscal data, especially to reduce
duplication in data collection, publish quarterly central government data, and improve the
timeliness of consolidated government data. The data for surveillance purposes would be
enhanced significantly if they contained information on the overall public accounts, in
particular off-budget accounts should be included in general government accounts and the
scope of reporting could be improved to include nonfinancial public sector corporations in
data on the nonfinancial public sector. Follow-up technical assistance was provided in
January 2002 to assist the authorities with the compilation of nonfinancial public sector data.
The authorities reported data for the consolidated central government for publication in the
IMF’s Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook. Starting with data for fiscal year
ending in June 2002, the authorities also report data for the consolidated general government
sector. Although, the authorities produce quarterly GFS data for budgetary central
government, they do not report these for publication in IFS.
Monetary accounts
The authorities report money and banking statistics on a timely and regular basis. In
March 2002, the IMF provided technical assistance to implement the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The BoM successfully implemented the compilation
procedures for the new Depository Corporations Survey (DCS) as recommended in the
MFSM and compiled data in this framework for the period beginning in August 2001.
However, the monetary survey is still used for monetary policy purposes (in the Monetary
Targeting Framework) and for reporting to the Fund. In June 2005, the BoM started sending
monetary data to STA using also the new standardized report forms.
Balance of payments
Mauritius provides quarterly balance of payments and international investment position data
to the IMF's Statistics Department on the basis of the classification system of the fifth edition
of the Balance of Payments Manual. Coverage is limited for data in the financial account of
the balance of payments and in the international investment position statement, particularly
those on direct investment and portfolio investment. To address these gaps, a 2001 ROSC
mission recommended the establishment of a survey of enterprises, banks and other financial
institutions, both onshore and offshore, to obtain data on claims and liabilities regarding
nonresidents. The authorities are investigating the possibility of conducting such a survey.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 3, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Mauritius
On December 2, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Mauritius.1
Background
Mauritius has been increasingly affected by the phasing out of external trade preferences for its
textile exports and, more recently, by higher prices for petroleum product imports. Growth has
slowed to 3.5 percent in 2004/05 and is expected to remain subdued during the next two fiscal
years. The surplus on the external current account has recently turned into a deficit, owing to a
decline in exports and a price-related surge in petroleum product imports. The real effective
exchange rate has depreciated and net foreign official reserves have dropped, although they remain
at relatively comfortable levels.
The slowdown of economic activity and the suspension of periodic adjustments of retail petroleum
prices have negatively affected Mauritius’ fiscal position. While the central government deficit was
kept at about 5 percent of GDP during 2004/05, the State Trading Company (STC) incurred a rising
deficit owing to the lack of adjustment of retail petroleum prices since early 2005. Unless corrective
action is taken, the overall fiscal position during 2005/06 is expected to deteriorate further, owing to
lower than originally projected revenue collections associated with lackluster activity and a further
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2–
increase of the STC’s deficit as the gap between retail prices and import costs of petroleum products
widens.
Inflation has picked up since mid-2004, reflecting ample liquidity and higher import prices for
petroleum products. More recently, price developments have moderated largely because of slower
monetary growth and because increases in international oil prices have not yet been passed on due
to the suspension of the adjustment of domestic oil prices.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Mauritius’ impressive economic and social progress over the past
two decades. However, they noted that a deteriorating external economic environment, particularly
for the sugar and textile sectors, recently has led to a slowdown of economic activity, an increase in
the external current account deficit, and a loss of international reserves. Directors underscored that
the challenging external environment, the high level of domestic public debt, and the risk of higher
inflation pose considerable policy challenges in the short and medium term. Against this
background, Directors welcomed the authorities’ recognition of the need for fundamental reforms to
boost external competitiveness and ensure fiscal sustainability.
Directors urged the authorities to develop a comprehensive economic strategy early on, that
combines structural reform measures and policies geared toward macroeconomic stability. Such an
agenda would reassure international and domestic investors, improve the environment for private
sector activity, and lay the basis for a return to high growth rates and the creation of employment
opportunities.
In the structural area, Directors encouraged the authorities to explore options for a more active
involvement of the private sector, including privatization, which would help foster investment and
growth. In this context, they stressed the need to review the role of the public sector in commercial
activities, including the financial soundness of the major public enterprises. Directors also
underscored the importance of creating a more flexible labor market to facilitate the transfer of
workers from declining to more dynamic sectors. However, they stressed that efforts to facilitate
inter-sectoral movement of labor will need to be accompanied by training programs geared toward
the needs of growing segments of the economy. Also, the impact of centralized wage negotiations
on labor costs and competitiveness needs to be examined soon.
Regarding the textile and sugar sectors, Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ restructuring
plans, aimed at mitigating the effects of a loss of trade preferences. They welcomed steps under
way to increase the overall efficiency of enterprise operations and seek new export opportunities for
textiles. However, they cautioned against the use of fiscal incentives for the sectors, taking into
account the difficult fiscal situation.
Directors commended the authorities’ steady progress on financial sector reform, including
implementation of several key Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations.
This has strengthened the banking system despite the adverse developments in the textile and
sugar sectors. Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to intensify financial sector monitoring and
to harmonize the tax treatment of domestic and offshore banks.

-3–
Directors urged the authorities to take steps to stem a further deterioration of the fiscal position in
2005/06. In this regard, they recommended careful monitoring of the financial situation of the major
state-owned enterprises. They welcomed the recent adjustment of domestic petroleum prices and
supported reinstatement of the automatic petroleum price adjustment mechanism to ensure full
pass-through of the cost of imported petroleum products to domestic retail prices while cautioning
that well-targeted safety nets will be needed to mitigate the impact on the poor. Directors also
stressed the need to devise support schemes for the sugar and textile sectors that would not add to
public outlays.
Directors emphasized that a strong and credible medium-term fiscal strategy will need to be
formulated as quickly as possible to contain the public debt and ensure fiscal sustainability.
They noted the scope for broadening the tax base and streamlining outlays through better targeting
to groups in need of assistance. They encouraged the authorities to follow through with their plan to
phase out all import tariffs, which will support efforts to bolster competitiveness. Directors also
recommended that debt management be improved, including through a further diversification of debt
instruments.
Directors emphasized that exchange rate and monetary policies will play a key role in securing
external competitiveness in the short term while longer-term structural reforms are being
implemented. Most Directors supported a cautious approach to tightening of monetary conditions in
order to contain inflationary pressures and encouraged the authorities to manage liquidity more
actively. In this regard, Directors supported the authorities’ request for Fund technical assistance to
develop a more diversified range of monetary policy instruments. Directors also cautioned against
adopting a fully-fledged inflation targeting regime in light of the need to refine the instruments of
monetary policy, the uncertain external outlook, and the need for fiscal consolidation.
Directors stressed that the exchange rate should reflect movements in macroeconomic
fundamentals. To this end, they supported greater flexibility of the exchange rate, observing that
interventions in the foreign exchange market should be limited to smoothing short-term volatility with
a view to protecting international reserves.
Directors noted that Mauritius’ data availability and quality are generally adequate for surveillance
purposes. They encouraged the authorities to reconcile differences between official and externally
collected debt data and to move the fiscal accounts to an accrual basis as soon as feasible.

Statement by Damien Ondo Mañe, Executive Director for Mauritius
December 2, 2005

1. I would like to express my Mauritian authorities’ appreciation to the staff for the
constructive discussions on issues pertaining to the Mauritian economy during the last
Article IV consultation exercise. My authorities are in broad agreement with staff’s
analysis and policy recommendations regarding the main challenges facing the
economy, and they thank staff for the informative set of papers. My authorities also
appreciate the excellent and timely technical assistance provided by the Fund. In this
context, the authorities valued the two seminars presented by staff on the topic of
Inflation and Exchange Rate during the mission.
2. As has been noted by the Board, during past Article IV Consultation discussions,
Mauritius, over the past two decades, has made impressive social and economic
progress. Real GDP growth was among the highest in the world, with real per capita
income more than doubled. The external account remained strong and the level of
international reserves increased significantly. These achievements have been
underpinned by large private and public investments which relied mainly on the high
rate of domestic savings, strong public institutions, and importantly by taking full
advantage of existing international trade agreements.
3. The changes in trade agreements, namely the phasing out of trade preferences for
textiles at end-2004, and that for sugar starting in 2007, two sectors on which the
growth of the Mauritian economy had been built, are posing severe challenges to the
authorities and are creating an uncertain medium-term outlook. As I explained in my
last Buff statement on Mauritius, the authorities have recognized the challenges
facing the country and the need to restructure the economy. In this context, they have
embarked on an ambitious program to find new drivers for economic growth. The
country is reengineering itself to move up the value chain and build a knowledge
economy based on financial services, and information and communication
technologies. Measures are also being taken to modernize the sugar and textile sectors
through higher productivity, better technology, and greater capitalization.
Recent Developments
4. Macroeconomic performance in 2004/2005 has been adversely affected by the
retrenchment in the textile and garments sector with the coming to expiration of the
Multifiber Agreement, and the sharp increase in the import price of petroleum
products. Sugar production will also be lower than earlier forecast due to heavy rains
early in the year. Although the tourism sector is expected to show robust growth, the
authorities now project real GDP to grow by about 3.5 percent this fiscal year.
Inflation has been revised upwards and is projected at 5 percent for 2005, compared
to 4.7 percent in 2004. The increase is due mostly to higher costs of imports.
Unemployment continued to increase, due to retrenchment in the textile and sugar
sectors, and was estimated at about 10 percent at end -2004. The decline in exports of

-2textile and garments and the higher import price of petroleum products caused the
external current account which has been in surplus in the recent past to turn into a
deficit. The fiscal deficit for 2004/05 is expected to be about 6 percent of GDP.
5. In July 2005, elections for the National Assembly were held and were won by the
Labor Party and a coalition of smaller parties. The new Government issued from the
elections has recognized the major macroeconomic and structural challenges facing
the country and has indicated its determination to address them. In presenting its
economic program, the government has announced that its efforts will focus on
reducing the fiscal deficit and implementing comprehensive structural reforms to
diversify the economy and enhance competitiveness.
Macroeconomic Policies
6. The authorities agree that macroeconomic policies need to be tightened. It is their
intention to take measures that will gradually reduce the fiscal deficit over the
medium term, and to tighten monetary policy. However, with GDP growth slowing
down, the authorities feel that they need to proceed carefully in their approach. At a
time of slow growth and rising unemployment, policies have to be carefully balanced
so that they do not make the situation worse by creating more unemployment.
7. Moreover, the new development strategy that is being put in place may also not help
to reduce unemployment significantly, at least in the beginning. Indeed,
diversification may create a period of jobless growth, as more emphasis is placed on
the development of more capital- and knowledge-intensive sectors that demand high
skills and create fewer jobs.
8. In the fiscal area, for the short term, the authorities are focusing their efforts on
containing expenditure, especially through cuts in capital outlays, at least for the
remainder of this fiscal year. Cuts in transfers and subsidies will be difficult in this
period of increasing unemployment, but will be looked at as the economy improves.
However, the authorities did raise petroleum prices by the full 15 percent in October,
in accordance with the automatic price adjustment mechanism. Further price
adjustments will be made quarterly following the mechanism in place. It is to be
noted that this increase followed the increase in September in the price of natural gas
for commercial users.
9. The authorities are in the process of developing a comprehensive medium-term
strategy to return the economy toward fiscal sustainability, and also address the
public debt problem. They expect to announce new revenue-enhancing and
expenditure-reducing measures in the next Budget. As a first step the authorities
intend to tighten tax loopholes and broaden the tax base.
10. The objectives of monetary and exchange rate policies are to support external
competitiveness and maintain macroeconomic stability. As inflationary pressures
have increased, the Bank of Mauritius has already raised interest rates. However, the

-3monetary authorities feel that they need to move carefully as regards interest rate so
as not to discourage investment, and also to pay close attention to the financial health
of the banking sector at a time when many factories are closing down. In any case,
policies will remain prudent. In their efforts to better manage liquidity, the
authorities are considering diversifying their monetary instruments, and have
requested technical assistance from the Fund.
11. The Bank of Mauritius has made good progress in the adoption of an informal
inflation-targeting framework for monetary policy. However, they do not feel that
all the conditions exist to adopt a formal inflation targeting framework. Box 2 of the
Selected Issues paper outlines well the conditions that Mauritius has to meet before it
can move to a formal inflation-targeting regime. In this regard, the authorities look
forward to the next T/A mission from MFD to help them develop the necessary
instruments and meet the preconditions for such a move.
12. The financial sector remains in sound health. In anticipation of the shocks to the
textile and sugar sectors, provision requirements had been strengthened, and the
exposure of the Mauritian banks to these two sectors have declined significantly over
the past few years. The authorities are confident that further provisioning needs could
be met from profits which remain strong. Nevertheless, the Bank of Mauritius
continues to monitor the situation closely. It is also to be noted that there is now a
single license for domestic and offshore banks, and the authorities intend to
harmonize the tax treatment of both activities shortly.
Structural Issues
13. As noted above, changes in the international environment are adversely affecting the
Mauritian economy. To maintain the growth momentum, and take full opportunity of
the globalization process, fundamental structural changes are being implemented.
Comprehensive restructuring plans for the sugar and textile sectors have been
developed through close cooperation between the private sector and the government,
and broad consultation with stakeholders, and have relied entirely on domestic
financing. The restructuring plans aimed at bolstering competitiveness in both the
textile and sugar sectors and to encourage diversification within those sectors. At the
same time the government has put in place a retraining program to enable displaced
workers both in the sugar and textiles sectors to acquire new skills that could help
them find employment in other sectors.
14. In the sugar sector, the measures being implemented have already helped to reduce
production costs, but the social costs are high, with the loss of more than 10,000 jobs,
since 2000. The number of sugar mills which stood at 20 have now been reduced to
11 and will be reduced further to 5 within 5 years. The mechanization process will
continue and more layoffs will occur. At the same time, a process of diversification
is underway within the sugar sector, with the production of ethanol, rum, specialty
sugar, and greater use of the residue from sugar cane in the production of energy. As

-4an example of the diversification process, Mauritius now exports over 60,000 tons of
specialty sugar which has a high market value and is not subject to any quota.
15. In the textile sector, the loss of employment is estimated at about 15,000 since 2000.
However, the authorities expect the situation to start stabilizing by year-end. Already
some of the more efficient factories have started to hire employees. The restructuring
strategy has also focused on upgrading technology, diversifying products and markets
such as taking better advantage of preferential access to the U.S. market under the
AGOA, developing skills and human resources, and attracting foreign direct
investment. Large investments have been made, often with foreign partners, in
spinning technology which will enable vertical integration and lower costs. Already,
the industry is regaining some competitiveness as regards upscale products.
16. Together with the restructuring of the these two sectors, the authorities are
continuing their efforts to deepen the tourism sector which has done very well. The
strategy put in place and which has relied on the development of an upscale tourist
industry has been successful. The authorities are building on the this success to
expand this sector further. New hotels are being built and air-link networks are being
developed with other countries. This sector is expected to make significant
contribution towards employment creation. Concurrently, the authorities are also
working closely with the private sector in developing a new strategy aimed at making
the island a “shopping paradise” through the gradual elimination of all import tariffs,
and through a policy of attracting regional tourists.
17. As regards other growth sectors, good progress is being achieved in the
development of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector, with
the assistance of foreign partners. This sector is absorbing much of the more
educated workers, and is expected to grow further over the medium term. The
seafood sector is fully operational and has large potential. The financial services
sector aslo continues to make positive contribution to growth. This sector employs
about 7,000 highly skilled workers.
18. On the labor market, while more flexibility could help to reduce some
unemployment, the authorities are of the view that the market is not as rigid as one
might think. In the EPZ, for example, where most of the textile and garments
factories are located, labor laws are flexible and firms can hire and fire at any time.
Similarly, in the new ICT sector which has many outcall centers and which needs to
be opened 24/7, labor laws are flexible, and wages are determined by supply and
demand. In the tourism and in particular in the hotel sector where there is union
activity, the hiring of workers has not been a constraint. The Tripartite Negotiations
( Labor, Management and Government) has generally not been a source of rigidity.
In fact, it has contributed to peaceful industrial relations in Mauritius, an important
factor in attracting foreign investors. As regards the inflation-biased argument of the
wage negotiation system, my authorities would point out that the implementation of
the salary increase recommended has been generally tapered, such that the average
salary increase has been overall half the inflation rate. Over the years, different

-5governments have looked at the many proposals with a view to changing the system,
but none has gathered a consensus. Moreover, none of the other system is as
transparent and easy to understand as the inflation-related wage increase. In cases
where there have been large wage increases, it has come on top of what the Tripartite
Negotiations had proposed and was the result of direct sectoral negotiations.
Nevertheless, the authorities will continue to work closely with all stakeholders with
a view to make the present system less rigid. My authorities would also like to point
out that the unemployment issue is more a problem of a lack of employment
opportunities rather than one of rigidities in the labor market.
19. Overall, while the economic situation in the short term is difficult, the outlook for the
medium to longer term seems brighter as Mauritius continues to adapt and reengineer its economy to the new realities. In designing their development strategies,
the authorities remain in close consultation with the World Bank. The authorities also
look for closer relation with the Fund, in assisting them in the analysis of the
economic and financial situation, and in helping them design the appropriate policies
to meet the ongoing challenges.
