IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Paraguay
On April 29, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Paraguay, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal.
Paraguay’s economy remains relatively resilient against the backdrop of a regional
slowdown. Growth is estimated at 3 percent in 2015, among the strongest in Latin America.
This reflects a milder terms-of-trade shock relative to comparators; stable growth in
investment and consumption; and modest fiscal stimulus. However, the economy
experienced some loss of momentum over the past year. Growth below potential helps
contain inflation pressures, including from past exchange rate depreciation. In the first two
months of 2016, headline inflation was temporarily elevated, mainly due to volatile food
prices. Since then, it has moderated below 5 percent in March and is expected to decline to
the mid-point of the central bank’s target range (4.5 percent) over the course of 2016.
The external position deteriorated in 2015, due to a negative terms-of-trade shock and
weakness in major trading partners. Furthermore, credit growth has moderated from a rapid
pace, as economic activity has slowed and financial conditions have become less favorable.
Credit quality has been deteriorating. Specifically, banks’ non performing loans have been
rising, albeit from low levels, since mid-2015. Notwithstanding potential vulnerabilities from
past rapid credit expansion, the financial system appears sound. Most banks posted positive
net income in 2015, although profitability measures (returns on assets and equity) were in
most cases below 2014 levels. Relative to the region, Paraguay’s banks compare favorably in
terms of their balance sheets and profits.
Macroeconomic policies remain accommodative in light of subdued inflation and slower
growth. Notwithstanding the BCP’s 25 basis point interest rate hike in January 2016,
monetary policy continues to be somewhat accommodative, following an easing cycle in mid

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2015. Meanwhile, fiscal policy has been supportive of economic activity. The fiscal deficit at
the central government level is estimated to have reached 1.7 percent of GDP—marginally
above the 1.5 percent ceiling set by the fiscal responsibility law (FRL).
Paraguay’s economy is expected to remain relatively resilient this year and next despite
challenging external conditions. Staff expects solid growth near 3 percent in 2016 and
3.25 percent in 2017. Given favorable weather and strong yields, the soy harvest—
Paraguay’s main agricultural crop—is likely to see strong growth from last year. Sound
macroeconomic fundamentals, favorable demographics, lower cost of oil imports and a very
competitive electricity sector are additional factors sustaining growth in the near-term. Lower
credit demand from subdued investment plans and tighter credit conditions will contribute to
slower, but still positive, credit growth in 2016, more in line with economic fundamentals.
Downside risks to growth have risen, mainly from the external side. A further slowdown in
Brazil or deeper decline in agricultural commodity prices represents the major risks to the
outlook. Domestically, rapid credit expansion in the banking system in the context of slower
economic activity represents a potential macrofinancial vulnerability that could amplify the
effects of adverse external shocks. Finally, limited capacity for administering and executing
public investments also represents a downside risk to growth.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the Paraguayan authorities for maintaining solid
macroeconomic fundamentals, including low inflation, sustained growth and sound public
finances. Nevertheless, Directors noted that downside risks to growth have risen, mainly
from the external side. They emphasized the need to maintain macroeconomic stability and to
strengthen implementation capacity and policy frameworks, address structural weaknesses,
increase productivity, reduce poverty and promote inclusive growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to sound fiscal policy. They emphasized the
need for continued efforts to mobilize revenue and contain current expenditure while making
space for capital spending, especially on infrastructure. In this context, they welcomed the
signs of increased effectiveness of the fiscal responsibility law, but noted the importance of
fully internalizing it in the budget process to help establish a track record and bolster the
credibility of the fiscal anchor. Directors stressed that if amendments to the law are sought,
changes to grant flexibility should be balanced by safeguards which enhance its credibility
and are communicated carefully.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views

of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors concurred that the moderately accommodative monetary policy stance remains
appropriate given the uncertain international context and contained inflationary pressures.
Monetary policy, coupled with a flexible exchange rate, should be the principal tool if growth
were to weaken further, within the limits of meeting the central bank’s price stability
objective. Limiting discretionary foreign exchange market interventions to exceptional
circumstances of disorderly market conditions would reinforce the inflation targeting regime
and reassure markets. Reforms to deepen interbank markets and improve liquidity
management could help strengthen monetary policy transmission.
Directors considered the exchange rate and external position to be broadly in line with
fundamentals. They noted that the ample international reserve cover is appropriate
considering Paraguay’s openness, the level of dollarization, and vulnerability to shocks.
Directors agreed that the financial system appears to be sound, despite weaker economic
growth and recent bank performance. In light of past rapid credit growth, vigilance over
potential vulnerabilities remained critical to contain financial sector risks. Efforts to bolster
the financial sector should include closely scrutinizing banks’ loan classification practices
and strengthening supervision of the cooperative sector. Directors welcomed progress
towards introducing risk-based supervision and encouraged the authorities to continue
upgrading monitoring and analytical capacity and strengthen institutional arrangements to
carry out these functions.
Directors commended the authorities for progress on implementing their structural reform
agenda covered in the National Development Plan. Directors stressed that infrastructure
remains a key priority, especially improving electricity distribution and transportation. They
welcomed steps that have been taken to strengthen government transparency, including
implementation of the Law of Free Access to Public Information.
Directors commended the authorities for their efforts to continue to strengthen anticorruption and AML/CFT measures to improve the business climate. They welcomed recent
passage of the law on asset declaration.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 14, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: Paraguay has solid macroeconomic fundamentals, with low inflation, sustained
growth and sound public finances. Over the course of last year, however, the economy
experienced a loss of momentum—largely linked to weak commodity prices and adverse
regional spillovers. Downside risks to growth, mainly external, have risen. Over the
medium term, authorities face challenges, including limited implementation capacity and
political economy constraints, in the pursuit of their reform agenda to address structural
weaknesses, reduce poverty, strengthen policy frameworks, increase productivity and
promote inclusive growth.
Focus: The consultation focused on policies to support macroeconomic resilience,
contain financial sector vulnerabilities, and advance economic development.
Key policy issues:
 On the fiscal front, there are clear signs of increased effectiveness of the fiscal
responsibility law (FRL), and it is important that the law is fully internalized in the
budget process. Staff projects a broadly neutral fiscal stance for 2016 and some
tightening of current primary expenditures would be advisable to avoid exceeding
the FRL’s deficit ceiling by a wider margin while safeguarding needed public
investment. Caution is warranted when considering any modifications to the fiscal
anchor. If amendments to the law are sought, changes to make the fiscal rules more
flexible should be accompanied by safeguards that enhance credibility.
 Monetary policy remains accommodative given the uncertain international context
and contained underlying inflationary pressures. On the external front, staff
continues to assess the currency and external position as being broadly in line with
fundamentals and reserves remain broadly adequate. Monetary policy coupled with
a flexible exchange rate should be the principal tool if growth were to weaken
further, within the limits of meeting the central bank’s price stability objective.
 The banking system appears to be sound and authorities are moving forward with
efforts to enhance financial supervision. Reducing still-elevated financial sector
dollarization through macroprudential instruments could help limit risks from
exchange rate fluctuations and possibly curb the need for foreign exchange
interventions. To manage risks emanating from somewhat weaker credit quality,
particular scrutiny is warranted in examining banks’ loan classification and
provisioning, particularly to the agricultural sector.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: RELATIVE RESILIENCE TO A
REGIONAL SLOWDOWN
1.
Against the backdrop of a regional slowdown, Paraguay’s economy remains relatively
resilient. Staff estimates growth at 3 percent in 2015, among the strongest in Latin America
(Table 1). This reflects: (i) a milder adverse terms-of-trade shock relative to comparators;1 (ii) stable
growth in investment and consumption; and
Peak to Trough Change of Commodity Terms of Trade
(iii) modest fiscal stimulus.
(In percent of GDP)

3.
Inflation pressures remain contained
despite significant depreciation of the
guaraní against the U.S. dollar. Core inflation
remained subdued during most of 2015 (Figure
1),2 despite a 25 percent depreciation against
the U.S. dollar (although depreciation of the
guaraní in effective terms was more modest).
However, core inflation increased towards the
end of the year. A limited degree of exchange
rate pass-through resulted in higher prices.
Services and housing have also contributed to
higher core inflation. In the first two months of

The economy experienced some loss
of momentum over the past year due to
unfavorable external shocks. For three
consecutive quarters, Paraguay’s real GDP
growth has progressively slowed down, reaching
1.1 percent year-on year (y/y) in the fourth
quarter, from 6 percent in the first quarter
(Figure 1). Real exports contracted by just below
10 percent (y/y) in the first three quarters of
2015. Prices of its two major exports, soybeans
and beef, fell 24 and 10½ percent respectively in
2015, while a deepening recession in Brazil
affected re-exports and commercial activity in
Paraguay’s border cities.

Terms-of-trade deteriorated as soy and beef export prices dropped in 2015, but import prices of oil products and
capital goods also decreased to provide some offset. Capital goods import prices fell in U.S. dollar terms mainly from
neighboring countries, Brazil and Argentina, whose currencies have depreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar.

BCP’s preferred measure of underlying inflation (“nucleus”) averaged 2.9 percent for 2015 (y/y) and 3.7 percent in
December, whereas core inflation (X1) averaged 3.7 percent for 2015 and 4.9 percent in December.

2016, headline inflation remained temporarily elevated, mainly due to volatile food prices. Staff
expects inflation to decline to the mid-point of the central bank’s target range (4½ percent) over the
course of 2016, as growth below potential helps contain inflation pressures, including from past
exchange rate depreciation. Moreover, recent currency appreciation since February, low oil prices,
moderating inflation for services and housing, and anchored inflation expectations, further point to
more subdued or easing inflationary pressures going forward, also reflected by moderating inflation
in March 2016.
4.
Macroeconomic policies remain accommodative in light of subdued inflation and
slower growth. Notwithstanding the BCP’s unexpected 25 basis point interest rate hike in January
2016 to 6 percent, monetary policy continues to be somewhat accommodative, following an easing
cycle over March-July 2015 (Figure 2). Meanwhile, fiscal policy has been more supportive of
economic activity. Staff estimates that the fiscal deficit at the central government level reached
1.7 percent of GDP—marginally above the 1.5 percent ceiling set by the fiscal responsibility law
(FRL). The estimated deficit would imply a positive fiscal impulse of 1.2 percent of potential nonagriculture non-energy GDP3 (Figure 3, Table 2, and Table 3).
5.
In the first year of implementation, FRL compliance has been challenging. Amid
legitimacy questions about the scope of the FRL to limit the legislative power of congress to enact
budgets that are not in line with the law’s provisions, the 2015 budget approved by congress
exceeded the deficit ceiling by 1.3 percentage points of GDP after modifications were introduced to
the executive’s budget proposal. Moreover, the approved budget law, allowed for the exclusion of
capital expenditure financed by sovereign bonds from the calculation of the deficit ceiling on a oneoff basis. Staff estimates an adjusted fiscal balance of -0.6 percent of GDP for 2015, below the FRL
deficit ceiling if such expenditures are excluded. Furthermore, real current primary expenditures are
estimated to have grown by 4.7 percent, exceeding the FRL ceiling of 4 percent on an ex-post basis.
6.
In 2016, however, there have been signs of increased effectiveness of the FRL in the
budget process. The draft 2016 budget submitted to congress complied with the numerical targets
of the law. While the final approved version still respected the deficit ceiling, modifications
introduced by congress altered the composition of spending. Staff still expects real current primary
expenditure growth for the central government to be below the FRL ceiling when comparing
outcomes for 2015 and 2016, but the growth of these expenditures would exceed the 4 percent limit
when comparing the approved budget to the 2015 outturn.4
7.
The external position deteriorated modestly in 2015, due to a negative terms-of-trade
shock and weakness in major trading partners. The current account balance moved further into
negative territory and is expected to remain in deficit at –1.8 percent of GDP in 2015 (Figure 4, Table
3

The primary balance is estimated to have deteriorated by 0.4 percent of GDP.

4

Note that authorities do not use fiscal outcomes to assess compliance with the FRL. Instead, compliance is based on
a comparison of the implied growth in current primary expenditures for the public sector in the approved budget for
year t+1, relative to the prevailing budget in year t, deflated by the mid-point of the BCP inflation target band.

4), as exports receipts (particularly, from Asia) have fallen due to lower commodity prices, as well as
from weaker economic activity in trading partners—notably, Brazil and Russia. Recent indicators also
point to weaker exports and, consequently, a smaller trade surplus last year. With respect to the
financial account, foreign direct investment has grown more modestly, about 10 percent through Q3
2015, than its average over the last 10 years given generally tighter financial conditions externally.
The deterioration of the current account position and reduced capital inflows has reduced
international reserve holdings. Staff continues to assess the currency and external positions as being
broadly in line with fundamentals given changes in the external environment (Annex II). The
assessment is mainly based on external adjustment consistent with weaker terms-of-trade and
partner activity, and real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciation, which is more in line with its
ten-year average. EBA-lite estimates of current account and REER gaps continue to present mixed
results, with poor empirical fit and almost no share of the misalignment explained by policy gaps.

Reserves remain broadly adequate. The BCP’s reserve position at 23 percent of GDP
covers 7 months of imports (Table 5). Reserves are expected to increase in 2016, relative to 2015,
partly as a result of the issuance of a US$600 million government bond. Reserves are assessed to
exceed the IMF’s standard adequacy metric for floating exchange rate economies. However, staff
believes that ample reserve coverage is appropriate for Paraguay considering the economy’s
openness, significant dollarization, and high vulnerability to weather and commodity price shocks.
9.
Recently, credit growth has moderated, but credit quality has deteriorated. Over 2015,
financial intermediaries have become increasingly less optimistic about economic conditions and
extending credit. In parallel, growth in bank credit to the private sector in local currency terms
peaked at 29½ percent last May but stood at about 18 percent by February 2016 (Table 6). This
largely reflects stagnant FX lending volumes, which more than offset the valuation effects of
exchange rate depreciation.5 Stagnant FX credit volumes coincided with reduced demand for
investment loans in the largely dollarized agriculture sector, owing to the drag on profitability from

lower commodity prices. In contrast, local currency lending growth remained strong, even as
changes to credit card regulations appear to have restrained consumer lending. Credit quality has
been deteriorating recently, with banks’ non performing loans (NPLs) rising to a still-moderate
2.9 percent in February 2016 (Table 7). Moreover, loan restructuring and refinancing, outside of
NPLs, also rose over the year to 2.3 percent of total loans, in some cases benefitting from the BCP’s
decision to grant temporary relaxations in loan classification to mitigate the effects of shocks facing
the agriculture and livestock sectors.

NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS TO RESILIENCE

Paraguay’s economy is expected to remain relatively
resilient this year and next, withstanding the adverse impact of
sizeable external shocks. Despite a prolonged regional slowdown and
weaker commodity prices, staff expects solid growth near 3 percent in
2016 and 3¼ percent in 2017, led by agriculture and construction.
Given favorable weather and strong yields, the soy harvest—Paraguay’s
main agricultural crop—is likely to see strong growth from last year.

an offset to negative carryover effects from weakening momentum elsewhere over the course of last

12.
But downside risks to growth have risen mainly from the external side (see Risk
Assessment Matrix). These risks are underscored by a noticeable deceleration in the quarterly path
of GDP in 2015. A further slowdown in Brazil and deeper decline in agricultural commodity prices
represent the major risks to the outlook. Staff analysis suggests that growth spillovers from Brazil
can be sizeable but the confidence range around point estimates is large (Box 1, Annex V). Albeit of
lesser importance, lower growth in the euro area and Russia—market destinations accounting for
about 25 percent of Paraguay’s exports—could dampen domestic growth to some degree. The
recent removal of exchange controls and trade taxes in Argentina could be a source of upside risk,
but its effects are uncertain (see Box 1). Rapid credit growth in the banking system in the context of
slower economic activity represents a potential macrofinancial vulnerability that could interact with
external risks, such as the deterioration of external financial conditions.6
13.
On the domestic front, limited capacity for administering and executing public
investments also represents a downside risk to growth. With indicators of its capital stock and
infrastructure quality typically in the bottom quartile among emerging markets, Paraguay’s planned
infrastructure build-out is a necessity. However, the efficiency of public investment management
and experience with large projects is relatively low—raising risks associated with any ramp-up in
infrastructure spending, including private sector participation in infrastructure projects (PPPs).

As a potential mitigating factor, lending rates remained quite stable during previous episodes of financial
turbulence, including during the taper-tantrum in mid-2013.

Box 1. Paraguay: Global and Regional Spillovers to Paraguay
Financial linkages between Paraguay and the rest of the World are limited.
Foreign asset holdings by Paraguayan banks are small and banks are largely
funded through deposits and capital. Foreign ownership of deposits is also small
and foreign equity (mainly from Brazil) represents only 2.5 percent of system
assets. Nevertheless, high levels of dollarization in the financial system could
render bank balance sheets vulnerable to sharp exchange rate movements, even
though currency mismatches are partly offset by natural hedges. Furthermore,
foreign investors do not hold domestically-issued government bonds and most
portfolio inflows to the country are linked to the issuance of sovereign bonds in
international markets. FDI growth in the recent past has been concentrated in the
construction and maquila sectors, which benefit from Paraguay’s competitive tax
system and energy prices.

Trade channels continue to be the main source of vulnerability to external

Shocks to the VIX volatility index, a measure of global risk aversion, are also
linked to statistically significant decreases in Paraguay’s GDP growth (variance decompositions show that about 11 percent of the

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: SUPPORTING GROWTH
THROUGH STRENGTHENED POLICY FRAMEWORKS
14.
Discussions focused on the structural reform agenda and measures to further
strengthen fiscal, monetary, and financial sector policy frameworks. The National Development
Plan comprehensively outlines the authorities’ structural reform priorities and tracking of
implementation progress was discussed, particularly with respect to infrastructure. Improvements in
government accountability were seen as encouraging initial steps. The current mix of
macroeconomic policies was viewed as broadly appropriate. Monetary policy remains
accommodative and the BCP kept interest rates on hold at its policy meeting at the time of the
mission—citing a more complex external environment. Steps to reinforce credibility of the inflation
targeting regime were also discussed. On fiscal policy, there were clear signs of increased
effectiveness under the fiscal responsibility law in the 2016 budget process, but a longer track
record of compliance is needed to cement it as a credible fiscal anchor. The fiscal stance appears
broadly neutral in 2016, but tax revenues are likely to be weaker than in the budget, and tightening
current expenditures would be advisable to avoid exceeding the FRL’s deficit ceiling ex-post by a
wider margin. Improvements to the medium-term fiscal framework and pension reform were still
needed.

Improved navigability of the Paraguay-Parana Waterway, through dredging, as well as investment in port terminals and key road
segments would relieve traffic congestion, reduce logistics costs and facilitate trade. Existing electricity transmission and distribution
systems are inadequate to meet the growing demand for energy. Paraguay shares with Brazil the second largest hydroelectric
power plant on earth, Itaipu, yet hydro power represents less than 20 percent of domestic energy consumption.

and quality of public services. Staff and authorities agreed on the need to prioritize infrastructure
investment in these areas—including through PPPs.
16.
The national development plan places emphasis on inclusive growth and poverty
reduction.8 The authorities highlighted the “Sowing Opportunities” umbrella program aimed at
poverty reduction and inclusive growth. It includes Tekopora, the longstanding conditional cashtransfer program, as well as several new programs such as Tenondera, an income-generating
program to empower those graduating from Tekopora; and Tekoha, a program to assist the poor to
legally acquire property on which they live. At the same time, authorities noted that efforts have
been made to improve targeting and coverage by collecting more information about the economic
conditions of potential recipients via the “Ficha Social” survey.

B. Fiscal Policy: Balancing Credibility and Flexibility
18.
Options to enhance the credibility and effectiveness of the Fiscal Responsibility Law
were discussed. While the FRL has not had the expected traction on the budget process, there are
signs of increased effectiveness as evident in the 2016 budget approved by congress. Crucially, adhoc provisions for the exclusion of capital expenditures from the deficit ceiling have not been added
8

In addition, programs under each of the three NDP axes can further be divided into: 1) promoting equality of
opportunities, 2) efficient and transparent public management, 3) land use planning, and 4) environmental
sustainability. The greatest resources are devoted to the first two subcategories.

The constitutional requirement (Article 104) that public officials declare their assets was clarified via regulatory Law

to the Budget law this year. Overall, despite notable progress, questions about the FRL as a credible
fiscal anchor remain. Part of the issue concerns legal ambiguity between the obligations under the
FRL and constitutional budget authority of congress under the current legal framework. To build
credibility of the fiscal framework and establish a track record, staff argued that it was important to
fully internalize the constraints of the FRL in the budget process.

The mission urged caution when considering any modifications to the fiscal anchor.
The government strives to meet its constraints under the FRL in the budget, but is considering
amending the law going forward given both design and implementation issues. This may include
revisiting the deficit ceiling, moving to a structural balance rule, as well as reviewing the treatment of
public investment in the numerical targets. Staff advised following a balanced approach in
considering any reforms given important potential credibility and reputational costs to amending
the framework. If changes are sought, staff recommended that reforms should balance credibility
and flexibility considerations to avoid perceptions of dilution of the current law. Any modifications
should be accompanied by concrete measures to strengthen fiscal institutions and preserve
sustainability of public finances (See Box 2). For example, correction mechanisms can help cement
the FRL as a credible fiscal anchor and ensure greater observance of fiscal targets over time. A
transition to a new fiscal anchor though would also need to be carefully managed (see Selected
Issues Paper).
21.
Comparing the implications of alternative fiscal rules, based on the experience of
other countries, was also part of this fiscal policy discussion. A “golden rule”—to exclude, for
example, public investment expenditure from the deficit ceiling—is part of fiscal rules in other
countries in the region. However, such exclusions

structural balance rule would be a sensible approach to avoid procyclical policies, but staff believed
it is likely to face implementation and communication challenges—including the estimation of
unobservable variables such as the output gap and structural revenues.

Box 2. Paraguay: A Balancing Act: Reform Options for Paraguay’s FRL
The Fiscal Responsibility Law, which came into force in 2015, was an important achievement toward strengthening
Paraguay’s fiscal framework. In addition to numerical targets, the law introduced elements of medium-term budgeting and
greater transparency.
However, fundamental issues have emerged with respect to the law’s implementation and design. First, there is some
legal ambiguity surrounding the FRL given the fact that annual budget laws are on equal legal footing with the FRL. Thus,
implementation of the FRL has proven complex with the annual budget law in 2015 affecting how deficit compliance would be
assessed last year (the 2015 budget law excluded capital expenditure financed by sovereign bonds from the calculation of the
deficit ceiling). Second, there is growing concern that under the current design of the rule, with its comparatively low deficit
ceiling, capital expenditure plans may be constrained despite large infrastructure investment needs. Finally, the prevailing
deficit ceiling (expressed in headline terms) and limited escape clauses can limit the space for countercyclical policies.
Consequently, the authorities are considering amending the FRL depending on the trade-offs involved with moving to
an alternative fiscal rule. With improved implementation under the FRL in 2016, staff favored retaining the current deficit rule
and establishing a solid track record of compliance, but also provided analysis of alternative fiscal rules to inform this discussion
(See Selected Issues Paper). Specific alternatives considered included adopting a “golden rule” which excludes public
investment from the deficit ceiling; increasing the headline ceiling; making the deficit rule more flexible by moving to a
structural balance rule; and removing the deficit ceiling and effectively changing the FRL to an expenditure rule.
Staff analysis highlights that different fiscal rules offer certain advantages, but also various drawbacks. The general
ranking of different rules with respect to debt trajectories is stable, but the composition of expenditures can vary significantly.
For example, if the authorities decide to adopt a “golden rule”, which is associated with the highest debt levels in staff
simulations, strictly adhering to the current expenditure rule and adding a debt ceiling would be crucial for preserving fiscal
sustainability. Furthermore, as practical experience has shown, a golden rule should be accompanied by efforts to enhance
public investment management efficiency and public accounting to ensure correct classification of capital expenditures. If the
authorities consider raising the headline deficit ceiling, efforts to strengthen the budgetary process and FRL provisions on
sanctions and enforcement would help to cement the authorities’ commitment to fiscal responsibility and alleviate concerns of
dilution of the law. Should the authorities consider removing the deficit ceiling and keeping the existing expenditure rule, debt
sustainability could be compromised in the absence of a debt ceiling, although international experience suggests that
expenditure rules have better compliance.
Caution is thus warranted when considering changes to the fiscal anchor and a balanced approach is needed if
amendments to the law are sought. To gain credibility, establishing a longer track record of compliance would be preferable
to changing the rule at the outset. Potential modifications to make the fiscal rule more flexible should be accompanied by a
number of safeguards that enhance credibility of the fiscal anchor.
The effectiveness of the FRL will ultimately hinge upon measures to strengthen legal and institutional aspects of the
fiscal framework. Paraguay’s public financial management system should be strengthened, particularly in terms of budgetary
processes, public investment management framework, credible financial reporting and accounts, and additional fiscal
transparency. From a legal perspective, the effectiveness of the FRL is limited, as per Constitutional law, congress appears not to
be restrained from actions that modify the FRL. On the operational side, Paraguay’s fiscal framework would benefit from the
introduction of explicit correction mechanisms to address deviations from the fiscal rules, as well as the path back to
compliance. More precise provisions on sanctions and enforcement would be welcome.
Transition to a revised fiscal framework would need to be carefully managed. Given the possibly large costs as well as
high political sensitivity, any modification to the FRL needs to be carefully tested and communicated. If a transition to another
rule is considered, care should be taken that all relevant stakeholders agree on and “own” the reform.

22.
Authorities are also considering introducing an independent fiscal council to provide
non-partisan evaluation of fiscal policy. The main objective of the envisaged council would be to
assess fiscal policy, but it could also evaluate the fiscal forecasts undertaken by the Ministry of
Finance. This would be particularly useful under a structural balance rule. The council would
comprise reputable experts that would serve on a voluntary basis. Staff broadly welcomed this
potential institutional change but noted that the international experience suggests that the mere

establishment of a fiscal council does not by itself lead to stronger fiscal performance.11 Successful
fiscal councils possess certain characteristics such as independence, adequate staffing, or high
media impact.

Regarding the medium-term fiscal framework, staff emphasized further improving
revenue collection and raising public investment as a share of spending. The authorities’ three

the need for civil service reform (Figure 3), which would help create more fiscal space for public
investment.
24.
The mission also encouraged authorities to monitor and mitigate fiscal risks associated
with the scale-up of public private partnerships. Projects already in the pipeline under this
modality would amount to close to 2.5 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, Paraguay’s PPP framework is
relatively recent and the authorities have limited experience with implementation. Staff urged them
to accelerate efforts to quantify and mitigate fiscal risks arising from contingent liabilities. Staff also
recommended that project selection and implementation should be closely monitored to ensure
that investment efforts are efficiently translated into a higher public capital stock.

25.
Paraguay’s fragmented and unregulated pension funds do not effectively mobilize
national saving to finance investment or help develop local capital markets. Meanwhile,
actuarial and operational deficits pose substantial risks to public finances through contingent
liabilities.14 Given high levels of informality, coverage is estimated to be very low. Currently, most
pension fund resources are simply held as deposits in the banking system, in part because of a lack
of legal clarity regarding alternative investment options. Enacting the draft law creating a pension
regulator and expanding portfolio management options for pension funds will be instrumental in
tackling some of these challenges, but additional efforts will also be needed to address long-term
financial sustainability concerns, including parametric reform. The authorities broadly shared this
assessment and noted entrenched interests in the pension industry impede reforms.
26.
Authorities recognize the main fiscal challenges identified by staff and remain
committed to moving ahead with initiatives despite political economy constraints. On civil
service reform, authorities are working on amending the Civil Service act with support from the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to build on changes initiated with the introduction of
the new salary scale in 2015. The government will also continue to pursue efforts to enhance
domestic tax revenue mobilization with technical assistance support from the IMF. Authorities also
pointed to recent successes in combating and dismantling large tax evasion schemes. Authorities
acknowledged their limited experience in the management of PPPs and are requesting further
technical assistance in quantifying and mitigating risks from contingent liabilities associated with
these projects. Finally, pension reform is a politically sensitive issue and authorities have opted for a
gradual approach, where the approval of legislation creating the pensions regulator through
congress would be an important first step. Subsequently, policy measures to address longer term
sustainability concerns could then be contemplated.

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy: Reinforcing the Inflation Targeting
Regime
27.
Staff and the BCP concurred that accommodative monetary policy remained
appropriate given external risks. The policy rate was maintained at 6 percent through March in
light of the uncertain international economic context and the view that inflation pressures are
contained and inflation expectations anchored (Figure 2). Staff assesses the monetary stance as still
accommodative considering that the policy rate remains at the lower end of its historical range and
is slightly below the BCP’s estimate of the neutral rate. Staff views this stance as broadly appropriate
and expects inflation to decline to the mid-point of the target range over the course of 2016.
14

The system comprises eight defined-benefit funds with independent administrative structures, the largest of which
are the Instituto de Prevision Social (IPS) (serving private sector workers through mandatory contributions) and Caja
Fiscal (which focuses on civil servants). In addition to pension benefits, IPS also provides health services funded by
mandatory contributions. The actuarial study for IPS indicates that it could face operational imbalances as early as
2032. Authorities estimate that the present value of the actuarial deficit of the Caja fiscal fund would amount to
between 40 to 50 percent of GDP Among the remaining smaller pension funds, Caja Itaipu and Caja Ande also
present actuarial deficits that combined would amount to close to 4 percent of GDP.

The BCP has improved monetary policy operations in pursuit of its inflation objectives.
During the course of 2015, the interest rate corridor around the monetary policy rate (MPR) has
been narrowed by lifting the floor to 5.5 percent. At the same time, the central bank increased
issuance of monetary regulation instruments (IRMs), used for repos, and reduced the rejection rate
of bids in order to steer the overnight rate above the floor of the corridor towards the MPR.

29.
Nevertheless, the monetary policy framework can be further reinforced. The mission
reiterated some earlier recommendations by staff to further develop interbank markets to improve
monetary policy operations and strengthen the policy transmission mechanism through the MPR.
This includes widening the set of private counterparties (beyond banks) who can trade short-term
liquidity instruments; further discouraging the use of the overnight facility where banks allocate their
excessive reserves; improving liquidity analysis and forecasting including of the impact of foreign
exchange intervention; and gradually promoting de-dollarization. The latter can include considering
macro-prudential measures that introduce differential requirements for dollar loans and deposits.
30.
Large FX interventions can interact with regular monetary policy operations and
objectives. In September 2015, the BCP conducted discretionary interventions to support the
guaraní in response to high market volatility, in addition to regular pre-announced sales of dollars
associated with the sterilization of government receipts. The amount of dollars sold through the
pre-announced sales also exceeded the dollar amounts purchased from the government. Foreign
exchange intervention activity is reported transparently by the central bank. With respect to
monetary policy, interventions in the FX markets can affect the operation of the interest rate corridor
through the functioning of the interbank market, and ultimately the relative price of FX lending.
Depending on the macroeconomic circumstances and market conditions, intervention can thus
generate movements in interest rates that may create tensions with policy objectives within the
inflation-targeting regime.
31.
Staff recommended limiting interventions in the foreign exchange markets to
exceptional circumstances. Discretionary interventions should be limited to countering possible
disorderly market conditions. These are situations in which the exchange rate stops working as a
shock absorber and markets stop operating normally. To further reinforce the interest rate as the

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PARAGUAY

main policy instrument, the BCP should maintain predictable, rules-based dollar sales of government
receipts avoiding frequent adjustments to the amounts to be sold and temporary suspensions. Clear
communication of the central bank’s approach to discretionary intervention may help reinforce the
primacy of the inflation-targeting regime and reassure markets. Finally, developing a liquid FX
market is an important requirement for a floating exchange rate regime to allow normal fluctuations
in demand and supply without disorderly situations (e.g., liquidity running short and markets
becoming suddenly one-sided). Avoiding frequent regulatory changes and tight limits on FX
operating positions would be helpful in this regard.
32.
Authorities broadly agreed with many of staff’s recommendations which they believed
were consistent with their policy approach. The BCP agreed on the objective of further improving
the monetary framework, interbank markets and liquidity forecasting. The central bank stressed that
it does not target an exchange rate level in its FX interventions, evident in the fact that the exchange
rate depreciated by about 25 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2015. The BCP emphasized that
foreign exchange market interventions are made only during exceptional situations of excessive
market volatility. For example, the central bank commented that its “complementary” operations
(i.e., those beyond its pre-announced dollar sales) in foreign exchange markets last year were
motivated by risks of disorderly market conditions. As a result of their discretionary nature, the
authorities argued that these types of interventions were difficult to constrain to a predetermined
set of rules.

D. Financial Sector Policy: Containing Potential Risks
33.
Rapid credit growth partly reflects an extended period of financial catch up and
deepening though these effects may be waning. Much of the striking 26½ percent annual
average growth in private sector credit over the past decade reflects improved financial stability and
macroeconomic fundamentals. With expansion taking place in all broad economic sectors, a large
portion of the growth appears attributable to structural factors. Currently, the stock of private credit
outstanding is broadly in line with peers with similar per-capita income levels. However, in 2015,
economic outcomes were moderate relative to other countries that have experienced high credit
growth, suggesting that lending might be running ahead of fundamentals. Similarly, credit gap
estimates have turned strongly positive in recent quarters (see Selected Issues Paper).

34.
At present, certain characteristics of the Paraguayan banking system were helping to
contain risks. Both assets and liabilities are split roughly evenly between local and foreign currency
denominations, helping to reduce the potential for currency mismatches in the banking system.
Risks of an exchange rate driven deterioration in borrowers’ ability to repay loans also appeared
limited. Natural hedges appeared broadly evident in the sectors that borrowed in FX, with modest
shares of borrowers reporting that they lacked income in the currency of the loan. Liquidity risks
appeared relevant, given banks’ heavy reliance on short-term funding sources, which is reflected in
high-interest margins, and a relatively small interbank market; however, large liquid asset holdings
could provide safeguards.
35.
The framework for financial supervision and regulation is being strenthened. In
particular, the authorities have a project to introduce risk-based financial supervision, which has
entailed recent actions in various areas:


20

Legislation. A draft banking law would grant additional powers to the BCP and facilitate the
revised regulatory framework. The authorities indicated that passage was a priority and
expressed optimism that congressional approval could happen this year. Banks expressed
concerns about enhanced BCP powers to revise capital requirements that may cause disruption
and regulatory uncertainty. To limit this possibility, continued clear communication will be
needed.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PARAGUAY



Capacity building. The Superintendence of Banks has been receiving technical assistance in a
number of areas to better track credit, market, and liquidity risks; assess bank risk profiles; and
improve stress testing. Progress has occurred on several fronts, although going forward,
additional resources with respect to staffing and information technology may be necessary.



Financial stability council. The authorities plan to introduce a consultative Council of Financial
Stability, composed of a high-level committee with the heads of the BCP, Ministry of Finance,
and the regulator of cooperatives, INCOOP, and supporting subcomittees.15 Staff welcomed
these steps, noting that good institutional arrangements and adequate information sharing
would be essential.

Going forward, staff sees scope for enhanced vigilance, particularly with respect to
credit. External conditions, including from agricultural product prices, which appear to influence
credit quality, are set to remain difficult for some time and could boost already rising nonperforming
loans. While loan renegotiations, aided by BCP’s

Macroprudential measures can help contain financial sector risks. In particular, to
encourage gradual de-dollarization in the banking sector and reduce potential for currency
mismatches, staff noted a possible role for differentiated risk weightings or provisioning
requirements. For deposits, FX risks could be mitigated by further raising already higher reserve
requirements. In addition to the financial stability benefits, these measures could further bolster the
inflation targeting regime and monetary policy operations more generally to the extent that dedollarization is encouraged. Outside of currency risks, the authorities could address potential
vulnerabilities from rapid credit growth more directly by introducing regulations related to loan-tovalue measures. With respect to liquidity risks, the authorities are working on an ongoing project to
construct appropriate liquidity ratios for supervised institutions.

15

The subcommittees would have responsibility for microsupervision, macro-financial stability, and crisis
preparedness.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

PARAGUAY

38.
Closer oversight in certain areas would also help prevent a build-up of financial
vulnerabilities. In some cases, data gaps needed to be closed, while in others strengthening
oversight appeared warranted in staff’s view:


Cooperatives. This sector, which reported assets of around 8 percent of GDP as of August 2015,
showed higher rates of credit impairment relative to banks (8.6 percent in the largest
cooperatives).16 Characteristics of the credit unions’ accounting make it difficult to assess capital
adequacy. Nevertheless, the sector’s regulator, INCOOP, maintains a monitoring system for
compliance—based supervision and specifies corrective actions for breaches of norms. The
authorities indicated that they were continuing a project to introduce deposit insurance, which
should lead to a process of verifying institutions’ health before joining the deposit guarantee
fund.



Consumer and corporate lending risks and other credit intermediaries. Ongoing projects,
including the Credit Registry, could be leveraged and strengthened to provide a wider range of
indicators to assess risks from the household and business sectors. Additionally, reports
indicated increasing use of alternative credit intermediaries operating outside of the regulatory
perimeter. Close monitoring appeared warranted given concerns over adequate consumer
protection as well as the potential for risks to shift away from supervised institutions.



Real estate markets. Reports indicated elevated commercial real estate prices, but decreasing
agricultural real estate prices. Staff advised adressing data limitations, which prevent a full
assessment of property valuations, rents, and occupancy rates, particularly in light of the
widespread usage of real estate to secure loans.

39.
The authorities concurred with the need for close financial sector vigilance, although
they viewed the rapid credit growth as constituting a lesser risk than staff. In their view,
continued rapid local currency growth reflected the relative resilience of the Paraguayan economy,
while FX lending growth was distorted by valuation effects. The authorities underscored the priority
they attached to the banking law, noting that its passage would broaden their ability to introduce
macroprudential measures. On specific macroprudential tools, the authorities noted that identifying
an appropriate liquidity ratio measure was a priority, and were open to differentiating risk weights or
provisioning requirements; reserve requirements appeared to them as having less relevance. With
respect to institutional and information sharing agreements, the authorities emphasized the already
good cooperation that existed without the need for formal processes and the consultative process
with regards to the draft new banking legislation.

16

The credit impairment measure is for Type “A” cooperatives, which have assets above 50 billion guaranies.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
Authorities have advanced their structural reform agenda in several areas and
important steps have been taken to strengthen transparency and governance. Progress is
being tracked through internal scorecards measuring delivery of final goods or services toward
meeting social objectives. Infrastructure—notably, improving electricity distribution and
transportation—remains a priority. Implementation of the Law of Free Access to Public Information
is welcome as having established greater transparency in public processes and greater engagement
with civil society, an important step to improve the quality of institutions in Paraguay on a lasting
basis.
41.
Monetary policy remains appropriately accommodative given the uncertain
international context and contained inflationary pressures. Staff expects inflation to decline to
the mid-point of the inflation target range by the end of 2016. On the external front, the current
account balance is projected to remain in deficit as lower commodity export prices and weaker
economic activity in trading partners weigh on export performance. Staff continues to assess the
currency and external position as being broadly in line with fundamentals, given changes in the
external environment. Reserves remain broadly adequate and exceed the IMF’s standard adequacy
metric for floating exchange rate economies. Ample reserve coverage is appropriate for Paraguay
considering the economy’s openness, significant dollarization, and high vulnerability to weather and
commodity price shocks.
42.
There are clear signs of increased effectiveness of the fiscal responsibility law, but it is
important that its ceilings are fully internalized in the budget process. This will help establish a
track record and solidify the credibility of the fiscal framework. In 2016, tax revenues are likely to be
weaker than expected in the budget, while investment expenditure is expected to be under executed
due to persistent implementation capacity constraints. As a result, staff projects a broadly neutral
fiscal stance for the year (although the fiscal deficit will exceed the FRL limit). In that context,
tightening current primary expenditures would be advisable to avoid exceeding the FRL’s deficit
ceiling by a wider margin, while safeguarding public investment.
43.
Caution is warranted when considering any changes to the fiscal responsibility law.
There are potentially important reputational costs to amending the fiscal framework, given the short
track record of compliance. If amendments to the law are sought, authorities would be better served
by following a balanced approach to any reforms. Modifications to the framework to make the fiscal
rules more flexible should be accompanied by a number of safeguards that enhance credibility of
the fiscal anchor. In terms of transition, changes to the fiscal anchor would need to be managed and
communicated carefully and should be accompanied by concrete measures to strengthen fiscal
institutions and preserve the sustainability of public finances. On the operational side, Paraguay’s
fiscal framework would benefit from the introduction of explicit correction mechanisms to address
deviations from the fiscal rules, as well as a path back to compliance.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

PARAGUAY

44.
Monetary policy coupled with a flexible exchange rate should be the principal tool if
growth were to weaken further, within the limits of meeting the central bank’s price stability
objective. Certain reforms could help reinforce monetary policy effectiveness. In particular, creating
conditions for the expansion of interbank and secondary markets could improve the transmission of
monetary operations. In addition, limiting foreign exchange market interventions to exceptional
circumstances would help reinforce the primacy of the inflation-targeting regime and reassure
markets.
45.
The financial system appears to be sound and authorities are moving forward with
efforts to enhance financial supervision, including through introducing legislation to
strengthen risk-based supervision. Additional key areas of progress have been related to
developing monitoring tools and strengthening capacity to monitor credit and liquidity risk. To build
upon these gains, key priorities going forward include continuing to upgrade monitoring and
analytical capacity as well as strengthening institutional arrangements, and ensuring adequate
resources to perform these functions.
46.
Other actions could help ensure that market, liquidity and credit risks remain
contained in an environment of challenging external conditions. Reducing still-elevated
financial sector dollarization gradually, including through macroprudential instruments (such as
raising capital and provisioning requirements for foreign currency loans) could help limit financial
risks from exchange rate fluctuations and possibly curb the need for foreign exchange interventions.
To counter risks emanating from somewhat weaker credit quality, particular scrutiny is warranted in
examining banks’ loan classification and provisioning to ensure stronger buffers. Additionally, the
supervisor of the cooperative sector could be strengthened.
47.
Authorities continue to strengthen anti-corruption and AML/CFT measures to improve
the business climate. The recent passage of laws on freedom of information and asset declaration
are positive developments. Robust use of AML/CFT tools related to politically exposed persons and
suspicious transaction reporting can also support efforts to address corruption risks. Authorities are
encouraged to progress on amendments to the AML/CFT law in line with international standards.
48.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Annex I. Implementation of Past Fund Policy Advice
The authorities have taken on board several of the policy recommendations from the 2014 Article IV
consultation.


Directors commended authorities’ efforts in increasing tax collection and recommended that
these should be extended to achieve lasting improvements in public services. Authorities have
moved ahead with base broadening measures, such as the extension of the VAT to cooperatives,
and made good progress in strengthening institutional frameworks at the tax revenue authority
(SET). With technical support from the IMF, SET undertook significant organizational improvements
and advanced in the elaboration of new audit and enforcement strategies. SET has also made
important progress in enhancing taxpayers’ registries and in implementing online collection
through bank and other similar entities.



On fiscal policy, directors noted that over time, a stronger budget process will be essential to
support fiscal discipline. They also highlighted that a prudent medium-term fiscal plan should
also incorporate some buffer against adverse shocks, given the high volatility of Paraguay’s
economic environment. There are signs of increased effectiveness of the fiscal responsibility law,
even if the short track record of compliance is mixed. The draft 2016 budget submitted to congress
complied with the numerical targets of the law. While the final approved version still respected the
deficit ceiling, modifications introduced by congress altered the composition of spending. Over the
medium-term, authorities’ plans fully conform to the numerical targets.



On monetary and exchange rate policy, directors recommended efforts focused on further
enhancing the effectiveness of the inflation targeting regime. During the course of 2015, the
interest rate corridor around the monetary policy rate (MPR) has been narrowed in an effort to
establish the policy rate as the main anchor. At the same time, the monetary authority has
increased issuance of monetary regulation instruments (IRMs), used for repos, and reduced the
rejection rate of bids in order to steer the overnight rate above the floor of the corridor towards the
MPR.



On financial sector policy, directors argued that the revision of central bank and banking laws is
essential to put risk-based regulation and supervision on a robust legal basis. A draft banking
law has been presented officially to congress, and is currently under review. This legislation would
grant additional powers to the BCP and facilitate the move towards risk-based supervision. The
authorities indicated that passage was a priority and expressed optimism that congressional
approval could happen this year.

The authorities have also maintained their commitment to transparency in the discussions with staff,
by consenting to the publication of the mission’s concluding statement and arranging a press
conference that typically generates comprehensive media coverage of the mission’s main findings
and policy recommendations.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Paraguay
Foreign
asset and
liability
position

Background. Paraguay's net international investment position (NIIP) has hovered around -40 percent of GDP over
the last 5 years. The negative FDI position reflects large inflows of capital in the agriculture sector and in the
businesses related to the maquila. More recently the construction sector was another repository of FDI. Paraguay
also has a negative net asset position related to loans mostly due to large projects financed by multinationals and
more recently to bond issuance by the government on international markets.
Assessment. Gross external debt has grown in the last couple of years (from about 55 percent to about 59 percent
of GDP), as a result of the multilateral loans and bonds component of the net asset position. Nevertheless, the
external debt position remains sustainable under a range of adverse shocks (Figure A1 and Table A1, Annex III).
Background. Paraguay's current account has been in surplus over the past 20 years averaging 0.4 percent of GDP.
In the past couple of years, the balance has turned to negative, mainly as a result of low agriculture commodity
prices. The current account is projected to remain in deficit over the medium term, mainly as commodity prices are
not expected to recover and fuel import prices will increase starting in 2017. While national savings have remained
relatively stable as a share of GDP, investment has decreased in the last 2 years, as a result of low prospects in the
commodity production sectors.
Assessment. The current account is estimated to have reached -1.8 percent of GDP in 2015, the largest imbalance
since 2012. The country has gone through a significant adjustment, in line with worsening the external
fundamentals. The current account is projected to remain in negative balance moving towards -0.5 percent in the
medium term below its' 20-year average current account balance (0.4 percent) mainly as a result of permanently
lower commodity export prices and reverting import prices.

Real
exchange
rate and
competiti
veness

Background. Paraguay's real effective exchange rate (REER) is highly correlated with commodity prices. Amidst
lower commodity export prices and a consequent negative terms-of-trade shock, the REER has depreciated by 5
percent during 2015, primarily reflecting nominal depreciation. Inflation has remained tame during 2015, with the
only exception of December as import prices remained low.

Capital
and
financial
accounts

Background. The CA deficit is financed by FDI and external loans, with a multilateral playing an important role.
Lately, the government has more frequently tapped the international markets with a placement of two bonds in
2015 and a placement of USD 600 million this year.

FX
interventi
on and
reserves
level

Background. During Fall 2015, in addition to regular sales of government dollar receipts, the BCP has enacted a
series of discretionary interventions and as a result reserves dropped by over USD 500 million.

Assessment. The EBA approach delivered inconclusive and mixed results on the equilibrium REER. Staff sees the
rate moving in line with fundamentals, with an adjustment smoothed by BCP interventions.

Assessment. Paraguay has a fully open capital and financial account but financial markets are not deep or
developed, yet. Despite adverse conditions in the region, Paraguay has enjoyed a stable flow of FDI. Vulnerabilities
arising from linkages with international financial markets in the region are very limited, with foreign asset holding
below 1 percent of total financial system assets.

Assessment. Reserves remain ample at 7 months of imports and above the Fund metrics for a small open economy.
A flexible exchange rate is the first line of defense against external shocks. Staff has recommended to continue with
a rules-based approach for the regular dollar sales and to limit discretionary interventions to exceptional situations
of disorderly market conditions.

The external position and the
exchange rate are broadly
consistent with medium-term
fundamentals. The external debt
position does not raise concerns of
sustainability.

1/ Public sector is defined as consolidated public sector. It includes the non-financial public sector and the central bank. The stock of public debt excludes central bank bills.
2/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
3/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 3 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 3 as ae(1+r).
6/ Includes social security surplus, accumulation of deposits from the sovereign bond issuance in 2014, and financing of the national development bank.
7/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, it includes the impacts of exchange rate changes.
8/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Historical Scenario

PARAGUAY

Annex V. Spillovers from Brazil1
To assess the effect of a shock to growth in Brazil on growth in Paraguay, a set of Vector
Autoregressions (VARs) have been estimated. The main finding is that when Brazil GDP falls by
1 percentage point, on average, this is associated with a fall in Paraguay’s GDP by about ½ to
¾ percentage points; however these estimates are often imprecise and the confidence intervals may
include zero.
A standard VAR model is used to identify the dynamic response of Paraguay’s GDP to a shock to
growth in Brazil. We estimate several models with three sets of variables: global, regional and
domestic. The global variables include the VIX volatility index, the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield,
world price of soy, and the Paraguay-specific commodity terms of trade index (as in Gruss (2014) and
WHD REO (2014)). The key regional variable is, of course, Brazil GDP. The domestic variables are
Paraguay GDP and the real effective exchange rate for Paraguay. The model is estimated using
quarterly data from 1994Q1 to 2015Q3, with two lags, and all variables are expressed in quarter-onquarter growth (seasonally adjusted for GDP), except for the VIX and the U.S. interest rate, which are
expressed in levels. Global variables are ordered first, followed by Brazil GDP, and then domestic
variables, so that VIX, the U.S. interest rate and Brazil GDP do not respond to changes in Paraguay’s
conditions.2 In addition, a different specification in which the VIX and the U.S. interest rate are
exogenous was also run and is reported at the bottom of Table 1, producing similar results.

While a shock to Brazil’s GDP3 can have a sizeable effect on Paraguay, this effect is often not
statistically different from zero. In other words, the effect is imprecisely estimated, and the
confidence intervals for the cumulative effect after 4 quarters range from no effect to well over
1 percentage point (Figure 1). To a large extent this is due to the fact that economic growth in Paraguay
is very volatile, given the prominence of agriculture and electricity sectors which are dependent on the
weather. The current crisis in Brazil has had an impact on Paraguay, mainly through diminished activity
in border towns and smaller re-exports. However, other sectors of Paraguay’s economy are still
relatively resilient even as Brazil nears 8 quarters of negative growth.

Exchange Arrangement: The currency of Paraguay is the Paraguayan guaraní. The exchange
arrangement of the guaraní is floating, and the exchange rate is determined by supply and demand.
The objective of the Central Bank of Paraguay (BCP) under Article 3 of Organic Law No. 489/95 is to
preserve and safeguard the stability of the currency and promote the efficiency and stability of the
financial system. Article 50 establishes that foreign currency trading by the BCP aims to smooth
seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand and offset erratic capital flows and speculative
movements that could disrupt the market or the exchange rate. Article 47 establishes that the
exchange rate is determined by market forces. The BCP publishes information on its foreign
exchange interventions on its website. The BCP intervenes occasionally in the market to smooth the
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PARAGUAY

effects of undue fluctuation. The BCP, as the government’s financial agent, receives U.S. dollars from
the government flowing from the royalties and compensation paid by the binational hydroelectric
entities and exchanges them for guaranies at the request of the government for the purpose of
public expenditures. The BCP implemented effective July 1, 2013, a program of preannounced sales
of the U.S. dollars it purchases from the government. The new program is more transparent, better
communicated, and more consistent with an inflation-targeting regime. This program indicates in
advance the nature, frequency, and size of the BCP’s foreign exchange transactions to avoid
influencing market expectations of the exchange rate. Paraguay has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Its exchange system is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation: The Executive Board concluded the 2014 Article IV consultation in February

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the BCP was subject to a
full safeguard assessment in respect to the arrangement approved on May 31, 2006. A safeguards
assessment of the BCP was completed in October 2006. The report stated that while the BCP has
made some progress in strengthening the safeguards framework since the 2003 safeguards
assessment, vulnerabilities remain in certain areas such as financial reporting and program data
reporting to the Fund.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK UNDER JMAP
Meeting of teams. The IMF and World Bank Paraguay teams met in January 2016 to exchange views
on economic developments and the macroeconomic outlook in Paraguay, and discuss ongoing work
and work plans for the year ahead. The IMF mission also met with the World Bank’s representative in
Asuncion during the Article IV mission. This section summarizes key themes of the discussions.
The outlook for Paraguay is challenging given the regional context and will require policies to
consolidate macroeconomic stability and address structural problems. Paraguay enjoyed strong
growth over the period 2003–14 and achieved significant progress in poverty reduction.
Nevertheless, important barriers to development persist, including large infrastructure gaps, limited
capacity to execute public investment projects, and deep-rooted institutional weaknesses. The
challenge ahead is to advance the structural reform agenda, without jeopardizing the sound
macroeconomic position attained over the past decade.
In this context, the following reform areas have been identified as macro-critical:

Fiscal and public financial management framework. The fiscal responsibility law provides a
suitable anchor for fiscal sustainability, but there is scope to adopt measures to improve budgetary
processes and strengthen legal and institutional aspects of the fiscal framework. Potential fiscal risks,
including from private sector participation in infrastructure investment, need to be addressed
proactively.

Tax revenue administration. Strengthening tax administration and enforcement is necessary
to mobilize revenues while enhancing the efficiency and equity of the system. This includes measures
to strengthen sanctions against evasion, reducing exemptions, and exploring the possibilities to
broaden the tax base.

Infrastructure. Improvements in public infrastructure, including transport, electricity, and
water and sanitation are crucial to support economic development and increase potential growth.
Boosting the pro-poor delivery of public goods and services, including in education and health, will
contribute to poverty reduction and shared prosperity.

Financial system. The new banking and central bank laws should provide a robust legal basis
for risk-based regulation and supervision. There is still is a need to strengthen the prudential
oversight of the cooperative sector and foster cooperation among the different regulatory
authorities.
The division of labor between the teams would be along the following lines:

Tax revenue administration, fiscal responsibility law, and government finance statistics. The
Fund will continue to support the authorities’ efforts to improve the tax system and increase revenue
collection through technical assistance (TA). It is also envisaged that a technical assistance mission on
strengthening the legal and institutional framework for the fiscal responsibility law will take place in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

PARAGUAY

the spring of 2016. The Fund will also provide technical assistance to cement Paraguay’s transition to
the GFSM 2001 standards for its fiscal accounts, including further support to fully move towards
accrual accounting.

Financial system. The Fund will continue to provide TA on the implementation of risk-based
bank supervision and regulation and stands ready to assist in the implementation of the new
banking laws. The Fund will also provide follow-up support on stress testing of the insurance sector
and on developing monitoring tools to reduce contagion risk between the banking and insurance
sectors.

Foreign Exchange operations. The Fund will provide technical assistance to the BCP on foreign
exchange operations, including on steps to strengthen a rules-based approach to foreign exchange
interventions.

Paraguay Job Diagnostic: The Bank will undertake a comprehensive multi-sector job
diagnostic analysis to identify challenges for expanding and improving employment opportunities in
Paraguay.

State-owned enterprises and PPPs. The Bank will continue to provide TA to support the
government’s efforts to improve corporate governance, eliminate payment arrears, and technical
oversight of SOEs and strengthen the PPP institutional framework. In addition, The Bank will support
the authorities’ efforts to assess fiscal risks and contingent liabilities from SOEs.

Governance and Business Climate. The Bank will continue its support to the government’s
efforts to strengthen institutional capacity, improve governance and transparency for a more efficient
management of public resource. The Bank will support the authorities’ efforts to boost
competitiveness, through the promotion of a better investment and business climate.
Work programs. The table below lists the teams’ work programs for the year ahead.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
Meeting of teams. The IMF and IADB Paraguay teams met in November 2015 to exchange views on
economic developments in Paraguay, and discuss ongoing work and work plans for the year ahead.
The IMF mission also met with IADB staff based in Asuncion.
The IADB’s Board of Executive Directors approved in 2014 the Country Strategy with Paraguay
(2014–2018). Sovereign-guaranteed lending under the program is expected to reach approximately
US$1 billion. Under the Strategy, the national authorities and the Bank identified the following
priority sectors in which the IDB Group would focus both its financial and non-financial products and
services: (i) transportation and connectivity; (ii) water and sanitation; (iii) energy; (iv) productive
development; (v) financial sector; and (vi) public management. Furthermore, the Bank will support the
social sector through two channels: (i) with specific interventions in each of the priority sectors, in
support of the objective of reducing extreme poverty; and (ii) through a crosscutting element in the
form of interventions to support the investment of FONACIDE resources, primarily targeting
education and health.
As of November 30, 2015, the Bank’s active portfolio in Paraguay included loans for the
financing of 21 projects. The lending portfolio amounts to US$850 million, of which US$447 million
are pending disbursement. Disbursements in 2015 are expected to total US$41 million. The current
portfolio includes lending to support the Government in the following sectors: transportation
(51 percent), energy (10 percent), social sector (2 percent), financial sector (8 percent), education
(4 percent), agriculture (3 percent) and others (22 percent). The portfolio additionally includes
6 projects pending legislative ratification, amounting to US$395 million, and one project pending
signature which amounts to US$20 million. Additionally, the portfolio includes 18 loans to the private
sector for US$98 million, mostly in the financial sector.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 2016)

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for
surveillance. Paraguay has made significant improvements in the compilation and dissemination of
macroeconomic statistics, but some shortcomings persist. In February 2014, a Data ROSC mission
conducted an assessment of data quality based on the new 2012 DQAF for six datasets (national
accounts, CPI, PPI, GFS, monetary, and balance of payments and IIP statistics). The mission also
assessed Paraguay’s macroeconomic statistics against the GDDS and, at the request of the
authorities, against the SDDS; the authorities’ response to the report and the mission’s
recommendations were published on the Fund’s website on August 18, 2014. The country is a GDDS
participant.
National Accounts. National accounts estimates, broadly consistent with the guidelines of the
1993 SNA, were released in 2005. A program for changing the outdated base year (1994=100) and
implementing relevant 2008 SNA recommendations is under development. The production boundary
is broadly in line with the 1993 SNA and recently included the two binational hydroelectric
enterprises following the 2008 SNA. Nonetheless, there are no independent estimates of the nonobserved economy after 1997, and mineral exploration and own-account production are mostly
excluded. Source data for nonfinancial services, household consumption, and changes in inventories
are insufficient. Currently, the major deviations from concepts and definitions established in the
1993 SNA involve: investment in in-house development of software; investment in mineral
exploration; investment in military expenses in fixed assets; the estimation of output broken down by
market, nonmarket, and own final use components; the inclusion of work-in-progress in forestry and
livestock production; and the partial inclusion of the non-observed economy in the national
accounts. Annual GDP meets GDDS recommendations, and QNA meets DSSD timeliness
requirements (90 days)
Labor market. Since the introduction of a regular household survey in 1998, the coverage and
quality of employment and unemployment statistics have improved significantly. Since 2010, data
are released on a quarterly basis, although the latter covers the Asuncion area only. The last available
observation for the quarterly series is the fourth quarter of 2015.
Price statistics. Both the consumer (CPI) and producer price indices (PPI) are reported on a regular
and timely basis. Since January 2008, the Central Bank of Paraguay (BCP) has been using a CPI index
based on the 2005–06 household budget survey. The geographic coverage of the CPI is limited to
Greater Asunción (the capital and metropolitan area), and expenditure weights are representative of
the consumption patterns of urban households. The PPI has a base weight period of June 2010 and

The data ROSC mission found that the resources are insufficient for real sector statistics and
constrain further development, particularly the full adoption of the 1993 SNA. The authorities
have been trying to address these resource shortcomings in the context of the recent compilation of
a new CPI and the production of QNA series.
Government finance statistics. The government finance statistics (GFS) used for internal purposes
and for reporting to WHD are broadly consistent with the recommendations of the Government
Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). In early 2015, the Ministry of Finance introduced GFSM
2001 classifications and presentation for monthly budgetary central government statistics, which are
published regularly on the Ministry’s website. The asset position of the social security system is
available on a daily basis. Statistics on the central administration include data of the Postal Service
Directorate (a nonfinancial public corporation) and the statistics of the nonfinancial public sector
include data of financial public corporations—four employer social insurance schemes. These social
insurance schemes are treated as financial corporations in the monetary and financial accounts. Data
on medium- and long-term external debt are reliable and available on a monthly basis. Deficiencies
remain in recording short-term supplier and commercial credit of the public sector. The latest
available data for general government and its subsectors in the 2014 GFS Yearbook are for 2013.
However, since 1994 no outstanding debt data and no breakdowns for expenditure by function have
been provided for publication in the GFS Yearbook. Monthly and quarterly data are not reported for
publication in IFS.
Balance of payments. The classification of the balance of payments and the international
investment position (IIP) follows the recommendations of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual (BPM5). Quarterly data on balance of payments and the IIP are available from 2001 onwards,
and are reported to STA for publication in the IFS. Improvements have been made in the quality of
the external sector statistics, especially in the coverage of foreign direct investment and in the
recording of external debt transactions but some deficiencies remain. An STA mission on External
Sector Statistics assisted the BCP in September 2014 in implementing recommendations of the ROSC
mission. One of the main recommendations of the mission, submit quarterly balance of payments
and IIP data on a BPM6 basis, has not been implemented yet.
Monetary and financial statistics. Paraguay reports monetary data for the central bank and other
depository corporations (ODCs) using the standardized report forms (SRFs). An integrated monetary
database meeting the data needs of the BCP, STA, and WHD is in operation. Coverage of the ODC
survey is complete, including data on credit cooperatives. The Superintendence of Banks reports 11
of the 12 core and 7 of the 13 encouraged financial soundness indicators for deposit takers to STA
on a monthly basis.
