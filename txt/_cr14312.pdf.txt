STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
September 8, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and risks. Following an upturn in 2013, growth is expected to moderate
somewhat during 2014−2015, narrowing the positive output gap. The impact of
recovering demand in advanced economies is likely to be offset by the ongoing real
appreciation of the currency and the gradual tightening in global monetary conditions.
Transitional costs related to the economic restructuring (see next paragraph) are also
expected to dampen growth in the near term. As a very open economy, Singapore is
particularly exposed to external risks related to a protracted period of slower growth in
advanced and emerging economies, a continued buildup and eventual unwinding of
excess capacity in China, an abrupt surge in financial market volatility as investors
reassess underlying risks, and geopolitical risks.
Medium- and long-term challenges. The authorities focus squarely on the
implementation of their medium-term economic restructuring plan. With the aim to
boost the productivity of labor and land, the plan could set the stage for a new era of
sustainable growth. However, productivity improvements may take some time to
materialize. For example, the slowing inflow of foreign workers, a key part of the reform
agenda, could moderate potential growth and lower competitiveness in light of the tight
labor market. The social safety net is being strengthened in the context of a rapidly
aging population.
Policy assessment. Singapore continues to implement a strong set of macroeconomic
and financial sector policies. The moderately tight monetary policy remains appropriate
but the fiscal stance is looser than would be warranted by cyclical considerations.
The 2014 budget focuses on noncyclical considerations, including support for
companies’ efforts to raise productivity and additional social spending on healthcare for
the elderly. The authorities’ plan to raise social and infrastructure spending by
1−2 percent of GDP over the medium term should help reduce the large current account
surplus. Financial regulation and supervision is among the best globally and Singapore is
a frontrunner in implementing global regulatory reforms. Macroprudential policies have
contributed to cool the housing and car permit markets and good progress has been
made in implementing key short-term FSAP recommendations.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Introduction
1.
Singapore’s macroeconomic performance has been impressive. GDP tripled from less
than US$100 billion in 2000 to almost US$300 billion in 2013. Strong growth and low
unemployment and inflation have been achieved along with some strong social indicators (e.g. high
life expectancy and home ownership). At the same time, however, compared to high-income peers,
the labor share of income is low and inequality and the cost of living are high, adversely affecting
some population groups. Key supporting factors for Singapore’s strong growth performance have
been a stable macroeconomic environment, continuous reforms to upgrade transportation
infrastructure and the broader business climate, and a liberal regime for the inflow of foreign
workers. The economy remains well-diversified. Known as a financial center and trading hub,
Singapore retains a competitive manufacturing sector which contributes more than one sixth of
GDP.
2.
The government is implementing a medium-term reform agenda, announced in 2010,
to restructure the economy. The strong expansion of Singapore's economy since the turn of the
century has been associated with a 34 percent rise in its population, mostly driven by inflows of
foreign workers. Emphasis is now being put on measures to boost the productivity of labor and land
while reducing reliance on foreign workers. The social safety net is being strengthened and fiscal
measures are being put in place to mitigate wage disparities. The restructuring plans are being
executed against the backdrop of a tight labor market and a rapidly aging population.
3.
Macroeconomic and financial policies have been broadly in line with past Fund advice.
During the last Article IV consultation, staff recommended a somewhat restrictive overall
macroeconomic stance and vigilance against risks in the financial and housing sectors. While
welcoming the ongoing efforts to restructure the domestic economy, staff also called for further
efforts to promote external rebalancing and address demographic challenges. The authorities have
maintained their moderately tight monetary policy. The 2014 budget focused on supporting the
business community’s efforts to increase productivity and providing additional social spending on
healthcare for the elderly and needy. Moreover, amid ongoing active use of macroprudential
policies, which contributed to a welcome slowdown of mortgage loan growth, good progress has
been made in implementing key short-term FSAP recommendations.

B. Recent Developments
4.
Singapore’s economy continues to perform well. Growth recovered to 3.9 percent
in 2013, from 2.5 percent in 2012 (Figure 1). Net exports accounted for almost half of the growth,
while private and public consumption contributed the other half. Following two years of strong
growth, private investment retreated somewhat. The acceleration of growth, alongside the
policy-induced slowing inflow of foreign workers, pushed the unemployment rate to a multiyear
low. Growth decelerated in the first two quarters of 2014 (with seasonally-adjusted annualized

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

3

SINGAPORE

growth rates of 1.8 and 0.1 percent, respectively), underscoring Singapore’s strong correlation with
advanced economies’ mixed performance, and possibly reflecting transitional effects on
consumption and investment related to the restructuring of the economy. A rising trade surplus
pushed up the surplus on the current account to 18.3 percent of GDP in 2013, from 17.5 percent of
GDP in 2012 (Appendix II).
5.
Inflation has decelerated and core
inflation remains contained. A series of targeted,
escalating macroprudential policies (MaPs)
contributed to cool the housing and car permit
markets (see Box 3 of the Staff Report for the 2013
Article IV Consultation). This helped lower headline
inflation to 2.4 percent in 2013, from 4.6 percent
in 2012. However, core inflation, while still
contained at 2.2 percent in July (y/y), has edged up
from last year reflecting accumulating wage
pressures, despite some offset from relatively
benign import prices.
6.
The impact of the United States’
ongoing exit from unconventional monetary
policy (UMP) has been limited. Singapore’s
financial markets have so far absorbed bouts of
volatility associated with expectations of
U.S. tapering and the spike in global risk aversion
early this year with limited impact. This partly
reflects Singapore’s relatively small external
portfolio liabilities. Since the initial “tapering
announcement” in May 2013, the nominal
U.S. dollar/Singapore dollar exchange rate has
moved in a narrow range, displaying less volatility
than the other ASEAN-5 currencies. While the Straits Times stock market index went down by
14 percent, the losses are now down to 3 percent. At 2.3 percent, the ten-year government bond
yield is now about 70 basis points higher (Figure 2).
7.
The credit cycle continues to mature. Private credit growth to residents is decelerating
following four years of strong growth (Table 3, Figure 3). Housing loan growth moderated aided by
the June 2013 launch of the new total debt servicing ratio framework (TDSR) and the expectation of
higher interest rates in the medium term. Property prices have leveled off and housing transactions
moderated. The nonperforming loan ratio of domestic banks remained stable at about 1 percent
(Table 7).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

C. Outlook and Risks
8.

The near-term outlook for growth is favorable but inflation will likely drift up.



Growth is expected to moderate to around 3 percent during 2014−2015, narrowing the
positive output gap. Growth impetus from recovering demand in advanced economies is likely
to be offset by the ongoing real appreciation and the gradual tightening in global monetary
conditions. Meanwhile, the planned further slowing inflow of foreign workers, as part of the
ongoing economic restructuring, will moderate potential growth and lower competitiveness.



The positive output gap and labor market tightness are putting upward pressure on
wages and prices, resulting in the projected temporary pickup in core inflation to around
2.4 percent during 2014−15. The higher wages and possible shortage of labor, driven by slower
additional inflow of foreign workers as part of the ongoing economic restructuring, would help
incentivize firms to invest in labor-saving technologies and therefore raise labor productivity;
and facilitate a reallocation of economic activity toward less labor intensive and higher
value-added sectors.

9.
The medium-term outlook will be
shaped by the success of the ongoing economic
restructuring program and policy responses to
the rapid pace of population aging. Potential
GDP growth is projected to slow in the next few
years on slower labor force expansion, and then
recover gradually as faster labor productivity
growth takes hold through capital deepening and
total factor productivity growth, reaching about
3¼ percent in the medium term—well below the
pace during 2000−08. Tighter labor supply due to
slowing inflow of foreign workers in the near term
and population aging in the medium term will boost wages. With productivity gains unlikely to fully
compensate, core inflation will increase temporarily and—together with continued nominal
appreciation—push up the REER, dampening export growth. Supported by a 1−2 percentage points
of GDP increase in social and infrastructure spending, the more appreciated REER is expected to
rebalance growth toward domestic demand. Accordingly, the current account surplus is projected to
narrow gradually by about 3¾ percent of GDP to around 14½ percent of GDP over the medium
term.
10.
The baseline projections are subject to a variety of risks. As a very open city-state,
Singapore’s economy is particularly exposed to external risks (Figure 6). In addition to risks related
to external demand shocks, including owing to the continued buildup and eventual unwinding of
excess capacity in China, it could also be affected by an abrupt surge in global financial market
volatility as investors reassess underlying risks, and geopolitical risks. Singapore’s strong

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

macroeconomic fundamentals—a very strong external position, adequate level of foreign reserves,
significant fiscal buffers and strong bank balance sheets—could help absorb shocks and facilitate a
countercyclical policy response. On the domestic front, the wide-ranging structural reforms the
government is implementing could set the stage for a new era of sustainable growth over the
medium term (upside risk). However, achieving productivity improvements is unpredictable in terms
of timing and magnitude. The resulting downside risk could be mitigated by carefully calibrating the
pace of implementation of labor-market tightening measures while affirming the medium-term
targets and objectives. Delays in implementing Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) standards may adversely affect reputation and the wealth management sector.
Key risks, their transmission mechanisms, and recommended policy actions are summarized in the
Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM, Appendix I).

Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities focus was squarely on the implementation of their medium-term
economic restructuring plan. Labor productivity growth had generally been weak since 2010
though it had improved in recent quarters. While noting that the restructuring could entail transition
costs that could hold back growth temporarily, the authorities remained firmly committed to the
medium-term restructuring objectives and noted the fiscal incentives that are being provided to
enterprises to adopt labor-saving technologies and to help them weather the transition. The
authorities observed that a further pickup in G-3 demand could push core inflation beyond their
comfort zone. In that case, they would consider recalibrating macroeconomic policies as part of the
normal decision making processes. However, the authorities would be more guarded in
reconsidering the implementation pace of the restructuring plans.
12.
The authorities were confident that the economy would be able to withstand the
impact of the key external risks highlighted above. As a very open economy, Singapore has been
confronted with frequent external shocks. The authorities noted the potential indirect income
multiplier effects from shocks to Singapore’s trading partners. They noted that financial buffers are
robust owing to the continuous efforts to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory frameworks.
Balance sheets of the corporate and household sectors are strong. While a significant rise in interest
rates could cause vulnerabilities among pockets of overextended households and therefore have
social costs, this would have little systemic implications.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
13.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS) has kept its moderately tight monetary
policy stance of gradual nominal effective
exchange rate (NEER) appreciation unchanged
since April 2012. While the specific parameters of
the basket-band-crawl framework are not made
public, staff estimates that the NEER band is
appreciating at an annual rate of 2½ percent and
has a width of about ±2 percent. The NEER is now
estimated to be around the midpoint of the band.
Staff observes that in the case of Singapore
estimating the output gap and its impact on inflation has been made harder by the varying rates of
inflow of foreign workers which have acted to buffer the output gap, both in upturns and in
downturns, and limit its impact on wages and inflation. In light of this, and given that Singapore’s
very open economy is commonly subjected to a multitude of external shocks, the authorities’
medium-term orientation to their price stabilization objective is appropriate: the exchange rate is
allowed to move within the band without frequent adjustments to the parameters of the exchange
rate based monetary policy.
14.
MAS’s current moderately contractionary monetary policy stance remains appropriate
to contain demand pressures in the context of a positive output gap and improving external
demand while facilitating relative price adjustment as the economy reduces its labor intensity. The
gradual appreciation path will also help anchor inflation expectations. The authorities’ track record
with operating the exchange rate based monetary policy, both in good and in bad times, indicates
that the policy framework is robust and flexible enough to deal effectively with crises as well as
tapering-related volatility. However, a challenge may arise owing to the need to maintain a tight
monetary policy stance and potential continued downward pressure on the exchange rate
associated with the ongoing gradual normalization of monetary policy in the United States. Through
uncovered interest parity, depreciation pressures could also compound the effect of higher
U.S. interest rates on domestic interest rates, raising debt servicing costs of the household and
corporate sectors and putting downward pressure on the housing market.
15.
Singapore’s external position is assessed to be substantially stronger than what is
consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies but the current account
surplus is projected to moderate over the medium term. In addition to the current account and
the REER gaps, the external sector assessment is based on Singapore’s foreign asset and liability
position, capital and financial account flows and their trajectories as well as reserve adequacy
considerations (Appendix II). Despite a significant narrowing of the current account balance and a

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

SINGAPORE

REER appreciation of 13 percent since 2010; at 18.3 percent of GDP in 2013, the current account
appears to be 2−8 percent of GDP stronger, and the real effective exchange 4−16 percent weaker
than what is consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. The quantitative
assessment takes into account the results from different standard models and their potential
limitations and caveats1. Reflecting high levels of past current account balances, Singapore has a
very large positive NIIP position and the composition of its external balance sheet does not pose a
major source of risk. Singapore’s NIIP position is expected to increase over time, based on declining
but still sizable current account balances that are projected in the medium-term. The financial
account deficit is mainly driven by official sector flows, reflecting the reinvestment abroad of income
from large foreign assets and public sector savings, which offset sizable net positive FDI inflows. The
financial account is expected to remain in deficit as long as income from net foreign assets is
reinvested abroad. Finally, international reserves, at 93 percent of GDP, are assessed to be adequate
for precautionary purposes. Going forward, staff projects the current account to moderate further,
facilitated by increased public spending, including on social safety nets, a more even distribution of
income across generations through transfers to the elderly, and the planned slower absorption of
foreign workers. In the absence of such policy measures, higher-than-norm current account
balances would persist in the medium to long term, reinforcing these past trends, and lead to
further accumulation of net foreign assets.

Authorities’ Views
16.
The authorities were confident that the economy and financial markets would be
resilient to an orderly UMP exit. The UMP exit follows a period of unprecedented monetary
stimulus and could therefore give rise to bouts of volatility. The authorities noted that there have
been earlier episodes of rising U.S. interest rates where Singapore was able to maintain a degree of
monetary policy independence, aided by the strong underlying balance of payments position.
17.
They raised concerns over the reclassification of their external position to be
“substantially stronger” than what is consistent with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policies. While appreciating the need for consistency across countries the authorities
were troubled by the inconsistent assessment for Singapore over time. They noted that the
estimates of the current account gaps have changed from year to year. Furthermore, the change in
Singapore’s external position from “stronger”, last year, to ”substantially stronger” this year belies
the fact that over a longer period of time, external balances are correcting toward the equilibrium.
For example, the current account surplus has trended down from 24 percent of GDP in 2010 while
the REER has appreciated significantly since 2010. The increase in the current account surplus
in 2013 reflected the timing of lumpy transportation equipment imports. This was a one-off that
would correct itself. Demographic developments, increased healthcare spending, and
1

Singapore is a very open economy and an international financial center that has a large positive net international
investment position (NIIP), very high per capita income and is aging at a very high speed. These nonstandard factors
make Singapore an outlier; and the quantitative assessments of its current account and REER difficult and subject to
a wide range of uncertainty.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

investments in labor-saving technologies would narrow the current account surplus over the
medium term.

B. Financial Sector and Macroprudential Policies
18.
The 2013 FSAP update noted that Singapore’s financial regulation and supervision is
among the best globally and overall compliance with supervisory standards is high.
Singaporean banks already meet key Basel III targets for 2015, and they should have no difficulty
meeting the 10.5 percent target for 2019 required by MAS for domestic systemic banks’ Tier 1
capital ratio plus conservation buffer—which is tighter than the Basel III target. MAS’s recently
outlined new liquidity framework is in line with Basel recommendations and banks are already very
close to meeting the 2019 target for the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR, 100 percent). Staff notes good
progress in implementing the key FSAP recommendations targeted for the short term, while steps to
implement the medium-term recommendations are being considered by the authorities
(Appendix III). In particular, in view of rising household and corporate indebtedness, MAS introduced
a multiyear onsite credit inspection program for major banks, and will continue to perform credit
and thematic reviews for all banks as appropriate.
19.
Singapore is seeing a welcome deceleration of credit growth to residents, amid a
tightening of system-wide liquidity and helped by the active use of MaPs.2 Meanwhile, loans to
larger businesses and nonresidents have continued to expand rapidly driven in part by rising loans
to China. A further gradual and orderly tightening of credit conditions with the UMP exit should also
limit the further buildup of household and corporate indebtedness. The authorities should remain
vigilant on banks’ credit quality, building on their strong track record of hands-on banking
supervision.
20.
The current macroprudential policies should be maintained to promote household
deleveraging. Staff estimates that these macroprudential policies have helped to curb the excessive
increase of house prices (Box 1). Household’s balance sheets are strong in the aggregate; but there
are pockets of risks. The recent broadening of the exemptions under the total debt servicing ratio
framework (TDSR) and loan tenure rules for refinancing housing loans contracted earlier is
appropriate to allow overleveraged households to negotiate a restructuring of their debt burden.
Although house price declines can have important wealth

2

During 2011−13, credit growth remained above standard thresholds used to identify build up of risks. For instance,
the increase in the credit-to-GDP ratio (in the range of 8–15 percentage points since 2011), and the estimated
deviation of the credit-to-GDP ratio from its trend (around 13.5 percentage points in 2013) both exceeded
commonly-used thresholds (3 and 10 percentage points, respectively) for excessive credit growth and related risks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

SINGAPORE

effects, risks from interest rate increases and unemployment shocks are more pertinent for
Singapore. Staff advises to maintain the current MaPs to promote household deleveraging. In
addition, as recommended by the FSAP, the authorities should continue their efforts to collect
granular data on household balance sheets, strengthen credit bureau practices, and continue
education of over-indebted households about managing their debt prudently. With a large supply
of new housing set to come on the market in the near term, a further price easing resulting in an
undershooting of historical trends seems likely in the near term. In case of signs of excessive house
price declines, staff recommends considering a relaxation of stamp duties as this can support
demand for real estate without loosening banks’ lending standards, while maintaining prudentially
appropriate levels for more structural measures.

21.
In the aggregate, the leverage of publicly–listed corporations has remained relatively
low despite rising corporate sector indebtedness. This may reflect robust earnings performance
and higher retained earnings.3 Financially stronger firms may have taken advantage of favorable
market conditions to borrow and held on to the proceeds. Lending to SMEs, accounting for
21.6 percent of loans to domestic corporates, is subject to strong underwriting standards, highly
collateralized, and has a lower NPL ratio than that for the overall corporate sector. Nevertheless, the
risks from the gradual normalization of interest rates on the corporate sector and SMEs in particular
call for continued vigilance, including in bank supervision.

3

Based on a sample of publicly-listed Singaporean nonfinancial corporates, about 17 percent of total debt resides
with companies with a leverage ratio above 2 as of end-2013 and about 21 percent of total debt resides with
companies with an interest coverage ratio of less than 2, but given the high level of overall corporate debt, these
warrant close monitoring. A cross-country study based on end-2012 data in the April 2014 Asia and Pacific Regional
Economic Outlook found that the shares of debt owed by firms with a high leverage ratio and a low interest coverage
ratio in Singapore are among the lowest in advanced and emerging Asia.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

22.
Singapore’s status as an important financial center and host to large G-SIFIs creates
potential for spillovers from global or regional financial shocks. Singapore’s financial sector is
very large relative to its own economy, increasing the size of potential spillovers into Singapore
(Box 2). As a regional financial center, Singapore also plays an important role in the transmission of
external shocks to the region. Growing cross-border exposures of domestic banks in the region,
including in China, have also increased these spillover risks.4 A resilient domestic banking sector and
strong regulatory and supervisory frameworks are critical not only for domestic financial stability but
also to limit spillovers to the rest of the region. For instance, when deleveraging European banks
reduced trade financing activity in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, Singapore’s domestic
banks provided stability and increased their market share, along with banks from Japan and
Australia. In addition, MAS recently proposed a stronger regulatory framework for domestic
systemically important banks (D-SIBs)5, which should help reduce risks of further propagation of
external financial shocks.
23.
Spillover risks underscore the importance of strong liquidity management. Singaporean
banks’ reliance on the foreign currency swap market poses risks because this market can seize up
during periods of severe financial stress. Foreign currency liquidity remains low, with the
non-Singapore dollar loan-to-deposit ratio at a multi-year high of 128 percent as of
September 2013 and a further rise through the first quarter of 2014. In light of this, the continued
monitoring of banks’ foreign currency liquidity management is a priority, and staff welcomes MAS’s
encouragement to banks to step up efforts to increase U.S. dollar deposit taking and issuing
U.S. dollar debt to finance their U.S. dollar lending. In addition, considering difficulties in raising
stable U.S. dollar funding, the authorities are encouraged to make banks develop contingency plans
for low foreign currency swap market liquidity.6
24.
Efforts to strengthen the AML/CFT framework should continue. The reputational risks
from opaque ownership structures in the offshore wealth management sector that can allow it to
be used to harbor or as a conduit for illicit assets should not be underestimated. In particular, any
change in perceptions about Singapore’s good reputation could have adverse effects on the
industry. In light of this, effective implementation of and compliance with the evolving international
AML standards, particularly relating to transparency of companies and trusts, and enhancing
cooperation with other jurisdictions is important. Staff notes that Singapore made the evasion of
certain foreign taxes a predicate crime for money laundering in July 2013. Singapore’s next
AML/CFT assessment by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is scheduled for 2015.

4

Cross-border loans to China are mainly trade bills (65 percent) and interbank loans (25 percent) and make up about
12 percent and 8 percent of total loans for domestic and foreign banks, respectively.
5

The proposed D-SIB framework includes higher loss absorbency, LCR, recovery and resolution planning, risk
disclosure and effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting requirements. In addition, foreign bank branches
with a significant retail presence would be required to locally incorporate their retail operations.
6

The authorities decided not to introduce a separate USD LCR due to the inefficiencies this would entail for
international banking groups.

Authorities’ Views
25.
Singapore’s financial sector is in a strong position thanks to continuous improvements
in the regulatory and supervisory framework. The industry-wide stress test conducted by MAS
shows that banks are resilient to a broad array of adverse macroeconomic shocks,7 reflecting their
strong starting positions. In the experience of the authorities, the foreign currency swap market is
relatively deep and it did not seize up during the global financial crisis. The country’s strong official
reserve position would only be used in case of an extreme stress event and not to provide support
to individual banks.
26.
AML/CFT policies and issues are taken very seriously. Financial Institutions (FIs) are
subject to a comprehensive AML/CFT regulatory regime, which includes customer due diligence,
ongoing account monitoring and suspicious transaction reporting requirements. FIs have also
undertaken a critical tax-risk review of their existing accounts to assess the tax legitimacy of assets
booked. Legislative changes made in 2013, and the findings of the Global Forum on Transparency
and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes mean that Singapore’s exchange of information
regime is in line with the internationally-agreed standard, that ownership and identity information is
available for all types of companies, partnerships and trusts, and that overall compliance with filing
and reporting obligations is very high.

C. Fiscal Policy and the Economic Restructuring
27.
Singapore has maintained a very prudent fiscal policy framework, building up
significant financial buffers. The Constitution mandates a balanced budget over the political cycle
while allowing the use of up to half of the projected average long-term investment income
generated from the government’s financial assets (equivalent to 2.1 percent of GDP in the
FY 2014/15 budget). Historically, Singapore’s fiscal policy has been more prudent than implied by
these fiscal rules. Moreover, in a presentation based on GFSM 2001, which takes into account all
investment income and receipts from sales of land, Singapore’s fiscal balances are stronger still.
Accordingly, the fiscal surplus in FY 2013/14 is estimated at 5.7 percent of GDP (Table 5).
28.
Initiatives in the FY 2014/15 budget continue to focus on medium-term objectives of
boosting productivity, raising inclusiveness, and coping with the projected sharp increase in
the old-age dependency ratio. Among other initiatives, the FY 2014/15 budget (April 2014March 2015) extended and enhanced transfers and subsidies to businesses to help them adopt
more efficient production technologies (e.g., through the Productivity and Innovation Credit
Scheme). This would help improve the prospects for potential output. The budget also established a
new extra-budgetary fund to cover health care costs for the elderly (Pioneer Generation Fund). The
seed money transferred to the new fund (2 percent of GDP) will initially be saved and disbursed over

conditions would warrant a somewhat restrictive fiscal stance in the near term, the budget implies a
fiscal impulse of about ¾ percent of GDP in FY 2014/15. This is smaller than the estimated fiscal
impulse of about 1¼ percent of GDP in FY 2013/14. The fiscal impulse is expected to turn out
smaller still, on spending falling somewhat short of the FY 2014/15 budget as has been the case in
the last few years.
29.
The cyclical concerns of a slightly expansionary fiscal stance in spite of a positive
output gap are outweighed by the medium-term merits of expanding the social safety net
and enhancing prospects for potential growth. The overall macroeconomic impact could be
managed by a tighter monetary policy stance. In view of the complex fiscal accounting system and
the increasing importance of financial flows to and from extra-budgetary funds, staff suggests that
more work be done, and publicly disseminated, on the calculation of the fiscal impulse. This could
include timely disclosure of fiscal data on a consolidated general government basis as well as
publishing, as a reference, general government-based budget estimates at the time of budget
announcements.
30.
Over the medium term, fiscal policy needs to accommodate the future expansion of
the social safety net to reduce inequality and to cope with the rapid aging of Singapore’s
population in a fiscally sustainable way. Singapore is among the fastest aging advanced countries
with an old-age dependency ratio projected to more than double by 2030 (Figure 5). The defined
contribution pension system limits aging-related contingent liabilities for the government. And the
relatively efficient health care system is an advantage in financing the costs of old age. Nevertheless,
aging and the potential inadequacy of retirement savings can be expected to provide upward
pressure on government spending. The authorities expect government spending to increase by
1−2 percent of GDP over the medium term, mainly due to social and infrastructure spending. This
increase could be financed by a combination of higher revenue from progressive taxes and using a
larger share of the investment income on accumulated past surpluses. There is also scope to
enhance the transparency of the management of the government’s financial assets, while paying
due consideration to the market impact aspects.
31.
There is scope to enhance the predictability and sense of social security derived from
the multitude of initiatives and programs that have been launched in recent years. Recent
budgets have initiated several specific measures to address population aging and to enhance
inclusiveness. However, the overall coverage of these measures may be difficult for the public to
grasp. These measures could be streamlined and made more efficient by merging the various
schemes into one or two meaningful and predictable benefits. This would also allow the public to
have a better sense of social security and adjust precautionary savings accordingly.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

SINGAPORE

32.
The effectiveness of the Central Provident Fund (CPF) to provide retirement savings
could be enhanced. Home ownership plays a very important role in Singapore.8 The CPF has a bias
toward house purchases.9 There is room to enhance mechanisms to facilitate monetizing real estate
assets to supplement retirement savings, including by developing well-functioning reverse
mortgage schemes. The older generation of Singaporeans is receiving low but risk free returns on
their retirement savings. Despite the subdued outlook for investment returns on pension savings,
there is scope to let contributors to the CPF share more in the upside to investment returns, thereby
letting them have a bigger share of the dividends from their country’s success.
33.
Policies to increase productivity through investment in education and infrastructure
and structural labor market policies will also be critical in facing the challenges of an aging
population. The greater educational attainment of younger cohorts will likely moderate the impact
of demographic shifts. Continued investment in education and infrastructure can contribute to the
success of the ongoing restructuring to enhance productivity. Labor participation rates are already
high but there could be some scope to raise women’s participation rates further and policies should
continue to focus on raising fertility rates. Policy measures could target improving the availability of
childcare facilities, part-time or flexible work arrangements and job-matching and placement
programs.

Authorities’ Views
34.
The authorities noted that the additional spending that underlies the positive fiscal
impulse is aimed at boosting productivity and would thereby help close the output gap over
the medium term. The restructuring program is imposing some transitional costs on the corporate
sector and the broader economy. Additional government spending on infrastructure and subsidies
to SMEs should provide relief and facilitate the adoption of labor-saving technologies. The
government typically takes a medium-term view of the budget and the risks of revenue over- and
under-performance are broadly balanced. The revenue over-performance in recent years was due to
unexpectedly buoyant demand for real estate and vehicles. These markets might now be at an
inflection point, making it hard to forecast revenue.
35.
The government continues to look for ways to further strengthen the CPF and the
support for low-income households. Housing grants and the appreciation of home equity have
been major parts of Singapore’s social security system, especially for the earlier generations.

8

Home ownership is among the highest in the world and home equity represents a very important share of
households’ total assets. For several decades, the Housing and Development Board has been overseeing the
development of public housing and encouraging home ownership by providing subsidies and concessional housing
loans, particularly to lower-income groups. As a result, the bulk of the total housing stock consists of public housing
which is available almost exclusively for citizens (permanent residents with family nuclei can purchase public housing
in the secondary market while foreigners can purchase in the much smaller private housing segment).
9

Withdrawals from CPF ordinary accounts are allowed at any time to purchase a property or to service a mortgage.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

Singapore has also established and enhanced several programs and schemes to better support the
needs of the low-income households. For many of these schemes, eligible recipients are
automatically enrolled, thus providing them with convenience and a greater sense of security.
Risk-free investment returns of up to 3.5 percent on CPF ordinary savings accounts and up to
5 percent on medical and special accounts are relatively high among countries with defined
contribution scheme. Also, CPF members can choose many options with higher risk-return profiles.
Up to 50 percent of government’s net investment returns are channeled to the budget, ensuring a
more progressive and targeted sharing of these earnings compared to raising the CPF interest rates,
which would benefit members with larger balances. Nevertheless, as announced in the President’s
speech to the reopened Parliament recently, the government plans to further improve CPF savings
and annuities schemes to better prepare Singaporeans financially for retirement.
36.
The authorities pointed at the transparency of the Government Investment
Corporation (GIC) and Temasek. Both publish annual reports. Temasek’s annual report provides a
summary of its group financial results based on audited financial statements, as well as data of
Temasek’s portfolio, shareholder returns and its governance and investment frameworks. GIC
discloses its 5, 10 and 20-year returns, and its portfolio management and governance structure. The
Ministry of Finance also provides detailed information about its reserves management and the role
of the President as the custodian of the reserves on its website. The government does not disclose
GIC’s assets under management in light of national security and strategic considerations.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Following a recovery in 2013, growth is expected to moderate somewhat
during 2014−2015. Headline inflation has decelerated owing to moderating real estate and car
permit prices, but the positive output gap, although narrowing, has been exerting upward pressure
on core inflation. Recovering demand in advanced economies is likely to be offset by the ongoing
real appreciation and the gradual tightening in global monetary conditions. Key external risks to the
outlook remain a protracted period of slower growth in advanced and emerging economies, a
continued buildup and eventual unwinding of excess capacity in China, an abrupt surge in financial
market volatility as investors reassess underlying risks, and geopolitical risks.
38.
Singapore continues to implement a strong set of macroeconomic policies. The
moderately tight monetary policy stance of gradual appreciation of the nominal effective exchange
rate of the Singapore dollar that has been maintained over the past two years remains appropriate.
While cyclical conditions would warrant a somewhat restrictive fiscal stance in the near term,
the 2014 budget implies a modest fiscal impulse. The additional spending accounting for this is
aimed at boosting productivity and would thereby help close the output gap over the medium term.
39.
Singapore’s financial regulation and supervision is among the best globally, but
continued efforts to effectively implement evolving international regulatory and AML/CFT
standards are critical. The nonperforming loan ratio of domestic banks remained stable at about

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

SINGAPORE

1 percent. Good progress has been made in implementing key short-term FSAP recommendations
and the authorities are encouraged to implement the remaining recommendations. In light of banks’
continued reliance on foreign currency swap markets to address currency mismatches,
strengthening foreign-currency liquidity management practices remains a priority. The authorities
should continue their efforts to effectively implement and comply with evolving international
AML/CFT standards, in particular the strengthened measures preventing the laundering of funds
that have evaded foreign taxes and the proposed measures to prevent misuse of ownership
structures.
40.
Efforts to promote household deleveraging should continue. While corporate loan
growth has remained firm, housing loan growth has moderated aided by the June 2013 launch of
the new total debt servicing ratio framework (TDSR) and the expectation of higher interest rates in
the medium term. The current MaPs to promote household deleveraging should be maintained.
41.
The authorities’ medium-term economic restructuring plan is ambitious. The plan’s
measures to boost the productivity of labor and land could set the stage for a new era of
sustainable growth. However, productivity improvements may take some time to materialize.
Therefore, against the backdrop of a tight labor market, the ongoing slowing inflow of foreign
workers, which is a key part of the reform agenda, could moderate potential growth and lower
competitiveness.
42.
Efforts to strengthen the social safety net should continue. In addition to supporting
companies’ efforts to raise productivity, the 2014 budget focuses on providing additional social
spending on healthcare for the elderly. The authorities’ intention to strengthen the modalities of the
main pension scheme and plans to raise social and infrastructure spending by 1−2 percent of GDP
over the medium term could help consolidate support for low-income households.
43.
Singapore’s external position is substantially stronger than what is consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies but the current account surplus is
projected to moderate over the medium term. Singapore is a very open economy that has a large
positive net international investment position (NIIP), very high per capita income and is aging at a
very high speed; which make a quantitative assessment of its current account and REER difficult. This
is reflected in staff’s wide range of current account and REER gap estimations. Despite the wide
range of uncertainty, the gaps are assessed to be relatively large. Since 2010, Singapore’s current
account has narrowed considerably and the REER appreciated substantially, which are consistent
with the ongoing economic rebalancing. Increased public spending, including on social safety nets, a
more even distribution of consumption across generations, and the planned slower absorption of
foreign workers would contribute to further moderate the current account.
44.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Singapore be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. Singapore: Housing and Household Sector Developments and
Macroprudential Policies
Singapore’s housing market is cooling. Both private and public house price growth turned negative in late-2013, and
declined by 1.3 percent and 1.6 percent (q/q), respectively, in the first quarter of 2014. Indicators on the quantity side
also indicate a softening of the market: the number of housing transactions has been decreasing; house supply
conditions, which had tightened in the mid-2000s due
to rising population, have been easing; and vacancy
rates are rising. Going forward, further downward
pressure on house price is expected with a large supply
of new housing set to come on the market in the
coming years.
The housing market moderation was aided by
macroprudential policies (MaPs). Since 2009, MAS has
implemented a wide range of MaPs, including stamp
duties, lower loan-to-value (LTV) ceilings, higher
minimum cash payment requirements, caps on loan
tenors, and the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR)
framework. Tighter limits are applied to riskier
segments of the housing market, such as
nonowner­occupied housing, owners of multiple properties, companies, and foreigners. The authorities’ targeted
approach is informed by efficiency and effectiveness considerations. The introduction of new MaP measures has
often been followed by incremental tightening steps and refinements. Most recently, the TDSR was refined to
facilitate deleveraging of overextended households. In February 2014, MAS broadened exemptions for refinancing of
owner-occupied housing loans that preexisted before the implementation of the TDSR rules. Similar adjustments
were made to the mortgage servicing ratio of public housing loans and loan tenure limits.
The banking sector has high exposure to the private housing market, but its credit risk profile has improved.
Household housing loans accounted for 28 percent of domestic banks’ assets in 2014:Q1. The majority of these
loans are provided to finance private properties whose prices are higher and historically more volatile than those of
public housing. Since the implementation of the MaPs, the share of borrowers with multiple housing loans and the
share of housing loans with high LTV ratios have both been decreasing. The TDSR framework, introduced in
June 2013, limited the banks’ exposure to overextended households with a built-in buffer to interest rate
normalization in the medium term by using a higher rate (3.5 percent rather than the current market rate of
1.8 percent) in its calculation.
Households’ balance sheets are strong in the aggregate; but there are pockets of vulnerability. Benefitting from the
price appreciation of houses—which represent 48 percent of household assets—net household wealth rose until
recently, and its level is among the highest in the world. However, since 2008, household debt as a share of
disposable income is on a gradual rise. In addition, the debt-servicing burden is not equally spread across the
population. MAS estimates that about 30‒35 percent of household have a TDSR above 40 percent, and 5‒10 percent
of households have a TDSR above 60 percent. A high share of mortgages linked to variable rates (about 70 percent
of the outstanding stock by value and about a half by numbers) poses risks to households and to banks through
their credit exposure.

Box 2. Singapore: Financial Sector
Singapore’s financial sector is large relative to its economy, is bank-based and mainly intermediates financial
1/
flows with East Asia and Europe. Singapore’s financial sector had about S$2.7 trillion (737 percent of GDP) in assets
in 2013. Commercial banks make up 78 percent of the financial system and although the local banks have increased
their share over time, foreign banks still make up about 67 percent of the banking system assets. East Asia and Europe
are the most important regions for Singapore’s offshore banking system. Cross-border funding and exposures in East
Asia involve both banks and nonbank customers, while exposures in Europe involve mainly banks, reflecting intra-group
funding activity of foreign branches. Singapore has developed to become an important global financial center for FX
trading and bond issuance as well. FX trading activity in Singapore is the third largest after New York and London and
has a large global share of trading activity in major regional currencies. Singapore’s wealth management industry has
also grown rapidly in recent years, with assets under management (AUM) amounting to about US$1.4 trillion as of
2/
end-2013.
Singapore’s financial sector has been an important driver of its economy. The contribution of Singapore’s financial
sector to its GDP has grown from 9 percent in 2000 to 11 percent in 2013. During this period, the overall economy grew
at an average annual rate of 5.5 percent, and the financial sector contributed about 0.76 percent per annum on average
to the headline GDP growth. Financial sector exports accounted for 14 percent of services exports and 5½ percent of
GDP, while net financial services exports was about 3 percent of GDP on average during 2000−2013. Singapore’s
financial sector has achieved high productivity growth over the past decade, surpassing productivity growth in other
3/
financial centers and has the highest level of labor productivity across different sectors in Singapore.
Financial services sector growth has been more volatile than other services sectors in Singapore and has been
negatively correlated with global risk sentiment. The financial services sector growth tends to be more volatile
compared to other services sectors and relative to total value-added growth, adding to total output volatility in the
economy. Compared to other advanced economies and financial centers, the relative volatility of Singapore’s finance
sector (relative to total value-added) is lower, which reflects Singapore’s higher overall volatility of growth. Financial
services activity is also negatively correlated with global risk sentiment as measured by the VIX index, increasing during
periods of low risk sentiment.
Beyond its direct contribution to growth, the financial sector has important two-way linkages with the rest of
the economy. Singapore’s position as an important regional port suggests positive feedback effects in terms of the
development of the commodities and FX trading markets, as well as trade finance and insurance services. Singapore is
also host to many multinational companies (MNCs). MNCs location decision may have been influenced by the existence
of an international financial center. Similarly, the existence of MNCs may have had positive spillovers on the financial
sector by providing demand for global treasury operations and other international financial services. The financial
services sector may also have had positive spillovers to other service industries such as business services, through
cluster effects given the interconnections.
Several factors will shape the further development of Singapore’s financial center. First, growth prospects and
wealth accumulation in ASEAN and South East Asia will be important as these regions constitute core markets for
Singapore’s financial center. In light of this, expansion of ASEAN’s inter- and intra-regional linkages would also benefit
Singapore’s financial sector. Second, the maintenance of a world-class regulatory and supervisory system, through
continuous upgrading, will be key given Singapore’s role as host to major GSIFIs. Third, to remain a leader, it will be
important to continue to develop new financial sector niches, such as the rapidly developing market for renminbi.

2/ Based on data from Monetary Authority of Singapore, 2013 Singapore Asset Management Industry Survey.
3/ Singapore’s higher labor productivity growth may reflect a relatively lower initial level of productivity and catch-up growth.
However, the level of labor productivity may not be measured consistently across different financial centers, due to differences in the
measurement of value-added and employment. Productivity growth may therefore be a more reliable indicator across different
jurisdictions.

Direct and intraregional trade linkages. Singapore’s high degree
of openness and position as a financial center and a trading
hub would imply large spillovers from advanced economies’
slower growth. High household indebtedness and potential
asset price corrections could exacerbate a slowdown in
economic activity, with potential spillovers to banks.
Financial linkages. Exposure to Europe and the U.S. is limited
for domestic banks; but significant for offshore banks.
Potential inward spillovers from banks in advanced markets
with significant presence in Singapore’s domestic market.

Medium to
High

Should domestic demand weaken
substantially, use temporary and
targeted fiscal stimulus, loosen
monetary policy and recalibrate MaPs
as necessary while maintaining
financial stability. In the longer run,
diversify the economy further to be
able to tap demand from fastergrowing regions, including Asia.

Direct and intraregional trade linkages. A significant slowdown
in China would have both direct and indirect effects on
Singapore’s exports, on the back of increasing direct trade
links between China and the region. China is also the second
largest source of tourists for Singapore. Domestic demand
would also be hit through worsening investment sentiment.
Financial linkages. Although most of the domestic banks’
lending to China is in the form of trade finance, total
exposures have grown to around 50 percent of GDP.
Widespread corporate defaults could lead to rising NPLs.
More broadly, given Singapore’s role as a financial center,
financial stress in China could lead to a decline in investor
sentiment, pullback of funding and market volatility.

Medium to
High

Provide temporary and targeted fiscal
support and loosen monetary policy
to offset headwinds from a potential
slowdown.
Continue to monitor banks’ exposures
to China and the rest of the region.
Use prudential policies and bank
supervision to ensure risks are
managed well.

Medium

Ensure financial institutions maintain
prudent risk management practices
and have adequate liquidity and
capital buffers. Maintain close links
with home country supervisors.
Recalibrate macroprudential policies
to mitigate financial sector stress. In
an extreme event, the strong official
reserve position could provide an
additional cushion. Swap lines with
other central banks complement this.

Decline in financial sector activity could slow growth. Financial
sector activity is an important driver of the economy and is very
sensitive to global risk sentiment.
Asset price corrections due to sustained capital flow reversals
and higher-than-expected increases in interest rates could affect
growth prospects through wealth effects and deteriorate banks’
capital, especially in light of the elevated levels of household
and corporate debt and prevalence of variable interest rates.
Liquidity risks owing to sudden retrenchment of interbank—
including intra-group—funding of offshore banks and funding
pressures due to foreign currency liabilities of domestic banks.
Decline in collateral values and wealth effects could trigger a
fall in economic activity and bank lending with further adverse
feedback effects on household indebtedness and property
prices.

Medium

Adjust macroprudential policies while
safeguarding financial stability. Use
targeted fiscal transfers to households
whose debt servicing capacity is
adversely affected.

Sharp increase in unit labor costs and loss of competitiveness.
Achieving productivity improvements is unpredictable in
terms of timing and magnitude. Rising wages without
compensating productivity gains would increase unit labor
costs, squeeze profit margins and reduce competitiveness.
This could lead to business closures and worker layoffs, in
particular among SMEs. NPLs would rise and mortgage
quality would decline on elevated unemployment.
Higher potential growth. Although Singapore is at the
technological frontier in many sectors, there is scope for
productivity increases through economic restructuring
towards higher-value added sectors and raising productivity
in sectors where Singapore faces productivity gaps.

Medium

The pace of implementation of
tightening the labor market should be
carefully calibrated to minimize
transitional costs. Temporary and
targeted fiscal transfers to help SMEs
during the transition could also be
effective.
Continue to increase public spending
on health, education and
infrastructure to provide a supporting
environment to increase productivity.

Decline in cross-border banking activity. Uncertainty about
regulatory reform and uneven progress across major
jurisdictions could lead to regulatory arbitrage, financial
fragmentation and a decline in cross-border banking activity.
Reputational risks. If risks related to opaque ownership
structures in the wealth management sector are not
adequately addressed, any change in perceptions about
Singapore’s good reputation could have adverse effects on
the viability of the industry.

Medium

Ensure regulatory standards and risk
management practices keep up with
international regulatory norms.
Continue to maintain collaboration
with financial sector supervisors in
other major jurisdictions. Fully
implement international AML
standards. Ensure service providers
report suspicious transactions, and
close accounts where supporting
evidence of beneficial ownership is
incomplete.

Binding supply constraints amid economic restructuring and a
positive output gap could lead to strong inflationary
pressures and rising inflation expectations, putting significant
strain on monetary policy.

Medium

Tighten monetary policy to stabilize
inflationary pressures. Accelerate
structural reforms to accommodate
the faster restructuring of the
economy and increase productivity.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative
likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of
the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix II. Singapore—External Sector Developments and
Assessment
Current account and real effective exchange rate (REER). After narrowing by about 6 percentage
points during 2010‒2012, Singapore’s current account surplus increased slightly in 2013 to reach
18.3 percent of GDP. The REER continued on its appreciation path, mainly reflecting the nominal
effective appreciation of the Singapore dollar as relative inflation differentials declined. Despite the
recent narrowing, Singapore’s current account surplus is one of the highest in the world and high
relative to other financial centers. Historically, a very high savings rate (both public and private) has
underpinned Singapore’s current account. High public sector savings are driven by Singapore’s
prudent fiscal policy framework, which involves a balanced budget rule over the political cycle and a
cap on the transfer to the budget of investment returns earned on government assets. In fact, fiscal
policy has been more prudent than implied by these fiscal rules. The relatively limited social safety
nets, a rapid pace of projected aging, the mandatory defined-contribution pension scheme, and
greater income inequality than in other countries may have contributed to the high level of private
savings. High corporate savings represent another important driver of private savings in Singapore
while its status as a financial center may have also contributed to precautionary saving motives1. The
narrowing of the current account since 2010 is expected to be structural and continue in the
medium term. In addition to the adjustment in the rest of the world, the narrowing of Singapore’s
current account will be driven by Singapore’s economic restructuring, rapidly aging population,
lower public sector savings and enhanced social safety nets. Consistent with these structural trends,
the REER is expected to continue to appreciate in the medium term.
Foreign asset and liability position. Singapore has a large positive net international investment
position, reflecting large net portfolio assets and official reserves. Although the size of official
foreign assets held by Government Investment Corporation, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, is
unknown, it likely accounts for a considerable share of the portfolio holdings. Gross assets and
liabilities are significant relative to GDP, which implies that valuation changes are an important
driver of changes in the foreign asset and liability position. The high net foreign asset position of
Singapore does not seem to make a significant contribution to the current account through the
income balance given the higher income paid on IIP liabilities (mainly FDI) than on assets (portfolio
and official reserves). Singapore’s NIIP position is expected to increase over time, based on declining
but still sizable current account balances that are projected in the medium term.
Capital and financial accounts. Singapore has a fully open capital account. The financial account
deficit is mainly driven by official sector flows, reflecting the reinvestment abroad of income from
large foreign assets. These flows tend to co-move with the global financial cycle. Net FDI inflows are
also significant and have historically been driven by foreign investment in the financial services
1

See Singapore—Staff Report for the 2013 Article IV Consultation, Appendix 2 for a more detailed discussion of
corporate savings and other structural factors that contribute to Singapore’s strong external position.

SINGAPORE

sector. Net bank-related flows are relatively small but gross banking sector-related flows are
significant and highly volatile. Financial account is expected to remain in deficit as long as income
from net foreign assets is reinvested abroad.
Reserve adequacy. There is no standard quantitative metric to assess reserve adequacy for
advanced economies. Staff’s assessment of reserve adequacy takes into account Singapore’s
position as an international financial center that does not issue a reserve currency which implies
potential precautionary need for reserves in periods of market distress and low foreign exchange
liquidity1. Singapore has a large stock of short-term external debt (344 percent of GDP in 2013),
which mainly reflects the cross-border activities of its large international banking system and would
therefore call for generous reserve buffers. However, about 80 percent of banks’ short-term
liabilities are covered by their short-term external financial assets, and FSAP’s U.S. dollar liquidity
stress tests last year showed that the banking sector’s FX funding gap over a one-year horizon
would be about 50 billion U.S. dollars, which is easily covered by Singapore’s official reserves (at
270 billion U.S. dollars). In addition, Singapore’s strong framework for effective supervision of banks
and ability to access swap lines with major central banks in case of a generalized funding stress
would reduce the need to have significant reserve buffers. Reserve buffers also serve an important
role in the implementation of monetary policy under Singapore’s managed exchange rate system.
With the nominal effective exchange rate used as the intermediate target, intervention is undertaken
as required to achieve monetary policy’s inflation and output goals. Based on considerations for
both precautionary needs and the effective implementation of the monetary policy framework,
Singapore’s current levels of reserves appear adequate and there is no clear case for further reserve
accumulation.
Quantitative assessment of the current account and the REER. Singapore is a very open
economy that serves as a regional financial center and trading hub. Its export and import shares
relative to GDP are one of the highest in the world (190½ percent and 167½ percent of GDP
in 2013), and changes in its current account are relatively large, making quantitative assessments
difficult (Figure II.1). Singapore is also an outlier with respect to its income per capita, pace of aging,
and NIIP position, limiting the applicability of quantitative assessments based on cross-country
econometric models.

We use MAS’s official reserves in the assessment of reserve adequacy as opposed to the total foreign assets of the
public sector, given the more liquid nature of MAS’s foreign reserves.

6/ Singapore is not part of the EBA sample. The etimates are obtained by applying EBA regression

Standard CGER-like models and the EBA model were used to assess the external balance. The CGER
equilibrium real exchange rate method implies that the REER is 17 percent stronger than warranted
by medium-term fundamentals.2 Macroeconomic balance (MB) approach allowing for a financial
center dummy (staff’s preferred MB approach specification) and the external sustainability approach
imply a CA surplus of 8‒8½ percent of GDP as the norm consistent with medium-term
fundamentals, and a CA gap of 6−6½ percent of GDP relative to staff’s medium­term CA projection
of 14.5 percent of GDP.3 EBA-like estimates imply a CA balance norm of 17½ percent of GDP
for 2013 in cyclically-adjusted terms, suggesting a CA gap of about 3 percent of GDP relative to the
cyclically-adjusted CA balance in 2013.4 In the MB and EBA models, the current level of NFA is used
2

This result is in contrast with CGER and EBA-like models for the assessment of the current account and likely reflects
the inclusion of a fixed effect together with the U-Shaped pattern of the actual REER since the mid-1990s, leading to
a fitted series that—for methodological reasons rather than fundamental economic considerations—is flatter than
the actual REER series.
3

The financial center dummy may capture precautionary saving motives, a high level of net foreign assets and other
characteristics that are associated with financial centers affecting saving and investment decisions.
4

Singapore is not in the sample used to estimate the EBA models because it is an outlier along several dimensions
(e.g. the NFA position, per capita income, fiscal balance and the aging speed) and nonlinearities in their impacts on
the CA would not be captured in the EBA framework. That said, the EBA CA framework, appropriately adjusted for the

as an explanatory variable and if the high NFA level is interpreted as a byproduct of past excessive
surpluses, the CA balance norm may be overstated. For the ES approach, the current level of NFA is
implicitly assumed to be optimal, and could also overstate the norm in cases like Singapore with a
large NFA position. Based on these model estimates and reflecting the wide range of uncertainty in
the case of Singapore, the current account gap is assessed to have a range of 2‒8 percent of GDP.
With respect to the REER, staff assesses that the real exchange rate is around 4‒16 percent weaker
than warranted by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. This estimate is drawn from
the CA assessment and relies on a semi-elasticity of the CA with respect to the REER of about 0.5,
consistent with Singapore’s high level of openness. It therefore reflects the uncertainty in the
underlying CA assessment and the semi-elasticity of the CA with respect to the REER. Despite the
wide range of quantitative assessments for the current account and REER gaps, they are still large
relative to other countries covered in the External Sector Report (ESR).
Overall assessment. Based on the range of quantitative assessments and the associated policy
gaps, a large positive NIIP position which is expected to increase in the medium term, continuation
of a deficit in the financial account and adequate levels of foreign reserves, the external position is
assessed to be substantially stronger than what is consistent with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policies. However, this assessment and the size of the imbalance are subject to a wide
range of uncertainty reflecting Singapore’s very open economy and position as a global trading and
financial center. From a multilateral perspective, and consistent with the authorities’ current policies,
increased public spending, a stronger social safety net, a more-even distribution of income across
generations, helped by an expected slower absorption of foreign workers are expected to contribute
to further moderate the current account.

special characteristics of Singapore, can still be informative. Applying the EBA coefficients to Singapore suggests that
the CA surplus is mainly explained by the high level of productivity, the large fiscal surplus and high rate of aging,
plus a dummy regressor for status as a financial center, and its large NFA position. Of the EBA-estimated CA gap of
3 percent of GDP, two percentage points is identified as policy gaps (driven by the fiscal balance (both in Singapore
and in the rest of the world) and public spending on health care) and the remaining 1 percentage point of GDP is the
residual.

Increased attention to onsite inspections of
banks’ credit risk.

2.

Monitor LCR ratios for significant foreign
currencies.

3.

Mitigate legal risks to CCPs from conflicts of law
across jurisdictions.
The CCPs to explore with members the
possibility of widening their collateral pool and
examine the feasibility of receiving Singapore
government securities as collateral to improve
access to central bank liquidity in times of stress.
Consider subjecting loans for owner-occupied
housing to a limit to be set by MAS.
Encourage overextended households to reduce
their leverage.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MAS has enhanced the CRAFT guidance to require greater
attention to sectors where banks have material credit
exposure. In addition, MAS has instituted a multiyear credit
onsite inspection schedule for major banks in 2013:
i. Where credit risk is key to the risk profile of the bank,
there will be periodic onsite reviews of the bank’s credit
exposure which will include review of credit files to
assess banks’ underwriting and loan grading standards,
adequacy of provisions and quality of credit exposures.
ii. Where sector concentration concerns have been noted
in the bank’s risk assessment, the review will also focus
on credit files belonging to borrowers from the
particular sector.
Where necessary, thematic inspections of credit risk will be
conducted.
MAS collects LCR data for Singapore dollar, U.S. dollar and
consolidated currency from all banks on an annual basis, as
well as on a semi-annual basis for major banks. Once
Basel III LCR requirements are implemented in January 2015,
such LCR data will be submitted and monitored on a
monthly basis.
MAS continues to actively engage other foreign regulators
to mitigate any cross-border regulatory risks to CCPs.
SGS already qualifies as eligible collateral. Nonetheless, SGX
will conduct a review, targeted for completion by
December 2014, to explore the feasibility of increasing the
amount of SGS held as collateral.
MAS is in the process of considering the need to subject
owner-occupied housing loans to a limit.
MAS enhanced rules on the prudent use of credit card and
other unsecured credit facilities in December 2013. The rules
include preventing financial institutions from extending
further credit to overextended borrowers. MAS also
implemented the Total Debt Servicing Ratio Framework
(TDSR) in June 2013 to encourage overextended households
to reduce their leverage. The authorities continue to warn
households of the risks of overleveraging through outreach
and education. The December 2013 Financial Stability Review
(FSR) contained a special feature box item warning of the
risks of overleveraging. Credit Counselling Singapore helps
overleveraged households to restructure and bring down
their debt over time. The national financial education
programme educates consumers about managing debt
prudently, mainly through workplace talks and workshops as
well as through newspaper info-ads, TV and radio
campaigns.

Recommendation
Stand ready to adjust macroprudential measures
in the housing market in line with changes in
market conditions.

Action Taken
MAS monitors various indicators and changes in market
conditions, including prices, transactions, and housing
affordability indicators, as well as global and domestic
macroeconomic conditions. The series of property-related
measures taken over the past few years has dampened
momentum in the property market, with prices starting to
decline and transaction volume moderating. MAS will
continue to monitor market conditions and will adjust the
measures, if necessary.

Medium-Term Implementation (1–3 years)
8.
9.

Further strengthen banks’ capital framework,
with implementation of the countercyclical
capital buffer in line with the Basel III timelines.
Further develop SGX recovery plans, identifying
additional scenarios.

10.

Upgrade the collateral that covers credit
exposures related to the link with the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange (CME).

11.

Formalize bilateral cooperative crisis
management agreements for FMIs.

12.

Collect more granular data on household
balance sheets, drawing on surveys and
strengthened credit bureau practices.

13.

Authorize the Singapore Deposit Insurance
Corporation (SDIC) to provide support, on a
least-cost basis, for the transfer of deposit
liabilities to a bridge bank or healthy institution.

14.

Ensure that the banking industry adequately
contributes to the costs of bank failures.
Further facilitate cross-border cooperation in
bank resolution.

15.

16.

Consider changes to the structure of the MAS
Board to strengthen operational independence
in financial supervision.

17.

Ensure that MAS’ mandate for prudential
supervision is not compromised by its
developmental mandate.

18.

Review and strengthen the resolution
framework to enhance MAS' operational
independence in bank resolution.

MAS will implement the countercyclical capital buffer by
January 2016 in line with the Basel III timelines
MAS will work with SGX to review CDP’s and SGX­DC’s
recovery and resolution plans to incorporate additional
scenarios.
SGX will review whether its current letter of credit (LC)
regime can be enhanced and if the clearing fund can be
used to cover losses from the Mutual Offset System (MOS)
link. The review is targeted for completion by June 2015.
While the existing MOU allows MAS to engage CFTC in
emergency situations, the authorities will consider including
details on crisis coordination with the CFTC at a later stage,
when international standards on crisis management are
finalized.
Data collection for the consumer credit bureau will be
enhanced, providing information on a borrower’s overall
credit limits and aggregate outstanding balances across
lenders. This is targeted for completion by 2014 H2. MAS has
also conducted new quarterly loan surveys of banks to
collect more disaggregated information on the credit profile
of borrowers for new housing loans.
MAS is studying possible arrangements that are best suited
to Singapore’s context, including widening the use of the
Deposit Insurance fund, where appropriate. The authorities
will draw from international best practices/ standards that
are in the process of being formulated and finalized.
Similar to recommendation 13.
MAS is committed to consider the impact of its resolution
actions on financial stability in other jurisdictions and to
work with foreign resolution authorities wherever possible
towards a coordinated resolution.
No action will be taken. In the authorities’ view, MAS has
legal and institutional safeguards that protect against
potential conflicts of interest and maintains full operational
independence in the supervision of financial institutions.
MAS will review the safeguards from time to time.
MAS is in the process of reviewing the MAS Act to clarify
that, where there are safety and soundness concerns, the
prudential supervision mandate will prevail over the
developmental mandate.
The recommendation is under review.

Exchange Arrangement
Singapore’s de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as “stabilized.” The de jure exchange
rate arrangement is “other managed.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) monitors its
value against an undisclosed basket of currencies and intervenes in the market to maintain this value
within an undisclosed target band. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. Singapore has
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange rate system
free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions,
except for restrictions maintained solely for the preservation of national or international security,
which have been notified to the Fund in accordance with the procedures set forth in Executive Board
decision 144-(52/51). Singapore maintains restrictions on Singapore dollar credit facilities to, and
bond and equity issuance by, nonresident financial institutions. Singapore-dollar proceeds obtained
by nonresident financial entities (such as banks, merchant banks, finance companies, and hedge
funds) from loans exceeding S$5 million, or any amount for equity listings or bond issuance to
finance activities outside Singapore must be swapped or converted into foreign currency upon
draw-down. Financial institutions are prohibited from extending Singapore-dollar credit facilities in
excess of S$5 million to nonresident financial entities if there is reason to believe that the

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. While the authorities have continued to expand the
range of publicly available data, dissemination of more disaggregated data would enhance the basis for
macroeconomic policy analysis, particularly in the external and fiscal areas.
National accounts: The Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS) has made improvements in data sources and
methodology. The reconciliation of various national accounts estimates was conducted in 2014, resulting in
lower statistical discrepancies. (DOS) has completed the rebasing of Singapore’s national accounts to reference
year 2010.
Price statistics: DOS has completed the rebasing of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to base year 2009. The CPI
is rebased once every five years to reflect the latest consumption pattern and composition of goods and services
consumed by resident households.
Government finance statistics: Information on government assets held abroad is neither published nor
provided to the Fund. The government publishes annually partial information on the interest and dividends on
these assets. Debt service payments on domestic debt made from the extra budgetary Government Securities
Fund are published on an annual basis. Data on the financial position of the consolidated public sector are not
published.
Monetary statistics: The Monetary Authority of Singapore has not submitted the standardized report forms
(SRFs) for monetary statistics introduced in October 2004. The SRFs provide for accounting data to be broken
down by instrument, sector, and currency.
Balance of payments: In February 2012, the DOS concluded the migration of the balance of payments accounts
to the 6th edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6). The main
changes relative to the 5th edition include: reclassification of repairs on goods and goods for processing to
services (from goods); reclassification of merchanting to goods (from services); and treating banks’ Asian
Currency Units (ACUs) as residents (previously they were regarded as nonresidents, and hence their transactions
were excluded from the balance of payments). Data on Singapore’s international investment position (IIP) is not
provided on a disaggregated sectoral basis as suggested by the BPM6. The authorities have completed revising
the IIP data to include all foreign assets held by Singapore’s Government Investment Corporation. The
associated flows were already included in the balance of payments data.

Data Standards and Quality
Singapore provides data on a timely basis and
meets all the SDDS specifications. These include the
coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of the data;
and the dissemination of advance release calendars;
quarterly certification of the metadata posted on
the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board;
and provision of information to allow users to
assess data quality.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Singapore

On September 22, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Singapore.
Singapore’s economy has continued to perform well. Growth recovered to 3.9 percent in 2013,
from 2.5 percent in 2012. Net exports accounted for almost half of the growth, while private and
public consumption contributed the other half. A rising trade surplus pushed up the current
account of the balance of payments to 18.3 percent of GDP in 2013, from 17.5 percent of GDP
in 2012. A series of targeted, escalating macroprudential policies contributed to cool the housing
and car permit markets. This helped push down headline inflation to 2.4 percent on average
in 2013, from 4.6 percent in 2012. Singapore’s financial markets have so far absorbed bouts of
volatility associated with expectations of U.S. tapering and the spike in global risk aversion early
this year with limited impact. While corporate loan growth remains firm, housing loan growth
has moderated, aided by the June 2013 launch of the new total debt servicing ratio framework
(TDSR) and the expectation of higher interest rates in the medium term. Property prices have
leveled off and housing transactions moderated. The nonperforming loan ratio of domestic banks
remained stable at about 1 percent.
Growth decelerated in the first two quarters of 2014 and is expected to moderate to around
3 percent during 2014−2015, narrowing the positive output gap. Recovering demand in advanced
economies is likely to be offset by the ongoing real appreciation of the dollar and the gradual
tightening in global monetary conditions. Meanwhile, the planned further slowing inflow of
foreign workers, as part of the ongoing economic restructuring, could moderate potential growth
and lower competitiveness. Core inflation is projected to average about 2.4 percent
during 2014−15, reflecting relative price adjustments to facilitate the ongoing economic
restructuring.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
The medium-term outlook will be shaped by the success of the authorities’ ongoing economic
restructuring program and policy responses to the rapid pace of population aging. Potential GDP
growth is projected to slow in the next few years on slower labor force expansion, and then
recover gradually as faster labor productivity growth takes hold, reaching about 3¼ percent in
the medium term—well below the pace during 2000−08. A tighter labor supply due to a slowing
inflow of foreign workers in the near term and population aging in the medium term will boost
wages. With productivity gains unlikely to fully compensate, core inflation will increase
temporarily and—together with continued nominal appreciation of the dollar—push up the real
effective exchange rate, dampening export growth, and contributing to a gradual narrowing of
the current account surplus over the medium term.
The baseline projections are subject to a variety of risks. As a very open economy, Singapore is
particularly exposed to external risks related to a protracted period of slower growth in advanced
and emerging economies, a continued buildup and eventual unwinding of excess capacity in
China, an abrupt surge in financial market volatility as investors reassess underlying risks, and
geopolitical risks. The restructuring program could set the stage for a new era of sustainable
growth. However, productivity improvements might take some time to materialize and may not
fully offset the effects of declining labor force growth.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors congratulated the Singaporean authorities on the success of their
macroeconomic management in supporting strong economic activity while keeping inflation
under control. They also welcomed the ambitious medium-term economic restructuring plan,
which could set the stage for a renewed period of sustainable growth. Nevertheless, Directors
noted considerable challenges facing Singapore, particularly those related to trading partners’
growth slowdown and global financial market volatility. They stressed the need for continued
vigilance to risks and spillovers in the financial and housing sectors, and further efforts to
promote external rebalancing, address demographic challenges, and reduce inequality.
Directors broadly concurred that, given cyclical conditions, the current monetary stance, with the
targeted rate of currency appreciation, is appropriate to anchor inflation expectations. They
supported the complementary use of macroprudential policies as needed to contain asset prices
and promote prudent lending and household deleveraging.
Directors recognized the medium-term needs to strengthen the social safety net and alleviate
transition costs of the economic restructuring plan. Therefore, they saw merit in a modest fiscal
stimulus in this year’s budget geared toward social and infrastructure spending in support of
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

reforms to boost productivity, enhance health care and retirement benefits for the elderly and
low-income households, and promote inclusiveness more generally. These reforms would also
help address the challenges from population aging and prospective workforce decline.
Directors agreed that Singapore’s financial regulation and supervision frameworks are among the
best globally. They welcomed progress in implementing key short-term recommendations in the
Financial Sector Assessment Program Update, and encouraged the authorities to implement the
remaining recommendations. They emphasized that strengthening foreign-currency liquidity
management at banks remains a priority. Directors supported ongoing efforts to comply with
evolving international regulatory standards and strengthen the regime against money laundering
and the financing of terrorism.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that Singapore’s external position—though subject
to high uncertainty—appears to be substantially stronger than warranted by fundamentals,
suggesting the importance of continued efforts to boost domestic demand and narrow the current
account surplus over time. Directors agreed that the planned increase in public spending,
ongoing steps to reduce reliance on foreign workers, and continued appreciation path of the
nominal effective exchange rate would facilitate external rebalancing.

Introduction

1.1
The Singapore authorities would like to thank the IMF team for a constructive
2014 Article IV Consultation. The useful discussions focused on the ongoing domestic
economic restructuring amid continuing uncertainties in the external environment.
2

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook

2.1
The Singapore economy moderated in the first half of 2014, following the strong
outturn in 2013. On average, the domestic economy expanded by 0.9% q-o-q SAAR in Q1
and Q2 2014, down from the 3.8% expansion in the last two quarters of 2013. The slowdown
partly reflected a pullback in the trade-related industries, alongside the downshift in growth
in the US and China early this year. Sectors dependent on domestic demand also eased, due
to weaker activity in private sector construction and real estate services.
2.2
Notwithstanding the relatively muted performance in the H1 2014, conditions are
broadly supportive of a modest growth trajectory for the Singapore economy for the rest of
the year. GDP growth in Singapore is forecast to come in at 2.5–3.5% in 2014. Gradual
improvements in the global economy, alongside a pickup in the IT industry, should provide
support to Singapore’s external-oriented industries. Meanwhile, the domestic-oriented sector
is expected to be resilient, buttressed by public sector-driven infrastructure expansions in
transportation networks, healthcare facilities and public housing construction.
2.3
CPI-All Items inflation eased to 1.6% in the first seven months of the year, from 1.9%
in the second half of 2013, largely reflecting the impact of government measures to cool the
property market and the higher supply of motor vehicle permits. However, MAS Core
Inflation, which excludes the cost of accommodation and private road transport, rose to 2.1%
in Jan-Jul 2014 from 1.8% in H2 2013. This stemmed mainly from the pass-through of
higher cost, particularly wages, to consumer prices.
2.4
Going forward, domestic cost pressures will remain significant. Notably, the labour
market will continue to be tight as productivity enhancements take time to materialise. Thus,
wage cost is likely to rise further and be passed on to some consumption goods and services.
In comparison, external price developments should be relatively benign as supply buffers in
the major commodity markets continue to be ample and inflation in most of Singapore’s key
import source countries is expected to stay modest.

2
2.5
Against this backdrop, MAS Core Inflation is projected to pick up slightly and
average 2-3% in 2014. Meanwhile, overall inflation is expected to ease for the rest of 2014
due to lower contributions from housing rentals and car prices. For the whole year, CPI-All
Items inflation is forecast to be in the range of 1.5-2.0%.
3

Monetary Policy

3.1
Singapore’s overall macroeconomic policy has been formulated to balance
considerations with regard to the medium-term path for growth and inflation, while
facilitating the ongoing restructuring of the economy.
3.2
In April 2014, MAS kept the S$NEER policy band on a modest and gradual
appreciation path, with no change to its slope, width or the level at which it was centred. This
policy stance, which has been in place since April 2012, aims to cap domestic and imported
sources of inflation and anchor inflation expectations amid economic restructuring.
3.3
Some transitional inflationary pressures are an inevitable and necessary part of
restructuring and economic transformation. Monetary policy is thus focused on restraining,
but not totally offsetting, the inflationary pressures while allowing relative prices to adjust to
reflect the true cost of scarce resources such as land and labour in Singapore.
4

Addressing Medium-term Challenges

4.1
The FY2014 Budget reinforced the key directions in economic and social strategies
that were set out in previous budgets. The Budget provided firms with sharper incentives to
invest in fixed and human capital and engage in business transformation and innovation, via
the extension of the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) scheme, the introduction of
PIC+ for small and medium-sized enterprises and the strengthening of current schemes for
R&D tax deductions and allowances.
4.2
The Authorities welcome the Report’s acknowledgement of the Budget’s focus on
increasing inclusiveness. Indeed, there have been significant enhancements to the support for
lower-income Singaporeans, particularly in healthcare and retirement adequacy. In
healthcare, the implementation of MediShield Life in 2015 will broaden the coverage of the
existing medical insurance scheme to all Singapore citizens and permanent residents for life,
with targeted subsidies for lower- and middle-income Singaporeans. The Pioneer Generation
Package (PGP), which was the centrepiece of a slew of government measures announced this
year, is specifically aimed at making healthcare affordable for elderly Singaporeans.1
1

Around 450,000 elderly Singaporeans, aged 65 and above in 2014, qualify for the lifelong healthcare benefits
provided by the PGP, including outpatient care subsidies, annual Medisave top-ups of $200 to $800 for life and
additional support for MediShield Life premiums.

3

4.3
On retirement adequacy, the Central Provident Fund (CPF), which is a fully-funded
defined contribution pension scheme and guaranteed by the government, helps Singaporeans
grow their savings to meet retirement needs. More than half of CPF members enjoy a
guaranteed floor rate of 3.5% p.a. on their Ordinary Account (OA) savings and around twothirds earn 5% on their Special, Medical, and Retirement Accounts (SMRA) savings.2
Various schemes to help retirees monetise the equity in their flats have also been introduced
and expanded.3 In addition, a Silver Support Scheme will be introduced to provide an annual
cash bonus to supplement the earnings of elderly low-income Singaporeans.
4.4
The authorities note that overall wages in the Singapore economy have continued to
increase, with the labour market remaining tight since the recovery from the Global Financial
Crisis. In addition, the shift towards capital-intensive sectors has raised the average wage
level of workers. As a result, over the last decade, real incomes have grown across all groups
of workers, with the median worker and worker at the 20th percentile seeing increases of
24% and 12% respectively. More recently, government transfers and taxes reduced the Gini
coefficient in 2013 from 0.463 to 0.412.
5

Financial Sector Developments

5.1
The authorities welcome the Staff’s endorsement of Singapore’s strong financial
sector regulation and supervision policies. Macro-pruduential measures have been used in a
complementary manner to moderate credit growth and the build-up of household leverage in
a sustained period of low global interest rates. The growth of household debt has slowed
from nearly 13% year-on-year in Q3 2011 to 5.5% in Q1 2014. At the same time, the risk
profile of new housing loan borrowers has improved, as almost all new housing loans granted
since the introduction of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio were within the 60% threshold. The
authorities will continue to be vigilant in monitoring developments in credit and asset
markets and retain the flexibility to adjust macro-prudential tools as necessary, while
maintaining the appropriate structural safeguards against excessive leverage in the economy.

2

CPF members have three accounts, namely Ordinary Account, Special Account and Medisave Account.
Members can withdraw their OA savings at any time to purchase a property or to service a mortgage. A fourth
account, the Retirement Account, is automatically created with savings from the Ordinary and Special Accounts
when members reach 55 years of age.
3

For example, the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) will be extended in April 2015 to four-room Housing and
Development Board (HDB) flats, covering 75% of elderly HDB households. Households also have the
flexibility to choose the length of lease to retain, based on their age and preference, subject to a maximum of
35 years.

4
5.2
As a regional financial centre, Singapore is host to a number of financial institutions
with significant cross-border activities whose financial flows could pose potential liquidity
risks. To mitigate such risks, the authorities closely monitor banks’ liquidity risk profiles,
using a range of indicators such as the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio. The authorities
complement their ongoing monitoring with a rigorous and robust supervision of banks, to
develop a deeper understanding of banks’ risk management procedures and liquidity risk
profiles. Beyond these prudential measures, the authorities’ industry-wide stress tests indicate
that the banking system will remain resilient under various liquidity stress scenarios,
including a disorderly unwinding of quantitative easing in the US and a consequent squeeze
in USD funding.
6

Final Remarks

6.1
The external economic environment is generally supportive of sustained if modest
growth of the Singapore economy for the rest of the year, but the authorities remain vigilant
to risks. At the same time, they are firmly committed to the economic restructuring program,
which is proceeding at a deliberately measured pace to give both workers and businesses
time to adjust towards a sustainable productivity-led growth model.
6.2
The Singapore authorities are pleased to inform the Board that they are agreeable to
the publication of the 2014 Article IV Staff Report and the Buff Statement.
