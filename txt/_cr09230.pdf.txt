Consultation and team. The 2009 Article IV consultation discussions with Indonesia were
held in Jakarta during May 25−June 5, 2009. The staff team comprised Mr. Rumbaugh
(Head), Mmes. Ramakrishnan and Ruiz-Arranz (all APD), Mr. Goyal (SPR), Mr. Baldacci
(FAD), and Ms. Gobat (MCM). Mr. Zavadjil (Senior Resident Representative) also
participated in the discussions. Mr. Kartikoyono (Advisor, OED) attended the meetings.
The team met with Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Bank Indonesia Acting
Governor Miranda Goeltom, Minister of Trade Mari Pangestu, Minister of State-owned
Enterprises Sofjan Djalil, Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Purnomo
Yusgianotoro, other senior officials, and private sector representatives.

•

Context of past surveillance. In recent consultations, the Fund and the authorities have
agreed on the broad policy priorities, including improving fiscal space through revenue and
expenditure measures, enhancing fiscal management, anchoring inflationary expectations,
and maintaining a prudential approach to lending. Constructive dialogue with the
authorities is ongoing through technical assistance in fiscal and monetary operations and
management. An FSAP is scheduled for later this year, which will inform the 2010
Article IV consultation.

•

Exchange rate system. Indonesia has a floating exchange rate regime. Indonesia has also
accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.

•

Economic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, although they could be
improved in some areas (Annex IV). Indonesia subscribes to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Impact of global financial turmoil: Benefiting from strong initial conditions and timely policy
responses, the Indonesian economy has withstood well the recent economic turmoil. Despite the
impact on financial markets during the last quarter of 2008, which has mostly been reversed
now, the economy has continued to grow albeit at a slower pace. The strength of the economy
stems from its greater dependence on domestic consumption rather than exports, unlike many of
its regional peers. The economy has also received a big boost in the first quarter from
election-related spending which provided strong support for private consumption.
Political background: The Legislative elections were successfully completed in April; the
Presidential election is scheduled for July 8, with a run-off on September 8, if needed.
Outlook and risks: Growth in 2009 is expected to decelerate to 3−4 percent, compared with
6 percent in 2008, with growth driven by domestic consumption, although the fiscal stimulus
would have to be fully implemented to support demand growth. Weak external conditions and
slow credit growth dampened exports and investment in the first half of 2009. However, a return
of credit growth and external recovery could support higher investment and exports in the
second half of the year. On the downside, if there were another bout of global risk aversion, it
could adversely affect external liquidity and growth, potentially leading to reversal of capital
inflows, drying up of external credit, and further declines in external and domestic demand.
Monetary and exchange rate policy: The staff and authorities agreed that the monetary easing
cycle since December 2008 may soon have run its course with a more cautionary approach
appropriate going forward. There is ample stimulus in the pipeline from the interest rate cuts
already implemented which, combined with the abundant liquidity in the banking sector, should
soon result in higher credit growth. In the medium term, anchoring monetary policy on a
well-defined framework would help lower inflation volatility and enhance policy credibility. The
exchange rate is broadly in equilibrium and its flexibility has served well as a shock absorber.
Fiscal policy: The growth impact of the 2009 fiscal stimulus depends on the timely execution of
the spending measures, especially on infrastructure. For 2010, given the availability of fiscal
space and that complete withdrawal of the stimulus could endanger economic recovery,
retaining some of the stimulus relative to 2008 would support aggregate demand, with public
debt consolidation continuing over the medium term. In this context, the staff advised that there
was room for a somewhat higher fiscal deficit for 2010 than currently planned by the authorities.
Banking sector: The banking system has been resilient to the global financial turmoil.
Managing credit risk is the key challenge. Smaller banks also remain vulnerable to liquidity risk
given their narrow funding options and difficulties with market access during distress. Going
forward, improving supervision and encouraging lending consistent with banks’ risk
management capabilities would help maintain asset quality and enhance public confidence;
regulatory forbearance or administrative measures to promote lending should be avoided. The
forthcoming FSAP will conduct an in-depth examination of the financial sector and help identify
specific areas that need to be strengthened.

I. OVERVIEW
1.
The 2009 Article IV consultation occurred against the backdrop of an uncertain
global economic climate and an ongoing election cycle.
•

Indonesia entered the current global crisis with strong initial conditions. Aided
by a generally favorable global economic climate that prevailed prior to the recent
crisis, Indonesia’s fundamentals were strengthened through sound macroeconomic
policy implementation, including prudent debt management and developing a more
sound financial sector. Economic growth averaged 6 percent since 2005, fiscal
performance was strong, the current account was in surplus, both public and external
debt have halved in the last five years to about 30 percent of GDP, and international
reserves had risen by $22 billion in that period to a comfortable level of more than
150 percent of short-term debt.

•

The elections have so far proceeded smoothly. The parliamentary elections held on
April 9 were not associated with high market volatility that characterized some
previous elections, and market sentiment has subsequently improved. The Presidential
election is scheduled for July 8, with a run-off on September 8, if needed.
II. BACKGROUND

2.
Indonesia’s financial markets were adversely impacted by the global financial
crisis. As foreshadowed at the time of the last Article IV consultation, Indonesia was
especially vulnerable to shifts in investor

rise in sovereign EMBI spreads to over
1,200 basis points, much higher than comparable emerging market economies.1 Net capital
outflows accelerated during September-November, primarily in the form of portfolio
outflows as nonresidents reduced their holdings of central bank and government securities by
some $6½ billion (text chart). The yield on government domestic bonds spiked sharply to as

high as 20 percent in late-October as foreign investors and local commercial banks reduced
exposures while market liquidity dried up, resulting in the government cancelling all debt
issuances through the end of the year and seeking official external budget contingency
financing for $5½ billion, as well as temporarily suspending mark-to-market valuation on
banks’ government bond holdings. The currency depreciated by some 40 percent, and the
stock market index declined by a similar amount (Figure 1). These factors contributed to a
decline in international reserves by $10 billion to $50 billion between July and October 2008.
3.
Despite the initial shock, financial markets have recovered in 2009. Concerns
about corporate rollover risk as well as resident deposit outflows did not materialize. With
relatively low vulnerabilities in the corporate and banking sectors arising from their strong
balance sheet positions, and high capitalization and profitability of the banking system, the
economy was able to absorb the impact of the crisis. Moreover, a series of mitigating
measures were taken by the government and Bank Indonesia (BI), including lowering banks’
reserve requirements, liquidity injection through repos, expansion of eligible collateral for
short-term financing from BI, temporary ban of short-selling, and expansion of deposit
insurance coverage.2 These factors, combined with the stronger than expected recovery in Q1
of 2009, boosted domestic and foreign investor confidence. Thus, and broadly in line with
improvements in other Asian emerging markets, CDS spreads have dropped to around
300 bps, the stock market has recovered by 80 percent, and the rupiah has appreciated by
about 20 percent as of end-June relative to their lowest points late last year. Capital inflows
have also resumed, and reserves have risen to $58 billion in May 2009.
4.
Strong consumption supported the recovery in Q1 of 2009. The Indonesian
economy’s stronger than expected real GDP growth of 4.4 percent (y/y) made it one of the
fastest growing emerging market

growth in Q4 of 2008 as weak external conditions took their toll and economic activity
slowed sharply (Figure 2). This was reflected in both weaker exports and domestic demand.
The latest leading indicators—retail sales, motor vehicle sales, and industrial production—
suggest that the economy may have bottomed out on a sequential growth basis. Moreover,
consumer confidence is at its highest since January 2005.
5.
External accounts also improved in the first quarter of 2009 after deteriorating
in 2008. The balance of payments surplus in Q1 was $4 billion compared with a deficit of
$4.2 billion in Q4 of 2008. This

coal prices increased and demand for

recorded a surplus of $2.4 billion largely from demand for sovereign debt securities, after
declining by more than $4 billion in Q4 of 2008 due to capital outflows from global risk
aversion.
6.
The recent monetary stance has kept pace with easing inflationary pressures and
slow domestic demand. BI has been on a monetary-easing cycle since December 2008; the
policy rate has been cut by 250 basis points to 7 percent, an historical low. CPI inflation has
decelerated rapidly since October 2008: year-to-date inflation through May 2009 is only
about 0.1 percent and the annual rate has declined to 6 percent (Figure 3). Core inflation,
which excludes administered and volatile prices, however, is a bit higher with a year-to-date
rate of 1.7 percent. The deceleration follows strong inflationary pressures in 2008 resulting
from high commodity prices as well as strong credit growth and domestic demand, which
together led to inflation of 11 percent in 2008, well above BI’s 4−6 percent target range.
7.
Fiscal space for a stimulus package was made possible by solid performance over
several years. The government announced a stimulus package for 2009 of about 1½ percent
of GDP to support domestic demand. This deficit expansion follows several years of prudent
fiscal management, including primary fiscal surpluses of about 2 percent of GDP per year,
that has led to a decline in public debt to 33 percent of GDP. In 2008, the fiscal position was
broadly in balance, well above the government’s revised budget deficit target of 2 percent of
GDP, driven mostly by strong non-oil revenue performance. In Q1 of 2009, a small surplus
has been recorded, in line with normal seasonality, but smaller than in 2008 due to tax
measures related to the stimulus and some frontloaded spending.

7
8.
Banking indicators are generally robust, and the system has proved to be
resilient. Financial soundness indicators improved in 2008—profitability rose and the capital
base strengthened further as banks retained a larger share of their profits and increased capital
(Figure 4). Overall liquidity conditions have improved since end-2008, with overnight
interbank market rates, loan-deposit ratios, and banks’ overall excess reserve holdings with
BI back to pre-crisis levels. Credit growth has slowed on a monthly basis since
December 2008, although this is not entirely unexpected after a prolonged period of rapid
growth and in light of the more uncertain environment.
9.
The corporate sector has thus far withstood reduced access to foreign funding.
Indonesian companies have over time reduced their vulnerabilities, including lowering
leverage ratios, raising profitability margins, and reducing exposure to external liabilities.
However, the corporate sector experienced some distress at the height of last year’s crisis as
indicated by the jump in the estimated corporate default probabilities for listed companies.
More recent data indicate declining default probabilities, albeit still higher than the pre-crisis
level (Figures 5 and 6).
III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
Economic growth is expected to slow considerably in 2009, although it is likely to
remain among the highest in the region. Unlike other export-dependent Asian economies,
the strength of private consumption in Indonesia is expected to keep growth positive,
with 2009 GDP growth projected to be 3−4 percent (see Box 1 for a comparison with other
countries). However, the

Box 1. Comparison of GDP Components with Regional Peers
•

Indonesia’s dependence on exports is among the lowest relative to its regional peers. Over
2006−08, the average exports of goods and services—at less than 50 percent of GDP—was more
closely aligned with India. Indonesia is less vulnerable than most of the other countries to the
strong headwinds from slowing external demand, especially when remittance inflows are taken into
account. Moreover, Indonesia’s export destinations and composition are relatively more
diversified; thus, a slump in any single region is unlikely to have a large impact on Indonesia’s
overall exports.

•

Indonesia’s domestic demand is one of the highest in the group. Total domestic demand is
almost 90 percent of GDP compared to 70−80 percent in some of the other countries. In particular,
consumption expenditures (private and public) are about 67 percent, benefiting from the large
domestic market base.

•

This is not to say that Indonesia will be immune to the weak external demand. Like other
countries, Indonesia’s exports have been falling in recent months. However, the impact of the
external weakness on growth may be less than its more export-dependent peers; like in India,
Indonesia’s domestic demand growth is expected to buffer the decline and keep GDP growth
positive.

is broadly in line with BI’s assessment but lower than the government’s projected growth of
4−4½ percent which stems mostly from an expectation of stronger consumption growth.
Despite the relatively positive outlook, the authorities remain concerned about the
implications of the uncertain global and regional recovery on Indonesia, and the potential for
further volatility in financial markets.
11.
Key near term risks relate to the underlying strength of both domestic and
external demand. In particular, private consumption—which is the largest part of GDP—
may need policy support to maintain growth. On the upside, the stimulus effects of the recent
monetary easing may be stronger than expected in supporting domestic demand. A stronger
than expected external recovery could also provide an added boost. On the downside,
however, another bout of global risk aversion or fall in commodity prices could impact
external liquidity and growth via reversal in capital inflows, tightening credit markets, and
fall in exports as well as domestic demand. An additional risk is that the budgeted spending
plans are not executed in time or are insufficient to replace the first quarter’s election-related
spending stimulus.
12.
In the medium term, potential growth is expected to be gradually restored. While
GDP growth in 2010 is likely to remain below potential (about 4−5 percent), as the global
economy gradually improves, export growth should slowly recover thereafter. Domestic
demand should also grow strongly, especially as investment gains momentum, which would
lead to higher imports. Higher infrastructure investment over the medium term, would
contribute to greater efficiency, increase productivity, promote rural development, and help
achieve higher potential growth. Maintaining an open approach to external trade would also
support the economy’s long-term competitiveness. Reducing inflation to 3−4 percent would
enhance overall policy credibility and lower volatility.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
Discussions focused on three main policy challenges: (i) the policy mix to support
growth; (ii) protecting the safety and stability of the financial sector; and (iii) alleviating
potential stresses to the balance of payments, particularly if there is a significant worsening in
global risk aversion and/or tightening in external liquidity conditions.
A. Support for Growth
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
14.
The authorities agreed with staff that the monetary easing cycle may soon have
run its course. The reduction in the policy rate by 250 basis points since December 2008 was
appropriate and in line with the declining inflation and slowing domestic demand. Going
forward, there is some concern about the recent increases in commodity prices—which have
a large impact on domestic inflation—as well as the prospects for a stronger economic

10
recovery. In this respect, despite the currently benign inflationary pressures and the recent
exchange rate appreciation, a cautionary approach to any further easing would be appropriate

economy can be better gauged. Also, given
the long lags in monetary transmission (see

the real economy may spill over to a period

hold, leading to high credit growth and

inflationary expectations, and the need to
quickly reverse course. In addition, an estimated Taylor rule indicates BI’s policy stance has
generally tended to have an expansionary bias over time, suggesting that a more cautious
stance would be appropriate now.3 Finally, any worsening in global risk aversion and external
liquidity risks would also justify a cautious monetary stance so as not to jeopardize capital
flows and the international reserve position.
15.
Monetary transmission in Indonesia has been slow, but credit growth is likely to
turn positive in the second half of the year. The authorities and private commentators were
concerned about the slow response of the lending rate to the recent policy rate cuts, as well as
the stagnation of credit growth. While deposit rates—particularly the minimum guaranteed
rate—have normally responded swiftly to policy rate changes, the lending rate has historically
responded more slowly and less fully to
18
policy rate changes. Indeed, some of the

have been more cautious in their lending in

deposit rates to restore liquidity positions,
reducing their ability to lower lending rates much further in order to maintain margins. On
balance, staff considers that with the prevailing strong confidence, sufficient liquidity in the

11
banking system, and completion of transmission lags, credit growth is likely in the second
half of 2009, albeit at a lower pace than in the last two years.
16.
Anchoring monetary policy on a well-defined policy framework would enhance
policy credibility. Although BI adopted an inflation targeting framework in 2005, its
pragmatic approach to monetary policy—by which it balances exchange rate stability,
inflation, and growth trade-offs—has kept inflation from rising to excessively high levels, but
has not managed to bring it down to partner country rates. Staff analysis indicates that this
may have contributed to higher economic costs relative to comparator countries in terms of
wider bond spreads and greater market volatility. Moreover, the multiplicity of objectives
may have also contributed to higher inflation volatility. Concerted efforts—based on a more
credible and objective inflation targeting framework—to consistently lower inflation and
guide inflationary expectations toward a medium-term target range of 3−4 percent would
enhance policy credibility and lower economic costs.
17.
Exchange rate flexibility has served as an important shock absorber for
shielding the real economy from volatile capital flows. As evidenced in recent months, the
flexibility of the currency has helped absorb large external shocks, while preserving domestic
stability. Based on the different approaches of the CGER methodology, the current rupiah
exchange rate is assessed to be broadly in equilibrium (Box 2). The authorities agreed that
reserve buffers could continue to be built up gradually in the near term, with intervention
largely directed at reducing volatility.
Fiscal Policy
18.
The fiscal stimulus package for 2009 was appropriate to support weaker
domestic demand. With the economy quickly decelerating, the tax measures in the stimulus
had an immediate impact on private consumption. The new spending measures—amounting
to about 20 percent of the stimulus package (mostly on infrastructure projects)—are expected
to support demand in the second half of the year. The overall budget deficit is estimated to
reach 2.6 percent of GDP in 2009, slightly above the authorities’ revised budget reflecting
modestly weaker non-energy revenue collection as well as higher energy subsidies.
Frontloaded domestic and foreign currency bond issuances—more than two-thirds of gross
financing needs were secured in the first six months—and the expected sustained demand for
sovereign paper in the remainder of the year have reduced budget financing risks. Despite the
wider fiscal deficit, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline further to 31 percent
of GDP in 2009 reflecting slower but still positive growth and exchange rate appreciation.
19.
Better budget execution is key to an effective fiscal stimulus. Staff stressed the
need to implement the spending program, particularly given the past record of under
execution (especially in capital spending) and back loaded spending, as reflected in

Box 2. Exchange Rate Assessment
Recent developments. The rupiah has recovered much of the loss experienced during the market turmoil of late
2008 and early 2009. It depreciated from Rp 9,200 per dollar in early September 2008 to nearly Rp 13,000 per
dollar in late November. It has since recovered to about
120
7,000
Rp 10,000 per dollar in early June. The real effective

exchange rate (REER) has also recovered since the first

quarter.
100
Export performance. Indonesia’s export market share
in global trade increased in 2008, largely on the back of
high commodity prices. The decline in commodity
prices and compression in exports globally in the last
quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 resulted in
a decline in Indonesia’s exports—by 7 percent y/y in
2008 Q4 and 30 percent y/y in 2009 Q1, though these
reflect the broader global recession rather than
Indonesia’s exchange rate valuation.
CGER estimates. Using the IMF’s Consultative Group
on Exchange Rate Issues (CGER) approach, Indonesia’s
REER is assessed to be broadly in line with equilibrium.
•

The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach yields
a modest overvaluation of about 6 percent, with the
current account norm estimated at 0 percent of
GDP, close to the underlying current account
deficit of close to about ¾ percent of GDP.

The external sustainability (ES) approach, on the
2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009
other hand, points to an undervaluation of about
6 percent: the current account deficit needed to stabilize the net foreign asset to GDP ratio at end 2008 is
about 1¾ percent of GDP, whereas the medium-term current account deficit is about 1 percent of GDP.

•

The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach suggests an undervaluation of nearly 20 percent: the
equilibrium real rate depreciated modestly owing to weaker terms of trade, but the REER depreciated by
more. The inclusion of a long pre-crisis period in the sample and the assumption of zero misalignment over
the sample in this approach, however, suggests that the estimated equilibrium real rate is biased upward.
Caution is needed, therefore, in interpreting this approach.

Overall assessment. The CGER assessment for Indonesia, thus, is 20 below and 5 above equilibrium. However,
the REER has appreciated by almost 5 percent from the CGER reference date of March 2009, which leads to a
range of 15 below to 11 above, suggesting the REER is now broadly in equilibrium. A similar result is obtained
when replicating the CGER methodology for a broader sample of countries and a longer time period, with added
explanatory variables. Using WEO data as of April, this robustness exercise yields an undervaluation of
2.1 percent according to the MB approach (a CA norm of −1.4 percent versus a medium-term projected deficit of
1 percent of GDP), 8.4 percent according to the ES approach, and 6.5 percent according to the ERER approach.
The results, therefore, point to an undervaluation of about 6 percent as of April. However, once again, with the
noted recent appreciation of the REER, the exchange rate is assessed to be in line with equilibrium.

that budget execution is critical, the
authorities were confident that the stimulus package would be fully implemented by the end
of the year. They noted that several measures have been taken to improve execution and
flexibility, including simpler procedures for budget implementation (such as the rapid
appointment of budget officials, and simplifying documentation and budget processes),
closely monitoring budget execution in local treasury offices with the establishment of a
high-level central monitoring committee, and expanding the scope for reallocating funds
within budget categories.
20.
A supportive fiscal stance in 2010 would help avoid endangering the economic
recovery path. The authorities’ current deficit target of 1½ percent of GDP for 2010 includes
about ½ percent of GDP in stimulus measures (mostly further permanent corporate income
tax rate cuts). This deficit, however, implies a withdrawal of half the stimulus relative to the
pre-crisis position. As

role to sustain the

Thus, staff noted that a deficit close to 2 percent of GDP could be achieved in light of
expected demand for government paper and projected external financing. It would also
provide room for additional spending on needed infrastructure areas, such as transportation,
ports, water systems and for strengthening the social safety net, without jeopardizing

14
medium-term public debt consolidation.4 The authorities noted that their ability to provide
additional stimulus would depend on the overall risk appetite of the market to meet financing
needs. They also noted that their 2010 fiscal targets may be revised once the new government
takes office in October 2009.
21.
Continued reforms to strengthen the fiscal framework would provide scope for
more public investment. Several structural reforms have already been undertaken or are
ongoing, including the establishment of a consolidated Treasury Single Account (TSA),
remuneration of government deposits at BI, and strengthening cash management. Further
progress with the following fiscal reforms would enhance budget flexibility and improve
public resource management, which could help lower bond yields: (i) reducing energy
subsidies and expanding transfers programs and social services for the poor; (ii) raising
non-commodity tax revenue ratios by broadening the consumption tax base and continuing
tax administration reforms to strengthen arrears collection, taxpayer registration, customized
taxpayers services, and audit functions; (iii) anchoring fiscal policies within a medium-term
budget framework to ensure adequate fiscal space; (iv) coordinating with line ministries to
strengthen budget execution, including at the sub-national government level; and (v) linking
cash and debt management strategies to support capital market access and efficient deficit
financing. Such measures would also improve the countercyclical role of fiscal policy.5
Noting the critical mass of fiscal reforms already underway, the authorities stressed that they
would continue on this path in the period ahead.
B. Safeguarding the Financial Sector
22.
The Indonesian banking sector proved resilient to the effects of the global
financial turmoil. Aided by strong capital positions and supportive policy measures, banks
weathered well the difficult operating environment in the second half of 2008 and early 2009.
Indeed, banking performance in 2008 was among the strongest in the region and among
emerging markets. Banks reported higher average profitability and capital, helped by
continued robust loan growth and large net interest margins. Asset quality remained steady
in 2008, although NPLs have inched up in the first four months of 2009 to above 4 percent.
The average loan loss ratio of over 100 percent suggests more than adequate loss coverage.

4

Public debt would gradually fall below 30 percent by 2012. This reflects a return to a positive primary fiscal
balance after 2010, reflecting stronger non-oil revenue collection from ongoing tax administration reforms and
lower transfers to regional governments in line with their own revenue generation capacity. In the medium term,
the debt outlook remains favorable, even under various adverse scenarios (Appendix I).

5

A selected issues paper examines this issue in detail.

15
That said, the global crisis did not go unmarked: some small banks, accounting for less than
½ percent of total banking assets, have run into trouble since the onset of the crisis.6
23.
Sensitivity analysis indicates that the banking sector is generally resilient to a
range of adverse shocks. Banks are most vulnerable to a sharp deterioration in credit quality
and less exposed at this stage to market risk given the underlying shifts in their portfolios
(Box 3). The latter is primarily because system-wide banks have a positive net open foreign
exchange position as of end-March while regulations restrict their exposure to equities in
their trading book. In addition, banks have lowered their holdings of government securities in
their trading book. These results and the analysis are, however, preliminary. The forthcoming
FSAP will examine the soundness of the banking sector in greater depth, including through a
comprehensive stress testing framework.
24.
Despite this resilience, the authorities agreed that risks remain and safeguarding
financial stability is a top priority. NPLs may rise further if corporate distress escalates,
pressuring banks’ profit margins.7 That said, the large banks are generally healthy because of
their larger capital and liquidity cushion to withstand further shocks.8 The authorities are
more concerned about the large number of small and some mid-sized banks, which account
for less than 10 percent of banking assets. These banks are more exposed to liquidity risk
given their narrow funding base and difficulties accessing the interbank market in times of
stress.9 Thus, early and quick action on any emerging problems, including liquidity for
solvent smaller banks, would be important in helping safeguard banking sector stability. In
this regard, the new Financial Safety Net law will enhance the legal framework for bank
resolution, enable quick decision-making, and improve institutional coordination for

In November 2008, the government recapitalized Bank Century as its liquidity problems mounted and it
breached the minimum reserve requirement, and in 2009, Bank IFI was liquidated. More recently, one rural
bank was also liquidated.
7

Indonesian corporates are seen as somewhat more vulnerable to a profit shock than regional peers, according
to a study in the May 2009 Asia and Pacific Regional Economic Outlook, because a larger number of
Indonesian firms were close to the distress level where cash flows are insufficient to cover the interest on debt at
end-2007.

8

9

The top 16 banks account for 70 percent of banking assets.

Interest rate risks is more accentuated for the smaller and mid-sized banks as many fund their longer-term
assets through short-term funding, mainly more costly time deposits and typically at fixed rates. According to BI
a number also experienced deposit outflows during the crisis in late 2008, and many were forced to offer higher
deposit rates in order to maintain existing customers.

16
Box 3. Banking Sector Sensitivity Analysis
Managing credit risks is a key challenge. Loans account for about 80 percent of banking assets. Loan
quality is expected to deteriorate in sectors that have been more affected by the global slowdown
(e.g., steel, textile and trade) as well as in some areas of consumer credit such as unsecured credit card
debt. The latter still accounts for a small share of total loans. Indonesian banks’ exposure to special
mention loans (mainly unclassified loans overdue up to 90 days), which account for about 6–7 percent of
total loans, remains quite high. Typically, 60 percent of these loans are downgraded to nonperforming
status. Restructured loans have also increased in recent months from 2 percent at end-2008 to 2.7 percent
at end-February. These risks along with slower loan growth are expected to add pressure to banks’ profit
margins this year.
To assess the impact of these risks, staff and BI ran sensitivity tests to examine their impact on
individual banks’ regulatory capital. All 124 banks were covered. Several scenarios were chosen that
are more extreme than staff’s baseline estimates to test for systemic weakness. The first shock examined
the impact of a doubling of NPLs from current levels (end-March 2009), applying historical default rates
from special mention to substandard (60 percent) to all other loan categories, and existing provisioning
requirements while disregarding collateral. The impact on capital by applying a more conservative loss rate
(50 percent) to all new NPLs was also examined. The analysis allowed for some mitigating factors, such as
allowing for half of reported first quarter March profits and excess provision as buffer against higher
provisioning costs. The analysis also examined the direct balance sheet impact from a 30 percent loss in the
value of the rupiah and government bond prices.
The sensitivity analysis found that even a doubling in NPLs would not undermine the soundness of
the banking system. The system-wide capital adequacy ratio (CAR) would decline by two percentage
points from 19 percent to 17 percent. Assuming a loss rate of 50 percent on all new NPLs does not
change the results much, with CAR declining by 1.2 percentage points. In total, four out of
124 commercial banks—accounting for 2½ percent of banking sector assets—would become
undercapitalized and fall below the 8 percent regulatory minimum.
The analysis also shows Indonesian banks are at this stage less exposed to market risk. A
deprecation of the rupiah by 30 percent and a decline in government bond prices of 30 percent affect
banks marginally with the system-wide CAR falling by only 0.3 percentage points. No bank would be
undercapitalized. Banks’ positive net open foreign exchange position of 2.6 percent of capital as of
end-March 2009 buffers them against a rupiah depreciation. While government bonds account for
12 percent of banking assets, just over 7 percent of this is held in the trading account. The extent of
market risk was reduced in late-2008 when, in response to the crisis, regulators allowed banks to shift part
of their government securities which were held in available-for-sales to hold-to-maturity, and at fair value
rather than at market value. Vulnerability to this exposure could change with the adoption of the IFRS in
2010, as banks’ rebuild their trading position, or if there is volatility in the government securities market.
These results and the analysis are preliminary. The upcoming FSAP will examine the soundness of
the banking sector in greater depth, including through a comprehensive stress testing framework which
will include both a top-down and bottom-up approach and assess banks’ vulnerabilities to a range of tail
risk shocks, including liquidity risk.1

crisis management. The draft law is being discussed in Parliament and its approval would
support a strengthened framework going forward. Also, while the deposit insurance scheme
(LPS) is fully backed by the government, increased funding to reach its reserve ratio target of
2½ percent of deposits would enable quick action when needed.
25.
BI agreed that there is scope for strengthening the supervisory framework. In
particular, building on recent progress, BI could continue development of its regulation and
supervision capacity to bolster its early warning and bank resolution mechanisms.10 Staff also
emphasized that supervisors examine banks’ implementation of regulations on early
restructuring of performing loans to ensure that such restructuring aims to restore the debtor’s
repayment capacity in full, including its ability to repay the principal. Where this is not
assured, such loans could be downgraded to NPL status. BI also agreed that collecting
supervisory information on repeatedly restructured loans and restructured loans that migrate
to NPL status could be a way to better monitor asset quality and detect any potential
problems of “evergreening.” Overall, banks have done a good job in restoring health to their
balance sheets. Going forward, their loan expansion should be in line with their risk
management capabilities and administrative measures or regulatory forbearance to promote
lending should be avoided. Staff welcomed the planned launch of the International Financial
Reporting Standards in early-2010, as this would further strengthen banks’ provisioning
practices and bring greater clarity to the valuation of their security holdings.
C. Alleviating Balance of Payments Stress
26.
Indonesia has thus far successfully
secured external financing. The bulk of the
$24 billion gross external financing need
for 2009 is related to private sector debt
obligations, which have been generally
successfully rolled over or repaid so far this
year.11 The balance of payments, however, has
been in surplus largely from public sector
inflows as the government has effectively
secured external funding, including $3 billion
from an international bond placement in March,
and an additional $650 million in April from a
global sukuk (Islamic bond), which have
contributed to an increase in international

reserves by nearly $7 billion in the first five months of the year. The government has also
secured a contingency package for $5½ billion in budget support with the World Bank,
AsDB, Japan, and Australia, which includes Japan’s guarantee of a samurai bond issuance
scheduled for later this year, and additional external swap and credit lines.12
27.
The current level of international reserves is adequate, although a somewhat
larger buffer could help ease pressures in case of another major bout of risk aversion.
Given the current global economic uncertainties, there are still some lingering concerns about
worsening external liquidity risks as a result of global capital market and commodity price
developments. Specifically, balance of payments pressures could materialize quickly if
another round of global risk aversion—say, on the scale of what occurred in 2008—
significantly undermines market confidence and disrupts capital flows, making international
reserves and the external position vulnerable. For example, if risk aversion rises, private
capital inflows could decline, foreign holdings of government bonds and central bank bills
could be withdrawn (as in the last quarter of 2008), or some deposits could potentially take
flight. The current reserve level leaves a relatively small cushion to face a major external
shock, and building a somewhat larger buffer, while maintaining a flexible exchange rate
policy, would be desirable to further bolster market confidence.13 Indeed, countries with
access to large buffers relative to their financing needs did not see their spreads rise as much
during the crisis.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Benefiting from strong initial conditions and effective policy action, Indonesia
has thus far withstood well the global financial crisis. After enduring substantial market
pressures during the last quarter of 2008, market confidence has returned and recent growth
has been one of the strongest in the G-20 and the region. Policy responses have been
appropriate to manage the large external shocks and the slowing economy.

12

The additional sources of potential financing include a three-year swap line with China for Y 100 billion
($15 billion), an approximately $12 billion credit line from the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralized, and a
¥ 1½ trillion swap line with Japan; the terms and modalities of these financing lines are still being discussed.

13

Previous staff analysis indicates that when the large increase in the size and volatility of capital flows to
Indonesia—against which reserves provide insurance—is accounted for, it makes sense to judge the adequacy of
foreign reserves against a broader measure of the country’s external liabilities, not only short-term debt.
Although reserves have doubled in dollar terms since 2000, they have not increased much compared to the rise
in gross external liabilities (reserves accounted for 17¾ percent of gross external liabilities in 2000 and about
21½ percent in 2008). See M. Ruiz-Arranz and M. Zavadjil, “Adequacy of Indonesia’s Foreign Exchange
Reserves,” IMF Country Report No. 08/298. Reserves as a percent of broad money have also declined from
38 percent in 2000 to 30 percent in 2008.

19
29.
Protecting economic and financial stability is the biggest challenge. With growth
weakening and subject to the swings of the global environment, the government and BI need
to continue to focus on achieving the appropriate policy mix to support growth in a volatile
global environment, protect macroeconomic and financial sector stability, and alleviate
potential stresses to the balance of payments, particularly if major global risk aversion or
external liquidity risks return.
30.
Implementation of the fiscal stimulus package for 2009 and maintaining some
stimulus in 2010 are important for supporting growth. The final growth dividend from
the 2009 fiscal stimulus depends on its execution, especially of the capital spending measures
given their estimated higher multiplier effect. For 2010, a deficit close to 2 percent of GDP
would be consistent with a countercyclical policy, provide room for greater spending on
much needed infrastructure and social services, while also supporting further debt
consolidation.
31.
Progress on structural fiscal reforms could enhance budget flexibility and
improve stabilization policy. Several measures are already underway, including
strengthening cash management, simplifying budget execution procedures, and establishing a
consolidated TSA. Additional reforms would improve fiscal management, including lowering
energy subsidies, expanding the non-commodity tax base, strengthening tax administration,
and improving subnational government reporting.
32.
The monetary easing cycle was timely and appropriate; going forward, a more
cautious stance is warranted. Although inflationary pressures remain low and credit growth
was flat for the first five months of the year, there is ample stimulus in the pipeline and a
cautionary stance is appropriate until the direction of the economy can be fully gauged.
Monetary transmission is experiencing normal lags, and the interest rate reductions already
implemented should soon be reflected in higher credit expansion and help support a recovery
in investment, removing the need for any additional measures to support lending growth. The
exchange rate is broadly in equilibrium and its flexibility has served well as an external shock
absorber.
33.
Further strengthening the financial sector framework will enhance stability.
Aided by supportive policy measures, the Indonesian banking sector proved resilient to the
effects of the global financial turmoil. Close supervisory vigilance remains warranted as asset
quality is expected to deteriorate in sectors that have been more affected by the global
slowdown. At the same time, smaller and some mid-sized banks remain vulnerable to
liquidity risk given their unstable funding base, including difficulties accessing markets in
times of heightened market volatility. Quickly responding to any emerging problems would
be important in safeguarding the sector’s stability. Parliamentary approval of the Financial

20
Safety Net law and further strengthening the supervisory framework would help maintain
asset quality and enhance public confidence. The FSAP will provide useful inputs to guide
further financial sector reform.
34.
The current reserve position is adequate to handle moderate external shocks.
However, it leaves a relatively small buffer should global risk aversion deteriorate
substantially. Given the prevailing uncertainties for private capital flows and the scope for a
resurgence in global risk aversion, somewhat larger reserve buffers would help boost market
confidence.
35.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I: INDONESIA—PUBLIC AND EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. Public Debt
1.
Public sector debt has declined as a share of GDP since 2000. The ratio fell to a
post-crisis record-low level of 33 percent in 2008 (Figure I.1) owing to prudent fiscal
management, which led to primary surpluses averaging almost 2 percent of GDP per year in the
last decade. Reduced risk premia, lower interest rates, and high real GDP growth also contributed
to debt consolidation. Foreign-currency debt (mostly due to multilateral institutions) has fallen
markedly to about half of total debt, as the improved fiscal position facilitated government access
to the domestic capital market.
2.
In the baseline scenario, a moderate further decline in public sector debt is likely.
Despite a larger fiscal deficit, public debt is projected to fall to about 31 percent of GDP in 2009,
reflecting rupiah appreciation and falling interest rates. In the medium term, the public
debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline gradually to 28½ percent by 2014. Strong growth from
2011 and sustained fiscal prudence drive this result. A return to positive primary balances from
2011 is consistent with accommodating extra resources for development spending.
3.
Standard stress tests suggest that the projected decline in the debt ratio could be
vulnerable to contingent liabilities, sharp exchange rate movements, and higher interest
rates (Figure I.1). Fiscal contingent liabilities amounting to 10 percent of GDP could raise the
public sector debt to almost 38 percent of GDP by 2014, with the ratio above 40 percent in 2010
(a level not seen since 2005). A 30 percent currency depreciation would raise the debt ratio by
9 percentage points compared to the baseline. A large increase in real interest rates would have
smaller, but still sizeable, effects with the debt ratio reaching 33 percent by 2014. Other
macroeconomic shocks have a more limited impact.
B. External Debt
4.
Indonesia’s external debt has also declined steadily, from over 150 percent of GDP in
1998 to 29 percent in 2008 (Figure I.2). External debt as a percentage of exports has also
declined, from 288 percent to 97 percent, over the same period.
5.
In the baseline scenario, the external debt dynamics are projected to be sustainable.
The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline to around 22 percent by 2014; the main driving
factors are: (i) the projected increase in real GDP growth to 5−6¼ percent over the medium term;
(ii) a projected positive growth-interest rate differential; and (iii) an expected increase in
nondebt-creating capital inflows. The favorable trend in external debt may be reversed if these
expected positive developments do not occur.
6.
The external debt ratio is most vulnerable to shocks to the exchange rate. A one-time
30 percent real exchange rate depreciation would raise the debt ratio by 14 percentage points in
2010, with the impact falling to 12 percentage points over the baseline by 2014.

terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e
> 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP)
remain at their levels of the last projection year.

ANNEX II. INDONESIA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of June 18, 2009)
Indonesia Country Partnership Strategy
The World Bank Group’s (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Indonesia
for FY2009−12, which marked Indonesia’s emergence as a strong middle income country,
was approved by the WBG Board in September 2008. The CPS focuses on improving
Indonesia’s institutions, both at the central and sub-national level, through five core areas of
engagement: private sector development, infrastructure, community development, education,
environmental sustainability, and disaster mitigation.
CPS implementation is progressing apace, marked by strong dialogue and solid partnership
with the Indonesia’s core economic ministries and several line ministries and agencies,
including education, public works, people’s welfare, anti-corruption commission (KPK), and
supreme and state audit agencies (BPK and BPKP). The engagements with regional/local
counterparts including in Aceh, Papua, Central Java and Jakarta, are broadening. In addition,
a major effort to engage more seriously with civil society, academia and media has been
launched. Partnerships with the key bilateral and multilaterals, including EC, Japan,
Australia, Netherlands, ADB, UNDP and IMF remain robust.
World Bank Engagement: Selected Highlights
Supporting Indonesia's Efforts to Mitigate the Impact of the Global Financial Crisis.
Only a few months into the implementation of the new CPS, Indonesia encountered the
growing global financial crisis. The Government of Indonesia (GOI) has taken precautionary
and preemptive actions to address financial and fiscal concerns including approaching the
WBG and other development partners for financing support in a difficult environment. The
WBG has helped the Government mobilize contingent financing, including from bilateral,
multilateral and other sources, of US$5.5 billion, of which US$2 billion is in a
WBG - supported Development Policy Loan with a Deferred Drawdown Option
(DPL-DDO). Through adoption of a robust platform of reforms aimed at strengthening its
resilience, Indonesia is not only expected to weather the current crisis, but also emerge
stronger in its aftermath.
Strengthening the Governance Agenda. The WBG under the new CPS is supporting the
strengthening of Indonesia’s country systems. The fight against corruption is central to the
Government’s program and relevant institutions continue to be strengthened. Although
progress is being made, challenges remain, as epitomized by slow progress on implementing
the legal and judicial reform agenda. The CPS seeks to move away from a WBG focused
approach of “ring-fencing projects” to one designed to strengthen and build upon Indonesia’s
own systems, policies and procedures. This approach focuses on policy formulation, policy

4
and program implementation, financial management, procurement, budget implementation,
audit, social and environmental safeguards, monitoring and evaluation, and supports
Indonesia’s priority budget programs to enhance the quality of overall public spending.
Deepening Indonesia’s Decentralization. The decentralization and empowerment of local
governments has been one of Indonesia’s most remarkable achievements in the past 10 years.
As a result, Indonesia’s almost 500 sub-national governments now manage close to 40% of
all public spending. Many of elected heads of provinces and districts/cities are implementing
innovative reforms, although challenges are considerable. Needs, opportunities and the
WBG’s capacity to respond to the demand vary greatly across the archipelago. Over the CPS
period, the WBG will seek to engage with a limited number of sub-national governments that
demonstrate a clear commitment to reforms through the Public Expenditure Analysis and
Capacity Harmonization (PEACH) program. PEACH programs focus on local planning and
budgeting and are demand-driven, tailored to the needs of local governments and
implemented by them, together with local Indonesian research institutions. In addition, the
WBG has re-structured several Bank financed local government support programs, to
expedite their progress and resolve implementation bottlenecks. Lastly, the
WBG-administered Decentralization Support Facility brings together a number of
development partners with a broad mandate to engage Indonesian institutions essential to the
local accountability framework, such as legislatures, media and NGO networks.
Enhancing Poverty Reduction and Sustainable Growth. The WBG is supporting
comprehensive policy reforms and innovative investment programs to support Government’s
poverty reduction and sustainable growth programs. Learning from the effectiveness of
successful engagements, such as the decade-long well performing Kecamatan Development
Project or KDP, the world’s largest program that uses the Community-Driven Development
approach, and the Urban Poverty Project (UPP), the WBG - supported operations in this area
have expanded, including support to the National Community Empowerment
Program - PNPM. Such operations build on what has worked well, focus on mechanisms for
social accountability, promote external transparency and access to information, enhance
planning and budgeting capacity, and integrate AAA/Trust Funds with lending and
supervision. Recent major operations also include a series of development program loans
(DPLs and Infrastructure DPLs) in support of the government’s reform program to improve
the investment climate, public financial management, public service delivery and
infrastructure. Investment projects support, among others, the School Assistance—
BOS-KITA program to better manage education funding and Indonesia Infrastructure Finance
Facility for infrastructure funding.
Supporting Indonesia’s Emerging Regional and International Role on Environmental
Sustainability and Climate Change. Indonesia emits significant levels of greenhouse gases,
mainly from deforestation and land use change. The GOI recognizes this issue and is
developing an initiative on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD)

5
supported by the WBG. Indonesia achieved global visibility as host of the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)’s Conference of Parties (COP) - 13
in 2007 and is now working together with Poland and Denmark toward COP 14.
The GOI is pursuing an innovative and potentially path-breaking engagement with the WBG
on geothermal energy. The WBG is also deepening the relationships established with the
National Planning Agency (Bappenas) and the local governments of Aceh, Nias and
Jogjakarta in supporting selected elements of the Government’s actions to strengthen natural
disaster resiliency. In addition to investment operations, the WBG is supporting the GOI with
background studies and other analytical work and technical assistance provided to the
Government agencies at the central and local levels. One example of such support is the
provision of technical assistance to the Ministry of Public Works to support development and
implementation of the master plan for peatland rehabilitation in South Kalimantan.
Support for Sustainable Recovery of Aceh, Nias and Yogyakarta. Reconstruction efforts
after the tsunami in Aceh and the series of earthquakes devastating Nias, Central Java and
Jogyakarta have become a key element of the WBG’s program, anchored around two
substantial multi-donor trust funds. The Multi-Donor Fund (MDF) for Aceh and Nias brings
together some 15 partners and is providing nearly US$700 million in resources, while Java
Reconstruction Fund (JRF), supported by six partners, brings in an amount close to
US$85 million. Post-disaster reconstruction and recovery in both provinces are progressing
well. Following the closure of the Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Agency’s (BRR)
operations in April 2009, tasked with the reconstruction of Aceh and Nias, the local
Government has resumed the authority over the development. As the recovery process
progresses, the sustainability of reconstruction investments and promotion of economic
development through livelihoods and income generation programs are becoming vital. Both
the MDF and JRF are supporting the preparation of new economic development/livelihoods
programs. Long term development will also hinge on continuation of peace and stability.
Bank Operations in FY09 and FY10
Lending. FY09 (July 2008 to June 2009) was marked by a strong lending performance, with
9 projects for US$4.225 billion, including US$2 billion in DPL-DDO, a regular DPL and an
infrastructure DPL, the National Community Empowerment Program (PNPM) - Urban and
Rural, a School Grants Assistance Program (BOS-KITA), a Tax Administration Reform
project (PINTAR), a Dam Operations and an Infrastructure Financing Facility. The active
portfolio as of end-April comprises 30 projects, including 2 additional financing operations.
In FY10 (July 2009 to June 2010), the WBG expects to deliver 9−10 projects across CPS
engagement areas. The base scenario envisages a lending volume in line with that in the CPS
of some US$2.6 billion including DPL6, IDPL3, Urban Water Supply and Java Bali
Additional Financing Emergency Reconstruction Project. Other projects expected to be

6
delivered in FY10 are projects to enhance medical education, strengthen statistical capacity
of the Government, increase youth employment, and expand community development in rural
and urban areas, etc.
Analytical and Advisory Services. In addition to the lending program, the WBG is
delivering to the Government of Indonesia policy notes and just-in-time advice, technical
assistance, as well as reports including a Development Policy Review, a report on Budget
Reform (with the IMF), Labor Markets, Health Financing, HIV/AIDs interventions, and a
Country Environment Assessment.
In the year ahead the WBG expects to deliver continuing analytical and advisory support,
including policy notes and reports for the new Government including on Agriculture and
Social Protection, Public Spending, Teacher Management, Low Carbon Growth, Papua
Infrastructure Strategy, and Urbanization.
Trust Funds. Trust funds (TF) and grant financing are an integral part of the WBG program.
The Indonesian TF portfolio is around US$1 billion at present. Going forward, knowledge
partnerships in delivering on the CPS agenda will become more important.

ANNEX III: INDONESIA—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
(As of June 12, 2009)
Asian Development Bank (ADB) cumulative loans to Indonesia exceeded $23.5 billion at
end-December 2008. In 2008, the ADB approved a total of $1,085 million or 10.3 percent of
the total loans approved by the institution for the year. Nonsovereign loans accounted for
$75 million or 6.7 percent of the total loans. Out of the $1,010 million sovereign loans more
than 80 percent were provided through three policy-based operations which advanced reforms
in macroeconomic management, infrastructure provision, and decentralized public financial
management.
In 2006, the ADB Board endorsed the Indonesia Country Strategy and Program (CSP)
2006−2009. The CSP aims to help the government achieve higher levels of pro-poor
sustainable growth and to enhance social development, with a key thematic focus on
governance and capacity development in all operations. Five areas of engagement were
derived to address the main constraints to development: improved infrastructure and
infrastructure services, deepened financial sector, improved decentralization, accelerated
MDG achievement, and strengthened environment and natural resources management. Since
then annual public sector lending and non-lending programs has been agreed with the
government selectively focusing on these areas of engagement.
Between 1967 and 2008, ADB provided 499 Technical Assistance grants to Indonesia
amounting to $266.66 million. The TA grants were financed from ADB’s Technical
Assistance Special Fund, the Japan Special Fund, and other sources. In 2008, eight TA grants
amounting to $13.0 million were approved, and represented 4.7 percent of total TA grants
approved by ADB during the year.

ANNEX IV: INDONESIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES1
1.
Indonesia’s macroeconomic statistics and statistical base are broadly adequate to
conduct effective surveillance. Indonesia has been a subscriber to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since September 1996, observing most of the SDDS
requirements. Exceptions include the currency composition in the reserve template in the first
quarter of 2007, general government data for 2005, and the timeliness in the production index
data where short delays have occurred.
Real Sector
2.
The annual national accounts have 2000 as the base year. Quarterly GDP data are
published in a timely manner for both expenditure and production sides. The estimates are
based on a limited set of indirect indicators of uncertain quality. Some sectors are influenced
strongly by seasonality, and seasonally adjusted data are prepared but not published. In
addition, no survey of nonfinancial services is prepared. An economic census of businesses is
undertaken every 10 years, without updates in the intervening period. The household budget
survey does not cover higher income households. There are inconsistencies with the Bank
Indonesia (BI) in imports and exports; and, with the Ministry of Finance (MoF) regarding
local government figures. The five-yearly input-output tables remove statistical discrepancies,
but there are large discrepancies in the intervening years. The Fund has recommended:
(i) development of a system to continuously update the census of businesses; (ii) introduction
of comprehensive annual establishment surveys for nonfinancial services industries;
(iii) publication of annual GDP estimates, including a time series of at least 20 years;
(iv) development of a set of annual supply and use tables (SUTS) starting from 2000; and
(v) enhancing the convergence exercise on trade data with BI.
3.
Labor market data, including wages and employment, are available, albeit reported
with some delay, through the annual labor market survey (Sakernas) published by the Bureau
of Statistics. Data on minimum and maximum wages for the formal sector are also available.
Quarterly data are available on industrial wages, with some delay.
Public Finance
4.
Available government finance data suffer from a number of weaknesses, in terms of
classification, coverage, and timeliness. Data on budgetary central government were available
until recently with a one-month lag, but subnational (provincial and local) government data
are available only with a lag of two years, and the quality of this data is variable. Problems in
1

The section is based on a detailed assessment of Indonesia’s observance of the IMF’s Data Quality Assessment
Framework, prepared by STA in March 2005.

10
budget and accounting systems have been compounded by the recent decentralization
initiatives, which have shifted substantial resources to the subnational governments.
Substantial efforts are in train, and significant progress has been made to overcome these
problems, ranging from the planned adoption of advanced accounting and statistical
standards, to the introduction of best practice budget management processes, and the
development of computerized financial management information systems.
5.
Against this background, the MoF and the Ministry of Home Affairs are committed to
keeping the requirements of fiscal statistics at the forefront of ongoing fiscal reforms, so as to
make better statistical monitoring one of the goals of the current efforts. The coverage and
timeliness of public debt statistics is generally adequate; however, only limited information
on contingent liabilities is available. The new expenditure classification introduced in the
2005 budget, is generally consistent with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001
(GFSM 2001) on functional codes and classification, although the data are compiled on a
cash basis.
6.
The authorities have committed to adopting GFSM 2001 standards. To this end, the
Fund staff has recommended in the short term: (i) establishment of a register of all
extrabudgetary units to improve the coverage of central government activity; and
(ii) inclusion of the economic codes consistent with the GFSM 2001 in the chart of accounts
to ensure that general government units report in a statistically meaningful way all
transactions and balances over which they exert control. Over the medium-term, priority
should be given to (i) seizing the opportunity offered by the two new subnational fiscal
reform efforts to simultaneously establish the underlying reporting arrangements to obtain
timely preliminary data for local government statistics; and (ii) to develop GFSM 2001
operating statements, statements of sources and uses of cash, and partial balance sheets, all of
which should be published on the MoF websites.2
Monetary Accounts
7.
Good quality monetary statistics are compiled by the BI on a timely basis. With STA
assistance, BI has developed an integrated database from which alternative presentations of
monetary statistics can be drawn to meet the needs of BI and the Fund. Further work,
however, is needed to expand the coverage of depository corporations to include mutual
funds (REKSA DANA), which report data to BAPEPAM—an agency that supervises some
of the nonbank financial institutions. To this end, BI is currently developing institutional
data-sharing arrangements that would enable it to access the register of—and data on—
mutual funds.
2

Local Government Finance and Governance Reform (LGFGR) project.

11
8.
To strengthen monetary statistics, STA missions have recommended: (i) collection of
source data on mutual funds in a format that meets statistical requirements; (ii) expansion of
the coverage of the monetary statistics to include mutual funds; and (iii) harmonization of the
reported interbank positions between the BI and commercial banks.
Balance of Payments
9.
Trade data are affected by some shortcomings. While customs sources utilized by the
BI are considered generally reliable, coverage of merchandise trade flows is insufficient.
Also, when the online reporting system for exports and imports was introduced in 2004, the
historical series were reconstructed only as far back as 2003. As a result, prior to 2003
balance of payments statistics are not entirely consistent with the national accounts estimates.
Data on services suffer from outdated surveys and weak methodologies. The BI adjusts the
customs data to cover exports and imports of Batam and other bonded zones. Data on
services suffer from outdated surveys and weak methodology. Adjustments are also made to
data on compensation of employees and workers’ remittances to cover professional workers,
legal workers not reported to the Ministry of Manpower, and illegal workers.
10.
For the capital and financial account, the methodological basis for the compilation of
FDI data needs substantial improvement. Inflows are currently calculated based on loan
disbursements to companies that have foreign equity using a fixed ratio to estimate equity
inflows. Surveys conducted by BI to collect FDI data have a low response rate and the
coverage of the directory of enterprises should be improved. Other areas that need
improvement include the recording of trade credits and the asset data for portfolio investment
and other investment transactions. The magnitude of the errors and omissions item has been
significant and appears to be related to the methodology used, for instance, for unrecorded
assets in the financial account. Financial transactions data have not been reconciled with
changes in the International Investment Position (IIP).
11.
The BI has proposed a range of measures to address these weaknesses. On traderelated data, a working group has been established to reconcile differences between BI and
customs data. The BI is planning to collect and publish data on goods imported for
processing, goods procured in ports by carriers, and transactions with the oil and gas sector.
On the financial account, the BI is planning to collect and publish data on direct investment
abroad, portfolio investment assets, other investment assets, and trade credits, to help address
the shortcomings in the recording of private financial flows.
International Investment Position
12.
An annual IIP is compiled, but the underlying data are weak in several areas, notably
for FDI. External debt statistics have improved considerably with the introduction of an
External Debt Information System (EDIS) in 2002. The system records external debt of
government and over 800 other entities that report to the BI on a monthly basis. The system

12
generates data for public sector external debt and debt service, as well as those for private
banks, that are considered reliable. However, improvements are still needed with respect to
components of private corporate sector data, particularly in distinguishing between scheduled
and actual debt service, in estimating the accumulation/reduction of private sector payments
arrears, and in estimating rescheduling and debt reductions received by the private sector
from external creditors.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Indonesia
July 13, 2009
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff report
was circulated to the Executive Board on June 30, 2009. This information does not alter the
staff’s assessment of policy issues and recommendations contained in the report.
2.
Financial markets have been generally quiet in the period leading up to and since the
Presidential elections, which were successfully held on July 8. The official results will be
known on July 27. The rupiah/U.S. dollar exchange rate has remained flat so far in July,
government bond yields and CDS spreads have been stable, and foreign exchange reserves
have remained broadly unchanged.
3.
Recent data continue to point to a sustained rebound in economic activity. Leading
consumption indicators continued to rise in May, including motor vehicle sales and retail
sales, and consumer confidence reached a 4½-year high in June. Moreover, tourist arrivals
are also on the rise and have increased by 4 percent in April and May (y/y). Reflecting rising
commodity prices, non-oil exports have continued to recover in April and May relative to
Q1 of 2009, and imports were also up in May in all groups, including raw materials and
capital goods. On an annual basis, however, non-oil exports and imports are still down about
15 percent and 30 percent, respectively.
4.
Headline inflation fell to 3.7 percent (y/y) in June, the lowest rate since June 2000. To
a large extent, the deceleration reflected the unwinding of base effects (there was a
30 percent fuel price adjustment in late May 2008). Core inflation also slowed, but is still at
5.6 percent. While there may be some upward pressure on food prices as the economy
recovers, year-end inflation could potentially finish slightly below the current projection of
5 percent.
5.
In line with expectations, Bank Indonesia (BI) reduced the policy rate on July 3 by
25 basis points to 6.75 percent. Consistent with the staff report, BI noted that the room for
more easing has become limited due to possible inflation risks in 2010.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 28, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Indonesia
On July 13, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Indonesia.1
Background
Indonesia entered the current global crisis with strong initial conditions. Aided by a generally
favorable global economic climate that prevailed prior to the recent crisis, Indonesia’s
fundamentals were strengthened through sound macroeconomic policy implementation,
including prudent debt management and developing a sound financial sector. Economic growth
averaged about 6 percent since 2005, fiscal performance was strong, the current account was
in surplus, both public and external debt dropped to about 30 percent of GDP, and international
reserves rose to a relatively comfortable level.
Notwithstanding the initial impact of the global crisis, the economy has rebounded in 2009.
During the last quarter of 2008, various factors—falling commodity prices, liquidity problems in
some segments of the banking sector, default by a private sector conglomerate on its
obligations, and general global risk aversion—led to a sharp deterioration in market conditions.
However, with relatively strong corporate and banking sector balance sheet positions, high
capitalization and profitability of the banking system, and a series of mitigating policy measures,
the economy was able to absorb the impact of the crisis. These factors, combined with the
stronger than expected recovery in Q1 of 2009, have boosted domestic and foreign investor
confidence.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

The economy’s resilience to the weak global conditions was evident in the stronger than
expected GDP growth in Q1 of 2009 that was supported by particularly strong consumption, as
private consumption benefited from a large election-related spending stimulus. External
accounts also improved in Q1 as the current account was positive from a non-oil trade surplus
and the financial account registered a surplus due to demand for sovereign debt securities. CPI
inflation has decelerated rapidly since October 2008 reflecting the weaker economic conditions
as well as falling commodity prices.
Macroeconomic policy responses have kept appropriate pace with the evolving economic
conditions. Bank Indonesia has been on a monetary-easing cycle since December 2008,
consistent with lower inflationary pressures and slowing domestic demand. The policy rate has
been cut by 275 basis points to 6¾ percent. A fiscal stimulus package of about 1.4 percent of
GDP was announced in February 2009. The fiscal space for the stimulus was made possible by
solid performance over several years that has resulted in a decline in public debt. Moreover, the
flexible exchange rate has served well as an external shock absorber.
Banking and corporate sector indicators are generally robust, and have proved resilient to the
crisis. Financial soundness indicators improved in 2008—profitability rose and the capital base
strengthened further. Coming from a period of rapid credit growth in the last two years, and in
light of the uncertain economic climate, credit expansion has decelerated on a monthly basis
since December 2008. Indonesian companies have over time reduced their vulnerabilities,
including lowering leverage ratios, raising profitability, and reducing their exposure to external
liabilities.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the resilience of the Indonesian economy, which owed much to
strong initial fundamentals and appropriate policy responses. Private consumption, supported
by the fiscal stimulus package, has kept growth positive and among the highest in the region.
The financial sector has recovered from the adverse initial impact of the global turmoil, and
investor sentiment has improved in recent months. Nevertheless, Directors noted that, although
the economic outlook for 2009 remains positive, another round of global risk aversion could
adversely affect external liquidity, demand, and growth prospects for Indonesia. It will therefore
be important that the authorities strive to achieve the appropriate policy mix, and promptly
adjust it as needed, to preserve macroeconomic and financial stability.
Directors welcomed the fiscal stimulus plan for 2009 and underscored that timely and efficient
implementation of the spending program, especially on infrastructure, would be critical to
sustaining the economic recovery. They considered it appropriate to maintain some of the
stimulus in 2010, given the available fiscal space. While some Directors pointed to financing
and capacity constraints, most saw room for a somewhat higher fiscal deficit than currently
planned, noting that such a level remains consistent with continued debt consolidation over the
medium term, an indication of the authorities’ record of fiscal prudence.

3
Directors commended the authorities for the progress in fiscal reforms toward a consolidated
Treasury Single Account, simplified budget execution procedures, and strengthened cash
management. They encouraged the authorities to build on the momentum of past reform efforts
to enhance budget flexibility and improve public resource management. Further strengthening
tax administration and lowering energy subsidies would help create fiscal space for priority
infrastructure and social expenditures.
Directors generally considered that the monetary policy easing since December 2008 was
timely and appropriate in the face of decelerating inflation and weakening investment. Going
forward, they supported a more cautious stance, given ample liquidity in the banking system,
long lags in monetary transmission, and the risk of a reversal of capital flows. Directors
encouraged the authorities to continue to strengthen the monetary policy framework. Strong
commitment to the medium-term inflation targets, as well as publication of inflation forecasts,
would help guide inflation expectations and enhance policy credibility.
Directors stressed that exchange rate flexibility has served the country well in recent months,
and remains an important shock absorber. They noted the staff’s assessment that the current
level of the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, and that reserves
are at a comfortable level. Most Directors considered it prudent nevertheless to build larger
reserve buffers gradually over the medium term to preserve investor confidence in the event
that global risk aversion deteriorates. Some others believed that the current level of reserves
and the various contingency arrangements should provide an adequate cushion.
Directors welcomed the robustness of the banking sector, with banks recording strong capital
positions and improved profitability. The crisis management measures recently introduced by
Bank Indonesia have helped alleviate liquidity pressures and restore market confidence.
Directors looked forward to early parliamentary approval of the Financial Safety Net law, which
would help strengthen the legal framework for bank resolution. They emphasized the
importance of a further strengthening of the early warning systems, and of continued close
supervision of banks, particularly small and medium-sized banks exposed to liquidity risk.
Directors looked forward to the forthcoming Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) to
help identify priorities for further financial sector reform.

and Dicky Kartikoyono, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
July 13, 2009
I. Introduction
On behalf of our Indonesian authorities, we would like to express our gratitude to the mission
team for the constructive discussion during their recent visit. Our Indonesian authorities
value this year’s Article IV consultation during a time when the global economy is
undergoing a severe economic strain. The staff report provides a balanced and clear overview
of key recent economic developments and the challenges facing Indonesia and so many other
member countries. Overall, they broadly agree with the staff appraisal and appreciate their
policy recommendations going forward.
II. Recent Economic Developments
After several years of strong and sustained economic growth, Indonesia now faces the
challenge to maintain the hard-earned macroeconomic stability and to keep advancing
towards higher economic and social developments. The substantial waning in commodity
prices, slackening global demand and trade began to bear down on the Indonesian economy
since the fourth quarter of 2008. The global financial strain has also put pressures on
domestic financial markets, with banks finding it harder to secure external financing, as well
as exporters to obtain favorable trade financing. The heightened uncertainty has signaled
both portfolio and real sector investors to be more observant in revolving their investment or
considering their new commitment.
Nevertheless, in relative terms, Indonesia’s overall position is not as precarious as for many
other countries. With its less interconnectedness on global capital, robust private
consumption, and better exports performance, Indonesia’s slowdown has come relatively
later and been more moderate than for many countries. Along with stronger macroeconomic
policy framework and credibility, the authorities have been able to weather the current crisis
from a better position than in the past. This achievement has been recognized by Moody’s,
which has changed the outlook for Indonesia's Ba3 sovereign rating from stable to positive
last month.
The budget performance in fiscal year of 2008/2009 was remarkable. Budget deficit was just
0.1 percent of GDP, compared with 2.1 percent projected earlier in 2008 when global oil
prices and the Indonesia’s energy subsidies rose to their peak. Revenue was about 10 percent
above budgeted level, due to high commodity prices and improvements in tax office
administration, while underspending continued as it had in recent years. Despite the
exchange rate depreciation, the debt to GDP ratio declined significantly to 33 percent at yearend. This prudent fiscal management has allowed our authorities to adopt countercyclical
macroeconomic policies for stabilizing the external and internal balances. The authorities
were able to take early action in providing pertinent economic stimulus. The immediate task
was to restore confidence and maintain aggregate demand. Coverage of deposit guarantee
was increased, interest rate was lowered, and the real economy was stimulated by fiscal

2
expansion. Meanwhile, the unprecedented spending associated with the general
parliamentary election process in the first quarter of 2009 was substantially playing out to
resist further retrenchment in economic growth. The vibrant democratic process was
apparently reflected in the high growth of the election-related-sub sectors, such as
advertising, telecommunication, transportation, hotel, restaurant, printing and textile industry.
Both fundamental policy responses and a temporary event turned out to be effective in
cushioning in the economy from further deterioration. In tandem, Indonesia GDP growth just
stalled to 4.4 percent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2009 from 6.1 percent in 2008,
while it slowed even more severe in most other economies. The subsequent presidential
election process, which will be held on July 8, with the fall back second round ending in
September 2009, is also expected to sustain demand and economic activity.
After hiking sharply in the first three quarters of 2008, fuelled primarily by soaring global oil
and food prices, CPI inflation came down in response to the continued weakening in the
economy as well as the deflationary trend in trading partner nations and improvement in
supply of food stuffs. Bank Indonesia has responded to the ups and downs of the global trend
with an abrupt shift in directions of monetary policy. It raised its policy rate from 8 percent in
May to 9.5 percent in October 2008 during the mounting inflationary pressures. On the
reverse trend, policy rate was cut in each of eight consecutive months from December 2008
to July 2009 by a total of 275 basis points, when the authorities has allowed lower global
prices to pass through to administered prices.
On external position, Indonesia, as an open economy, is obviously in no position to isolate
itself from the global malaise, despite having developed considerable growth momentum. The
fallout of the global financial crisis in the second half of 2008 has suddenly reversed the
Indonesia’s balance of payments performance, after benefiting from buoyant volume of
exports and strong commodity prices in the first half of 2008. Foreign portfolio investors
rushed to pull their existing holdings of financial assets out of Indonesia’s market. These
events led to heavy pressure on the Rupiah and sharply increased its volatility. The Rupiah
depreciated more than 15 percent during the last quarter of 2008. Also, exports began
tapering off in response to falling commodity prices and declining economic activity in
trading partner countries. The combined deficits in the current account and the capital
account contributed to a surging balance of payments deficit of USD 4.2 billion in the final
quarter of 2008. International reserves declined by close to USD 8 billion from its
comfortable level of USD 59.4 billion in the first half of 2008 to USD 51.6 billion at the end
of 2008. Indonesia’s balance of payments, however, regained its traction in the first quarter
of 2009 with overall balance charting a surplus of nearly USD 4 billion and international
reserves escalating to USD 54.8 billion (equivalent to 5.9 months of imports and official debt
repayment). This was due to increased capital inflows from government bond issuance and
foreign portfolio investment.
On the banking sector front, following rapid credit expansion of 29.5 percent in 2008, bank
lending has started to decline as the economic slowdown impaired supply and demand of
credit. Banks have become more cautious and perceived higher credit risk in their lending
activities by applying stricter loan standard. Furthermore, customers have been reluctant to

3
expand their business and production as the global slowdown has affected both domestic and
external demand. This development coupled with increased required provisioning because of
worsening quality of the loan may lower bank profitability. Despite this challenge, Capital
Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is expected to remain high about 18 percent and Non Performing
Loan (NPL) remaining below 5 percent in 2009 with over 100 percent loan loss coverage.
The Indonesian banking sector thus continues to be healthy and robust.
III. Prospects and Policies Direction
Over 2009 and 2010, our authorities remain cautious of the downside risks of growing
uncertainty, weakening global demand, and limited sources of financing, should the
heightened global economic slowdown prolonged beyond expectation. They are fully
cognizant that the global crisis will result in Indonesia’s slackening GDP growth and
exacerbating the already decreasing export performance. A range of the policies taken under
crisis response initiatives, including unconventional steps, has done much to stabilize the
economy during the global downturn. Our authorities are determined to make every effort to
minimize the impact of the crisis, and to take measures to strike a balance between three
strategic aspects: namely, monetary stability, strengthening financial system stability, and
aligning stimuli to maintain economic growth momentum.
Fiscal Policy
On fiscal policy, our authorities have formulated the revised budget with a stimulus package
amounted to USD 7.1 billion, which constitutes a range of tax cut, provision of subsidies for
medication and cooking oil, pay increases for civil servants, provision of direct cash transfers
and expenditures for community block grants. The expectation is to maintain the level of
strong domestic demand in the first quarter of 2009 so as to adequately compensate for the
anticipated deterioration in income and exports. Our authorities are aware that the execution
capacity of the fiscal stimulus, both by the central and regional government, will be crucial to
preventing a sharp drop in domestic demand. Hence, they have taken extraordinary efforts to
expedite the budget execution process, particularly for regional government, in a right and
timely fashion. These measures are therefore expected to be able to secure the public
purchasing power and continue the level of first quarter GDP growth of 4.4 percent to the
rest of 2009.
Going forward, the government is vigilant that the flagging economy would affect budget
revenue, including tax revenue, dividends of State Owned Enterprises and oil & gas revenue.
On the other hand, they are compelled to ramp up their expenditures allocation for
undertaking various counter cyclical policies. At the current juncture, the government has
secured a parliamentary approval to revise its budget by increasing the deficit to 2.5 percent
of GDP, from 1.0 percent in the original budget.
Nonetheless, it is acknowledged that an expansionary budget always brings a considerable
risk in secure financing resources, especially with short supply of global liquidity. As a

4
prudent and precautionary step in such a case, and to safeguard market confidence, during the
first quarter of 2009, the authorities sold 3.5 billion dollar denominated bonds, and USD 650
million global Islamic Bond. These have boosted international reserves up to
USD 57.9 billion. Furthermore, the government has engaged in intensive talks with
development partners to provide back up in the form of standby loans, should it not be
possible to access the financial market on reasonable terms. So far, several creditors’
commitment has been granted to guarantee standby loans amounting to USD 5.5 billion,
including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank (WB), Australia and Japan,
in the form of guarantee for a samurai bond issuance.
Monetary Policy
On monetary policies, Bank Indonesia’s heightened alertness to strike an optimum balance in
maintaining price stability while providing an effective monetary stimulus to the real sector
has proven to be timely and effective. CPI inflation in 2009 is projected to continue on a
downward trend in response to a very good harvest season, the still weakened condition of
the domestic economy, low inflation in trading partner nations and improvement in supply of
foods. After eight consecutive cuts since December 2008, the policy rate of 6.75 percent is
now predicted to approach its bottom. Inflation for 2009 is expected to be at the lower end of
the 5-7 percent projection.
The downward trend of the BI Rate has also met with positive response in the banking
system, albeit on a limited scale. Since December 2008, bank deposit rates have come down
150 bps in response to cuts in the BI Rate. Over the same period, loan interest rates eased by
an aggregate 100 bps, while the expansion of bank lending has just started to show its early
sign of recovery. In this connection, Bank Indonesia has a strong commitment to strengthen
the effectiveness of its public communication to address the weakened monetary policy
transmission through banks deposit and lending rates. Be that as it may, with the spurred
optimism of business sector post the election process, credit growth would likely be at its
faster pace in the second quarter of 2009.
External Position and Exchange Rate Development
Like in many other economies, the weaker global growth in 2009 will put heavy challenges
to the Indonesia’s external position. Indonesia’s exports will vary with the development in
global commodity prices, while both the value and quantity of imports will drop, at least as
swiftly as the plunge in exports. The rate of decline in imports may reach a trough due to the
weakening domestic demand and sluggish international trade.
As a result, the authorities are aware of the risk of a minor current account deficit, though
the prospect of maintaining current account surplus remains open with the rebound of global
commodity prices and improved demand from emerging markets. In the capital and financial
account, the continuing consolidations on global financial markets will slowdown capital
inflows to Indonesia. Inflows from government’s financing and foreign direct investment will
balance the impact and positive perception on domestic economy will help improve portfolio
inflows.

5

The extent of the recovery of global financial markets will likely be key to performance in
the Indonesia capital and financial account. Meanwhile, disbursement on external debt and
issuance of government global bond will affect the magnitude of capital movement of
Indonesian financial assets, which will eventually influence the Rupiah stability. Bearing this
in mind, our authorities have enacted preemptive steps to call on foreign reserves under
various bilateral and multilateral swap arrangements. They have access to bilateral currency
swap arrangement with China amounted to RMB 100 billion (equivalent to USD 15 billion)
as well as bilateral swap arrangement with Japan, China and Korea totalling USD 18 billion.
Also, they have worked closely with the ASEAN+ 3 partners to speed up the implementation
of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilaterisation (of which Indonesia’s access amounted to
USD 11.925 billion). To date, none of these facilities has been withdrawn, as Indonesia’s
international reserves remain steady at the adequate level.
This was followed by a temporary measure to safeguard the supply of foreign currency in the
domestic market in order to maintain exchange rate stability during mounting uncertainty.
Under this temporary regulation, banks may avail a USD repurchase agreement with Bank
Indonesia. They can bring their Indonesian Government foreign currency denominated bond
to Bank Indonesia to be exchanged with foreign currency in repo transactions for tenors of 1
month.
Hence, since April 2009, all the abovementioned factors have contributed to the Rupiah
stabilizing below 10.500 per USD, after depreciating gradually around 11.000-12.000 per
USD in the last 6 months.
The Financial Sector Development
Recent aggregate financial indicators suggest that Indonesia’s financial sector remains sound
and healthy. In April 2009, overall bank capital adequacy ratio (CAR) was 17.6 percent,
while the gross non-performing loans (NPLs) ratio has been held steadily at around
4 percent, a far cry from levels seen during the Asian crisis. Liquidity in the banking system,
including the inter-bank money market, has also progressively improved alongside growth in
depositor funds. Meanwhile, on the financial market, capital inflows have been driven by
positive sentiment in the stabilized global economic activity. This in turn has led to an
appreciation of the Rupiah, a renewed growth in the composite stock index and an
improvement in yield on Indonesian Government Securities. The Credit Default Swap (CDS)
spread for Indonesia, as an indicator of risk perceptions, also eased from 403 bps at end-April
2009 to about 333 bps at end-May 2009.
On banking policy, the authorities continued to promulgate regulations and policies with
prudential principles but providing enough room for bank intermediation and business
financing through the capital market and other non-bank financial institutions. Improved
coordination between Bank Indonesia and the Government under the new Financial Safety
Net framework has improved surveillance quality in the banking sector and non-bank
financial institutions as well as the capital market. The expeditious takeover of a mid-size
problem bank by the Government during the peak of global crisis and the closure of a small

6
problem bank in April 2009 by Bank Indonesia have resulted in strengthened public
confidence in the banking system. Furthermore, discipline when implementing prudent
regulations succeeded in limiting Indonesian banks’ exposure to larger problems associated
with derivative products, as faced by a number of other developing and developed countries.
Going forward, the authorities have committed to improve capital market and banking
system resiliency by enacting several strategic initiatives. Their immediate priority is to
promote banks efficiency and roles in expanding financial services, while continuing to
strengthen their supervisory framework. These initiatives call for simplifying the
administrative burdens of the system, along with ongoing close monitoring to point out
potential problems. Coupled with regular stress test to evaluate vulnerabilities, prompt and
corrective actions in handling problems are essential to confine further deterioration in the
system.
