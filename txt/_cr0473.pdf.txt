January 7, 2004
1.
This statement summarizes discussions on future Fund involvement in Djibouti,
which were held during a staff visit in Djibouti from December 7–14, 2003, and after the
staff report was circulated to the Executive Board on December 5, 2003. It does not change
the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The staff explained to the authorities that a period of decisive policy implementation
was required before possibly entering into a new arrangement under the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF). Moreover, the staff noted that, provided that donors continue to
grant Djibouti nonmilitary budgetary aid in support of its economic reforms, there would not
be a balance of payments financing need in 2004.
3.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s recommendation to move to a Staff Monitored
Program (SMP), covering at least twelve months, to establish a strong track record of policy
reform and mobilize adequate external financial assistance. Under this program, the
authorities intend to complete the unfinished reform agenda of the previous PRGF
arrangement, including measures to strengthen the fiscal position and increase
competitiveness (such as privatization and adoption of new labor and investment codes). In
addition, the program would include additional measures to improve governance and
transparency (such as periodic publication of government accounts audit and reports on
expenditures in priority social areas) and strengthen social safety nets.
4.
It was agreed that the staff would return to Djibouti to finalize discussions on a SMP
after two conditions are fulfilled: the adoption by the national assembly of a 2004 budget
along the lines discussed with staff; and the transmittal by the authorities to the staff of a
draft Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) that clearly incorporates
measures and a timetable to complete the unfinished reform agenda of the previous PRGF.
5.
The 2004 budget was approved by the national assembly on December 29, 2003. The
staff did not yet receive all the details of the approved budget in order to assess whether it
fully reflects the latest discussions that were held during the December 2003 staff visit,
including on achieving the objective of a 2.5 percent of GDP surplus in the domestic fiscal
balance and the demobilization of 500 military at end-March 2004.
