SLOVAK REPUBLIC
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the
2004 Consultation with the Slovak Republic
Approved by Robert A. Feldman and Anthony Boote
January 26, 2005

The 2004 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Bratislava during October 27–November 10.
The team, headed by Mr. Fernández-Ansola, included Mmes. Choueiri and Oomes, and Mr. Moore (all
EUR). Mr. Sipko, Advisor to Mr. Kiekens (Executive Director), attended several meetings. The mission
met with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Mikloš; Governor Jusko and Vice-Governor
Kohútiková of the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS); other senior officials; and representatives of
parliament, trade unions, financial institutions, and foreign investors.
The Slovak Republic has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, and maintains an exchange rate system
free of restrictions (Appendix I).
The Slovak Republic joined the European Union (EU) on May 1, 2004. The center-right coalition
government in power since 2002 has a slight minority in parliament. The next general election is due in
September 2006. The authorities have announced their intention to adopt the euro in 2009.
In concluding the last Article IV consultation on July 23, 2003, Directors commended the government’s
skillful economic management and commitment to reform. Directors agreed that to sustain Slovakia’s
favorable outlook the authorities will need to address still-high unemployment and achieve a sustainable
fiscal deficit reduction. They welcomed the government’s wide-ranging reform agenda to address these
challenges, and noted that its full implementation would be key to prepare Slovakia’s entry into the EU.
The mission updated the Report on Standard and Codes (ROSC) fiscal transparency module. The Slovak
Republic meets the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) specifications. Data in this report
reflect information received by January 10, 2005.
In compliance with OECD conventions, Slovakia has adopted legislation that tightened penalties for
bribery offenses and money laundering, and adapted domestic accounting rules and auditing principles to
international standards.
The authorities released the mission’s concluding statement and have agreed to the publication of the
staff report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background. Fueled by a strong recovery in domestic demand, continued export strength,
and productivity growth, real GDP expanded by an estimated 5¼ percent in 2004, a rate
above trend. However, employment stagnated, and the unemployment rate remained at
17¾ percent—of which two-thirds is long term. Meanwhile, headline inflation remained high
(about 6 percent at end-2004), driven by administered price and indirect tax increases. The
external current account deficit widened from 1 percent of GDP in 2003 to an estimated
3 percent in 2004. This is well within sustainable limits and largely reflected dividend
repatriation. The fiscal deficit is estimated to have expanded to 3.8 percent of GDP.
Outlook. Growth is expected to remain close to 5 percent in 2005–06, slightly above
potential. Although domestic demand remains a key driver of growth in 2005, large
investments in export-producing companies provide good prospects for vigorous balanced
growth. On present trends, staff expects headline inflation to approach 4 percent in 2005, at
the top end of the central bank’s target range (3.5 ±0.5 percent). The current account deficit
should widen temporarily to about 5 percent of GDP in 2005, owing to strong consumption
and investment-related imports. These imports will expand export capacity: accordingly, the
current account deficit is projected to be below 2 percent of GDP in 2007–08.
Policy discussions
Monetary policy: Policies are under pressure from large capital inflows despite strong
appreciation of the koruna and large cuts in interest rates. Staff recommend a tightening of
fiscal policy to contain the risks of overheating, but given the upside risks to inflation and the
strong external competitiveness position, argue for a flexible approach to the exchange rate in
pursuing disinflation.
Fiscal policy: The fiscal stance, which turned expansionary in 2004, is set to remain so in
2005. While accepting that the 2004 stimulus was timely, with the economy growing above
potential in 2005, staff emphasize the desirability of accelerating and deepening fiscal
consolidation, particularly in light of the backloading of fiscal adjustment under the
authorities’ three-year fiscal framework and the upside risks to inflation. The authorities were
confident that strict implementation of their policies would be consistent with their fiscal
targets and macroeconomic objectives.
Structural policies: The authorities instituted a strong set of structural reforms in 2004.
Structural factors still to be addressed include reforming the education system to keep up
with evolving labor market demands, promoting labor mobility, developing infrastructure to
connect the less developed areas to the rest of the country, and reducing the tax burden on
labor.

I. KEY ISSUES
1.
Slovakia’s economic performance is benefiting from good policies. This
performance has been favorable compared to regional standards (text table). Output and
productivity have expanded strongly. Employment has also grown, and unemployment—
though still high—is down from its peak. Although inflation remains high, fiscal and external
deficits have narrowed substantially in recent years. These developments reflect sound
macroeconomic management, large foreign direct investments, and an improved business
climate following important reforms that are supporting convergence to western European
income levels (Box 1 and text chart). At end-2003 Slovakia already complied with two
Maastricht criteria for euro adoption (text chart). Slovakia’s policies are also generally in line
with previous Fund advice, notably on fiscal policy (Box 2).

Box 1. Slovakia’s Reforms
The government that took office in late 2002 has significantly accelerated the
reform process. Building on earlier progress in privatization and financial sector
restructuring,1 the government has implemented an ambitious agenda in its first two
years:
•

Tax reform: from 2004, featuring a single rate of 19 percent for VAT, personal
and corporate income tax. The reform also widened the tax base by eliminating
most exemptions.
• Welfare reform: in 2003, measures to reduce abuse of social benefits; and in
2004, a mixture of benefit cuts and increased linkages to job search efforts, to
improve incentives to work.
• Pension reform: legislation to increase retirement ages (first increases in 2004),
tighten link between future benefits and contributions, and introduce a second
funded pillar from 2005.
• Health reform: co-payments on health services were introduced in 2003; and
parliament recently approved legislation comprehensively restructuring the
health sector.
• Labor market reform: in 2003, an inflexible labor code (introduced under the
previous government) was amended to remove many restrictions on overtime
and work practices.

Major privatizations included the banks, the gas company, and the regional electricity
distribution companies.

Box 2. Policy Implementation and Past IMF Recommendations
Monetary Policy: In 2003, Fund staff advised the NBS to improve communications to
support disinflation efforts. The NBS has improved inflation forecasts, and has recently
announced steps to strengthen guidance on inflation expectations by adopting explicit
inflation targets.
Policy mix and fiscal consolidation: Fund staff advised the authorities in late 2002 to
reorient the policy mix towards tighter fiscal policy and easier monetary policy given
large capital inflows. Recent Article IV consultations also emphasized the need for
fiscal adjustment to increase national savings and reduce external imbalances. The
fiscal deficit has declined since 2002, which has supported successive interest rate cuts
by the NBS, and national savings have increased significantly. While fiscal policy was
expansionary in 2004, the resulting stimulus was in line with the 2004 budget and
partly justifiable by cyclical considerations: domestic demand contracted in 2003 and
the prospects for its recovery, even in early 2004, appeared dim (but turned out better
than expected).
Medium-term fiscal framework: In the 2003 consultation, the Fund supported the
authorities’ intentions of developing a comprehensive medium-term expenditure
framework to help achieve their fiscal objectives. The 2005 budget introduces
multiyear budgeting; Slovakia’s Convergence Programme1 also details medium-term
expenditure policy intentions.
Social spending reform: In 2003, the Fund recommended streamlining health sector
and welfare spending, and encouraged reform of the public pension system—though
recognizing that introducing a mandatory, funded pillar to the pension system could
complicate efforts to meet the Maastricht deficit criterion. The government has
implemented reforms in each of these areas (Box 1).
Labor and product market reforms: Past Fund advice welcomed the restructuring
and privatization of the main banks and utilities, but stressed the need to raise
productivity and growth prospects by removing remaining labor market rigidities and
improve the business environment. Box 1 notes the labor market reforms implemented.

2.
Slovakia’s economic performance has strengthened further since the 2003
Article IV consultation. Growth has been strong despite cyclical weakness in Europe and
increasing oil prices, and core inflation and the external current account deficit have been
contained (Figures 1 and 2). Economic activity, which was entirely export-driven in 2003,
broadened to the domestic sector in 2004, supported by a modestly expansionary fiscal policy
(Tables 1–3). Interest rates were reduced in steps throughout the year by a cumulative
200 basis points, initially to encourage domestic demand but more recently in response to
strong appreciation pressures. Yet, as shown by the monetary conditions index in the
monetary policy section below, monetary conditions still tightened somewhat, as the koruna
appreciated by over 6 percent against the euro in 2004. Despite the strong economic
performance, employment gains have been uneven across sectors and small overall, leaving
unemployment high.
3.
Looking ahead, Slovakia confronts the challenges of meeting the Maastricht
criteria on inflation and the fiscal deficit, while maintaining high growth and increasing
employment. The inflation rate, though falling, is well above the euro-area average and
bringing it down to the Maastricht level will require further effort, especially in light of
continued rapid wage growth. The fiscal deficit remains substantial and consolidation will
become more difficult, given the costs of some reforms, the election cycle, and EU
expenditure commitments. Further, income convergence to western European levels calls for
maintaining the course of structural reforms.
4.

The discussions thus focused on three policy issues:

•

First, dealing with the tensions between disinflation and containing real
appreciation. The authorities target inflation at 3.5 percent in 2005, but there may be
upside risks. Given these risks, the role of exchange rate flexibility in achieving
inflation objectives was explored.

•

Second, ensuring an appropriate speed and path of fiscal adjustment. The fiscal
deficit should decline, both for medium-term considerations and to support monetary
policy in bringing down inflation. In particular, the current three-year budget may
need to be more ambitious about the 2007 target (3 percent of GDP), which would
call for sequencing adjustment in a way that eliminates the current back-loading and
strengthening the expenditure framework to enhance fiscal policy credibility.

•

Third, reducing unemployment and sustaining growth. Ensuring strong job
creation and noninflationary growth calls for maintaining structural reform
momentum.

II. THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Recent Developments and Outlook
5.
After slowing slightly in 2003, the economy grew robustly in 2004 (Tables 1–2).
Real GDP expanded by an estimated 5¼ percent, a rate above trend. The upswing reflected a
strong domestic demand recovery as well as continued export strength, and was supported by
stimulative fiscal policy, strong household credit growth, and record high nonprivatization
FDI. The external current account deficit widened to an estimated 3 percent of GDP,
compared with 1 percent of GDP in 2003 (Table 4), with the widening largely reflecting
dividend repatriation. Nevertheless, the deficit remained well within sustainable bounds;
indeed, export volumes grew by 13 percent as Slovakia continued to gain market share in
Europe and competitiveness remained strong (see Figure 2). With growth largely driven by
productivity gains, employment stagnated, and the unemployment rate therefore remained at
17¾ percent.1
6.
Growth is projected to remain close to 5 percent in 2005. Both authorities and
staff agreed that strong growth should continue, with demand shifting from external to
domestic sources. In this regard, investment in new plant and equipment is projected to
remain the main driver, with consumption—supported by real wage growth—continuing to
grow strongly (text chart and Figure 3).

Based on the internationally comparable Labor Force Survey data. By contrast, the
unemployment rate based on registered unemployment declined by 2½ percentage points in
2004, to 13 percent. These measures diverge because of conceptual and sampling differences.

-9-

7.
The strength of the economy has prompted an acceleration in wage growth and
questions about the degree of slack. The NBS estimated an output gap of 1½ percent below
potential in 2004, against the staff’s ½ percent—which was closer to the Ministry of
Finance’s estimate (Box 3). Although unemployment remains high, as much as two-thirds of
it is long term. Private sector representatives noted evidence of specific skill shortages in
some regions, and increased supply of these skills would require a pickup in earnings,
implying slower disinflation. The NBS did not envisage the output gap closing over the
projection period, and believed that on the whole, the pool of unemployed is sufficient to
sustain expected growth without significant wage and inflation pressures.
8.
The external current account deficit is expected to increase, but to remain
sustainable. The authorities expected the external current account deficit to widen to about
5 percent of GDP in 2005, owing to strong consumption and investment imports—associated
particularly with the construction of Peugeot and Kia car production plants. This widening
would be temporary, as the rapid increase in investment imports would support an expansion
in export capacity, thereby raising exports and driving the current account deficit below
2 percent of GDP in 2007–08. Moreover, throughout the projection period, the deficit would
stay within sustainability boundaries—estimated by staff at 6 percent of GDP. Nonetheless,
the authorities were concerned about adverse shocks, as the deficit is projected to come close
to sustainable limits in 2005. While staff broadly concurred with the baseline projections, it
saw the risks as less skewed than the authorities and more room to maneuver if risks
materialize. Slovakia’s economy is becoming more flexible, and thus more resilient to
shocks. Even if the current account deficit exceeds somewhat projected levels in 2005–06,
Slovakia would have no problems financing it. Under the baseline projection, the deficit is
already almost fully covered by FDI, and additional financing, if needed, would be readily
available.
9.
The near-term growth outlook is subject to balanced risks. On the upside, a
faster-than-anticipated increase in export capacity would raise export-led growth. Domestic
demand could also be higher, if the cumulative interest rate cuts over the past 15 months
stimulate demand more than projected. Downside risks are primarily external, including from
a slower-than-expected recovery in EU demand or sustained high oil prices.
10.
There was broad agreement that
medium-term growth prospects remain
favorable, based on continued productivity
gains. Slovakia’s recent strong economic growth
has reflected productivity growth following large
capital accumulation during 2001–02. Large
investments—particularly in the car industry—
have introduced advanced technologies that have
greatly increased productivity. Expected

Box 3. Slovakia’s Output Gap
The output gap is measured as the difference between actual and potential output in percent of
potential output, with a negative number indicating a level of output below potential. Estimating
the output gap therefore requires an estimate of potential output, an unobserved variable.
The NBS measures Slovakia’s potential output from a multivariate Kalman filtering model with
unobserved components that jointly estimates potential output, and equilibrium interest and
exchange rates. This approach combines statistical filtering techniques with macromodeling. An
adjustment is made to potential output to reflect (i) a permanent shock in 2003 from Volkswagen’s
new production line of Touareg vehicles and (ii) a temporary shock in 2004Q1 from the leap year
effect—the latter estimated at 1 percent year-on-year in the first quarter. Based on this
methodology, the NBS finds a negative output gap of 1.5 percent in 2004.1
The Ministry of Finance estimates potential output using a production function where inputs are
the existing capital stock and potential labor. Employment time series data were filtered using the
Hodrick-Prescott filter to derive an estimate for potential labor, while capital stock estimates were
obtained from National Accounts data. Assuming a labor-elasticity of output of 47 percent, the
results point to a negative output gap of 0.1 percent in 2004.
Like the Ministry of Finance, staff estimates potential output using a production function
approach2, but with somewhat different estimates of potential labor, capital stock and laborelasticity of output. Therefore, staff finds that the output gap in 2004 is a negative 0.6 percent of
potential output.

domestic and foreign investment should result in further capital deepening and in
technological enhancements that sustain total factor productivity growth (text table).
Assuming TFP growth of about 3½ percent in the medium term—a rate similar to that
observed in the past four years—Slovakia should be able to grow at around 4½ percent.
11.
In a context of strong growth potential, risks associated with public and external
debt accumulation are contained (Tables 7 and 8). External debt is projected to decline
from 45 percent of GDP in 2004 to 28½ percent of GDP in 2009, mainly reflecting strong
non-debt creating inflows in 2005–06 and a decline in the current account deficit in 2007–09.
Various stress tests—assuming higher external interest rates, lower GDP growth, or xchangerate depreciation—indicate that Slovakia's external debt dynamics remain manageable, with
the debt level generally remaining below 60 percent of GDP under most adverse scenarios.
Also, Slovakia's public debt is projected to decline to about 42 percent of GDP by 2009,
thereby remaining sustainable in the medium term. Under various adverse scenarios—such as
slippages in fiscal adjustment, or adverse growth or interest rate developments—public debt
could rise by up to 14 percentage points of GDP but would remain below the Maastricht limit
of 60 percent of GDP.
B. Monetary Policy
12.
The NBS cut interest rates and intervened substantially in the foreign exchange
market in 2004 (text chart). The NBS reduced its main policy rate by a cumulative 200 basis
points in the year through September (the month prior to the Article IV mission), initially in
response to weak domestic demand, and later to contain the sharp rise in short-term capital
inflows. The NBS also conducted extensive foreign exchange market interventions, enlarging
its balance sheet and increasing the extent of its sterilization operations. By end-September,
the NBS’s sterilization position amounted to twice the monetary base and was costing about
1 percent of GDP annually. The exchange rate moved in a narrow range in the twelve months
through September, as the koruna appreciated by about 3 percent against the euro.

Several factors suggest that
inflation risks are skewed to the
upside: (i) nominal wage growth
was rapid in 2004 (text chart) and
threatens to remain high in 2005,
given backward-looking wagesetting behavior. Indeed, the
correlation between lagged inflation
and wages is 85 percent for the
period 2002–04 (text chart), and this
number is robust to shortening the
series by up to six months; (ii) low
food-price inflation might not
persist in 2005, because it partly
reflected a very good harvest that
may not be repeated; (iii) the output
gap is closing rapidly owing to
rising domestic demand (see Box 3),
supported by previous interest rate
cuts; and (iv) given the declining
economic slack, there could be
substantial second-round effects
from increases in oil and

Inflation is expected to fall
in 2005. The 12-month core
inflation2 rate reached 1½ percent at
end-2004, down from 2¾ percent at
end-2003, largely reflecting falling
food prices (Figure 1). Headline
inflation remained high (about
6 percent at end-2004, against
9⅓ percent at end-2003), driven by
administered price and indirect tax
increases, but should fall in 2005 as
these one-off effects wane (text
chart). The NBS targets 3.5 percent
for headline inflation with a
± 0.5 percent range at end-2005.

administered prices,3 particularly if wage setting remains backward looking. Staff thus
expected that, on present trends, headline inflation would approach 4 percent in 2005, the top
end of the NBS-targeted range, leaving no room for the materialization of upside risks (text
chart).
15.
The NBS viewed its inflation target as attainable, and was more concerned about
the negative effects of exchange rate appreciation on the competitiveness of traditional
manufacturing sectors. In this view, (i) the observed wage increases in 2004 were
temporary, as they partly reflected delayed bonuses from 2003 to take advantage of the
reduced income tax rate; and wage growth should remain moderate in 2005; (ii) food prices
should also remain subdued given trends in world commodity prices and barring unforeseen
adverse weather conditions in Slovakia; (iii) slack in the economy is substantial, with
unemployment high; and (iv) given this slack, second-round inflationary effects should
remain limited. Therefore, the NBS felt confident about its inflation target of 3.5 percent, and
saw only minor risks of inflation reaching the upper bound of the range. It was, however,
concerned about the pace of nominal appreciation against the euro, which was not
commensurate with the improvement in economic fundamentals and therefore risked
undermining the competitiveness of those manufacturing sectors where productivity growth
is lagging—mostly local small- and medium-sized enterprises. It believed that a policy of
slowing down nominal appreciation would mitigate these effects, and act as an insurance
against adverse external current account shocks.
16.
While understanding these concerns, staff felt that the upside risk on inflation
argued for a more flexible approach to the exchange rate in pursuing disinflation and
for an enhanced communications policy to guide inflation expectations. Productivity
growth in Slovakia is expected to continue to exceed productivity growth in the euro area
(Box 4), making room for real appreciation in the medium term.4 While too rapid
appreciation could be harmful to competitiveness, gradual real appreciation could also
encourage enterprise restructuring needed in some sectors, such as light manufacturing. Staff
therefore recommended to maintain a flexible approach to the management of the exchange
rate, underscoring that intervention beyond smoothing could entrench inflationary
expectations and be costly for the NBS. Exchange rate flexibility would also promote prudent
risk management by market participants, thereby increasing Slovakia’s resilience to volatile
capital flows, and limit opportunities for one-way bets at the expense of the NBS. Market
participants indicated that, at times, it had been difficult to decipher monetary policy

Box 4. Competitiveness
Slovak wages remain competitive. Compared with wages in other EU accession countries, Slovak wages
are still relatively low, even when adjusting for labor productivity. Wage growth has been broadly in line
with productivity growth, and unit labor costs even declined somewhat recently.

More broadly, other competitiveness indicators are also favorable. ULC-based and PPI-based real
exchange rate measures have generally appreciated in line with productivity, and relative prices are still low
given Slovakia’s income level. While CPI-based real appreciation has accelerated recently, this has been
largely due to sizeable administered price adjustments, bringing these prices into line with costs. Going
forward, the influence of administered price adjustments on the CPI-based real exchange rate will gradually
disappear. In any event, as Slovak productivity continues to grow faster than euro-area productivity (see
productivity differential in chart), further real appreciation is natural and need not reduce competitiveness.

intentions because it was unclear if the NBS wanted to achieve certain inflation objectives or
manage the exchange rate within a certain path. A suitable communications strategy should
send coherent signals to the market, and thus reduce the costs of disinflation by guiding
public inflation expectations.
17.
Given the inflation outlook and already low real interest rates, staff
recommended that the authorities refrain from further reducing official interest rates
to stem appreciation, while also emphasizing the merits of tightening fiscal policy to
contain the risks of overheating. If capital inflows remained strong and threatened
competitiveness, monetary policy could not continue carrying all the burden of maintaining
macroeconomic stability. Under this scenario, a tighter fiscal policy would have an important
role to play (see below).
18.
The authorities reduced interest rates again in November to ward off excessive
appreciation, but monetary conditions still tightened (text chart). In the face of renewed
rapid koruna appreciation against the euro, the NBS cut interest rates by another 50 basis
points in late November, bringing the main policy rate to 4 percent. The koruna, nevertheless,
continued to appreciate against the euro, in part reflecting the announcement of significant
new FDI projects, Slovakia’s sovereign debt rating upgrade by Standard and Poor’s in midDecember, and increased inflows to the region as a whole. The authorities allowed the
koruna to appreciate thereafter—thus tightening monetary conditions—intervening only
sporadically in December in the face of persistent upward pressure in the foreign exchange
market.

19.
In a shift from past policy, the NBS announced in December explicit inflation
targets for 2005–08, stating that the primary focus of monetary policy will be inflation,
with exchange rate developments assessed depending on their inflationary impact. This
contrasts with the previous practice of publishing inflation forecasts, which were not strictly
“targets” and were often revised midyear depending on economic developments. The

- 16 -

announcement was widely welcomed, including by staff, as a signal of more transparency in
monetary policy-making. The new monetary policy framework—announced as part of the
monetary program for 2005–08—adopted end-year inflation targets of 3 to 4 percent in 2005,
and ambitious targets of below 2.5 percent in 2006 and below 2 percent thereafter.
C. Fiscal Policy
20.
The fiscal stance turned
expansionary in 2004 (Table 3 and
text table). The fiscal deficit widened
to an estimated 3.8 percent of GDP
from 3.4 percent of GDP in 2003. This
reflected a reduction in revenues of
over 1 percentage point of GDP, owing
to the tax reform and lower social
contributions (Box 5), offset by lower
spending on wages, benefits, and
interest. Taking into account net
transfers from the EU—which add to
domestic demand, even if the fiscal
balance is unaffected—the fiscal
impulse was 1 percent of GDP in
2004. This expansion followed a
significant fiscal contraction in 2003.5

balance excluding net transfers from the EU.

21.
Going forward, fiscal consolidation will be constrained by the cost of reforms, as
well as the need to reap the full benefits of EU accession. The authorities estimated that
the launch of a privately funded pension system pillar in January 2005 would cause a general
government revenue loss of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2005, rising to about 1 percent of GDP in
2006 and beyond. These projections are uncertain and hinge on how many people will
choose to join the second pillar.6 The authorities estimated that greater than expected
participation in the second pillar could imply annual transition costs reaching 1¾ percent of
GDP in 2006 and beyond. The recently approved health insurance reforms, while hardening
budget constraints in the health sector, will nevertheless entail higher public spending by
5

The over 2 percent of GDP reduction in the fiscal deficit in 2003 (Table 3) reflected
structural measures—including expenditure reduction in social benefits and health, and
ending the practice of hidden spending by extending new government guarantees on loans
unlikely to be repaid—as well as a fall in the interest bill.
6

Baseline projections assume that about 50 percent of those entitled would shift from the
first to the second pillar; participation in the second pillar is mandatory for new labor market
entrants from January 2005.

- 17 -

Box 5. Effects of Slovakia’s Tax and Welfare Reforms1
Tax revenues have fallen modestly as a share of GDP following the tax reform introduced
in January 2004. With economic growth better than assumed in the budget, tax revenues in
2004 are estimated to have declined by only 0.3 percentage point of GDP from 2003 (Table 3).
However, collections of social contributions have fallen by more than expected following the
reduction in rates, reflecting other factors, including a deterioration in the administration of
collections. On the other hand, the welfare reforms are projected to have generated savings of
around 0.3 percent of GDP in 2004.
The reforms should reduce distortions in the economy and strengthen incentives to work
and invest. The elimination of most exemptions under the new income tax system contributes
to better resource allocation, and makes the system easier to administer—as does the singlerate VAT, which will help address long-standing problems with excessive refunds. The tax
reforms may have limited effects on work incentives—for many taxpayers, the reform reduces
labor taxes only modestly—though the welfare reforms do strengthen work incentives through
both the activation programs and lower marginal effective tax rates on incomes of welfare
recipients. However, taking into account the significant reductions in capital taxes, the tax
burden has shifted from capital to labor, and the still-high tax wedge could continue to dampen
employment demand.
The tax system is less progressive than previously. The single-rate personal income tax
includes large tax-free thresholds, ensuring the tax is progressive rather than proportional.
Household spending data suggest that the single-rate VAT, and the higher excises, appear to
have only limited distributional effects. However, social contributions—which are payable
only up to a ceiling—remain a regressive component in the tax system.
The welfare reform has had different implications for different-size families. Assuming
that parents participate in activation programs, social assistance benefits for smaller families
remain near pre-reform levels. However, for families with four or more children, benefit
reductions are significantly larger.

0.3 percent of GDP from 2005,7 though partly financed through higher contributions. Finally,
although the opportunity to draw on structural funds implies a net flow of resources (after
membership fees) from the EU to Slovakia, spending from the available structural funds
requires Slovak government cofinancing.
22.
The 2005 budget envisages a deficit close to the estimated 2004 outcome, but
implies some further fiscal expansion (text chart). The 3.8 percent of GDP target reflects
the additional costs mentioned

They agreed that taking into
account budgeted net transfers
from the EU (1¼ percent of GDP), and adjusting for pension reform costs, the budget implies
a small positive fiscal impulse, which staff estimates at around ⅓-½ percent of GDP.
23.
With the economy growing at rates above potential and capital inflows expected
to be sustained in the next few years, staff argued for a tighter fiscal policy in 2005. The
2005 budget is part of a three-year framework that envisages a declining fiscal deficit—to
3 percent of GDP in 2007, the Maastricht ceiling—even in the face of the transition costs
from the introduction of the second pillar. Staff argued that an acceleration of fiscal
consolidation in 2005 based on durable spending measures was needed to: (i) enhance the
credibility of the medium-term fiscal framework; (ii) avoid a pro-cyclical fiscal policy; and
(iii) support monetary policy by reducing the risk of overheating. While the authorities
agreed that faster fiscal consolidation would be desirable, they felt that further structural
fiscal measures would be politically difficult to introduce. In addition, they expected that
current policies will achieve the targets under the 2005–07 budget framework helped by the
cyclical upswing, as well as the public sector reform and the delayed effects on expenditures
from ongoing health and welfare reforms. Still, staff argued that a tighter fiscal policy should
remain an essential instrument in the policy mix to contain appreciation pressures.

24.
Views differed on the path of fiscal adjustment over 2006–07. The authorities’
three-year fiscal framework implies that most of the adjustment would take place in 2007
(text chart). Abstracting from pension reform costs would yield a smoother fiscal adjustment
path, although still back-loaded. While consistent with medium-term sustainability (Table 8),
staff regarded this approach as risky given the 2007 test date for euro adoption. Targeting a
test-date deficit with no margin risks missing the Maastricht criterion in case of even
relatively minor shocks. Moreover, this approach leaves no room for implementation
slippages, whether ahead of the 2006 elections or from delays that the next government could
encounter preparing fiscal measures. Indeed, delaying most of the fiscal adjustment to 2007
could compound these risks. Therefore, staff supported a lower deficit target in both 2006
and 2007. While recognizing the desirability of tighter fiscal targets in these years, the
authorities considered that their approach balanced a number of considerations, including the
pace of EU-related spending and political-economy aspects associated with the elections in
2006, and preferred to maintain the current targets. Moreover, they expected that
conservative budgeting, improved fiscal management systems in place (see below), and
cutting waste would provide a margin on expenditures in 2007, thus containing the risk of
slippages.
25.
A stronger fiscal framework would help ensure the needed deficit reduction.
Fiscal policy faces the difficult task of combining additional consolidation with welcome
pension reform and higher spending on EU-financed projects. With recent direct-tax cuts
constraining revenues, this will require a durable reduction in the growth of real primary
spending by the general government from current annual rates of about 6 percent—albeit
reflecting temporarily higher spending growth financed with EU resources—to about
1 percent to meet the recommended target for 2007. Staff encouraged the authorities to find
growth-enhancing expenditure savings in areas unrelated to EU-financed projects. These
could come from the continued restructuring of inefficient sectors, such as the railways, and
from a careful review of spending on subsidies that seem unlikely to enhance potential
economic growth, particularly agricultural subsidies. Staff also argued that, given the tight
expenditure growth required, the medium-term fiscal framework should feature binding
nominal expenditure ceilings to complement the deficit targets. The authorities noted that,
although their framework does not contain formal expenditure ceilings, the budget law for
2005 allows for a nominal expenditure increase of only 1 percent compared to the budget
baseline before resorting to a supplementary budget.
26.
Fiscal management has improved significantly, but challenges remain. The
authorities have already taken strong measures to improve fiscal transparency including
abolishing most extrabudgetary funds at end-2001, and restricting the issue of new
government guarantees from end-2002, and several other steps over the past two years.8 In
this context, staff and the authorities regretted parliament’s decision to re-establish an
extrabudgetary environmental fund, which would reduce oversight over environmental
8

- 20 -

spending, and hoped that the new fund would not set a precedent for further reversals of
transparency. The new Debt and Liquidity Management Agency is already generating
significant savings on government debt, and the recently established State Treasury is also
making an important contribution to fiscal control, notwithstanding some temporary gaps in
state budget expenditure data. Meanwhile, decentralization is still in progress, with new
funding formulas for education spending and revenue-sharing for personal income tax taking
effect from 2005. So far, the ongoing transfer of spending responsibilities from central to
local governments—including some education, healthcare, and transport responsibilities—
has not affected fiscal discipline in most local governments, which operate within a
framework of balanced current budgets. Subnational governments account for 16 percent of
general government expenditures in the 2005 budget.
D. Euro Adoption
27.
The timetable for entering ERM2 and adopting the euro appears appropriate.
The authorities envisage ERM2 entry in 2006 and euro adoption in 2009. The goal of early
euro adoption is ambitious and provides incentives to pursue an appropriate macroeconomic
policy mix and persist with reforms. Staff and the authorities agreed that the preconditions
for successful participation in ERM2 go beyond fiscal and monetary policies. In particular,
the need to boost the economy’s resilience to shocks—especially important after Slovakia
loses the exchange rate instrument—calls for sustained structural measures.
E. Structural Issues
28.
Despite recent reforms, structural factors still hamper labor market flexibility.
The authorities argued that recent reforms to the labor code and the benefits system should
encourage employment by reducing restrictions on part-time employment, easing separation
arrangements, and improving incentives to work. However, they also acknowledged that
reducing unemployment would require policies to address several remaining problems.
•

First, employers reported that tertiary education reform was needed to keep up with
evolving labor market demands and create adequate possibilities for life-long
learning. In this respect, the authorities reported on recent agreements among the
private sector, universities, and the Ministry of Education that should help tailor
graduate training to market needs.

•

Second, a lack of affordable new housing for low- and middle-income households has
discouraged the unemployed from moving between regions to seek jobs. In addition,
the rental market is small and illiquid, and a bias towards tenant rights remains an
impediment to developing affordable rental housing.

- 21 -

•

•

Third, regional mismatches are
high, with economic activities
and FDI concentrated in the
western part of the country,
particularly in the Bratislava
region, where unemployment is
low (text chart). To help reduce
the regional mismatch of jobs
and workers, policies not only
need to ease constraints on
labor mobility, but also support
the provision of basic transport
and business infrastructure to
help attract jobs to high
unemployment regions.

Fourth, nonwage labor costs remain amongst the highest in the region, and the recent
tax reforms have shifted the tax burden from capital toward labor, encouraging
capital-intensive activity rather than job creation.

29.
Recent measures have promoted an efficient and predictable legal environment.
A World Bank study has singled out Slovakia as the world’s top reformer in improving its
investment climate over the past year. In 2004, the amount of time to start a business was cut
in half, time to recover debt fell by three quarters, and a new private credit registry opened.
Although investor representatives expressed some frustration with the excessive discretion of
bankruptcy judges and inefficient legal procedures, they also applauded corrective steps
taken by the authorities. The authorities argued that the draft bankruptcy law should overhaul
current bankruptcy procedures by making them faster, improving creditor rights, and
reducing judges’ discretion, including by randomizing the process of case allocation to
judges. Staff welcomed these initiatives as well as the new commercial registry act, which
has considerably shortened (to two weeks) and simplified registration procedures. According
to the World Bank, Slovakia witnessed a jump of 12 percent in new business registrations
after simplifying entry procedures.
30.
Investment incentives need to be monitored to avoid an inefficient use of public
resources. The government intends to attract new investment, particularly in disadvantaged
areas, through significant fiscal incentives, which are also widely used by other countries in
the region. Staff encouraged the authorities to evaluate projects carefully to ensure that scarce
public resources are not spent on the promotion of investments that would have taken place
anyway.
31.
While the financial system appears sound (Table 5), the ongoing strengthening of
supervisory capacity should improve risk monitoring. Bank profitability is solid, but
lower than in comparable EU member states, and is expected to remain under pressure due to
increased competition following EU entry (text table). Yet, Slovak banks—about 90 percent

of which are foreign-controlled—are amongst the best capitalized in the region,
nonperforming loans are declining and well provisioned, and bank lending is rebounding,
especially to households (Table 6 and text table). The authorities noted that banks’ exposure
to households is low, and that household credit growth is an expected move to equilibrium
from a very low base. Staff agreed, but stressed that this growth exposes the financial sector
to risks that may be underestimated because available statistics do not capture additional
credit granted by nonbank institutions.9 The authorities reported progress in banking
supervision, noting they had completed examinations of all banks over the past two years.
They also planned to improve the supervision of financial conglomerates and cross-border
transactions, by integrating the Financial Markets Authority into the NBS in 2006.
32.
Plans to finalize privatization and speed up product market reform are on track.
The envisaged sale in 2005 of Slovenske Elektrarne—the electricity generation company—
would successfully conclude major privatizations. The authorities reported that the electricity
and gas markets will be liberalized for all commercial consumers from 2005. Staff, for its
part, noted that high access fees for imported energy could still discourage the entry of
foreign energy suppliers, which is necessary to increase competition.

33.
Following EU accession, Slovakia adopted the EU's Common Commercial
Policy. Tariffs and preferential trade agreements were modified to ensure EU-conformity.
Minor effects are expected from this process as Slovakia's tariff system was not significantly
different from that of the EU, and its trade with third countries affected by the changes in the
preferential agreements is small.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL

34.
Slovakia’s accession to the European Union took place amidst promising nearterm prospects and a favorable medium-term outlook. Despite a difficult external
environment, growth has been resilient and core inflation has declined. Reforms to labor,
product, and financial markets have increased the flexibility of the Slovak economy. With
domestic demand recently gaining momentum and investors’ continued interest in Slovakia,
the prospects for strong balanced growth in the medium term remain favorable, provided
pending reforms are completed and macroeconomic policies managed deftly.
35.
Given upside inflation risks and the need to progress in meeting the Maastricht
criteria at a time when the output gap is closing, monetary conditions need to tighten.
The recent koruna appreciation is already contributing to tighter monetary conditions. Since
inflation is likely to remain close to the upper end of the targeted range in 2005, with
significant upside risks, interest rates should not be lowered. As now intended by the NBS,
they should be guided in the future by the need to achieve inflation targets. On the exchange
rate, although the NBS has a role to play in smoothing excessive exchange rate volatility, it
should avoid fine-tuning, and have a flexible approach to the exchange rate in pursuing
disinflation. In a context of strong competitiveness, as reflected in the dynamism of exports
and growth, intervention beyond smoothing could be counterproductive and entrench
inflationary expectations. Moreover, sustained interventions also enlarge the NBS balance
sheet and increase its losses.
36.
Against this background, the new NBS monetary framework appears to
appropriately place a clear emphasis on inflation targets. This should contribute to
anchoring inflation expectations, supported by a suitable NBS communications strategy, and
also help generate more forward-looking wage-setting behavior, which, in turn, should help
disinflation. In addition, the new framework is expected to provide a transparent foundation
for monetary policy by relying primarily on the interest rate instrument, rather than foreign
exchange intervention. In all, it should enhance the credibility of NBS policy making.
37.
A stronger fiscal stance than envisaged by the authorities would have clear
benefits, and the authorities should therefore take any available opportunity to achieve
this. The deficit target for 2005 is reachable, provided the authorities take measures to ensure
that the collections of social security contributions recover as the budget envisages. But
additional adjustment would be desirable given projected above-trend growth, and to mitigate
the risks arising from the back-loading of the adjustment in the three-year budget framework.
The authorities, at a minimum, should therefore reduce the planned deficit if growth turns out
to be higher than projected in the budget (4.5 percent), or if collections of some taxes, such as

- 24 -

the VAT, improve, as seems likely. Such a tightening, in a context where substantial capital
inflows could continue, would help to reduce appreciation pressures while still supporting
monetary policy in reducing inflation.
38.
More ambitious medium-term fiscal targets, and a strengthening of the fiscal
framework, would reduce the risk of missing the Maastricht deficit criterion in 2007.
The European Commission recently concluded that Slovakia is on track to bring down the
fiscal deficit to the Maastricht level of 3 percent of GDP by 2007. However, the current fiscal
deficit target of 3 percent of GDP leaves no margin to deal with negative shocks. A more
ambitious target, say 2½ percent of GDP, would enhance the credibility of the fiscal strategy,
and minimize the possibility of a longer, and perhaps more difficult, stay in ERM2 if the
3 percent of GDP ceiling were breached. Additional measures to reach this objective should
focus on eliminating subsidies that do not enhance potential economic growth. While the
2007 budget will be the responsibility of the next government, the current administration
could help achieve Slovakia’s medium-term objectives by strengthening the fiscal framework
through the introduction of binding expenditure ceilings, to complement the nominal deficit
targets. Establishing primary expenditure ceilings would clarify the basis for durable fiscal
deficit reducing measures, and the need to elaborate the appropriate underlying policies. In
this context, to smoothen the fiscal adjustment, it would be desirable to bring forward to
2006 some of the expenditure savings planned in 2007.
39.
Achieving fiscal objectives requires the participation of all levels of government,
and the continued transparent implementation of fiscal policy. More decentralization will
bring the provision of services closer to those receiving them, but requires good fiscal
management locally. The government also needs to ensure close cooperation between the
central and local governments to ensure expenditure control at the general government level.
The authorities have significantly improved fiscal transparency, essential for proper oversight
over fiscal activities, though the recently established environmental fund represents a
setback. It should remain an exception and its activities should be folded back into the state
budget as early as possible.
40.
Slovakia should continue to implement its successful structural reform program.
Privatization and restructuring have attracted needed investment in infrastructure, unleashed
private sector initiative, strengthened the financial sector, and accelerated growth. While the
imminent completion of the government’s privatization program is welcome, the authorities
should ensure that the relationship among the current buyers, providers, and alternative
suppliers of energy will indeed encourage competition. The institutional labor market
framework has become more flexible, and a key task ahead is to ensure that policies in other
areas—such as the education system and public infrastructure—also support an environment
that helps reduce high unemployment. It is essential to prepare projects that make full use of
EU structural funds available for this purpose. High wage taxes from social contributions
remain an impediment to employment, and any further tax reform should give priority to
reducing labor taxation. The legal framework has improved significantly but
implementation challenges remain, including improving the functioning of the courts.

41.
The NBS should strengthen the financial system by building supervisory
capacity to monitor risks. While the NBS has improved institutional supervisory capacity,
greater risks arise from rapid credit growth to households, the operations of financial
conglomerates, and cross-border transactions. More vigilance is needed on all these fronts,
including by improving consolidated supervision, broadening the data coverage of household
assets and liabilities, and reacting appropriately and promptly to examination findings. The
plan to establish a single financial sector supervisor should be implemented with care not to
distract from effective oversight of the financial sector.
42.
The next Article IV consultation with the Slovak Republic is expected to be
conducted under the standard 12-month cycle.

Projection

Sources: Data provided by the Slovak authorities; and IMF staff estimates.
1/ The composition of the external debt is expected to change in the medium term with medium- and long-term (MLT) debt declining as privatization receipts
are used to retire public debt, and private short-term debt increasing to finance the trade balance deficit.
2/ Excludes the effects of so-called "window dressing" operations, whereby commercial banks increased both short-term external assets and liabilities.
These operations account for gross debt of some US$2 billion at end-1997 and end-1998.
3/ Short-term external debt is defined so as to include MLT repayments due the next year.

1/ In January 2001, privatization bonds equivalent to Sk 83.7 billion were issued, to repay Sk 72.3 billion bank credit to the Slovak Consolidation Agency
(SKA, an enterprise) and Sk 11.4 billion bank credit to the Consolidation Bank. In March, a similar transaction took place, which decreased credit to enterprises by
Sk 21.3 billion, and increased credit to the government by a similar amount. The December 2000 data are presented including the impact of these transactions.
2/ Includes accumulated interest payments on restructuring bonds.
3/ Includes increase of Sk 11.5 billion in February due to the merger of the Consolidation Bank into the SKA (related to an NBS credit to the SKB).
4/ Includes deposits of privatization receipts at the pension fund account at the NBS.
5/ Adjusted for the removal of credits from SKA (Sk 31.5 billion) and Devin Bank (Sk 4 billion) from the statistics in February 2002.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ Real GDP growth drops to 4 percent throughout 2005-09.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and both non-interest current account and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP) remain

B1. Nominal interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
B2. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
B3. Change in U.S. dollar GDP deflator is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
B4. Non-interest current account is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
B5. Combination of B1-B4 using one standard deviation shocks
B6. One time 30 percent nominal depreciation in 2005

B. Bound tests

A1. Key variables are at their historical averages in 2005-09 4/
A2. Country-specific shock in 2005, with reduction in GDP growth (relative to baseline) 5/

A. Alternative scenarios

1/ Gross debt. Public sector refers to general government. Assumes the authorities’ 2005 budget projections for (nominal) fiscal deficit and debt for 2005-07.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium- and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance) remain at the level in percent of GDP/growth rate of the last projection year.

The currency of the Slovak Republic is the Slovak koruna, created on February 8, 1993 upon
the dissolution of the currency union with the Czech Republic. A single exchange rate applies
to all transactions within the convertible currency area. The currency was floated on
October 1, 1998. The exchange rate is set in the foreign exchange market and stood at
Sk 28.496 per U.S. dollar and Sk 38.796 per euro on December 31, 2004. The National Bank
of Slovakia (NBS) does not support the koruna’s exchange rate, but intervenes primarily to
smooth large fluctuations in the exchange rate and when the exchange rate moves to an
unacceptable level. The exchange rate regime is currently classified as a managed float with
no preannounced path for the exchange rate.
The Slovak Republic continues to maintain an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions consistent with its Article VIII
obligations.

APPENDIX II

Slovak Republic: Statistical Issues

From the point of view of macroeconomic analysis and policy making, the quality of
1.
the data, in particular of the national accounts, has improved in recent years. A Data ROSC
mission to Bratislava during February–March 2004 found that the quality, integrity,
soundness and reliability of the data were overall satisfactory, despite some shortcomings in
the data revision policy. The main issues remaining are: (i) weaknesses in the data on prices
and volumes of imports and exports; (ii) a lack of timely data on the overall general
government operations; and (iii) slow compilation cycle of the annual national accounts and
lack of proper benchmarking of quarterly data. Slovakia subscribes to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since 1996 and observes or exceeds all related standards.
Finalization of the Data ROSC report is pending the authorities’ response to the draft.
2.
With regard to timeliness and public access, the authorities in general follow a free
and open data publication policy. Data are promptly released to news services, and are also
published regularly in various monthly and quarterly statistical publications, and on the
Internet11 according to a pre-announced schedule. Changes in definitions and coverage,
however, often diminish the usefulness of published data. Data on core surveillance variables
are provided regularly to the Fund, and with minimal lags: a week or less for foreign
exchange reserves; a month or less for general government financing and detailed state
budget implementation data; 10 days to a month for consumer prices, reserve money, broad
money, and interest rates; two months for foreign trade data; and about three months for
other fiscal, balance of payments, and national accounts data. However, the 2004 Data ROSC
mission reported difficulties in reconciling balance of payments statistics with national
accounts, monetary, or government finance statistics.
Real sector and prices

3.
Significant progress has been made in the elaboration of the Slovak national accounts
statistics. However, output estimates for the last few years may yet have to be revised in the
future. The quarterly national accounts data on expenditures exhibit weaknesses and there is
a significant statistical discrepancy between the supply side and the demand side
(representing more than 1 percent of GDP in 2003Q2 and 2003Q4).12 An important
outstanding issue is the compilation of reliable price deflators for imports and exports that
would enable better decomposition into volume and price changes. The unit value trade price
11

Data are available on the website of the Slovak Statistics Office (www.statistics.sk), the
National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) (www.nbs.sk), and the ministry of finance (MoF)
(www.finance.gov.sk).

12

In line with staff recommendation the Slovak Statistics Office has started to publish data
for this discrepancy, which is no longer included in inventories.

- 43 -

APPENDIX II

indices—on which the national accounts trade price deflators are based—are published with
long delays and are currently not appropriately adjusted for quality changes. The problem is
recognized by the statistical authorities; however, improvement is still pending.
4.
In the area of consumer price indices, it is important that historical data are produced
on the basis of the new basket for core inflation and total CPI.
5.
Following the fast development of chain stores, which are not fully captured in
surveys, the authorities consider that retail sales and the level of consumption might be
underestimated (especially if compared to VAT receipts), and wages statistics might be
biased.
6.
In the enterprise sector, it would be very useful if the line ministries produced
systematic accounts of the financial positions of the public enterprises under their purview.
Fiscal sector

7.
General government statistics are compiled annually in accordance with the
methodology of the 1986 Manual on Government Finance Statistics (GFSM 1986) for
internal use, publication in the GFS Yearbook, and dissemination on the Ministry of Finance
(MoF) website in compliance with the SDDS. In accordance with the EU acquis
communautaire, the authorities report semi-annually on general government net
lending/borrowing. Monthly reconciliation of government operations above and below the
line is restricted to budget transactions. A modern treasury system began operating in January
2004. The new system will improve fiscal control by providing a means of recording
expenditures at the planning and commitment stages. However, from mid-2004, monthly
state budget data have not included breakdowns of revenues or expenditures. It is not yet
clear whether these new data gaps reflect teething problems with the treasury system, or
other factors related to EU accession.
8.
The MoF is converting its fiscal accounts to ESA 95 standards. The MoF has also
begun compiling statistics in accordance with the methodology of the Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001); data are available on a cash basis for 2000–02, and on
an accrual basis for 2003.
External sector

9.
The Slovak Republic provides balance of payments statistics in a timely manner. The
balance of payment statements are presented in two formats, an analytical presentation and
the standard presentation, and are reported on a monthly basis. Banks are now reporting their
arbitrage transactions accurately. Improvements have also been made in reporting
nonresidents’ claims and liabilities in domestic currency. Balance of payments statistics are
compiled and disseminated monthly on a cumulative basis during the year; however,
dissemination on a cumulative basis does not follow best practices. Weekly information on
Gross International Reserves is reported timely via the reserves template. Moreover, the

- 44 -

APPENDIX II

NBS has revised with effect from January 1, 2002 its methodology of reporting foreign
exchange reserves. These changes are in line with IMF guidelines and STA technical
recommendations and include the valuation of gold at market price and a change in the
reporting of repo operations and gold swaps. Also, the reporting of foreign exchange reserves
by commercial banks has been revised to include selected long-term assets in the item
“foreign exchange reserves.” Some problem areas remain, including: (i) the recording of
most interest payments on a cash basis; and (ii) the need to disseminate discrete balance of
payments statistics as required by the SDDS.
Monetary sector

10.
Monetary statistics are of good quality, and are reported on a timely basis to the Fund.
The 2004 Data ROSC mission found that the two sets of monetary data compiled by the
National Bank of Slovakia (NBS)—the national monetary statistics (NMS), for internal use,
and the harmonized monetary statistics (HMS), submitted to international organizations—are
broadly in line with the IMF Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. One exception was
the treatment, in the NMS, of government’s foreign liabilities as part of the NBS foreign
liabilities, with a counterpart adjustment in NBS claims on the government. In response to
the mission’s comments, the authorities changed this treatment to exclude government
foreign liabilities from NBS foreign liabilities. Another exception was the exclusion of
money market funds from the NMS, but the authorities recently started including these funds
as a memo item in the NMS. A third exception is that market valuation is not applied to
certain financial instruments under both the NMS and HMS.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the
Slovak Republic
On February, 11, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Slovak Republic.1
Background
Slovakia’s economic performance has improved since the 2003 Article IV consultation.
Output has expanded strongly and fiscal and external balances have narrowed substantially in
recent years. These developments were assisted by large foreign direct investments and an
improved business climate following important reforms—including to taxation, welfare,
pensions, healthcare, and the labor market—that are supporting convergence to western
European income levels.
Economic activity was entirely export-driven in 2003; real GDP increased by 4.5 percent
despite a contraction in domestic demand. But activity broadened to the domestic sector in
2004, supported by accommodating macroeconomic policies, and real GDP grew by an
estimated 5.25 percent. The external current account deficit widened in 2004 to an estimated
3 percent of GDP, still well within sustainable bounds. Despite the strong economic

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2performance, however, employment gains have been uneven across sectors, and
unemployment remains high at 17.75 percent.
Headline inflation remained high (5.9 percent at end-2004, against 9.3 percent at end-2003),
driven by administered price and indirect tax increases, but should fall in 2005 as these one-off
effects wane. Core inflation was low, at 1.5 percent at end-2004, below the end-2003 outcome
of 2.7 percent owing largely to falling food prices. For end-2005, the National Bank of
Slovakia’s (NBS) target range for headline inflation is 3.5 plus/minus 0.5 percent, and core
inflation is expected to fall within the range 1.1 to 3.4 percent.
The NBS reduced its main policy rate by a cumulative 250 basis points between September
2003 and end-2004, initially in response to weak domestic demand, and later to counter the
appreciation pressures arising from significant short-term capital inflows. The NBS also
conducted extensive foreign exchange market interventions, enlarging its balance sheet and
increasing its sterilization position. Nevertheless, the Slovak koruna appreciated by about
6 percent against the euro during 2004.
Following a sharp contraction in 2003, the fiscal deficit widened slightly in 2004 to an
estimated 3.8 percent of GDP (European System of Accounts 1995 basis). This reflected a
small reduction in revenues as a share of GDP following the 2004 tax reform, only partly offset
by lower spending on wages, benefits and interest. Taking into account net transfers from the
EU, the fiscal impulse was about 1 percent of GDP in 2004.
The authorities have released a strategy for euro adoption in 2009, based on Exchange Rate
Mechanism 2 (ERM2) entry in 2006, and meeting the Maastricht fiscal deficit and inflation
criteria in 2007.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Slovak authorities’ sound macroeconomic management
and exemplary progress on structural reform over the past few years. This has resulted in an
impressive performance of the Slovak economy, with strong productivity and economic growth
and declining fiscal and external imbalances. Structural reforms have increased the economy’s
flexibility, large foreign investments have expanded production capacity, and investor
confidence is growing as a result of the remarkable improvement of the business climate.
Slovakia’s accession to the EU in May 2004 set the stage for a continued robust economic
performance, supported by an increasing contribution of domestic demand to broad-based
growth over the medium term.
Despite these favorable prospects, Directors noted that challenges remain. The inflation rate,
though falling, is still well above the euro-area average, and strong growth poses upside risks
to the central bank’s inflation target for 2005. Further fiscal consolidation to reduce the still
substantial fiscal deficit will require perseverance. Also, the unemployment rate remains high,

-3particularly in eastern regions. More generally, the achievement of income convergence to
western European levels will require maintaining the strong momentum of structural reform.
Directors recognized that the authorities face a challenging monetary policy environment.
They elcomed the National Bank of Slovakia’s adoption of a monetary policy framework that
will give disinflation priority over exchange rate considerations. With the support of an effective
communication strategy, the explicit inflation targets announced for 2005-08 should increase
the transparency of monetary policy, help anchor inflation expectations, and encourage
forward-looking wage-setting behavior. Given the rapid productivity growth and favorable
competitiveness indicators, Directors supported a more flexible approach to the exchange rate
in pursuing disinflation. Directors noted that the upside risks to inflation and record-low interest
rates leave little room, if any, for further interest rate cuts to limit exchange-rate appreciation.
They emphasized that, in a context where substantial capital inflows could continue, a tighter
fiscal policy should remain an essential instrument in the policy mix to reduce inflation.
Accordingly, Directors encouraged the authorities to aim for a tighter fiscal policy than currently
planned for 2005-07, although it was recognized that this will require careful preparation to
preserve public support for the Maastricht convergence process in the upcoming election year.
They considered a more ambitious fiscal consolidation path to be desirable in light of the
projected above-trend output growth and Slovakia’s planned adoption of the euro in 2009.
For this year, Directors encouraged the authorities to reduce the planned deficit if economic
growth and revenues exceed expectations . Looking ahead, they highlighted the risks involved
in back-loading the fiscal adjustment, noting, in particular, that the 2007 deficit target of
3 percent of GDP will leave no margin with respect to the Maastricht criterion to deal with
negative shocks or policy slippages. Directors advised the authorities to strengthen the
medium-term budgetary framework to help ensure that the Maastricht criteria will be met in a
sustainable way.
Directors generally welcomed the comprehensive tax reform introduced in 2004, which should
reduce distortions in the economy and strengthen incentives to work, although some concern
was expressed about the decline in the progressiveness of the tax system. They recognized
that the upfront cost of these and some other structural reforms, and spending on EU-financed
projects, make further fiscal adjustment more difficult. At the same time, they observed that
additional growth-enhancing expenditure savings could come from the continued restructuring
of inefficient sectors and the reduction of remaining subsidies, including agricultural subsidies,
that do not contribute to Slovakia’s growth potential. Directors also emphasized the need for
continued close cooperation at all government levels and the continued transparent
implementation of fiscal policy to support the achievement of fiscal objectives.
Directors welcomed the results of the updated fiscal module of the Report on the Observance
of Standards and Codes, which show that further progress has been made in bringing fiscal
transparency close to international best practice, including through improvements in the
coverage and availability of fiscal information. However, they regretted that the establishment
of the extra-budgetary environmental fund is a slippage in fiscal transparency.

Directors noted that the authorities’ timetable for entering ERM2 and adopting the euro will
require, in addition to sound macroeconomic policies, continued structural reform.
They welcomed recent reforms to the legal framework and improvements to the investment
climate, and looked forward to steps to improve the functioning of the courts. They also asked
that fiscal incentives for regional investment should be applied carefully, and that remaining
privatizations should be undertaken in a way that encourages competition.
Directors also welcomed recent reforms to the labor code and the benefits system that reduce
employment restrictions and improve incentives to work. At the same time, Directors stressed
that further structural measures are needed to deal with the high unemployment.
They highlighted the importance of improving education, upgrading public infrastructure, and
developing the housing market for low- and middle-income households to facilitate labor
mobility and reduce the regional mismatch of jobs and workers. Further efforts will also be
needed to reduce the still-high labor tax wedge.
Directors commended Slovakia’s solid bank soundness indicators and the ongoing
improvements to banking supervision. They encouraged a further strengthening of supervisory
capacity, including through appropriate follow-up on audit findings, and the collection of
comprehensive data on household assets and liabilities to better monitor risks stemming from
rapid household credit growth. Directors welcomed the planned consolidation of financial
sector supervision in the National Bank of Slovakia, while cautioning that organizational
changes should not distract from effective oversight.

Statement by Willy Kiekens, Executive Director for Slovak Republic
and Juraj Sipko, Advisor to Executive Director
February 11, 2005
The Slovak authorities are grateful for the extensive consultations and discussions with the staff
and for the well written and balanced Staff Report and the Selected Issues Papers.
Introduction
The continuation of consistent macroeconomic policies, supported by comprehensive structural
reforms, has borne fruit. The fiscal deficit shrank from 5.7 percent of GDP in 2002 to
3.4 percent in 2003, while the external current account deficit fell from 8.0 percent of GDP to
0.9 percent during the same period.
A broad-based privatization program, a sharp reduction of government expenditure on subsidies
and transfers, radical reforms to the pension and healthcare systems, and the adoption of a single
tax rate for personal and corporate income taxes and VAT, earned Slovakia recognition as the
World Bank's "top reformer of the year" in 2004.
May 1, 2004 was the historic date on which Slovakia and other advanced transition countries
joined the European Union. Accession took place during a period of strong economic growth
largely resulting from prudent macroeconomic stabilization policies and a broad-based
framework aimed at medium-term sustainability.
In December 2004, Standard and Poor's upgraded Slovakia's sovereign rating to A-, with a
positive outlook. In January 2005, Moody’s upgraded Slovakia to A2.
Real Sector Development
Slovakia is one of the fastest growing economies in Central and Eastern Europe. The
higher-than-expected growth of about 5.3 in 2004 was driven by strong domestic demand,
higher wages, a vigorous export performance, and high nonprivatization FDI. The authorities'
medium-term projection for GDP growth is around 5 percent in the period 2005-2007.
Last year, the external current account deficit widened by more than 2 percentage points. This
deterioration was due mainly to strong investment inflows and strong outflows of profits being
repatriated to foreign companies operating in Slovakia. The authorities expect that in 2005,
imports connected with the construction of Peugeot, Kia, Ford, and other greenfield investments
will increase the external current account deficit to 5 percent of GDP, but this will be fully
financed by FDI inflows. For 2006, the authorities project a current account deficit of about
4.5 percent of GDP. In 2007-2008, the current account deficit is expected to be less than
2 percent of GDP.
To make the economy more competitive, the authorities have adopted the Lisbon Strategy and
will implement it through 2010. They are convinced that the only way to guarantee Slovakia's

-2long-term competitiveness is to create the structural conditions essential for developing a
knowledge-based economy. In particular, the authorities intend to concentrate their efforts on
four areas: improving education and human resources, ensuring that Slovak citizens develop
information technology skills, ensuring the development of Slovakia’s scientific potential, and
continuing to develop a business environment that promotes market competition.
Fiscal Policy
With a view to adopting the euro as soon as possible, the authorities succeeded in building
support for their plans to meet the Maastricht criteria. A first step towards that goal was bringing
the ESA-95 (European System of Accounts) general government deficit below 4 percent of
GDP in 2004.
The overall fiscal deficit in 2004 turned out better than budgeted and is estimated at 3.8 percent
of GDP. The authorities agreed with the staff that further consolidation will be needed. But
given the election cycle, it will be difficult to reduce the deficit faster than the authorities already
envisage in their Convergence Programme.
The update of this program covers the period 2004 to 2007 and provides indicative projections
until 2010. The budget plans for 2005 and 2006, as specified in the three-year fiscal policy
framework, are in line with the Convergence Programme. Based on this framework, the
authorities target the general fiscal deficit for 2005 and 2006 to be 3.8 percent and 3.9 percent of
GDP, respectively. The target for 2007 is to reduce the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP
reference value, which the European Council of Ministers supported in their statement of
December 2004.
Monetary Policy
Slovakia's strong competitive position vis-à-vis other EU members, strong capital inflows, and
EU membership have caused the Slovak koruna to strengthen vis-à-vis the euro and the US
dollar. In response, the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) cut interest rates by a cumulative 250
basis points and intervened substantially in the foreign exchange markets in 2004. Nevertheless,
the appreciation in 2004 exceeded 6 percent vis-à-vis the euro, which was much higher than the
NBS's expectation.
In 2004, headline inflation dropped to 5.9 percent and core inflation to 1.5 percent. This was
significantly lower than the inflation in 2003, but still relatively high because of administered
price increases toward cost-recovery levels and indirect taxes.
In December 2004, the National Bank of Slovakia approved the monetary program and the new
monetary policy framework for 2005-2008. Within this framework, monetary policy will focus
primarily on inflation, and the NBS has announced explicit inflation targets for 2005-2008.
This conforms to the authorities' strategy for euro adoption. The inflation targets are 3.5 percent
within a ± 0.5 percent range for 2005, and below 2.5 percent for 2006, and below 2 percent
thereafter.

-3Banking Sector
Slovakia's banking sector has been successfully restructured and brought in line with EU and
Basel requirements. The World Bank has supported an Enterprise and Financial Sector
Adjustment Loan which has supported the re-capitalization and privatization of formerly
state-owned banks, and the overhaul of the legal frameworks for banking, insurance and the
securities market. Slovakia's banking sector is now on a sound footing: it is profitable, the best
capitalized banking sector in the region, and is almost fully owned by foreign partners.
To improve supervision in the financial sector as a whole, the authorities and the NBS have
decided to integrate the Financial Markets Authority into NBS’s Banking Supervision
Department in 2006.
Foreign Direct Investment
Overall, today's stable macroeconomic framework, supported by strong and comprehensive
structural reforms, an improved investment climate, in particular the tax reform, have created an
environment attractive to foreign investors. This environment is now further strengthened by
EU membership, which provides a powerful stimulus for private sector development. New
greenfield investments, particularly in the automotive industry, will make Slovakia the largest
per capita car producer in the world by 2007.
Reform Agenda
The ambitious reform agenda has been almost fully implemented within the first two years of
this government’s term (the next election will take place in September 2006). The only item
still outstanding is the reform of the education system, and the authorities expect that this part of
the agenda will be discussed again in parliament within the next two or three weeks.
Tax Reforms
A comprehensive tax reform was introduced in 2004 to improve incentives for entrepreneurship
and work by making the tax system more transparent and reducing distortions caused by
exemptions and double taxation. The reform is based on a single flat rate of 19 percent for all
personal and corporate incomes taxes and also for VAT. In addition, almost all tax exemptions
have been eliminated, and the estate transfer, gift, and inheritance taxes have been abolished.
Social Protection
The Government has established a modern, cost-effective, and efficient social protection
system. In particular, reforms in 2004 corrected the disincentives to work, while still providing
needed assistance to poorer Slovaks. This includes a multi-pillar pension reform, improvements
in the collection and administration of social contributions, and strengthening the institutional
capacity of the Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs and the Family, and of the Social Insurance
Agency and the National Labor Office.

-4Public Finance
The Public Finance reform has strengthened the institutional capacity for budgetary and
financial management of government operations, and has improved the macro-economic
analysis and forecasting capabilities of the Ministry of Finance. In addition, a Debt
Management Agency and the State Treasury System have been established.
Pension Reform
The pension reform applicable from 2004 has enhanced the public pay-as-you-go (PAYG)
balances by gradually increasing the statutory retirement age from the previous 60 years for men
and 55 years for women to 62 for both genders. A fully-funded second pillar was introduced in
January 2005.
Health Sector
A comprehensive health sector reform was launched to promote the sector's fiscal sustainability
while maintaining the quality of health care and increasing the capacity of the health sector.
Legal and Judicial Systems
All aspects of the legal and judicial systems and institutions have been assessed by the World
Bank, and their strengths and weaknesses identified, and the Ministry of Justice has begun
implementing the World Bank’s recommendations. Despite considerable progress in this area,
weaknesses remain. The authorities are committed to addressing these weaknesses and
strengthening the business, and legal environment.
Unemployment
The authorities agree with the staff that notwithstanding the amendment of the Labor Code
reform in July 2003, unemployment is still a major concern. Unemployment is still relatively
high, even by regional standards, although some improvement is visible.
With a view to reducing unemployment by improving labor mobility, the World Bank approved
a Human Capital Technical Assistance Project for the Slovak Republic on January 25, 2005.
This project will help the government to strengthen its ability to promote employment,
education, and social cohesion by establishing an effective policy infrastructure to implement,
manage, and evaluate reforms in the Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs and Family, and in the
Ministry of Education. The authorities intend to address the issue of skills and regional
mismatches pointed out by staff through improvements in the education system and
infrastructure development that gives priority to the less-developed regions in the country.
Euro Adoption
In anticipation of euro adoption, the authorities approved an updated Convergence Programme
in November 2004. It is expected that Slovakia will join ERM-II during the first half of 2006,

-5and will adopt the euro in 2009. Moreover, the Ministry of Finance envisages having the
general government finances in balance by 2010. The authorities are strongly committed to
fulfilling all Maastricht criteria for euro adoption in a timely manner. This goal is also
supported by the opposition parties.
Conclusion
The generally positive trend of recent economic developments and favorable outcomes of
structural reforms, observed in the Slovak Republic since the last Article IV consultation
(concluded in July 2003), would not have been possible without the broad-based technical
assistance, useful advice, and strong support provided by both the Bretton Woods institutions.
This does not mean that Slovakia considers reforms and adjustments it needs as being already
complete. But the authorities are confident that they can complete the remaining part of their
agenda: Reforming the education system, reducing unemployment, strengthening the judiciary
and law enforcement, and improving the knowledge-based economy. And the main
medium-term challenge for the Slovak Republic is still to fulfill all of the criteria for adoption of
the euro.
