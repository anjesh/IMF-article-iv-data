REPUBLIC OF LATVIA
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the
2005 Consultation with the Republic of Latvia
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Carlos Muñiz
July 14, 2005
The 2005 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Riga during April 13–26,
2005. The team comprised Ms. van Elkan (head), and Messrs. Luna and Stavrev (all
EUR). Ms. Zubkova (Advisor, OED) and Mr. Rosenberg (Regional Representative)
attended several meetings. The mission met with Bank of Latvia (BoL) Governor
Rimšēvičs, Finance Minister Spurdziņš, and senior officials, academics, and
representatives of financial institutions, foreign investors, and NGOs.
Latvia acceded to the European Union (EU) on May 1, 2004 and entered ERM2 on
April 29, 2005. A four-party center-right coalition government took office in December
2004. Notwithstanding the short tenure of governments, macroeconomic policy has
been anchored to meet the preconditions for EU accession and euro adoption. The next
general election is due in 2006. The authorities are aiming to adopt the euro at the
beginning of 2008.
Latvia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, section 2, 3, and 4, and maintains
no restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions, except for those imposed in compliance with applicable UN Security
Council resolutions. All such restrictions have been notified to the Fund pursuant to
Decision No. 144 (52/51).
Latvia has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard. Coverage,
periodicity, and timeliness of the data are adequate for surveillance.
The authorities released the mission’s concluding statement
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2005/042505.htm) and have expressed their
intention to publish the staff report.

-3Executive Summary
Background: Growth increased to 8¼ percent in 2004 on very strong consumption and
investment, while inflation and the current account deficit jumped sharply—only partly
related to temporary factors. Booming bank credit added to demand pressures and also
increased macroprudential risks. Gross external debt reached 93 percent of GDP, although
net debt is a more modest 30 percent. Nonresident deposits—an important funding source for
banks—point to growing mismatch risks. Latvia joined ERM2 in April 2005 at the prevailing
parity and plans to adopt the euro in 2008.
Outlook: Booming demand is set to continue, fuelled by ongoing credit expansion, real wage
growth, and sharply higher net EU grants. Average inflation is expected to remain at
6¼ percent—well above the Maastricht limit—while the current account deficit should
narrow on account of larger net EU grants.
Policy issues and discussions
Access to substantial EU funds poses a difficult tradeoff for fiscal policy. With the currency
peg preventing further effective tightening of monetary policy, fiscal policy remains the
primary demand management tool. While EU-financed investment would raise growth
potential over the medium term, it adds to near-term cyclical pressures. With output slightly
above potential, the mission stressed the need for a firmer fiscal stance than planned. This
would also slow external debt accumulation and help prefinance pension reform costs.
Moderating credit growth was viewed as essential to containing inflationary pressures.
While credit growth has been driven by availability of new financial instruments and lower
real interest rates, it continues to contribute to demand pressures. The authorities are
considering taxing multiple mortgage loans to moderate credit growth. Staff called for
eliminating distortions in the tax system that were fuelling the mortgage boom, including
generous treatment of capital gains on real estate.
Maintaining competitiveness in ERM2 will depend on bringing down inflation and
containing wage growth. The mission stressed the importance of demand management for
dampening inflation and labor market flexibility to limit wage growth, although there was
recognition on both sides that sustained productivity gains augured well for the maintenance
of competitiveness going forward.
Vulnerabilities from the credit boom put a premium on strong supervision and prudential
safeguards. Recent improvements in financial sector monitoring are welcome but the
loosening of some prudential regulations may exacerbate risks. The mission highlighted the
need for strengthened supervision of banks with significant nonresident deposits. Recent
amendments to AML laws and the authorities’ request for an AML/CFT ROSC are welcome.
Sustaining vigorous growth remains contingent on expanding and efficiently allocating
capital and employment. Reducing corruption, transparently allocating EU funds for
infrastructure, encouraging greater labor force participation, and better matching skill
acquisition with skills demanded in the labor market will help to avoid bottlenecks to
medium-term growth.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
During much of the past decade,
Latvia’s growth performance has
outstripped other new EU member
countries while broad macroeconomic
stability has been maintained. A sound
policy framework and far-reaching structural
reforms supported this performance,
including a prudent fiscal policy that
underpinned the exchange rate peg, and
fundamental reforms of the business and
wage-setting environments. These efforts
promoted enhancements in factor
productivity and investment—including
substantial FDI—that have expanded
productive capacity and narrowed the per
capita income gap with Western Europe.
However, at 40 percent of the EU-15 average
(PPP basis) in 2004, per capita income still
remains the lowest in the EU.

2.
Rapid economic growth under Latvia’s open trade and capital account regime
contributed to relatively large current account deficits and rising external debt
(Figure 1). Despite strong growth of exports, current account deficits averaged 7¼ percent of
GDP during 1996–2003, consistent with Latvia’s low initial income and high growth
potential. FDI has covered about half the cumulative deficit, but with privatization slowing,
nonresident deposits (NRDs) and borrowing from parent banks have played an increasing
financing role (Figure 2). As a result, total gross external debt has risen sharply to 93 percent
of GDP in 2004, even though net external debt remains a more modest 30 percent of GDP
(Figure 3).

Domestic demand picked up
sharply in 2004, pushing economic
growth well above the 1996-2003
average. A strong increase in investment
and consumption—driven by expectations
of sustained income convergence and
declining real interest rates—pushed GDP
growth up to 8½ percent, from 7½ percent

in 2003 (Table 1). The external sector remained a net drag on growth even as export volume
growth increased. Private sector credit—particularly to households—continued to expand
rapidly, growing by more than 35 percent for the fifth consecutive year to reach 57 percent of
GDP, second highest among new EU members (Figure 4). Unemployment declined steadily
to below 10 percent in Q1 2005—of which long-term unemployment is less than half—even
as economy-wide wages continued to rise well above inflation.

used the opportunity of EU accession to raise prices in conditions of strong demand.
Excluding large one-off investment imports of about 1½ percent of GDP and some preaccession stock building, the underlying current account deficit widened by about

Box 1. Impact of One-Off Factors in 2004: A Moderate Effect
One-off factors in 2004 accounted for only part of the increase in inflation and the current
account deficit. As in several other NM states, EU accession brought increases in indirect
taxes and changes in customs duties, leading to higher prices and some pre-accession
hoarding of goods during the early part of the year. However, in Latvia, the direct
contribution of these effects is thought to have been small. According to the Bank of Latvia,
changes in indirect taxes (both increases and reductions) and administratively regulated
prices added 1 percentage point to inflation around mid-year. A pre-accession buildup in
stocks boosted imports by about 1¼ percent of GDP early in the year, but these are likely to
have been largely drawn down during the second half, with only a small net impact on
imports for the year as a whole. Food price

5.
Notwithstanding the surge in imports in 2004—partly attributable to the fast
pace of domestic demand—external competitiveness appears adequate. The labor costbased real exchange rate—broadly unchanged in 2004 relative to 2003—improved
significantly compared with earlier years as rapid productivity growth and a modest
depreciation of the SDR-linked currency compensated for strong growth in nominal wages
(Figure 5). Exports grew robustly in volume terms and, together with a favorable terms of
trade, further increased Latvia’s export share in EU and world markets. Latvia joined ERM2
on April 29, 2005 at the prevailing exchange rate parity, having repegged from the SDR to
the euro in January.
6.
Booming bank credit added to demand pressures. With bank profits strong, easy
access to foreign financing, nonperforming loans low and well provisioned, and capital
adequacy—though moderating in recent years—still considerably higher than the newly
lowered minimum requirement,1 banks faced few constraints in expanding their balance
1

The minimum statutory capital adequacy ratio (CAR) was reduced in late 2004 from
10 percent to 8 percent—the rate in most EU countries—to provide similar conditions for
domestic banks and foreign branches.

sheets (Table 3 and Appendix II). With mortgages the most dynamic segment of the credit
market, banks have become increasingly exposed to credit risk from possible house price
fluctuations and from a slowdown in economic growth to which bank lending is an important
contributor. Since most mortgages are denominated in foreign currency (euros and U.S.
dollars), indebted households are exposed to movements in the exchange rate. Nonresident
deposits (NRDs)—an important funding source at many banks (including several of the
largest banks)—represent more than half of total deposits, raising concerns about the
growing shortfall of banks’ liquid foreign assets relative to short-term foreign liabilities, as
well as possible links with money laundering.
7.
Despite two supplementary budgets, strong revenue overperformance enabled a
better-than-budgeted fiscal outturn in 2004. With conservative revenue forecasts, higherthan-expected GDP growth, and lower spending than approved in the supplementary budgets,
the general government deficit on a cash basis was contained to 1.1 percent of GDP,2
one percentage point below target and ½ percentage point below the 2003 outturn, consistent
with Executive Directors’ recommendations during the 2004 Article IV consultation (Table 4
and Box 2). Adjusting for cyclical effects on revenue and excluding net EU grants, the fiscal
stance is estimated to have been contractionary in 2004 (Box 3).
Box 2. Article IV Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Latvia has generally heeded the Fund’s advice on macroeconomic and structural policies, as
evidenced by a series of stand-by arrangements, the most recent of which expired at end-2002.
However, recent years have seen an easing of fiscal control toward year-end on account of a
surge in spending, slowing progress toward the authorities’ medium-term goal of budget
balance. Monetary policy has generally supported the exchange rate peg, and in preparation for
euro adoption, liquidity management has increasingly relied on open market operations.
In the financial area, supervision has been streamlined with the establishment of a unified
financial sector supervisor, and the authorities recently approved a package of legislation
aimed at eliminating deficiencies in the AML/CFT framework.
In concluding the last Article IV consultation, Directors praised Latvia’s continued strong
economic performance (http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2004/cr04260.pdf).
However, they saw as ongoing risks the large current account deficit and rapid credit growth
which—though consistent with Latvia’s stage of development—called for a prudent fiscal path
and vigilant bank supervision. They also advised that potential overheating risks should be
warded off in a timely manner. This advice remains relevant in view of recent macroeconomic
developments.

On an ESA95 basis, the deficit was 0.8 percent of GDP. The difference between the cash
and ESA concepts reflects the one-time effect of the increase in the VAT collection lag
following EU accession.

Box 3. Estimating the Fiscal Stance in Latvia
In addition to standard adjustments for cyclical conditions and differences between
cash and accrual accounting, estimating the demand effect of fiscal policy requires
accounting for EU transfers. EU-financed government spending leaves the fiscal
balance unchanged but adds to demand pressures, the timing of which may not fully
coincide with the receipt of EU funds owing to advance and ex post payments which
are recorded upon arrival of the funds in the national budget presentation. On the other
hand, contributions to the EU raise the measured deficit, but do not generate domestic
demand. The Latvian budget format (“extended” government) includes in revenues and
expenditures EU grants to private sector final beneficiaries (estimated by the mission at
40 percent of EU grants for 2005), even though these are not part of government
activity. On the basis of these considerations, the appropriate concept for assessing the
fiscal stance is the change in the structural accrual balance excluding net EU grants and
transfers to the private sector where the government is the paying authority.

to include banks’ short-term foreign liabilities—helped lift nominal interest rates on latsdenominated bank loans (Figure 6). However, the pickup in inflation was even stronger, and
real borrowing costs declined, while real deposit rates turned sharply negative. Maintaining
the ±1 percent band, the lats was repegged to the euro at the beginning of 2005 and Latvia
entered ERM2 at end-April 2005. The authorities are aiming to adopt the euro at the
beginning of 2008, which would require satisfying the Maastricht criteria sometime during
2007.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
9.
The discussions focused on policies to maintain macroeconomic and financial
stability while preserving external competitiveness. The challenge for the near term was
seen as dampening overheating pressures in order to qualify for euro adoption without an
undue delay that could generate its own risks.3 Over the medium term, the goal is to sustain
real income convergence by reducing risks of a boom-bust cycle triggered by eroding
competitiveness and a heavy private-sector debt overhang. The discussions also explored the
contribution of the financial sector to prevailing macroeconomic conditions, and the extent of
vulnerabilities generated by the ongoing credit boom, the size of NRDs, and deficiencies in
the AML/CFT framework.
10.
While recognizing the importance of fiscal policy as the primary lever to
moderate demand, the authorities stressed that access to substantial EU funds posed a
difficult tradeoff. Given the constraints of the narrow-band currency peg, the authorities saw
clear limits to their ability to influence private domestic demand through further tightening of
monetary policy. While there was agreement that reining-in fiscal policy was the main
available tool to contain overheating pressures, the authorities and the mission had different
perspectives on how to resolve the tradeoff between the medium-term capacity-enhancing
benefits of EU-financed spending (including on infrastructure), and the short-term benefits—
for macroeconomic stability—of a firmer fiscal stance. This partly also reflected different
assessments of the extent of spare capacity and thus prospects for disinflation.
A. Economic Outlook and Medium-Term Risks
11.
While the authorities saw strong growth continuing in 2005, they expected
inflation and the current account deficit to moderate as temporary supply shocks
dissipated. They forecast economic growth at 7½ percent for this year, but estimated that
this would leave output below potential until 2006. One-off supply side factors—rather than
overheating pressures—were seen by the authorities as primarily responsible for the higher

inflation, including through a strengthening of the fiscal stance.

- 16 -

inflation and current account deficit last year. They saw spare capacity in industry (a
utilization rate of about 70 percent—though rising) and the recent jump in the investment-toGDP ratio (with positive effects on growth potential) as consistent with a still-negative
output gap. For 2005, the authorities expect the current account deficit to narrow to
10 percent of GDP and inflation to moderate to 5–5½ percent (year-average basis). However,
they were concerned about risks of second-round effects from further increases in energy
prices scheduled for 2005, which could delay euro adoption.
12.
The mission considered the economy to be somewhat more cyclically advanced,
with output marginally above potential since late 2004. The ongoing credit boom and
stronger real wage growth were expected to underpin private domestic demand this year,
while a sharp increase in spending financed by net EU grants (by 2.4 percentage points to
3.6 percent of GDP) would also boost public spending. Staff thus projected GDP growth of
7¾ percent for 2005, slightly above the authorities’ forecast and above staff’s estimate of
short-term growth potential (about 6½ percent). Moreover, actual growth may be exceeding
the reported rate owing to very dynamic activity in the grey economy, especially
construction. On the cyclical position of the economy, the mission noted that activity was
unevenly distributed across economic sectors and geographic regions—with services
accounting for nearly four-fifths of the economy and the Riga region generating the bulk of
GDP—a pattern reinforced by the recent composition of growth. It pointed to evidence of
capacity constraints in construction (the sector most affected by mortgage-financed housing
and EU-financed infrastructure spending), where shortages of qualified workers have pushed
up wages; and to the very rapid expansion in retail sales that has raised core inflation. While
investment would enhance future growth potential, in the short term staff saw the pace of
activity as set to further widen the positive output gap.
13.
Against this background, the
mission saw the risks weighted toward
higher core inflation and a wider
underlying current account deficit this
year. While headline inflation (on a 12month basis) would remain on a downward
track through mid-year reflecting the high
base in early 2004, demand pressures would
likely turn this trend around in the second
half, with the mission projecting year-end
inflation at 6¼ percent. While staff saw the
current account deficit narrowing to about
10½ percent of GDP this year on the basis of

higher net current transfers from the EU4 and the absence of bulky one-off investments that
pushed up imports in 2004, adjusting for these one offs, the deficit would be slightly higher
in underlying terms than in 2004 due to strong domestic demand and higher energy prices.
14.
High external imbalances and rising foreign debt—the main risks for the
medium term—could weigh on market sentiment, particularly if euro adoption is
substantially delayed. With relatively modest official reserve coverage of short-term
external financing needs (Table 5), Latvia remains reliant on capital inflows. Under the
baseline, staff is projecting external debt climbing by 14 percentage points of GDP over the
next six years, reaching 108 percent by 2010. This reflects the impact on the current account
deficit of strong domestic demand and faster inflation and productivity-adjusted wage growth
relative to trading partners—with the deficit only partly financed by FDI—and the need to
maintain adequate reserve coverage for imports (Tables 6–7). This baseline highlights the
need for demand restraint to improve the saving-investment balance and slow debt
accumulation. Fiscal consolidation would need to contribute significantly to the required
adjustment, complemented by higher net private saving from measures to moderate credit
growth (see below). The BoL regarded net debt (projected by the mission to reach 50 percent
of GDP in 2010) as a more relevant indicator of vulnerability and noted that lending by
parent banks to Latvian subsidiaries—which is likely to be continuously rolled over—
accounted for 12 percentage points of gross debt. They also considered that external sector
risks would greatly diminish once Latvia adopted the euro. The mission cautioned, however,
that unless macroeconomic policies were geared to containing demand and inflation, market
sentiment could be adversely affected, heightening external risks in the short term.
B. Fiscal Policy
15.
The mission expressed concern about the procyclical fiscal stance that is in
prospect this year. The 2005 budget targets a significant increase in spending—estimated at
more than 11 percent in real terms—covered mostly by EU grants. Although the headline
deficit is budgeted to widen by ½ percent of GDP, controlling for net EU grants and cyclical
effects, the demand and stimulus is likely to be on the order of 3⅓ percent of GDP.
16.
The authorities agreed that the budget implied a procyclical stance, but
explained that fiscal policy was likely to be considerably tighter than initially planned.
They expected strong tax collections in the first quarter to continue through the year,5 while

accounts is expected to narrow by 3 percentage points to 7¼ percent of GDP in 2005.

the budget’s assumptions on EUfinanced spending were viewed as
too ambitious, with likely
execution at three-quarters of this
level owing to slower-thanexpected procurement and
implementation bottlenecks.
While a supplementary budget
was currently under preparation
authorizing additional spending to
cover inter alia unforeseen storm
and security costs, the authorities
expected to keep the headline
deficit under 1 percent of GDP.

17.
Even with the headline deficit projected by the authorities, the mission saw risks
in the resulting procyclical fiscal stance this year. The mission estimated that the likely
fiscal outturn for 2005, albeit considerably better-than-budgeted, implied a demand stimulus
of about 1½ percent of GDP, and advised that a more appropriate target given the present
cyclical position of the economy was to aim for broad fiscal neutrality. Such an objective
would balance the need to reduce demand pressures with the benefits for the economy’s
supply potential of EU-financed investment. The mission estimated that a target of fiscal
neutrality could be realized by holding expenditure and net lending relative to GDP
(excluding payments to the EU) unchanged from the previous year, which would still allow
real spending to increase by nearly 8 percent. Beyond the issue of the fiscal stance this year,
the mission advised against the practice of authorizing large additional spending in the event
of revenue overruns—as in the previous two years—given the risk that this could
institutionalize procyclicality in public finances.
18.
The authorities considered staff’s recommended fiscal stance for 2005 to be
politically infeasible, and plan for rather gradual adjustment over the next several
years. In their next update of the Convergence Program, the authorities intend to revise down
their medium-term fiscal targets on account of the stronger outturn for 2005, and to trim the
fiscal deficit thereafter by 0.1 percentage points of GDP per year. Against this, ongoing
second-pillar pension reform—by diverting contributions from government revenue—will
increase the deficit by 1½ percent of GDP when fully phased in 2010. The mission saw
benefit in faster medium-term adjustment to help prefinance pension reform costs and reduce
external sector risks, and recommended improving the fiscal balance (including second-pillar
contributions) by 1½ percent of GDP during 2004–10, supported by better tax compliance
and some expenditure restraint. Phasing the adjustment—but with front loading during 200507—would also alleviate prevailing overheating pressures while accommodating the
spending of time-bound EU grants that would enhance potential growth (Table 6). The
authorities noted that because the revised Stability and Growth Pact provides only temporary

...

partial relief for pension reform costs, they were considering scaling back the second pillar
reform. Staff pointed out that while reducing the size of the second pillar would avert an
increase in the fiscal deficit, it would not appreciably affect aggregate saving or the external
imbalance.
19.
The authorities saw complying with requirements for drawing EU funds and
EU-related fiscal forecasting as having improved the medium-term perspective of the
budget. They noted that the medium-term deficit path in the Convergence Program is
obtained from separate forecasts of revenues (linked to macroeconomic projections) and
expenditures (based on estimates of recurrent costs and costs of planned and ongoing
investments). Beginning with the 2005 cycle and as required by the EU, medium-term
strategies prepared by several line ministries guide the selection of EU-financed investment
projects, while a government working group was looking at the possibility of introducing
two-year budgets. The mission welcomed these improvements, but noted that the credibility
of fiscal targets would be enhanced if explicit forecasts of future EU disbursements—a key
parameter for budget preparation—were made known.
C. Inflation, Credit Growth, and ERM2/Euro Adoption Issues
20.
There was general agreement on the need to moderate credit growth in order to
contain inflationary pressures. Latvia’s credit boom has contributed to overly strong
domestic demand and rising external debt (Box 4). In view of the narrow exchange rate band,
the BoL saw little scope for further effective tightening of monetary policy, since widening
the interest rate differential against the euro, for example, would likely induce a further shift
toward foreign-currency borrowing, rather than moderating domestic credit. The authorities
were therefore considering other measures to slow credit, including taxing multiple mortgage
loans by individuals in order to stem speculative real estate purchases. The mission stressed
the need to address distortions in the tax system that could be fuelling the mortgage boom,
including generous capital gains tax exemptions and the practice of basing land registration
fees on low cadastral values or assessors’ valuations—rather than transaction prices. It
therefore recommended restricting the scope of the capital gains tax exemption to an
individual’s primary residence, instead of all real estate owned by individuals, as at present.
21.
The mission supported Latvia’s prospective move into ERM2, provided policies
were in place to safeguard competitiveness. Solid export volume growth, a rising export
share in world markets, a favorable ULC-based real exchange rate, and a sharp rise
(1¾ percentage points) in 2004 in self-financed reinvested earnings underpin the merit of the
decision to adopt the prevailing euro-lats peg as the ERM2 central parity. The authorities
underscored the importance of the exchange rate regime—including the narrow band—in
securing and maintaining macroeconomic stability for more than a decade, prompting their
decision to unilaterally preserve the narrow band within the standard ±15 percent ERM2
margins. The mission cautioned that excessive inflation could compromise medium-term
competitiveness, and stressed the need to preserve existing labor market flexibility while

- 20 -

bringing domestic demand under control. The authorities saw the decentralized wage-setting
system and ongoing productivity improvements as helping to support competitiveness going
forward. The mission cautioned that sustained high wage growth in the nontradable sector
would add to wage pressures in the tradable sector that could erode competitiveness unless
productivity growth increased commensurately.
Box 4. Macroeconomic Effects of Latvia’s Credit Boom
Latvia’s credit boom likely results from the availability of new credit instruments and
lower real interest rates—consistent with an easing of liquidity constraints from
deepening financial integration. However, since the credit expansion stimulates
domestic demand, it can also contribute to overheating. Rapid credit growth is not new
to Latvia but, until recently, demand effects appeared to have been contained by high
domestic saving and deposit accumulation. Since 2004, however, external bank
borrowing has been the main funding source for credit.
A background paper uses an econometric estimation and simulates a theoretical model
to analyze the macroeconomic effects of domestic credit.1/ Results suggest that:
(i) private sector credit raises domestic demand, inflation, and the current account
deficit in the short to medium run; (ii) the financing source matters—foreign financing
generates higher inflation and growth and a larger current account deficit than does
domestic deposit-financed credit; and (iii) the sectoral allocation also matters, with
household credit growth raising inflation and worsening the current account, while
corporate credit has the opposite effect, presumably by expanding productive capacity.
_______________________

by E. Stavrev, in the upcoming Selected Issues paper for 2005.
D. Financial Sector Issues
22.
With little evidence that a slowdown in credit growth was underway, the mission
urged vigilance in monitoring associated macroprudential risks. Still low loan
penetration of households (only 10 percent have a mortgage and 25 percent some form of
credit) and renewed borrowing by corporates for EU-related projects were expected to fuel
bank lending in 2005–06. Banking representatives saw the BoL’s stress tests—which indicate
considerable resilience to macroeconomic shocks—as supporting their favorable assessment
of risks. Supervisors and the mission were somewhat more cautious in view of banks’
aggressive drive for market share. The mission also cautioned that the current strong
financial soundness indicators (FSIs) could quickly weaken if the economy were to slow
sharply or the real-estate market undergo a correction.

- 21 -

23.
The mission welcomed the recent improvements in monitoring and stress testing
which have strengthened the quality of macroprudential surveillance. Following on from
the major changes in financial sector supervision since the 2001 FSAP (including
establishing a single independent supervisory agency; Appendix III), further progress has
recently been made, including refining risk scenarios used in stress tests and collecting loanperformance data by type of borrower and credit instrument. The recent broadening of the
coverage of the credit register for bad debts should also improve the basis for banks’ lending
decisions.
24.
However, the mission expressed concern that several key prudential regulations
had recently been relaxed. While recognizing the strong competitive pressures from foreign
banks, the mission noted that the reduction in the minimum CAR was an unwelcome change
during a credit boom, with two banks having reduced their capital cushions below the
previous threshold. The mission also considered that the removal of limits on banks’ open
positions in euros had been premature. Supervisors saw repegging to the euro as having
reduced the riskiness of the euro relative to other foreign currencies. They noted that they had
recently advised banks to inform households of the risks of foreign currency loans, and
welcomed the ongoing shift from dollar- to euro-denominated mortgages. The mission
agreed that the relative riskiness of euro-denominated liabilities had declined, but considered
it prudent to keep in place limits on net euro positions until euro adoption to discourage
building-up large open positions in the interim (Box 5). It also called for supervisors to
ensure that smaller loan-to-value norms are applied in all situations of currency mismatch
between borrowers’ income and debt to reflect the greater riskiness of these loans.
25.
From a macroprudential perspective, the mission saw merit in proactive
supervision of banks with substantial NRD liabilities. NRDs have high average turnover
and could respond differently to shocks than other liabilities. The recent outflow of NRDs
(concentrated primarily in two small banks identified as potentially involved in money
laundering) underlines this difference. The authorities perceived systemic risks from NRD
banks to be very modest owing to their relatively small share of domestic credit (11 percent
of GDP) and limited interbank linkages. They also pointed to the resilience of NRDs to the
Russia crisis and did not consider the run on Uruguay’s NRDs during the Argentina crisis as
a relevant parallel for Lativa. The mission nonetheless noted that several large banks have
substantial domestic and NRD bases, creating the potential for a run on one type of deposit to
spill over to another within a bank, and considered that the Uruguayan episode highlighted
risks of liquidity and currency mismatches between banks’ short-term NRDs and counterpart
assets. The mission also considered that FSIs based on aggregate data were not very
informative owing to large differences in liquidity and profitability across groups of banks,
and welcomed the separate compilation of FSIs for banks with and without significant NRDs
(Table 8).
26.
The authorities reported on progress to strengthen AML legislation and
enforcement and requested an AML/CFT ROSC. They confirmed that 13 banks had been

mismatch between banks’ short-term
foreign liabilities and liquid foreign
assets rose rapidly to 10 percent of
GDP in 2004, of which 3 percentage

(equivalent to 200 percent of capital of
NRD-intensive banks). Widespread
withdrawal of NRDs could affect the
economy through two channels: by
creating liquidity shortfalls at NRDintensive banks; and by drying-up an
important source of current account

placed under AML watch, thousands of bank accounts had been closed due to lack of client
cooperation with customer due diligence requirements, and some 16,000 unusual- or
suspicious-transaction reports had been filed in 2004 alone. Nonetheless, at the time of the
mission, significant deficiencies remained, including: (i) legislation that did not define
“beneficial owner” or stipulate the obligation to identify the beneficial owner; and (ii) an
inadequately funded, staffed, and equipped law enforcement arm that was impeding timely
investigations. To remedy legislative shortcomings, the authorities were preparing
amendments to the Credit Institutions Law and the criminal code, which were approved
following the mission. To determine whether this new legislation and its implementation
complies with international best practice, the authorities requested an AML/CFT assessment
for early 2006. The mission welcomed these developments and urged that any remaining
weaknesses identified in the assessment be quickly addressed.
E. Structural and Other Issues
27.
The authorities saw the current structure of the economy as a potential
bottleneck to medium-term growth potential. They viewed as unsustainable the recent
growth bias toward potentially-unproductive services and were also concerned that most EU
structural funds had so far been allocated to Riga and the central region, while highunemployment areas had seen little benefit. The authorities were therefore seeking to ensure
a more regionally-balanced allocation of future EU grants. The mission supported this
approach as also helping to alleviate overheating pressures and emphasized the importance of
transparent and open project selection and tendering procedures in realizing the full growth
potential of EU funds. It also urged continued efforts to strengthen AML/CFT protections
and reduce corruption in order to maintain Latvia’s attractiveness to foreign investors.

29.
The authorities viewed a
higher minimum wage as
supporting labor force
participation while reducing the
grey economy, but the mission
cautioned about possible adverse

Ratio of minimum to average wage

28.
Although unemployment is declining, the authorities were concerned that the
structural component remains substantial despite rapid economic growth. Long-term
unemployment is concentrated among high-school drop-outs, low-skilled workers made
redundant by structural change, and older workers reflecting the gradual increase in the
official retirement age. The authorities credited active labor market measures with the
gradual reduction in long-term unemployment. However, the mission viewed outdated
training and work experience as obstacles to further reductions, and recommended reforms
targeted to graduating workers with

effects on employment. The authorities suspected that the large share of minimum-wage
workers reflected a sizable “grey” economy in which official wages are supplemented by
cash payments. The mission acknowledged that raising the minimum wage could promote
labor force participation and increase tax collections by legitimizing the grey economy, but
cautioned that it could also discourage demand for low-skilled workers. This concern was
reinforced by the relatively high ratio of minimum-to-average wages in Latvia. A better
solution for increasing participation, the mission argued, was to narrow the tax wedge for
low-wage workers by lowering their social security contributions.
30.
From accession, Latvia’s trade policy is governed by the common policy of the
EU. Latvia terminated all bilateral preferential trade agreements and adopted the EU’s
common customs tariff and preferential agreements. The elimination at the beginning of
2005 of WTO quotas on textile imports was seen as detrimental to Latvia’s textile exports to
the EU, which represented some 80 percent of Latvia’s domestic production.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Latvia faces the challenge of sustaining rapid income convergence with advanced
European countries while maintaining macroeconomic stability. Latvia’s strong track
record on macroeconomic performance, underpinned by deep-seated structural reforms and
generally prudent fiscal and monetary policies, was crowned by EU accession and ERM2
entry. But with growth expected to remain above trend and emerging imbalances apparent in
rising core inflation and a widening underlying current account deficit, action is needed to
contain domestic demand by avoiding the stimulus in prospect for 2005. Doing so will also
support Latvia’s euro adoption goal and help preserve external competitiveness while
preventing a large debt overhang that could weigh on market sentiment and slow income
convergence.
32.
Given overheating concerns, macroeconomic policies should, at a minimum,
avoid adding to demand pressures. Under the pegged exchange rate and fully liberalized
capital flows, further tightening domestic monetary policy instruments would likely be
ineffective or counterproductive. Therefore, ensuring macroeconomic stability falls primarily
to fiscal policy. Moderating the recent pace of credit growth would complement fiscal
adjustment and limit the buildup in external debt.
33.
A broadly neutral fiscal stance would balance the supply-enhancing potential of
EU-financed investment with the need to contain short-term demand effects of public
spending. This target is consistent with a general government deficit excluding net EU grants
of 1.1 percent of GDP in 2005, only marginally smaller than the deficit on the same basis in
the previous year. The revenue over performance in train should make this target achievable,
provided the authorities contain the expenditure-to-GDP ratio (excluding payments to the
EU) to the level in 2004. In this regard, the planned supplementary budget risks opening the
door to additional spending demands that would make fiscal policy more procyclical, unless
offset by savings elsewhere. More generally, the practice of authorizing spending of revenue

- 25 -

overruns during the year should be avoided as it tends to institutionalize procyclicality in
public finances.
34.
Fiscal policy should also aim at lowering the buildup in external debt and
prefinancing the cost of pension reform within a comprehensive multi-year budgeting
framework. Owing to the paucity of other instruments, fiscal policy should assume a sizable
share of the needed external adjustment, notwithstanding low public debt and relatively low
fiscal deficits. A more frontloaded medium-term fiscal adjustment than envisaged by the
authorities would not only decrease dependence on foreign savings but also help cover the
fiscal cost of pension reform—even if it is decided not to implement the reform in full. In
addition, a smaller deficit would provide a buffer for meeting the Maastricht and SGP fiscal
ceilings if the economy were to slow considerably. Recent improvements in medium-term
budgeting are welcome, but to enhance the credibility of fiscal targets, the authorities could
usefully make known their forecasts of EU grants that underlie the fiscal projections.
35.
Moderating the pace of credit is essential to support fiscal policy in containing
inflationary pressures. With little or no scope for independent monetary policy, other
measures are needed to slow credit growth, especially mortgage credit. As a first step,
distortions in the tax system that could be fuelling the mortgage boom should be eliminated,
including by limiting the capital gains tax exemption only to an individual’s primary
residence. The authorities should also explore further their proposal for a tax on mortgage
borrowing while recognizing that the effectiveness of such a measure would likely diminish
over time as ways are found to circumvent the tax.
36.
Rapid credit growth puts a premium on strong supervision and prudential
safeguards. Recent improvements in monitoring and stress testing are welcome and further
refining credit-risk scenarios will better alert the authorities to potential vulnerabilities.
However, the easing of prudential regulations for credit and exchange rate risk amid a
sustained credit boom is unwelcome. Close scrutiny of banks’ currency exposures and credit
standards should continue, while supervisors should ensure that banks appropriately tailor
loan conditions to reflect the added risk of lending in a currency other than the borrowers’
income, and continue to alert borrowers to risks entailed in unhedged foreign currency
borrowing.
37.
Macroprudential vulnerabilities associated with nonresident deposits and the
different profile of banks that specialize in these deposits call for enhanced supervision.
The growing mismatch between short-term foreign liabilities and liquid foreign assets is a
concern in view of the high turnover of NRDs. The recent outflows from a few small banks
due to money laundering concerns attest to the vulnerability associated with NRDs, as well
as to the importance of addressing the underlying concerns. Several large banks with
substantial domestic and NRD bases warrant rigorous monitoring owing to the risk that
withdrawals of one type of deposit could adversely impact the confidence of other depositors.
The authorities are also encouraged to regularly compile macroprudential data separately for
banks with and without substantial exposure to NRDs.

- 26 -

38.
Strengthening the legislative and enforcement aspects of the AML/CFT
framework remains a priority. The recent amendments to AML legislation and the request
for an independent evaluation in the form of an AML/CFT ROSC are welcome steps.
Combating money laundering should be seen as an ongoing process, with development and
timely implementation of an action plan for remedying remaining weaknesses a key goal that
would serve to avert the reputational risk to Latvia’s financial sector.
39.
Sustaining vigorous growth over the medium term is contingent on continuing to
expand and efficiently allocate capital while raising employment. Concerted efforts to
reduce corruption and transparently allocate EU funds for infrastructure will support
medium-term growth by ensuring the efficient use of scarce resources. Narrowing the tax
wedge for low-wage earners through a reduction in their social security contributions would
help to raise labor force participation and improve job creation relative to increasing the
legislated minimum wage. Revamping the education system by tailoring curricula to graduate
workers with in-demand skills would help boost the effective supply of labor.
40.
It is recommended that the Article IV consultation with Latvia remain on the standard
12-month cycle.

2/ Official reserves and banks' liquid foreign currency-denominated assets cover about 75 percent of short-term debt at remaining maturity and foreign currency deposits.
3/ Since end-April 2005.
4/ The large negative value reflects Malaysia's negative gross external financing requirement (owing to a large current account surplus) and very high level of reserves.

Key Macroeconomic and External Assumptions
Real GDP growth (in percent)
GDP deflator in US dollars (change in percent)
Nominal external interest rate (in percent)
Growth of exports (GNFS in US dollar terms, in percent)
Growth of imports (GNFS in US dollar terms, in percent)

II. Stress Tests for External Gross Debt
1. GDP growth, interest rate, deflator, non-interest curr.acc., and non-debt inflows are at historical average in 2005-2010
2. Nominal interest rate is at historical average plus 4 percentage points in 2005 and 2006
3. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
4. Change in US dollar GDP deflator is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
5. Non-interest current-account deficit is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
6. One time 15 percent nominal depreciation in 2005

Exchange Arrangements:

The currency of Latvia is the lats, which was introduced in March 1993 to replace the
Latvian ruble. The exchange rate was pegged to the SDR from February 1994 to
December 2004, within a ±1 percent band. On January 1, 2005, the lats was repegged to the
euro and on April 29, 2005, Latvia entered ERM2, maintaining the previous band width.
Latvia’s exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions. Latvia maintains bilateral payments agreements with
Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan (reported as “inoperative”), and has notified the Fund under
Decision No. 144-(52/51) that it has introduced measures to freeze accounts of members of
Al-Qaeda, the Taliban and other terrorist groups in accordance with UN Security Council
Resolutions Nos. 1267 (1999), 1333 (2000) and 1390 (2002).

APPENDIX III

Latvia: Follow-up on Key Recommendations of the 2001 FSAP
RECOMMENDATIONS
Priority policies
FCMC establishment: Communications with staff and
commercial banks should be strengthened, and
procedures should be introduced for the smooth
transition of deposit insurance to the Financial and
Capital Market Commission (FCMC). The authorities
should more clearly define the role and
responsibilities of the deposit insurance agency within
the FCMC, and ensure that there is no conflict of
interest between the responsibilities of the deposit
insurance fund and the larger goals of the supervisory
agency. Initiate a change management program (hire
human relations experts, form joint teams, etc.).
Prepare for the internal organization of the FCMC by
formulating internal procedural rules, sign off
procedures and job descriptions. Strengthen
independence and accountability through legal
amendments to the law governing the FCMC, and
harmonize legislation and supervisory methods.

ACTIONS TAKEN (as reported by the authorities)
Internal policies and procedures have been formulated.
ISO 9001:2000 granted on 7 May 2003, confirmed
annually.
Organisational structure is established along functional
lines.
Legislation and supervisory methods are harmonized
across sectors.

Strengthen accountability and appoint members of the
Consultative Council (preferably full-time
professionals not connected to a particular financial
institution) and determine its operating mechanisms.
Define short- and long-term objectives of the FCMC.

Pursuant to the Law on the Financial and Capital
Market Commission, the Consultative Council is
formed on a parity basis from representatives of the
FCMC and professional associations of financial and
capital market participants.
Strategy was adopted by the FCMC Board.
Annual action plans are approved by the Board and
reviewed quarterly.

Insurance: Details on Policyholder Protection Plans
for insurance policy holders should be disclosed to the
public before the plan goes into effect on 1 July 2001.

Respective amendments to the Law on Insurance
Companies and Supervision Thereof are implemented.

SMC: The Securities Market Commission (SMC)
should be exempted from the new civil service
conversion law.

Non-applicable.

Policies for the short to medium term
FCMC establishment: Implement the change
management program (appoint a PR firm, harmonize
salaries, etc.). Implement internal organizational
measures (form an International Affairs Division,
nominate lead specialist staff) and formulate a
strategic plan. Sign Memoranda of Understanding
between FCMC, and both the BoL and MoF.

The change management program was successfully
implemented.
MoU was signed with the BoL and is reviewed
regularly.
Cooperation between BoL, FCMC and MoF is
prescribed by legislation.
A Memorandum of Understanding on co-operation in
financial crisis situations between the banking
supervisory authorities, the central banks and the
Finance Ministries of the European Union is under
preparation.

- 42 -

APPENDIX III

RECOMMENDATIONS
Legal framework: Indemnity should be provided for
supervisory staff acting in good faith in the normal
discharge of their functions and powers. Adopt
legislation to transform court bailiffs into an
independent legal profession. Train and appoint
additional judges, and improve the infrastructure and
security of court buildings.

ACTIONS TAKEN (as reported by the authorities)
Indemnity is provided to supervisory staff acting in
good faith (Law on Credit Institutions, Art. 111 (5),
Law on Insurance Companies and Supervision Thereof,
Art. 1102, Financial Instruments Market Law, Art 5)

Monetary policy: As planned, the BoL should
reduce—with the aim of eventually eliminating—its
long-term swap facility, given its effect on the level of
usable reserves and given recent growth in long-term
financial instruments.

In 2002, the Bank of Latvia eliminated the long-term
swap facility.

Payment systems: The BoL should publicly disclose
its payment system roles and the major policies it will
follow to achieve its objectives. The BoL law makes
the BoL responsible for the payment system but does
not explicitly provide any mechanism by which such
responsibility may be exercised. It is recommended
that the BoL be given such explicit oversight
responsibility.

On 13 September 2001, the Council of the Bank of
Latvia approved "Bank of Latvia's Payment Systems
Policy" (Resolution No. 89/10) that contains the Bank
of Latvia's objectives and role in the field of payment
systems as well as oversight principles. The "Bank of
Latvia's payment systems policy" is disclosed publicly
by the publication of report on oversight of payment
systems in Latvia in 2002.

The planned amendments to the Credit Institutions
Law that address the legal uncertainty associated with
the finality of settlements should be adopted.

The "Law on Settlement Finality in Payment and
Financial Instruments' Settlement Systems" was
approved by the parliament on December 11, 2003 and
has been effective from May 1, 2004. This law
addresses all issues related to the finality of
settlements.
On 27 January 2005, a new Advisory Board was
created which is led by the Prime Minister (Board
members are the Minister of Finance, the Minister of
the Interior, the Minister of Justice, the Prosecutor
General, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the
President of the Central Bank, the Chairman of the
Financial and Capital Market Commission) in order to
set up priorities in the AML area at the political level.
Also amendments to the Law on Prevention of
Laundering of Proceeds Derived from Criminal
Activity are prepared ahead of time to fully comply
with the requirements of the EU’s third Anti-money
Laundering Directive.
Criminal Code provides sanctions for insider trading
and market manipulation. According to Article 193 of
the Criminal Code, for a person, who acquires or
disposes of a financial instrument on one’s own or
other person’s behalf using the inside information or
engages in the market manipulation, the applicable
sentence is deprivation of liberty for a term not
exceeding 10 years or a fine not exceeding two
hundred times the minimum monthly wage prescribed
in the Republic of Latvia at the time of the judgment,

Money laundering: The enforcement of anti-money
laundering laws and regulations needs to be
strengthened. There is scope to strengthen cooperation
between banking supervision and the Money
Laundering Board. Procedures could be re-examined
and the fines for not reporting financial transactions
increased.

Securities markets: Insider trading and market
manipulation should be made a criminal violation and
the level of fines adjusted to provide for mandatory
disgorgement of profits. Legal insider buying and
selling should be disclosed to the market.

- 43 -

RECOMMENDATIONS

APPENDIX III

ACTIONS TAKEN (as reported by the authorities)
with or without confiscation of property.
According to Article 86 of the Law on the Financial
Instruments Market, persons included in the issuer’s
list of holders of inside information shall submit,
within three business days of making a transaction in
an issuer’s financial instruments, a written notification
to this effect to the respective market organizer. The
market organizer shall post this information on its
Internet homepage without delay.

Non-life insurance: As the volume of business grows,
calculation of technical provisions for non-life
insurance should be subject to certification by an
actuary.

Pension reform: The FCMC should prepare itself for
the licensing and supervision of second pillar private
pension funds.

Article 49, Paragraph four of the Law on Insurance
Companies and Supervision Thereof stipulates that a
non-life insurance company engaged in any class of
civil liability insurance shall append an actuarial
valuation to an annual report, the volume and structure
of which is determined by the respective FCMC
regulations.
FCMC Regulations on Licensing of Managers of Statefunded Pension Schemes and Regulations on
Preparation of Reports of Managers of State-funded
Pensions Schemes have been adopted, a system of onsite examination and off-site monitoring established.

SME financing: The authorities should improve the
administration of, and increase the coordination
between, the government funds that support SME
development.
Corporate governance: Sufficient funding should be
made available to increase the re-registration of
enterprises in the Enterprise Register as soon as
possible.

This recommendation is no longer relevant since the
reform of the Commercial Law is over: January 3,
2005 was the last date when companies/commercial
enterprises to which the reform of the Commercial Law
applies could submit to the Register of Enterprises
(RE) documents to re-register in the Commercial
Registry.
The overall Commercial Law reform was financed
from the state budget and with that financing the RE
ensured the following measures regarding reregistration:
- carrying out informative seminars to enterprises;
- placing extensive information on the RE's homepage
in the internet;
- providing information to mass media;
- distributing methodological materials via other
information channels.

Issues for close watch or for the longer term
Current account: The authorities should continue to
closely monitor developments in the current account,
especially given the possible slowdown in global
economic activity.

Despite robust export development, high domestic
demand has induced rapid import growth and
deterioration of the foreign trade balance and the
current account deficit in 2004. As further acceleration
of the domestic demand facilitated by the growth of

- 44 -

RECOMMENDATIONS

Bank lending: The authorities should continue to
closely monitor the fast growth of bank lending for
signs that imprudent lending may be taking place.

Insurance: There have been allegations that
reinsurance is being used for tax evasion. The FCMC
should study insurance practices relying on data
collected from insurance companies.

APPENDIX III

ACTIONS TAKEN (as reported by the authorities)
lending could trigger upward risk to external
imbalances, the BoL's Council decided to tighten
monetary policy stance in 2004. Measures taken with a
view to reduce macroeconomic risks included a rise of
the refinancing rate by one percentage point to 4%, an
increase of the reserve requirement for financial
institutions by one percentage point to 4% and an
extension of the minimum reserve base including in the
reserve base the financial institutions' liabilities to
foreign banks with an agreed maturity or redeemable at
notice of up to 2 years. The BoL is committed to
conduct a careful analysis of macroeconomic trends
also in the future and, if required, to use instruments at
its disposal to ensure macroeconomic stability.
Banks' strategies, policies and risk management
practices are examined; restrictions on lending are
imposed when deficiencies are discovered (2 cases in
2003). About 50% of the loan portfolio is examined
on-site. The assessment of the loan portfolio by
supervisors is not materially different from that of
banks. Off-site monitoring is enhanced through the
introduction of a new detailed data system on banks’
loan portfolio as from the 3rd quarter of 2004.
Amendments to the Law on Insurance Companies and
Supervision Thereof (Articles 60 and 601) define
eligible reinsurers; provide the FCMC with powers to
request a change in the placement of reinsurance or to
ensure the meeting of reinsurance obligations by the
reinsurer’s pledge of monies transferred to the
possession of the insurance company or the branch of
the non-Member State in the amount of the technical
provisions for reinsurance.
If risks are transferred for reinsurance by using services
of an insurance broker, the insurer is obliged to, prior
to concluding a contract and during the whole period of
validity of the contract, continually assesses the
financial situation and reputation of the insurance
broker. The insurer must have at its disposal documents
showing the placement of reinsurance and the amount
of the commission paid to the insurance broker.

Leasing: The FCMC should closely monitor the
evolution of independent leasing companies and
consider formal supervision over their operations.

Major leasing companies are subsidiaries of banks and
are supervised on a consolidated basis.

Corporate governance: The authorities should
consider developing detailed guidelines for both
traded and non-traded companies on the structure and
operation of committees within supervisory boards
and minimum professional qualifications for
supervisory board members.

According to the Latvian Commercial Law:
(1) Only natural persons with the capacity to act may
be council members.
(2) The following may not be council members:
1) members of the board of directors, the auditor,
proctor or commercial representative of the company;
2) members of the board of directors of any dependent
company of the company or any person with the right

- 45 -

RECOMMENDATIONS

APPENDIX III

ACTIONS TAKEN (as reported by the authorities)
to represent the dependent company.
(3) The articles of association may specify stricter
restrictions for council members.
(4) The minimum number of council members shall be
three, but if the stock of the company is in public
circulation – the minimum number of council members
shall be five.
(5) The maximum number of council members shall be
twenty.
(6) A council member may not entrust to another
person the performance of his or her duties.
According to the Credit Institution Law:
(1) The chairperson of the council and the members of
the council of a bank may be persons who conform to
the following requirements:
1) who are competent in issues of financial
management;
2) who have the necessary education and three years
professional work experience in an undertaking,
organization or institution of relevant size;
3) who have an unimpeachable reputation; and
4) who have not had revoked the right of engaging in
entrepreneurial activities.
The chairperson of the council and the members of the
council of a bank may not be persons:
1) who have been convicted of the intentional
committing of a crime, including bankruptcy in bad
faith;
2) who have been convicted of the intentional
committing of a crime, even though released from
serving the sentence because of a limitation period,
clemency or amnesty; or
3) against whom criminal proceedings for the
intentional committing of a crime have been terminated
due to a limitation period or amnesty.
(2) The meeting of stockholders has a duty on its own
initiative or at the request of the Financial and Capital
Market Commission to remove without delay from
office the persons referred to in Paragraph one of this
Section if they do not conform to the requirements
specified in this Section.
(Similar requirements for supervisory board members
are included in other legislative acts and these apply to
insurance companies, investment companies, securities
market organizers and investment management
companies.)

APPENDIX IV

Latvia: Statistical Issues
1.
The authorities have a very open and well-articulated data dissemination and
publication policy. Most economic and financial statistics are reported to the Fund on a
regular and timely basis, and many additional economic and financial aggregates are readily
available on the websites of the Bank of Latvia (BoL) and Latvian government institutions
and agencies. The authorities are reporting data for the Fund’s International Financial
Statistics, Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, the Direction of Trade Statistics, and the
Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. Latvia has subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since November 1996 and meets SDDS specifications for
the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of the data, and for the dissemination of advance
release calendars. Its metadata have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (DSBB, http://dsbb.imf.org) since December 1997 and it has disseminated
data on the reserves template since April 2000. There is increased cooperation on data issues
between the Central Statistical Bureau (CSB), the BoL, the Ministry of Finance, and the
customs authorities.
National accounts
2.
The CSB compiles and publishes quarterly national accounts statistics using the
production and expenditure approaches on a regular and timely basis, largely following the
1993 SNA and ESA 95. However, there are significant discrepancies between the GDP
estimates based on production and those based on expenditure. The underlying data for the
production approach are obtained primarily through a comprehensive survey of businesses
and individuals, and are supplemented by data from labor force surveys and from
administrative sources. The CSB believes that the basic data understate economic activity,
particularly in the private sector, and there is an ongoing effort to increase coverage. Official
national accounts include an adjustment for under-recording, which the CSB currently
estimates as 16 percent of total GDP. Additional data for the expenditure-based accounts are
obtained from household budget surveys and other surveys from the State Treasury and
ministries.
Prices
3.
The CSB compiles a nationwide consumer price index. With Fund technical
assistance, it has developed appropriate methodologies to deal with most of the technical
problems resulting from the major structural shifts that have occurred in the economy.
Reporting improved markedly during 1998, in part due to the implementation of a new
household budget survey, based on World Bank technical assistance, enabling the CSB to
compile indices for different types of households. Following advice from EUROSTAT, the
weights in the CPI basket are now revised annually. The weights in the producer price index
are updated annually and the index covers almost three quarters of total industrial activity.
The CSB also publishes export and import unit value and volume indices.

APPENDIX IV

Government finance statistics
4.
The staff is provided with monthly information on revenues, expenditures, and
financing of the central and local governments and special budgets. With some limitations,
the available information permits the compilation of the consolidated accounts of the general
government.
Monetary statistics
5.
Monetary data are comprehensive, timely, and comply with international standards.
Specifically, data on the balance sheets of the BoL, commercial banks, and other financial
institutions, as well as the banking survey, are compiled with a very short time lag, i.e.,
within two weeks of the end of the reporting period. Fund staff is also provided weekly with
data on foreign exchange transactions, including outright interventions and foreign currency
swaps. The institutional coverage, classification, and sectorization of accounts comply with
Fund standards. Interest rate data are compiled and published with equally short time lags.
The BoL also reports comprehensive data on banking supervision and prudential regulations.
Balance of payments statistics
6.
The BoL assumed responsibility for compiling the balance of payments statistics
from the CSB in early 2000, and since 2001 has published monthly statistics based on source
data derived from an international transactions reporting system (ITRS). These source data
are being supplemented with the results of three quarterly surveys that were launched in
2000: non-financial enterprises, foreign direct investment and related income flows, and
transportation services. An annual survey of other services will be launched beginning with
data for 2002.
7.
The authorities have taken stock of the Resident Advisor’s recommendations and
adopted in October 2001 an action plan to improve balance of payments statistics coverage
for merchandise trade and travel data. However, they have not reported any improvement in
their compilation techniques for financial transaction items nor indicated whether the survey
on foreign bank accounts of enterprises programmed for 2001 has been implemented.
8.
The trade account is affected by recording problems, and compilation of financial
account transactions is hampered by inadequate sources. Merchandise trade data, based
largely on customs data, underestimate imports and exports of about 140 Custom-bonded
warehouses and three free trade zones. There is a need to improve procedures to ensure that
goods passing through customs warehouses are properly valued. Coverage of exports to
Russia and CIS countries is incomplete; and re-exports of cars and shuttle trade items are
particularly difficult to capture. Estimates of travel credits and debits have been improved
through a revised survey. In general, survey techniques need to be further improved. The
BoL made methodological improvements in compiling statistics on private transfers and
textile exports in 2002. The improvements in survey techniques related to private transfers
better capture income that sailors and other Latvians repatriate to Latvia. Regarding textile

- 48 -

APPENDIX IV

exports, the authorities found that many companies declared only the value added part of
their processed textile exports, although they reported the full value of imported inputs.
While these methodological improvements are welcome, no attempt has been made to revise
earlier data. The resulting break in the data series hampers their usefulness for analysis. Debt
data from Latvia’s International Investment Position (IIP) show a more rapid buildup of debt
than is indicated by the BOP statistics, and efforts are needed to explain and address this and
other divergences between IIP and BOP data. These were among the issues addressed in a
Data ROSC mission from the Fund in September 2003.

Latvia: Table of Common Indicators Required for Surveillance
As of June 27, 2005

- 49 APPENDIX III

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 27, 2005
1.
This statement contains factual information that has become available since the Staff
Report was circulated on July 14, 2004. This information does not materially alter the thrust
of the staff appraisal.
2.
The Bank of Latvia (BoL) raised banks’ reserve requirements by 2 percentage points
to 6 percent, with effect from late August 2005. According to the BoL, the decision was
aimed at fostering macroeconomic stability by slowing bank lending and hence domestic
demand. In addition, the BoL raised its inflation forecast for 2005 from 5 percent (yearaverage basis) to 6 percent in view of price developments during the first half of the year and
projected increases during the second half. The BoL maintained its 2005 growth forecast at
7½ percent.
3.
A high-level working group comprising the Finance and Economy Ministries and the
BoL has been charged with formulating measures to bring down inflation. The measures are
expected to be announced and, according to the Prime Minister, will include some
“unpopular steps,” including tax changes.

Statement by Jon A. Solheim, Executive Director for Republic of Latvia
and Jelena Zubkova, Advisor to Executive Director
July 27, 2005
On behalf of our Latvian authorities, we would like to thank staff for the valuable policy
dialog on the key policy challenges facing Latvia on its way to economic transformation and
towards euro introduction. Our authorities recognize that the strong economic development
required for sustainable convergence with an average EU level and beyond contains risks and
necessitates close monitoring and actions to address macroeconomic imbalances. By the
accession to the ERM-2, our authorities have committed themselves to a sustainable
reduction in inflation and containing external imbalances at a sustainable level. Although our
authorities are in broad agreement with staff’s analyses and recommendations, as outlined in
the staff paper, our authorities and staff have in some areas different perspectives of the
actual situation as well as the appropriate policy approach. This applies in particular to the
somewhat different assessments of the extent to which output already for some time has been
above potential, and the tradeoffs related to EU-financed spending. Accordingly, our
authorities would like to underscore that the underlying factors behind the inflationary
pressures remain mixed and that one-off supply factors make staff’s conclusions on
overheating of the Latvian economy less straightforward.
Economic developments and risks
Our authorities agree that domestic demand is the key driver of the strong economic activity.
While domestic demand is driven by both consumption and investments, the growth is
particularly strong for investments. The investment growth, in turn, builds up capacity and
strengthens competitiveness, which is necessary for utilizing the possibilities provided by the
EU accession. The sharp increase in manufacturing investments has expanded the supply side
of the tradable sector, and the merchandise export growth (38 percent in the first five months
of 2005) has recently significantly outpaced that of the import growth. The latest statistical
data indicate that manufacturing activity after a temporary deceleration in the beginning of
2005 (reflecting the effects on the wood-processing sector of the January storm) is
rebounding. All in all, our authorities project slightly lower GDP growth in 2005 than staff or around 7.5 percent - which is broadly in line with the authorities’ estimated potential GDP
growth.
Although the rapid credit growth should be seen as part of the convergence of the Latvian
economy and integration with EU’s financial markets, our authorities acknowledge the risks.
This is particularly related to the upward pressure on external accounts, while the impact on
inflation appears more mixed. Our authorities share staff’s view on the need to moderate
credit growth, and are considering several tax-related and administrative measures to
moderate credit growth.
Our authorities recognize the challenges related to increased inflationary pressures since
2004, but consider that the demand effects are somewhat overestimated by staff. One of the
most influential factors behind the recent pick-up of inflation is the special increase in food

-2prices, which was induced by the EU membership and a combination of other cost-push
factors (surge in energy prices in combination with Latvia’s relatively high energy intensity;
increases in regulated prices; and harmonisation of indirect taxes). Notwithstanding that the
Latvian core inflation is still relatively high (5.1 percent y-t-y in June 2005), it has shown a
clear downward trend since end-2004. Moreover, even core inflation should not be regarded
as solely demand-driven. Comprehensive analysis by the Bank of Latvia shows that the core
inflation concept encompasses a range of supply-side factors, namely, indirect effects of oil
and regulated prices, changes of indirect taxes and exchange rate as well as price
convergence. Since food price equalisation is still ongoing and energy prices are on their way
up, inflation is expected to average 6.0 percent in 2005.
Our authorities recognize the need to contain inflation expectations and to alleviate possible
second round effects. An inter-institutional working group headed by the Ministry of Finance
and composed of representatives of all the relevant ministries and the Bank of Latvia was,
therefore, set up recently. The working group has submitted to the Cabinet a report on price
developments and proposed measures to reduce inflation. The proposal includes measures to
mitigate cost-push pressure on inflation, promote domestic competition and contain credit
growth. The working group also considers direct measures, such as changes in indirect taxes.
In light of our authorities’ efforts to restrain inflationary pressures, average annual inflation is
expected to fall to about 4 percent in 2006.
Fiscal policy
Our authorities remain fully aware of the role of fiscal policy in the promotion of
macroeconomic stability, and agree with staff that the fiscal stance should be broadly neutral
in light of the strong domestic demand. However, to achieve a substantial consolidation
already in the course of the next few years may prove difficult due to the significant budget
expenditures that will come from payments related to NATO, EU and required structural
reforms. Moreover, in 2005 additional costs will be incurred by compensation to the
agricultural sector created by extreme weather conditions. Given the difficult balance
between future expenditure commitments, and securing a sustainable macroeconomic
performance, our authorities will in the coming years aim at a budget deficit below 1.5
percent of GDP. The long-term objective of the government’s medium term budgetary
framework is a gradual reduction of the budget deficit towards a balanced budget. In this
context, it should also be taken into account that the Latvian government has a long track
record of cautious fiscal planning, resulting in regular undershooting of fiscal targets. This
practice is expected to continue also in the future, implying that the fiscal outturn in 2005 and
coming years could be markedly lower than budgeted.
Monetary and financial sector
Our authorities would like to reassure that the plans on euro introduction in 2008 are still
high on their agenda, and they intend to make every effort to ensure compliance with the
Maastricht criteria by mid-2007.
To mop up excess liquidity that could be used for lending, the Bank of Latvia on July 14,
2005 increased the reserve requirement for commercial banks from 4 percent to 6 percent

-3(effective August 24, 2005). The reserve base was previously extended to include resources
acquired from non-resident banks, and this step will therefore influence both banks that
acquire resources domestically and banks that raise funds abroad. To moderate the sharp
credit growth, our authorities are currently considering a number of measures which could
dampen the demand for loans. This would in turn contribute to reduce the demand pressures
on inflation, reduce external imbalances and moderate net foreign debt growth.
Our authorities appreciate staff’s evaluation of Latvia’s efforts to strengthen the financial
supervision. Our authorities concur with the importance of sound financial management, not
least in light of the rapid credit growth, and will continue to improve the set of supervisory
instruments. Even though financial stability indicators are published on an aggregate basis,
they are monitored on individual basis, and our authorities will remain vigilant to the
financial developments in individual banks. With regard to staff’s concern about the recent
relaxation of some prudential regulations, this should be seen in light of the continued
evaluation of the financial soundness of individual banks and the level playing field in the
EU context. Appropriate actions will be taken if risks to financial stability would emerge. In
addition, the Latvian financial sector’s risks and prudential policies should be viewed in the
context of the strong presence of the European, especially Scandinavian, capital in the
Latvian banking system.
Our authorities note staff’s traditional concern about the high share of non-resident deposits
in the Latvian banking system. In its latest published Financial Stability Report, The Bank of
Latvia analyzed net assets and liabilities of resident deposit intensive (RD) and non-resident
deposit intensive (NRD) banks. The analysis revealed significant differences between the two
groups. RD banks attract funds available on the interbank market abroad, most notably from
their parent banks and use them mostly for granting loans to resident non-banks. NRD banks
mostly attract funds from non-resident non-banks and place a majority of them in foreign
banks or securities. A minor part of the non-resident deposits was used for granting loans to
residents. In 2004, NRD banks decreased the share of domestic loans financed by
nonresident deposits, thus, reducing the liquidity risk. Past experience shows that nonresident deposit flights have been relatively small even during major unfavourable external
developments (for example during the Russian crisis). Banks that were most severely
affected by the outflows of NRDs managed quickly to convert even long-term external assets
into liquidity. In addition, as for foreign indebtedness, NRD-intensive banks formed only
18.0 percent of total NFA of the commercial banks. The rest of the banks’ foreign debt is due
to parent banks borrowing, as well as syndicated loans from other foreign banks.
Structural issues
Staff argues that the current structure of the economy should be treated as a potential
bottleneck to the medium term growth potential. Although some regional disparities are of
concern, favourable structural changes that contribute to a build-up of productive capacity
and strengthen the growth potential have taken place during the last years. There have been
favourable changes in the investment structure, and in particular, investments are
increasingly channelled in the tradable goods sector. Moreover, FDI has picked up after the
EU accession and the share of greenfield investment projects has increased.

-4Our Latvian authorities recognize that threats to the economic development can be posed by
structural impediments in the labor market, particularly workforce skills mismatches. Our
authorities consider labor market flexibility as an important factor to ensure a smooth
development of the Latvian economy, not least in light of the prospective accession to the
EMU. Active labor market policies are addressing structural unemployment issues, and
resources provided by EU funds will strengthen these activities. A substantial share of EU
fund financing is earmarked for the development of human resources, and this will improve
the quality of future labor supply. Furthermore, the Latvian Investment and Development
Agency provides support to enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness and improve the
workforce quality through active labor market initiatives, training, retraining and information
dissemination.
Our authorities concur with staff that combating money laundering should be seen as an
ongoing process. However, this has been the policy approach of our authorities, and all
relevant EU legislation has been implemented. Latvia has already adopted the legislative
provisions incorporating all FATF recommendations and fundamental AML/CFT principles
(including know-your-customer principle and extended reporting of business and politically
exposed persons, in accordance with the forthcoming Third EU Directive). In 2005, a number
of specific measures were taken against some financial institutions by imposing fines,
freezing accounts, applying enhanced supervision and even removing management. These
results have been achieved by persistent efforts of the authorities and the financial
institutions. In order to assess Latvia’s progress, the authorities have requested AML/CFT
ROSC in early 2006. In addition to AML/CFT, anti-corruption measures were addressed by
strengthening of the independence of the Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau and
by implementing the medium term National Program for Corruption Prevention.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Latvia
On July 27, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Latvia.1
Background
During much of the past decade, Latvia’s growth performance outstripped other new European
Union (EU) members while inflation remained subdued. A sound policy framework and farreaching structural reforms supported this performance, including a prudent fiscal policy that
underpinned the exchange rate peg. These achievements were capped by Latvia’s accession to
the EU last year and, more recently, by ERM2 entry. Nonetheless, per capita GDP—at
40 percent of the EU-15 average in PPP terms—remains the lowest in the EU. Against the
backdrop of an open trade and capital account regime, income convergence contributed to
relatively large current account deficits, averaging 7¼ percent of GDP during 1996–2003, and
sharply rising gross external debt, which reached 93 percent of GDP in 2004, though net debt
remains a more modest 30 percent of GDP.
Economic growth picked up sharply in 2004 on very strong domestic demand, accompanied by
a jump in underlying inflation and current account deficit. Investment and consumption were
buoyed by expectations of sustained income convergence and declining real interest rates that
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2pushed GDP growth to 8½ percent. Unemployment continued to decline gradually, and is below
10 percent. Inflation rose to 6¼ percent and the current account deficit widened to 12⅓ percent
of GDP in 2004, partly reflecting one-off factors related to EU accession and other supply
shocks; but even excluding these effects, inflation and the current account deficit have
increased, pointing to the presence of demand-induced imbalances. Private sector credit—
particularly to households—continued to expand strongly, approaching 60 percent of GDP.
Latvia joined ERM2 at end-April 2005 at the prevailing exchange rate parity, having repegged
from the IMF’s Special Drawing Right (SDR) to the euro in January. Labor cost-based
competitiveness was broadly unchanged in 2004 relative to the previous year, and considerably
stronger than in earlier years. Rapid wage growth was compensated by strong productivity
gains and a modest depreciation of the SDR-linked exchange rate. Exports of goods and
services grew robustly in volume terms in 2004 and, together with a favorable terms of trade,
further increased Latvia’s export market share.
Booming bank credit added to demand pressures and macroprudential risks. With bank profits
strong, nonperforming loans low and well provisioned, ready access to foreign financing, and
capital adequacy—though moderating in recent years—well above the newly lowered minimum
requirement of 8 percent of assets, banks faced few constraints in expanding their balance
sheets. Mortgages continued to be the most dynamic segment. With most loans denominated in
foreign currency, unhedged borrowers are exposed to exchange rate movements. Nonresident
deposits—a significant funding source at many banks—represent more than half of total
deposits, raising concerns about the growing shortfall between banks’ liquid foreign assets and
short-term foreign liabilities, as well as possible links with money laundering.
Macroeconomic policies sought to ease demand pressures in 2004. The general government
deficit narrowed by ½ percentage point to 1.1 percent of GDP on stronger-than-budgeted
revenues and lower spending than approved in the supplementary budgets. Monetary policy
was tightened through an increase in the refinancing rate and a strengthening of mandatory
reserve requirements, although real interest rates on lats-denominated bank loans declined.
The repeg to the euro and ERM2 entry were effected smoothly and spreads on eurodenominated bonds have narrowed to 20 basis points.
Robust growth is expected to continue in 2005. The ongoing credit boom and faster real wage
growth are expected to support private domestic demand while a sharp increase in net EU
grants would also boost public spending, with growth reaching 7¾ percent, keeping output
somewhat above potential. While inflation (on a 12-month basis) has remained on a downward
track through mid-year reflecting the high base in early 2004, strong demand pressures and
additional increases in energy prices will likely prevent a further decline in inflation in the second
half of the year, with year-average inflation broadly unchanged relative to 2004. The current
account deficit is expected to narrow to about 10½ percent of GDP on account of larger net EU
transfers and the absence of bulky one-off investments that pushed up imports last year.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the strong performance of the economy, which had culminated
in Latvia’s admission to ERM2 earlier this year. They cautioned, however, that decisive and
timely action to reduce inflation would be crucial to meeting the authorities’ euro adoption
timetable and, more generally, to preserving external competitiveness. While Directors generally

-3considered rapid financial deepening and persistently large current account deficits to be
broadly consistent with Latvia’s stage of real convergence, they saw potential risks associated
with these developments and welcomed the authorities’ commitment to remain vigilant and to
address these risks as needed.
Directors expected robust economic growth to continue in 2005. They attributed the increase in
inflation in 2004 to both demand and supply factors. However, with growth remaining somewhat
above potential and rising regulated and world energy prices, Directors saw inflation declining
only marginally this year.
Given inflation inertia and overheating concerns, Directors called for macroeconomic policies to,
at a minimum, avoid adding to demand pressures. In view of the pegged exchange rate,
Directors considered fiscal policy to be the primary tool for ensuring macroeconomic stability.
Directors also emphasized the need to moderate the recent pace of credit growth in order to
subdue private demand and limit the buildup in macroprudential risks.
Directors considered that a broadly neutral fiscal stance for 2005 would balance the need to
accommodate supply-enhancing EU-financed investment with that of containing the short-term
demand effects of higher public spending. Directors welcomed efforts to contain the execution
of the budget in 2004, but expected that the likely fiscal outturn in 2005—although significantly
tighter than the approved budget—would add to demand pressures. To avoid a demand
stimulus from fiscal policy, Directors urged the authorities to save the projected
overperformance in revenue and hold fiscal spending excluding payments to the EU constant
relative to GDP. Consistent with this, the size of the supplementary budget under preparation
should be strictly limited.
Directors considered that fiscal consolidation over the medium term—beyond what is
contemplated in the Convergence Program—was desirable to slow the build up in external debt.
They welcomed recent improvements in medium-term budgeting associated with the tapping of
EU funds and preparation of Convergence Programs. Notwithstanding the low level of Latvia’s
public debt, Directors also considered that medium-term fiscal adjustment would help to
prefinance the cost of ongoing pension reform. Some Directors noted that some flexibility could
be considered in the fiscal consolidation.
Directors, viewing rapid credit growth as adding to demand pressures, commended the Bank of
Latvia’s decision to raise interest rates and tighten reserve requirements over the past year.
However, as Latvia’s ERM2 entry further limits the scope for an independent monetary policy,
Directors considered that the options for additional tightening had diminished, and they
therefore called for other measures to moderate credit growth. In this regard, closing capital
gains tax loopholes that could be fuelling the mortgage boom was seen as a priority. Directors
also supported the authorities’ intention to impose a temporary tax on mortgage borrowing if the
pace of credit growth failed to moderate.
Directors considered that Latvia’s external competitiveness remained adequate at present, and
supported the decision to enter ERM2 at the prevailing euro-lats peg. However, Directors saw
the recent acceleration of wages as a risk to future competitiveness. They therefore called for
policies to contain wage and price inflation while preserving existing labor market flexibility.

-4Directors underscored the need for strong supervision and prudential safeguards in the present
environment of very rapid credit growth. They welcomed recent improvements in monitoring and
stress testing and the ongoing shift to euro-denominated borrowing in response to Latvia’s
repeg to the euro, but considered that the recent easing of prudential regulations amid the
sustained credit boom could well exacerbate financial sector risks. They therefore urged
continued close oversight of banks’ credit standards and currency exposures, and maintenance
of tighter loan conditions in situations of currency mismatch between borrowers’ income and
debt.
Directors recommended enhanced supervision of banks with substantial nonresident deposits.
They considered that the recent outflows from a few small banks because of money laundering
concerns attested to the risks associated with these deposits. Directors urged rigorous
monitoring of large banks with substantial domestic and nonresident deposits to limit risks of
contagion. Owing to the different profile of banks dealing with nonresident deposits, they also
called for compiling macroprudential data separately for banks with and without substantial
exposure to nonresident deposits.
Directors welcomed the recent antimoney laundering amendments and the authorities’ request
for an Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Report on
the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC). They stressed that strict implementation of
the legal framework was critical for successfully combating money laundering. Directors urged
that any remaining weaknesses identified by the ROSC be quickly addressed in order to
safeguard Latvia’s position as a regional financial center.
Directors encouraged the authorities to move ahead with structural measures to sustain
vigorous growth. Efficiently allocating EU funds for infrastructure was seen as a key element of
a framework for promoting efficient resource allocation, along with the authorities’ continued
reduction of corruption. Directors also called for removing constraints on effective labor supply
by encouraging labor force participation through a narrowing of the tax wedge on low-wage
earners, sharpening incentives to find employment, and by ensuring that the education system
becomes more responsive to skill needs of employers.
