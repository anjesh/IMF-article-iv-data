RUSSIAN FEDERATION
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with the Russian Federation
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and G. Russell Kincaid
July 10, 2008
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Russia’s economic recovery is gaining strength. Soaring oil prices, large capital inflows, and
rapid financial deepening underlie a virtuous circle of strong growth in investment,
productivity, real incomes and consumption. Catch-up gains in productivity are reinforcing the
momentum.
But despite a strong supply response, inflation is rising sharply—well beyond increases in food
and energy prices—as real domestic demand growth has reached 15 percent annually.
Moreover, while the ruble is still undervalued, it is moving close to its equilibrium and
competitiveness margins are narrowing.
The demand pressures reflect in part that fiscal policy is procyclical, and that the ruble peg
continues to fuel rapid growth in money and credit. With private demand growth set to remain
strong, and possibly accelerate, the rise in the non-oil fiscal deficit in 2008 implies further
procyclical stimulus. At the same time, the peg against the dollar-euro basket will likely entail
further monetary easing, as Russia’s relative cyclical position vis-à-vis the US and the Euro
area continues to strengthen.
In staff’s view, the CBR would be best advised to refocus monetary policy on inflation
reduction, allowing more exchange rate flexibility. Fiscal policy should preferably withdraw
stimulus; at a minimum, a further increase in the non-oil fiscal deficit should be avoided,
implying that the supplement to the 2008 budget should be reconsidered.
Absent policy corrections, domestically generated inflationary pressures risk increasing further.
Over the medium-term, a continued pro-cyclical fiscal stance could cause the ruble to continue
to appreciate apace in real terms, even as the current account swings into a deficit. With the
ruble already close to its equilibrium, this points to the risk of the exchange rate overshooting
its equilibrium path. It is, therefore, important to reduce the non-oil fiscal deficit from 2010, as
planned in the medium-term budget, strictly adhering to the envisaged spending limits.
The financial sector is weathering the global turmoil well. But after years of fast credit growth
and negative real interest rates, staff is concerned about vulnerabilities if a sharp monetary
tightening becomes necessary. It should be a priority to improve the regulatory and prudential
system as recommended by the FSAP update.
The government is determined to reinvigorate stalled structural reforms, focusing in particular
on improving the investment climate. Plans are well-advanced and implementation should
proceed expeditiously.

However, despite a strong supply
response, surging domestic demand has
been associated with signs of overheating.
Inflation has doubled during the last year and
competitiveness margins have steadily been
reduced, although staff estimates suggest that
the ruble is still likely undervalued. The rising
demand pressures reflect in part a fiscal policy
that is becoming increasingly procyclical, and
a fixed exchange rate policy that, in the face
of rising oil prices and large capital inflows,
has hampered monetary policy and resulted in
very high money and credit growth.

Against this background, the key challenges are containing inflation pressures,
preventing the exchange rate from overshooting it’s equilibrium level, and further
bolstering long-term GDP growth. The related issues covered in this report include the
appropriate stance of macroeconomic policies, the spillovers from the global financial
turmoil, the need for reinvigorating the structural reform agenda, and potential vulnerabilities
in the financial sector.

Labor markets continue to
tighten, and accelerating real wage
growth is pushing up unit labor costs.
Labor utilization rates have reached record
highs and the unemployment rate continues
to decline, with acute labor shortages in
high-growth areas such as Moscow and St.
Petersburg. For the economy as a whole,
real wage growth has accelerated to an
annual rate of 15 percent, well above
productivity growth: unit-labor costs were
up 5 percent in 2007, compared to an
increase of 1.8 percent in 2006.

manufacturing sector continues to perform
well, growing by 10 percent year-on-year
during the first five months of 2008. Staff estimates suggest, however, that competitiveness
margins are narrowing and that the real effective exchange rate is now closer to its
equilibrium range (Box 1).
8.
Despite surging imports and stagnant oil export volumes, the balance-ofpayments surplus remains large, owing to rising oil prices and strong capital inflows.
While the volatility of inflows has increased as a result of the global turmoil, interventions in
the foreign exchange market have remained high, and foreign reserves rose by
US$145 billion in the year through end-May 2008, reaching US$549 billion. The main
features of the balance of payments are as follows:

6
Box 1. Russia’s External Competitiveness
Despite the rapid pace of real appreciation in recent years, Russia remains competitive. However,
equilibrium-based indictors suggest that the undervaluation of the ruble—a salient feature over the post1998 period—has narrowed significantly, and that the real exchange rate is now getting close to its
equilibrium level, although a small margin still remains. Looking forward, transition-related productivity
gains will result in a steady and sizable real appreciation over the medium term, without necessarily
implying a deterioration in competitiveness. But, given the limited margin left, if the authorities maintain
their current procyclical fiscal stance, there is a significant risk of the real exchange rate overshooting this
equilibrium path, even if the current account swings into a deficit.
•

Staff research suggests that Russia’s competitive edge in wages has weakened over the past five years,
and that the manufacturing wage is now consistent with Russia’s underlying productivity. The finding is
based on empirical estimates of the equilibrium manufacturing wage, which is modeled as a function of
different measures of productivity and income (e.g., per capita GDP, human capital, share of agriculture,
institutional indicators) in a cross-country panel-data
700
framework.2 Using the USD wage as a cost-based

that an undervaluation of as large as 50 percent

GDP (percapita, PPP, USD, log)
The Funds’ standardized CGER exercise also
suggests that the undervaluation of the Ruble is
narrowing, and that the currency is approaching its equilibrium value. Current estimates indicate that the
extent of undervaluation ranges from 0-20 percent.3 More specifically, the equilibrium exchange-rate
approach agrees with staff’s own finding that the ruble is now broadly line with Russia fundamentals,
finding that the currency is overvalued by only about 2 percent. Alternatively, CGER’s externalsustainability approach finds that the currency is undervalued by 21 percent, implying that, presently,
Russia could absorb further appreciation and run a reduced current-account surplus without necessarily
leading to a worsening of its underlying net international investment position (NIIP). Currently, staff
estimates suggest that Russia is an overall creditor, and that net assets are expanding rapidly. The
macroeconomic balance approach, suggests that the currency is undervalued by 2 percent. This estimate
is based on a medium-term current-account norm for Russia of 2.6 percent of GDP, which is in line with
an estimated underlying current account balance of 3.1 percent of GDP in 2007. The latter is derived from
the projected medium-term current account deficit after stripping away cyclical and temporary factors, and
taking into account a real appreciation of about one-third. This real appreciation would lower the
estimated underlying current account balance in 2013. Russia is still transitioning to a new, more marketbased economy, and therefore the estimated current-account norm is expected to change; as Russia’s
business environment improves, investment opportunities will increase, reducing the current account
norm. In addition, projected real appreciation in the base line is considered to be an equilibrium response
to increased productivity, and owing to Balassa-Samuelson effects should not adversely impact
competitiveness

Staff estimates are based on an update of the model presented in Krajnyák and Zettlemeyer (IMF Staff Papers,
Vol.45), and subsequently applied in Ukraine (Country Report 05/20) and Romania (Country Report 06/169).

3

These figures are from the most recent CGER exercise in February 2008. Updated figures are not yet
available, but a 5-percent real appreciation over the past few months suggest that this range may now be around
+5 to -15 percent.

Import growth is driving a rapid
increase in the non-oil current
account deficit. Reflecting the
acceleration in domestic demand
growth in the face of tightening
resource constraints, import volume
growth continues to rise rapidly and is
now running at an annual rate of
almost 30 percent. This, and the
stagnation in oil export volumes
since 2005, had until recently resulted
in a notable decline in the headline
current-account surplus, but this
decline has been reversed, for now, by
a renewed surge in oil prices. The
current account balance in the year
through March 2008 was 6.6 percent
of GDP, up from a surplus of
6.1 percent of GDP in 2007.
Capital inflows declined initially
following the onset of the global
financial turmoil, but are now
recovering. The increase in spreads
following the turmoil led to a general
delay of planned corporate Euro bond
placements. However, the decline in
overall capital inflows was mitigated
by continued Euro bond issuances by a
few state-dominated energy companies
and banks; by increased recourse to the
syndicated loan market, which saw
less of an increase in spreads; by the
continued strength of FDI; and, not
least, by carry-trade inflows, reflecting
the widening differential between
Russian and foreign interest rates and,
in particular, rising expectations of
future ruble appreciation. The initial
turnaround was exacerbated by
exceptionally large inflows prior to the
turmoil, owing to large share issuances
by two state banks and substantial

borrowing by a state oil company to finance purchase of Yukos assets. In recent
months, Russian borrowers have returned to the Euro bond market in force, and
capital inflows have largely recovered to pre-turmoil levels. In this regard, the rise in
spreads has only had a limited impact on interest rates on U.S. dollar denominated
bonds, especially for higher-rated state-owned entities, owing to the decline in dollar
benchmark rates.

Private capital inflows have benefited from a significant reduction in external
vulnerability and low sovereign spreads (Tables 4 and 5). The trend decline in
public-sector indebtedness in recent years has gone hand-in-hand with a sharp
increase in private-sector debt,

overall access to foreign borrowing has
benefited indirectly from Russia’s reduced external vulnerability, low sovereign
spreads are likely to have particularly helped large state-controlled enterprises, not
least in the energy and banking sector, as they are perceived to enjoy implicit
sovereign guarantees (borrowing by such enterprises is classified as private sector
borrowing). The net international position, which was slightly negative in 2006 (6 percent of GDP), is estimated to have turned to balance in 2007.

B. Economic Policies
9.
Fiscal policy is adding to demand pressures. Primary expenditures by the federal
government rose by 15 percent in real terms, and the non-oil deficit—excluding a one-off
collection of tax arrears from Yukos—rose by 0.8 percent of GDP in 2007, to 4.7 percent of
GDP.4 As spending was heavily back-loaded, fiscal policy provided a particularly strong
stimulus towards the end of the year. The 2008 budget, including the recently proposed
supplement, entails a further notable impulse, as the non-oil deficit of the federal government
is set to increase for the fourth consecutive year, by 0.9 percent of GDP, to 5.6 percent of
GDP.

4

The non-oil balance is adjusted for a one-time receipt of tax arrears from Yukos. These payments were
financed by borrowing from abroad.

The fixed exchange rate policy continues to cause a lax monetary stance. In
defense of the de facto peg, strong capital inflows have required equally-large unsterilized
interventions in the foreign-exchange market, which have in turn translated into excess
liquidity in the banking system. Indeed, the interbank market was extremely liquid on the eve
of the global financial turmoil. This reflected the bank IPOs and Yukos-related auctions in
the first half of 2007, which resulted in substantial inflows and a dramatic surge in banks’
excess reserves with the CBR. Following the onset of the turmoil in the second half of the
year, therefore, this existing pool of reserves provided a significant cushion for the banking
system as a whole, offsetting the impact of lower inflows on domestic liquidity. In addition,
given Russia’s fragmented interbank market and concerns that some smaller banks might run
into liquidity difficulties, the CBR quickly stepped up its repo operations and broadened its
list of eligible collateral for liquidity support when money market rates began to rise (Box 2).
At present, Russia’s banking system remains comfortably liquid, overnight interbank rates
are at the lower end of the usual trading range, and CBR repo operations have been scaled
back sharply. Recent CBR efforts to tighten monetary conditions, by raising interest rates and
reserve requirements, will have only marginal impact on liquidity conditions.

Box 2. Liquidity Support Measures, 2007–08
Over the past 9 months, the CBR has taken various steps to address liquidity pressures
arising in large part from fluctuations in capital inflows following the onset of the global
financial turmoil.
•
The “Lombard list” of eligible collateral (the list of securities used for repo
operations) was expanded by reducing the minimum acceptable rating to B+/B1.
This is estimated to have provided access to an additional 160 billion rubles
(US$6 billion) in support.
•
Average haircuts on collateral were lowered from 19 percent to 10 percent.
•
All required reserve ratios were reduced temporarily by 100 bps, for a term of
three months (October 11, 2007–January 14, 2008). This is estimated to have
provided an additional 100 billion rubles (US$4 billion) in support.
•
The currency swap rate reduced from 10 percent to 8 percent, aligning it with the
overnight direct repo and Lombard rates.
•
A six-month term-lending facility, collateralized with bank loans, was tapped for
the first time by a few banks (it had been available since 2005, but never
exercised).
•
The list of eligible collateral was further extended in February 2008 to include
Eurobonds of Russian corporates, not traded publicly in Russia.
•
An end-year surge in government spending also helped ease liquidity, including
the capitalization of Russia’s new development institutions.
•
Starting in April, 2008, the government has offered to recycle a limited portion of
its cash surplus, via a weekly series of one-month deposit auctions.

Real interest rates have become
increasingly negative, credit growth has
remained very strong, and remonetization
has begun to slow. Real interest deposit
rates have declined to minus 8 percent and
average real lending rates to minus 4 percent.
In line with this, credit has continued to
expand at more than 50 percent year-on-year,
and there is evidence that the decline in
velocity is starting to slow. With still very
limited demand for long-term ruble
denominated assets, and with the global
financial turmoil giving rise to concern about
the availability of long-term foreign financing,
private-sector calls for the government to
place part of the stabilization fund’s assets
with the domestic banking system have been
increasing.

significant real exchange rate appreciation in
the offing, leakage through the balance of payments is expected to increase. In view of this,
and taking into account base-effects, real GDP growth is expected to ease slightly in 2008, to
7¾ percent. Reflecting a considerable moderation in the terms-of-trade gains and a slightly
lower fiscal impulse, growth is projected to slow further in 2009, to about 7¼ percent. This is
still above estimated potential growth of about 6 percent. The unwinding of the headline
surplus in the current account will revert temporarily in 2008 as a result of the very sharp
recent increase in the terms-of-trade, before resuming in 2009. The non-energy current
account deficit is projected to deteriorate further, albeit modestly, from 10.8 percent in 2007
to 11.9 percent in 2009.
13.
The risks to growth are broadly balanced in the near term. The outlook for oil
prices is favorable and any impact from a decline will be largely absorbed by the automatic
stabilizers built into the oil stabilization fund—which absorbs almost 85 percent of the
change in revenues associated with changes in oil prices. The risk of a rapid unwinding of the
large capital account surplus appears to have largely subsided with Russia continuing to
weather the global financial turmoil relatively well. Indeed, it is possible that capital inflows
will be stronger than in staff’s baseline scenario. Looking beyond the next 6–12 months, the
main downside risk to GDP growth stems—in staff’s view—from the consequences of
leaving inflation unchecked and the attendant possibility that monetary policy would have to
be tightened significantly to bring inflation back under control.
14.
Inflationary pressures are likely to remain strong. With strong growth and little
remaining spare capacity, inflation is set to exceed the revised official end-year target of
10.5 percent by a wide margin in 2008.5 Pressures on headline CPI inflation will likely ease
somewhat in the second half of the year, as food price inflation moderates owing to a base
effect from the second half of 2007. However, under the current mix of procyclical fiscal and
accommodative monetary policies, there is a risk that domestically generated pressures could

17
increase, especially if the economy is buffeted by additional external price and demand
shocks. All in all, staff projects inflation to be 14.1 percent by the end of 2008.
15.
The key medium-term challenge is to avoid a policy-induced overshooting of the
real exchange rate and the current account. With strong domestic demand causing imports
to outpace exports by a wide margin, there is a risk of overshooting, especially in light of the
procyclical fiscal stance. Under the staff’s base-line medium-term scenario, which is based
on announced fiscal policies and assumes a continuation of the fixed exchange rate policy,
overshooting of the real effective exchange rate and the current account is avoided, but this
depends critically on the government avoiding a procyclical fiscal stance, by adhering to the
ceilings in the medium-term fiscal framework—which entails a gradual decline in the non-oil
deficit starting in 2010 (Table 9). It also depends on the assumption that a reinvigoration of
structural reforms will enable Russia to continue to realize considerable catch-up gains in
productivity in the coming years. However, considering the recent experience, there is a risk
that a prolonged period of above-trend oil prices might further weaken spending discipline in
coming years and cause a continuation of procyclical fiscal policy. Staff’s alternative
medium-term scenario shows that, in the absence of medium-term fiscal consolidation, the
real effective exchange rate and the current account balance are likely to overshoot their
equilibrium paths (Table 10). This also points to a heightened risk of being forced to
implement a procyclical fiscal tightening in the event of a sharp drop in oil prices in the
future.
IV. THE POLICY RESPONSE
16.
Against this background, the key economic policy issues confronting the Russian
economy are how to (a) respond to the sharp rise in inflation, (b) avert the medium-term risk
of the exchange rate overshooting its equilibrium path, and (c) address the vulnerabilities in
the financial sector.
A. Fiscal Policy
17.
Further fiscal relaxation is in store for 2008. The government has proposed a
supplementary budget of 0.3 percent

cyclical relaxation at a time when
demand pressures are already strong
would increase pressures on prices and the ruble. In this regard, they were concerned that
calls for higher spending were mounting, not least because of the swelling of the oil
stabilization fund. Overall, however, they felt that the incremental inflationary pressures

18
would be manageable. Officials of the Ministry of Economy, who considered the economy
not to be at risk of overheating at this juncture, did not feel that the ongoing fiscal relaxation
would add to inflationary pressures.
18.
Looking to 2009 and beyond, Ministry of Finance officials expect the demand on
public sector resources to increase as a result of important reforms. In particular, the
need to overcome serious infrastructure bottlenecks, improve the quality of public health
service, and support pension reform will require substantial additional resources. However,
while mobilizing the needed funds for such spending, Ministry of Finance officials felt that it
would be important to adhere to the ceilings in the medium-term framework. The non-oil
deficit was set to decline from 6.8 percent of GDP in 2008 to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2011.
Taking into account the government’s revenue and GDP projections, this implies a reduction
in total spending by the federal government from 17.9 percent of GDP in 2008 to
16.6 percent of GDP in 2011 (Table 7). Other officials questioned these ceilings as they were
generally less concerned about the inflationary effect of higher public spending, arguing that
higher expenditure on infrastructure and structural reforms was necessary to boost Russia’s
long-run growth potential.
19.
Staff warned against further pro-cyclical fiscal stimulus. It noted that, while
the 2008 supplementary budget was relatively small, it entailed an additional fiscal impulse
at a time when policy should ideally be withdrawing stimulus. Staff urged the authorities to
reconsider the proposed supplementary budget, save any revenues above budgeted amounts,
and underexecute the 2008 budget to the extent possible, as in previous years. For 2009, staff
stressed that fiscal policy should aim to provide a counter-cyclical stimulus, but that, as a
second best, the authorities should avoid a further 0.7 percent increase in the non-oil deficit,
as implied by the approved medium-term budget.6
20.
Further fiscal relaxation over the medium term would heighten the risk of
exchange-rate overshooting. Staff stressed that absent a slowdown in domestic demand
growth, upward pressures on the real effective exchange rate will persist and import growth
will remain high. Staff, therefore, agreed with the Ministry of Finance that the ceilings in the
medium-term budget should not be relaxed and that room should be created within the
ceilings to accommodate higher spending on reforms and infrastructure. Staff noted that, in
judging the impact of these projects, it is important to take into account that their impact on
GDP growth will be slow in coming and that they, therefore, should not be expected to
provide an immediate respite from resource constraints.
21.
Calls for a reduction in the general VAT rate or its outright elimination have
intensified. Officials at the Ministry of Economy felt that the VAT led to distortions,
6

on the IMF staff classification of non-oil revenue.

19
hampering in particular exports and investments, and that it was too susceptible to fraud.
While details remained to be worked out, they suggested a unification of the general and
special rates at 12 percent, close to the estimated effective VAT rate of 11.4 percent.7 They
were confident that such a proposal would not entail a major revenue loss as it would
increase the tax base by reducing incentives for tax evasion. This proposal was not supported
by officials of the Ministry of Finance. While VAT administration should be improved—in
particular the long delays in the payment of refunds—they saw no case for significant
changes in the VAT, which was the least distortionary tax. Stressing that tax reform should
be revenue neutral at this juncture, they argued that the focus should be on the corporate
income tax. Staff supported the Ministry of Finance in its opposition to the proposed changes
in the VAT and agreed with its priorities for tax reform. It urged the Ministry of Finance to
take immediate steps to overcome the long delays in VAT refunds and noted that its
calculations suggested that unification of VAT rates at 16 percent, combined with the
elimination of exemptions, would be broadly revenue neutral.
22.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to a good governance and
transparency as far as the management of Russia’s sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) is
concerned. Russia currently has two SWFs after the former oil stabilization fund was split
into the Reserve Fund (RF) and the National Welfare Fund (NWF) in early 2008. The RF is
capped at the equivalent of 10 percent of GDP and is invested (like the former stabilization
fund) in liquid, triple A, sovereign or quasi-sovereign securities. The resources in the NWF
will eventually be invested in somewhat more risky and longer-term assets than the RF; the
NWF’s investment strategy and risk management framework is still under consideration, and,
its resources will remain invested in more liquid assets in the meantime. The authorities
stressed they intend to follow the generally accepted principles and practices for sovereign
wealth funds that are now being developed by the International Working Group of Sovereign
Wealth Funds (IWG) with Russia’s participation. Staff underscored the importance of
Russia’s active participation in the IWG.
B. Monetary Policy
23.
CBR officials were confident that the rise in inflation could be reversed without
a more flexible exchange-rate policy. Although they believed that the revised official end2008 target of 10½ percent would be difficult to attain, they nonetheless considered that
headline inflation would peak within the next few months and would decline significantly,
reaching a low double-digit level by the end of the year. In this regard, they pointed out that:
(i) the rate of broad-money growth had slowed over the first quarter of 2008, which would
help curb inflationary pressures by the third quarter; (ii) recent measures to raise interest rates
7

Currently, the general VAT rate is 18 percent and the special rate is 10 percent. Staff estimates of the effective
VAT rate indicate that it increased from 11.4 percent in 2006 to 11.7 percent in 2007 (excluding one-off
revenues from Yukos).

20
and reserve requirements would start to have an impact at around the same time; and (iii)
global food-price inflation was expected to ease substantially over the second half of 2008.
As for 2009, on the assumption of lower oil prices and continued strong import growth, an
expected drop in currency inflows would ease upward pressure on the exchange rate,
removing the need for continued large-scale liquidity injections through the foreign-exchange
window. Also, CBR officials reaffirmed that they stood ready to raise reserve requirements
more aggressively, in the event that banks were more liquid than deemed desirable.
24.
Nonetheless, as part of their transition to inflation targeting, exchange rate
flexibility would gradually increase over time. For the time being, the CBR would
maintain tight control over the level of the currency basket. However, rather than intervening
only at the edges of the bid-ask band, the CBR was also buying predetermined amounts of
foreign exchange within the band. The immediate impact would be to add an element of dayto-day uncertainty, and so help discourage excessive speculation. Over the longer-run, as the
pace of inflows slowed, a progressive widening of the band would allow a gradual step-bystep transition to a more freely-floating exchange-rate, and ultimately to an inflationtargeting framework. In this regard, the authorities confirmed their intention to move to
inflation targeting within three years.
25.
Staff advocated substantially more exchange-rate flexibility. It stressed that: (i)
the current slowdown in money growth largely reflected a base effect from early 2007; (ii)
recent efforts to tighten interest rates and reserve requirements had been marginal, and by
themselves would have little material impact on inflation or inflationary expectations; and
(iii) the prospects for a decline in inflation over 2008 depended largely on a hoped-for, but
still uncertain, slowdown in external food-price inflation. Looking further ahead, with a
procyclical fiscal relaxation in the pipeline, and with an apparent revival of capital inflows,
staff cautioned that it would be a mistake to delay monetary tightening on the assumption
that an unwinding of the current account surplus would ease appreciation pressures, thereby
reducing the need for intervention. On the contrary, upward pressures on the currency would
remain high, as long as buoyant private demand and an expansionary fiscal policy maintained
GDP growth above potential. In this context, given the strength of Russia’s economy relative
to those of the United States and European Union, the de facto basket peg would become
increasingly unsustainable, and it was thus a matter of urgency that the authorities should
relax the peg and be able to set monetary policy independently, with a view to inflationary
conditions in Russia. More generally, staff was concerned that, under current policies,
Russia’s inflationary path would continue to be largely determined by external events over
which the CBR had no control.
26.
Staff agreed that an immediate move to formal inflation targeting may be
somewhat premature at this stage. But this did not preclude a more aggressive, less-formal
focus on inflation. Moreover, it was noted that, from the experience of other central banks, it
was not necessary to meet a stringent set of sophisticated preconditions before adopting the
new framework. Instead, the key to success is an independent central bank—one that can

21
credibly commit to placing inflation ahead of other objectives. In this regard, to help anchor
expectations, the CBR was encouraged to strengthen its communications strategy: providing
a realistic assessment of current trends, clearly outlining its thinking and intentions, and
demonstrating how its policy measures will bring prices back into line. At this stage, that
would entail explaining that the end-year inflation target for 2008 would likely be missed,
and would also entail outlining measures to bring inflation back on target by end-2009.
C. Financial Sector Issues
27.
There was agreement that the Russian banking system was weathering turmoil
in global capital markets well. The authorities confirmed that no bank has required direct
support from the CBR—a few banks that relied heavily on foreign funding had faced
increased strain, but these institutions have been able to restructure their balance sheets
without much difficulty. Overall the banking system has proved reassuringly resilient, and
depositor confidence remained high. Looking forward, the central bank has engaged in a
close dialogue with Russian banks since September, focusing in particular on their
contingency plans against a prolonged period of uncertainty. Refinancing requirements over
the near term are not seen to present a problem, and banks appear to be well prepared for the
next peak in repayments in the third quarter of 2008. Even in the event of protracted global
turmoil, any individual difficulties would likely be dealt with easily by further capital
injections, or possible consolidation. The authorities stressed that banking was still an
attractive and expanding business in Russia, and that local owners could provide substantial
additional funding if needed.
28.
Nonetheless, many financial vulnerabilities remain. In view of extremely rapid
credit growth, negative real funding costs, and a competitive focus on market share,
discussions focused on the concern that Russian banks’ may face limited incentives to
prudently assess and manage risk. In the context of rising inflationary pressures, staff
highlighted in particular concerns as to the potential impact of a sharp monetary tightening.
The views of market participants and the authorities on this issue were mixed. Some
considered that Russian banks, given their strong cash flows and high margins, would adapt
to a new higher-cost environment without much difficulty. Others stressed that a significant
increase in interest rates to positive real levels, for both deposit and lending rates, might take
a more serious toll.
29.
In this context, staff stressed the importance of following up on the
recommendations of the recent update of Russia’s Financial System Stability
Assessment (FSSA). The FSSA had found that, although the financial system and regulatory
framework has strengthened, the system still faces notable risks (Box 3). The main near-term
challenge is credit risk. Moreover, the update indicated that banks’ resilience may be less
than suggested by reported data and that, given the fragmented interbank market, liquidity
risk might continue to present a problem in the event that private confidence weakens or
foreign appetite for Russian exposure declines. In this regard, the update recommended that
the authorities: strengthen loan classification and provisioning practices; enhance the CBR’s

22
tools for managing interbank liquidity; and strengthen the framework for resolving problem
banks at an early stage.
30.
The authorities concurred with most of the findings of the FSAP update (Box 3).
They disagreed, however, with the suggestion that loan classification and provisioning
practices in Russia were problematic. They argued that CBR methodology and supervisory
practice in this area is now more advanced, and more conservative, than it had been 4–5
years ago. The existing system worked adequately, and it was not clear that the FSAP
recommendations would improve the situation in practice. The authorities agreed, however,
on the importance of consolidated supervision, and noted that this would be a future priority.
D. Structural Reform and Long-Term Growth
31.
There was agreement that Russia’s long-run growth prospects hinge on higher
investment. The authorities shared the staff’s analysis that increases in capacity utilization
and productivity have been the main sources of potential GDP growth in recent years, but
that, with the economy virtually at full capacity, room for further increases in capital and
labor utilization rates is very limited. Officials at the Ministry of Economy acknowledged
that, while productivity growth may remain high for several more years, it will eventually
slow as the scope for easy catch-up gains begins to wane. Against this background and
because the contribution from labor force growth will remain limited, owing to Russia’s
ageing population, they felt that the key to sustaining strong potential growth was higher
investment.
32.
To boost investment the new government is focusing on improving
infrastructure and the investment climate. The government is proposing increases in
infrastructure spending, including through public-private partnerships, to address severe
bottlenecks that are hampering long-run growth prospects. Moreover, President Medvedev
has made a stronger investment climate a key priority and this will be reflected in the
government’s long-term development strategy. The broad objectives under consideration
include strengthening the judiciary and tackling corruption, as well as a reinvigoration of
reform of the civil service and public administration. Action plans in these areas will be
decided in the coming months.
33.
Social sector reforms have also become a policy priority. The authorities noted
that the key reforms in this area are improving the quality of education and the health system,
and strengthening the public pension system. They stressed that the latter reform was
particularly pressing as the current replacement rate of 24 percent—which is already far
below the lowest rate among OECD countries—is projected to decline to 17 percent by 2027
under current policies. Plans in these areas would also be finalized in the coming months.

23
Box 3. Key Conclusions of the 2007 FSAP Update
The FSAP update found that Russia’s financial system has strengthened since the original
assessment in 2003. This is a reflection of favorable economic conditions, growing confidence in the
financial system, and a stronger legal and regulatory framework.
Nonetheless, the banking system still faces important risks.
•

The chief issue is credit risk, which reflects Russia’s rapid lending growth, especially to
households. This is a high-risk segment owing to a combination of limited information on
household borrowers, on the one hand, and banks’ untested risk-management systems, on the
other. In such an environment there is a danger that rapid credit expansion may conceal an
unrecognized deterioration in asset quality. Also important is liquidity risk. Despite an
expanding range of funding options, this is a concern for banks with limited or no access to the
interbank market—these are typically smaller banks with a limited deposit base that could face
problems if confidence weakens or foreign appetite for Russian exposure declines.

•

Market risk is less of a concern. Although exposure has risen in some banks, with increased
holding of securities, these remain small relative to risk-weighted capital. Currency risk is also
limited. Banks maintain long open positions in foreign exchange, but unhedged positions are
relatively small, so exposure is modest. Interest rate risk is potentially significant for some
banks, but data limitations have prevented a detailed analysis in this area.

The update found that banks’ resilience may be less than suggested by reported financial data.
Capital ratios have fallen since 2003 as a result of strong asset growth, and reported capital appears to be
overstated because of weaknesses in loan classification and provisioning—the adoption of more prudent
provisioning would decrease capital by as much as 50 percent.
There is still scope for further strengthening of the financial system.
•

The CBR’s monitoring of systemic risk has improved, but internal coordination should be
strengthened.

•

The bank-resolution framework has been effective so far, but may face difficulties resolving
medium-sized banks. The CBR lacks the authority to intervene at an early stage so as to
minimize the cost of resolution and the disruption to creditors, including depositors.

•

The regulatory and legal framework for capital markets has been fortified, but significant
challenges remain in the rapidly expanding insurance sector.

•

Implementation of Russian and international accounting and auditing standards is improving.
However, additional measures are needed, including approval of new laws on consolidation,
accounting, and auditing.

•

Despite a dramatic expansion in recent years, the equity market remains highly concentrated in
the ten largest companies.

•

The FSAP update also concluded that the turmoil in global financial markets did not pose an
immediate systemic threat to the banking system, but problems could arise if current conditions
persist. With shallow domestic capital markets and retail deposits concentrated in the largest
state bank, a prolonged period of limited access to foreign borrowing would further increase
funding costs, exposing some banks to refinancing difficulties, and compressing profitability
across the banking sector. Thus far, the banking system has shown considerable resilience,
helped in part by strong cash flows and large liquidity injections by the central bank.

24
34.
Staff supported the government’s reform priorities and welcomed the focus on
raising investment. It agreed that the key to higher investment is improvements in
infrastructure and reforms to strengthen the business climate. It noted, however, that
implementation of reform plans had stalled in may areas in recent years. While
acknowledging the challenge to secure broad political support at a time when strong growth
and high oil prices may cause complacency about the urgency of reforms, staff urged the
authorities to take advantage of the new government’s coming into office to advance
implementation of reforms. It stressed that with reform plans well-advanced in many areas,
early implementation should be feasible. Staff also called for measures to ensure greater
investment in the oil and gas sector and, in this regard, welcomed the planned reduction in
the mineral extraction tax and the step-wise liberalization of domestic gas prices. On social
sector reforms, staff agreed with the urgency of pension reform and noted that its estimates
showed that maintaining the replacement rate at its current level would require additional
annual transfers to the pension fund averaging 1½ percent of GDP over 2008 to 2050.
35.
The authorities expected Russia to be able to join the WTO by early 2009. They
noted that progress is being made in addressing the remaining outstanding issues, which
include export duties on timber, the treatment of state-trading companies, and budget support
for agriculture. Staff stressed the importance of early accession to the WTO as it would as it
would serve as a catalyst to strengthen change. It welcomed the expiration of the prohibitive
export taxes on wheat and other grains as of July 1, 2008 and urged the authorities to refrain
from new measures that would limit international trade in food staples.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Russia’s economic expansion is gaining strength. Soaring oil prices, large capital
inflows, and rapid financial deepening are providing the impetus for a virtuous circle of
strong growth in investment, productivity, real incomes and consumption. Momentum is
being boosted further by high returns on investment owing to the scarcity of capital; by
continued scope for catch-up gains in productivity, not least by reallocating existing factors
of production to more productive sectors; and by the still low financial leverage. Thus, while
the commodity price boom remains an important propellant of economic growth, the strength
of investment is increasingly underpinned by other, endogenous factors, suggesting that the
economic expansion is becoming more resilient.
37.
The recovery owes much to prudent management of oil revenues. The ruble has
appreciated steadily in real terms, but this is unavoidable, indeed desirable, in view of
Russia’s large terms-of-trade and productivity gains. As to be expected, growth is led by
nontradable sectors, but there are no strong signs so far that the tradable sector has become
uncompetitive, although margins have been reduced. Crucial in this regard has been the
policy of saving most of Russia’s oil revenue windfall in the stabilization fund, which has
prevented excessive real appreciation. With the budget balanced at an oil price of less than
half the current world market prices, and with close to 85 percent of marginal earnings
absorbed by the stabilization fund, Russia is indeed well protected against even a sharp drop

25
in oil prices. This is another aspect of the recovery’s resilience often overlooked by the
contention that Russia’s success is merely an oil story.
38.
But the risk of overheating is rising owing to an expansionary macroeconomic
policy mix. Despite the economy’s strong supply response, inflation now extends well
beyond what can be explained by global increases in food and energy prices, which is not
surprising considering that domestic demand has been booming at unsustainable annual rate
of 15 percent in real terms. However, rather than reducing demand pressures, procyclical
fiscal policy and an exchange rate policy geared towards resisting appreciation through
unsterilized interventions are exacerbating such pressures. For a number of years, this policy
mix has made it difficult for the authorities to bring down inflation decisively, despite the
benefits of rapid remonetization and large productivity gains. Now, it is undermining their
ability to arrest and reverse rapidly increasing inflation as the economy is being jolted by
imported food price shocks, sharply accelerating domestic demand, and monetary easing
abroad.
39.
The policy mix leaves Russia exposed to the risk of inflation being buffeted by
future external developments beyond the authorities’ control. The targeted reduction in
headline inflation by end-2008 hinges mostly on a possible, but uncertain, deceleration in the
growth of global food prices. Similarly, the assumed reduction in inflation next year depends
to a large extent on the assumption that an unwinding of the current account surplus—
because of lower oil prices and continued rapid import volume growth—will begin to reduce
pressures on the ruble and, therefore, the need for unsterilized interventions. But such
pressures will remain high, even as the current account swings into a deficit over the medium
term, as long as buoyant private demand and procyclical fiscal policy maintain GDP growth
above potential. There is thus a need for a stronger monetary tightening and a more prudent
fiscal stance aimed at containing domestically generated inflationary pressures.
40.
Monetary tightening will require greater exchange rate flexibility. The policy of
pegging the ruble to a dollar-euro basket is becoming increasingly inflationary, as Russia’s
cyclical position continues to strengthen relative to that of the U.S. and the euro area. With
the liberalization of capital controls, exchange rate flexibility is likely to be unavoidable in
order to ensure an independent monetary policy, calibrated with a view to inflationary
pressures in Russia. In this regard, raising reserve requirements is not a sustainable substitute
for exchange rate flexibility, in part because this instrument will encourage financial
disintermediation if used too aggressively. Meanwhile, the increasing tensions between the
authorities’ inflation and exchange rate targets is exacerbating capital inflows, as the market
expects that the latter will eventually give way to the former. Scaling back interventions and
permitting ruble appreciation is necessary not only in order to set inflation on a sustained
downward path, but also to guard against the risk that further exogenous shocks feed into
additional price increases. And doing so soon would reduce the risk of higher inflation
expectations getting entrenched.

26
41.
Additional fiscal stimulus should be avoided. While the bulk of oil and gas taxes
are still being saved, the steady increase in the non-oil deficit has entailed adding stimulus
just as private demand has become more buoyant. This procyclical fiscal stance shifts more
of the burden of demand management onto a monetary policy already somewhat hamstrung
by political and social resistance to appreciation. And with little evidence of broad support
for substantially greater exchange-rate flexibility, this further unbalancing of the
macroeconomic policy mix will most likely increase inflationary pressures in the near term.
In view of this, the authorities are best advised to prevent a further increase in the non-oil
deficit in 2008–09, suggesting that the decision to supplement the 2008 budget should be
reconsidered.
42.
Continued procyclical policy is a threat to competitiveness. While staff estimates
suggest that the ruble is approaching its equilibrium level, margins have been reduced in as
much as the ruble has steadily become less undervalued. This points to the risk that a
continuation of the increase in the non-oil fiscal deficit, in face of very buoyant domestic
demand, could cause the real exchange rate and the external current account deficit to
overshoot their equilibrium levels. Under the assumption that the authorities will adhere to
their plans for a reduction in the non-oil deficit from 2010, staff believes that the ruble will
remain within its equilibrium range over the medium term, despite the still relatively fast real
appreciation expected over 2008–09. Failure to adhere to these plans would, however, most
likely prompt the ruble to overshoot its equilibrium path, as would the slowdown in
productivity growth that would likely result over the medium term if reforms were not
reinvigorated as planned.
43.
Vulnerabilities in the financial sector remain a concern. The sector has weathered
the recent global financial turmoil well and it is encouraging that both CBR officials and
leaders of key financial institutions are confident about its ability to withstand further
turmoil. This is in line with the finding of the FSAP update that the financial system,
including the regulatory and supervisory system, has strengthened significantly since the
original FSAP. But this progress notwithstanding, concerns remain that, after years of
negative real interest rates and extremely fast lending growth, a significant increase in real
interest rates, in the event that the CBR is forced to undertake a sharp monetary tightening
would take a significant toll on the banking system. It should accordingly be a priority to
further improve the regulatory and prudential framework as recommended by the FSAP
update. Most importantly, loan classification and provisioning standards should be
strengthened and legal amendments should be finalized to allow effective consolidated
supervision.
44.
The government’s focus on improving the investment climate is most welcome.
Raising investment is key to sustaining strong potential GDP growth in Russia, and will need
to be supported by the elimination of infrastructure bottlenecks and the promotion of a
favorable investment climate. The broad outline of the government’s long-term development
strategy and policy priorities are encouraging, and are appropriately focused on strengthening

27
the judiciary and tackling corruption. Plans to reinvigorate reform of the civil service and
public administration are also important for the investment climate. In several of these areas,
plans have been well-advanced for some time, which should make early implementation
feasible.
45.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Exchange Arrangements: The de jure arrangement is a managed float with no
pre-determined path for the exchange rate. The Central Bank of the Russian
Federation (CBR) sets and announces the official exchange rates of foreign
currencies against the ruble on a daily basis. These rates are based on ruble quotes
against the dollar on the internal foreign exchange market and on quotes of other
foreign currencies against the dollar on the global exchange market. The CBR
intervenes in both interbank currency exchanges and the over-the-counter
interbank market to limit fluctuations in the exchange rate of the ruble against a
basket of the euro and dollar in the short run. The dollar is the main intervention
currency. As a result of the stability of the ruble against the euro-dollar basket, the
de facto exchange rate arrangement of Russia will be changed, with a starting date
of February 1, 2006, from managed floating with no predetermined path for the
exchange rate to a conventional fixed peg to a composite.

3
The Russian Federation accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement with effect from June 1, 1996, and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for currents international transactions.

ANNEX II. RUSSIAN FEDERATION: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
1.
World Bank Group activities in Russia are guided by the recent three-year Country
Partnership Strategy (FY07–09) which was endorsed by the Bank’s Board in
December 2006. The CPS reflects a strong commitment by both the World Bank Group and
the Russian government to continue a close and productive relationship that is suitable to
Russia’s new conditions. While the federal government no longer needs the financial support
of the World Bank, it still values highly World Bank knowledge, experience, and project
management skills. New borrowing by the federal government will be limited over the period
of this CPS, whereas the use of guarantees, sub-national borrowing and new fee-for-service
arrangements for investment and policy advice are likely to grow. Given substantial
developmental challenges in a large number of Russian regions, the federal government has
encouraged the Bank Group to deepen its direct involvement in the regions. Correspondingly,
a central theme of the CPS is the focus of Bank Group activities in select regions, including
economic analysis (growth and business environment diagnostics), regional development
strategies, and related investment projects. IFC and MIGA operations will remain substantial
(Russia is IFC’s and MIGA’s largest exposure). The successful full transition to new
modalities of cooperation with the Russian government will involve increased coordination
among IBRD, IFC and MIGA.
2.
The CPS envisions a partnership with the Russian government for the realization of
four primary objectives: (a) sustaining rapid growth, (b) improving public sector
management and performance, (c) improving the delivery of social services, and (d)
enhancing Russia’s global role. The first three pillars correspond closely to the pillars of the
previous Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and channel support directly toward the
development challenges and policies elaborated in the government’s Medium-Term
Economic Program, with a particular focus on the regions. The fourth pillar forms the basis
for a new area of assistance, and concerns Russia’s integration in the world economy and
donor community.
Major areas of Bank Group activities by CPS strategic pillars
(a) Sustaining rapid growth
3.
The World Bank Group will assist Russia in various ways in meeting the challenges
of sustaining rapid growth, including participation in macro-policy debates, monitoring the
investment climate, supporting public investment and PPPs for growth and diversification,
working with regions to identify and overcome barriers to growth, supporting investments in
priority areas at the regional level, and providing direct assistance to the private sector:
•

Macroeconomic policy, long-term fiscal sustainability, and the effective management
of Russia’s large external inflows: The Bank will contribute to the macro-policy
debate in Russia through the periodic Russian Economic Reports, on-demand policy
notes and knowledge sharing. Advisory services can include training and impact
monitoring activities related to WTO accession. In addition, there is strong interest in

5
the Bank’s technical assistance in advising on alternative uses for the windfall oil
revenues, including the development of an institutional framework for the effective
management of a growing diversified portfolio of foreign assets. The Bank is also
preparing a larger study on long-term fiscal risks and fiscal sustainability. In
April 2008, the Bank of Russia and World Bank Treasury formally signed a fee-based
services agreement whereby Treasury will provide technical support in internal
investment management capacity for a period of 3 to 4 years.
•

Investment climate monitoring and policy advice: The Bank will continue periodic
business environment and enterprise performance (BEEPS) surveys, regional
investment climate assessments, and administrative barriers studies undertaken by
FIAS for interested regions. The Bank and MIGA can work at the regional level on
capacity building and the development of investment promotion programs for
attracting FDI, similar to the initiative currently underway in Rostov Region. WBI
will continue capacity-building activities related to investment climate assessments.

•

Supporting energy efficiency. The World Bank jointly with the IFC is currently
preparing a study on energy efficiency, which is designed to provide senior Russian
policymakers with a comprehensive and practical analysis of energy efficiency issues
in Russia, its potential, benefits, and policy recommendations.

•

Supporting Government investment and public-private partnerships (PPPs) for
growth and diversification: On-going investment projects support land registration
and the development of a national cadastre for securing property rights and the
development of land markets. Possible partial risk guarantees of the Bank to the
power sector could help attract investment to the electricity sector for modernization
and substantial increases in capacity. In addition, regular and reimbursable TAs are
now being provided to support development of PPPs across sectors. In particular, the
largest Bank’s fee-for-service portfolio belongs to the City of St. Petersburg and
includes such prominent PPP infrastructure projects as Western High Speed
Diameter, Orlovsky tunnel, NADEX and Pulkovo airport. The Bank would also work
with Russia's Development Bank (VneshEconomBank - VEB) to develop its capacity
to support large-scale PPPs and also possibly to carry out joint PPP projects. Another
area where the Bank is helping the Government to prepare an investment program is
microfinance sector, with focus on financial cooperatives and their integration into
the financial system of the country.

•

Working with regions to identify engines of growth, develop growth strategies, and
remove barriers to growth: The Bank held two major knowledge events on regional
development strategies in early 2008: an early discussion of World Development
Report on regional disparities and its implications for Russia, and Regional
Development Strategies workshop for Russia’s regional governments and other
stakeholders of regional development. In addition, the Bank is finalizing a Country
Economic Memorandum focused on barriers to growth at the sub-national level and

6
on issues of regional agglomerations. The development of fee-for-service
arrangements with the regions would provide another avenue for supporting
preparation of regional investment strategies and growth analyses, and provision of
other analytical services.
•

Supporting investments in priority areas at the regional level: The IFC/Bank SubNational Development Program will support priority regional public investments. The
government is interested in developing this financing mechanism further, as it
involves direct lending to well-performing regions and municipalities without
sovereign guarantees. Three such sub-national operations have been completed to
date, including two in the Chuvash Republic and one in Petropavlosk municipality
(Kamchatka). Infrastructure is also an important area of IFC investments. This
concerns primarily transport and logistics, but also includes municipal infrastructure.
MIGA can play a role in supporting foreign direct investment in infrastructure at the
sub-sovereign level, including in the water and solid waste sectors. Regional
infrastructure projects supported by the Subnational Program is another area where
the Bank and IFC could partner with VEB for joint project preparation and support.

•

Providing direct support to the private sector: IFC will continue to support Russia’s
private sector growth agenda through a combination of financial and advisory
services to promote the growth of the private sector and the diversification of the
Russian economy. IFC will finance projects (1) with important spill-over effects to
other companies, such as infrastructure and financial markets, (2) in sectors where
Russia may have a comparative advantage, for example the processing of natural
resources and those that promote the knowledge economy, and (3) those increasing
the range and quality of products and services available in the Russian market,
particularly outside of Moscow. Much of IFC’s activities will remain concentrated in
the financial sector, where priorities will be: (i) building long-term relationships with
medium-sized independent private regional banks, so as to increase competition and
the range of services available to the population. IFC financing, provided in the form
of long-term senior loans and, in selected cases, subordinated loans, will help to
strengthen the banks’ balance sheets, reach new clients (including SMEs), attract
more depositors, and consolidate their position as leading regional banks; (ii)
supporting the introduction of specialized banking products, including mortgage
financing, consumer finance and leasing; (iii) supporting the process of privatization
of state-owned banks, as and when requested by the Russian Government; and (iv)
supporting development and use of new financial instruments, such as partial
guarantees of local currency bonds and securitization.

•

Continuing IFC advisory work through the Private Enterprise Partnership and FIAS:
This technical assistance will address the following objectives: (a) increasing the
development impact of investments through strengthening local suppliers and
engaging in community development work around large investments; (b) building the
capacity of private banks to deliver new product lines, such as mortgage finance and

7
financing for energy efficiency; and (c) improving corporate governance and
environmental sustainability through work with banks and real sector clients,
including IFC investees. FIAS will continue to work with select regions to improve
the business climate by assisting in implementation of policies/instruments to kickstart functioning markets of land and commercial real estate.
•

MIGA will continue to support foreign investors through the provision of political
risk guarantees: Supporting foreign investment in infrastructure, in close
coordination with the Bank, will remain an important area of MIGA’s activity in
Russia. In the financial sector, the Agency will continue to explore opportunities to
support capital markets transactions, including asset-backed securitizations. MIGA
may also continue to promote the role and assist in the expansion of foreign banks in
the Russian banking sector. Areas for potential further involvement in Russia include
manufacturing, agribusiness and services sectors.

(b) Improving public sector management and performance
4.
Public sector management has been a particular area of strength of World Bank
work in Russia, which will be further deepened in coming years. The Bank will remain
engaged in supporting programs for modernizing selected public sector institutions,
improving government administration, the judiciary, local self-government, and budgetary
management at federal and sub-national levels. The Bank will expand its engagement in
regions in these areas, in accordance with the federal priority for improving public sector
performance at the sub-national level.
•

Modernizing selected public sector institutions: The completion of on-going projects
will contribute to the modernization of public institutions and improved public
services. These include tax modernization, customs development, cadastre and
registration, fiscal federalism, performance-based budgeting, treasury development,
and a statistical development project.

•

Supporting the government program in administrative reform: The Bank will
continue its close engagement with the government in the area of administrative
reform at the federal and sub-national levels, including the coordination and
implementation of substantial donor funds. The primary goal will continue to be
bringing Bank and international expertise to bear on the implementation of the
government’s program for administrative reform, which currently places a strong
emphasis on encouraging initiatives at the sub-national level. So far, the Bank has
concentrated sub-national work in the Southern Federal Okrug and regions in the
North-West. A fee-based advisory service supports Khanti-Mansiysk Okrug-Yugra
on administrative streamlining and establishment of an e-services portal. Similar feebased advisory services may also be developed with other regions. Support for public
administration and governance for selected regions which cannot afford fee-based
services is being provided through a DFID Trust Fund which runs from 2007–10.

8
•

Stepping up engagement on judicial reform: Assistance on judicial reform also
involves the coordination of donor funds and special cooperation at the regional level.
A recently approved project, which complements the 2007–11 Federal Targeted
Program for judicial modernization, supports judicial reform (FY07) with a focus on
improving the efficiency of dispute resolution and the transparency of judicial
functioning. A complementary grant from the Government of Japan will provide
support to Perm Krai and Leningradskaya Oblast on demand-side justice sector issues
such as legal aid to the poor and juvenile justice. In addition, at the request of the
Chairman of the Supreme Commercial Court the Bank plans to partner with it and the
Ministry of Economic Development to support the drafting of framework legislation
to strengthen administrative resolution of disputes and complaints handling, as well as
individual bankruptcy law.

•

Support for budgetary reforms: The Bank will continue to respond to the demands of
the federal and some regional governments for assistance in budgetary reform and the
development of performance-based budgeting. In addition, the Bank will remain a
partner to the government in the continued scaling up of the Fiscal Federalism Project
(now financed by the Russian government) and its expansion to the municipal level.

•

Supporting the reform of local self-government: The Bank will continue its dialogue
with the government in this area, and in brining international experience to bear on
this vital area of reform in Russia. A study has been launched for monitoring and
assisting the development of local-self government in rural areas in the Perm, Penza,
and Adygeya regions. The Bank will seek to engage directly with regions and
municipalities in this area on the basis of new modalities, including a discussion of
replicating the positive experience of the Fiscal Federalism Project model for building
capacity at the municipal level.

•

Investments in municipal development: On-going and possible future regional
projects have significance for overall municipal development and the quality of
municipal services. This includes the completed Kazan Municipal Development
Project and on-going Saint Petersburg Economic Development Project, a Housing
and Communal Services project awaiting for signature (FY09, also see below),
possible regional projects on water and heating system upgrades, and a proposed
Cultural Heritage II project (FY09) aimed to use the cultural heritage and the cultural
heritage tourism as a resource for economical and social development in the
participating regions. The Stavropol pilot Local Initiatives Support project improves
the quality of settlement level social infrastructure and the Bank is working with
Ministry of Regional Development on scaling up the program nationally.

•

Supporting anti-corruption initiatives: As a coherent national-level anti-corruption
program may begin to take shape, the Bank will explore avenues of possible
constructive contributions to such anti-corruption initiatives.

9
(c) Improving the delivery of social and communal services
5.
In addition to continued general cooperation with the federal government, the Bank
will concentrate much of its support for improving social service delivery at the sub-national
level. The Government has prioritized the social sector and social services in its mediumterm program. Given that the primary responsibilities and initiatives for reform in these
services will be at the sub-national level, the Bank will concentrate its focus on the regions.
Main activities include the continuation of work in the areas of poverty, education, and health
in cooperation with the regions. Additional activities include the monitoring of social trends
and service delivery quality (joint with USAID) and special employment-related activities in
the Southern Federal Okrug (the development of decentralized employment services, and
labor integration of youth). Another critical area for improving living standards is provision
of housing and communal services. The government places high importance on improving
the performance of the housing and communal services (HCS) sector and on the delivery of
high quality services by communal enterprises, and closely links service provision with
improving the quality of life.
•

Continuation of the poverty work: In addition to continued cooperation with Rosstat
and federal ministries, the emphasis of the Bank poverty work (in cooperation with
DFID) has moved to the regional level. The Bank is working, and will continue to
work, directly with regions on monitoring poverty and improving social assistance
programs aimed at better targeting. Regional social protection strategies for Tver and
some other regions will be developed with Bank assistance. Successful models of
cooperation can be scaled up to similar regions.

•

Improving the health of the population: The Bank will continue its engagement with
the government on adult health, and the development of a national strategy to
improve the health of the population, with the goal of reversing the strongly negative
trends in premature mortality and morbidity. As a follow up to earlier child welfare
efforts and jointly with international donors the Bank will assist in design and
implementation of practical mechanism for family support, preventive social welfare
and child care at federal and regional level. Additional advocacy, public awareness
and information sharing efforts jointly with government leaders, public figures,
private sector and NGOs will be undertaken in support of critically needed
government policies in this area. Another priority is to advise federal and regional
authorities on appropriate risk pooling, insurance, and sustainable health financing.
IFC will continue working with private companies on programs for occupational
health, including HIV-AIDS issues. The Bank will implement on-going projects in
the health sector and offer to scale up or modify existing models at the sub-national
level as a service to regions. The development of public-private partnerships in the
health sector could be supported jointly by TA from the Bank and direct financing by
IFC to PPPs and/or purely private providers. Lessons from the TB/AIDS project
could be applied through more focused interventions in interested regions through
sub-national projects and TA. A few regional projects could be supported for

10
removing environmental hotspots and addressing other environmental concerns
posing major health risks to population.
•

Modernization and improvement of the education system and vocational training:
The Bank will complete current projects in education designed to modernize the
system and improve vocational training. As is the case of health, the Bank will seek
to meet demands of regions for special support at the sub-national level for education
reform. Regional TA and possible projects could focus on improving systems for
professional and vocational education, accompanied by parallel assessments of local
labor markets with an eye to improving the quality of local professional labor supply.
Another focus could be pre-school education and early childhood education. The
recently completed Youth Strategy by the Bank provides recommendations for
improvements in youth policies, with possible applications to Russia for forwarding
the dialogue on youth policies in the area of education and training.

•

Improvement in the provision of housing and communal services: The Bank’s support
in the infrastructure sector will largely focus on improving quality of utility services
and housing. The Bank has a large portfolio focused on improving heating, water,
electricity, and other municipal services in selected regions. This includes the recently
completed Kazan Municipal Development Project and electricity sector reform
support project and on-going Saint Petersburg Economic Development, Municipal
Heating, Municipal Water and Wastewater projects. As part of the larger effort by the
Government to invest into improvements of the HCS sector, the Bank is working on
preparation of a program that would support reforms and investments in HCS on
grant basis allocated to regions competitively. Also, a large share of sub-national
lending is expected to focus on improving these services.

•

Housing finance and energy efficiency through IFC's PEP program: IFC’s PEP
program is currently focusing its work on two new product platforms in Russia:
housing finance and energy efficiency, both of which are complemented by IFC
investments in this area. The Primary Mortgage Development Project is working to
streamline the mortgage lending process in Russia. IFC's Sustainable Energy
Efficiency Program in Russia combines IFC's advisory and investment capacity. The
project makes credit lines available to banks for on-lending for energy efficiency
projects, and provides technical assistance to banks and private companies in order to
raise the lending volumes available for energy-saving projects. The program has
already disbursed its first credit line to Center Invest Bank in Rostov, and currently
has a US$60 million pipeline of potential deals across all regions of Russia. IFC also
runs a number of additional programs in Russia, including support for corporate
governance in the banking sector, for improvement of forestry management practices
in the Northwest, and for development of local suppliers to the mining sector in the
remote region of Magadan.

11
(d) Enhancing Russia’s global role
6.
The Bank has a strong commitment to support Russia’s increasing global role, and
assist the country in fulfilling its global commitments. The Bank will continue cooperation
with the Russian government in support of its emergence as an international donor and active
member of multilateral organizations. In addition, the Bank will assist in establishment of
mechanisms and implementation of specific actions arising from Russia’s global
engagements, such as the Climate Change and Biodiversity Conventions, and pandemic
diseases initiatives. During the CPS period, the Bank will also seek to share with Russian
experts its analysis (and advocacy) that is currently directed towards the traditional DAC
donors. Specific areas for Bank’s engagement in Russia are:
•

Assistance in the formulation of an ODA strategy for Russia as emerging donor: The
Bank will continue to assist Russia as an emerging donor, and will cooperate on the
design of Russia’s development aid strategy and the establishment of a national ODA
system. Specific Bank support includes training/capacity events, information sharing,
and advisory services. The Bank will remain engaged with Russia on international
policy initiatives developed under Russia’s G-8 presidency, including on Russia’s
priority themes for international assistance—quality of education, energy poverty,
and controlling the spread of infectious diseases. The Government counterparts will
be involved in policy dialogue on global food crisis and climate change.

•

Providing access to the Bank’s instruments for channeling Russian developmental
assistance: The Bank will help in preparation of Africa debt-for-development swap,
facilitate Russia contributions in multilateral TFs such as Avian Flu Trust Fund, the
Education-For-All/Fast Track Initiatives, and support design of Russia supported
programs like Malaria control in Africa, Global Village Energy Partnership, Quality
of Basic Education. Following increased Russia’s contributions to IDA15 the Bank
will further work on developing ownership of IDA among Russian policy makers.
Beginning with a high-level Emerging Donor Meeting in April 2006, the Bank is
assisting Russia in organizing development aid seminars and international events. The
Bank will also seek opportunities for increased engagement of Russian experts in
development policy debates, their participation in the Bank’s work in other countries,
and “staff secondments” for building capacity within the Russian Government for aid
allocation and management.

•

Fulfilling international obligations related to global goods: The Bank will assist
Russia in developing procedures and mechanisms for implementing specific activities
in the framework of the Climate Change and Biodiversity Conventions. TA is
currently being provided on the introduction of low-carbon technologies and climate
change mitigation. If the government moves ahead with the introduction of financial
instruments for low-carbon technologies in Russia, the Bank would be ready to
support the preparation and implementation of a number of carbon-finance projects.
There are three GEF projects in the Bank’s pipeline awaiting the establishment of a

12
legal and institutional framework for their introduction at the regional level with
federal oversight. Additional projects on biodiversity and climate change could also
be prepared. The Bank will continue participation in the Ministerial Conference on
Forest Law Enforcement and Governance in Europe and North Asia.
•

Linking Russian companies to global markets: IFC and MIGA activities are also
relevant to the expansion of Russia’s global role. In keeping with its global strategic
objective to encourage investment across emerging markets (South-South
investment), IFC will continue to actively support strong, reputable Russian clients in
investments elsewhere in emerging markets. Consistent with its strategic objective to
support South-South investments through the provision of guarantees, MIGA will
continue to proactively engage Russian companies planning to invest in emerging
markets.

Focus on Russian regions
7.
The Bank is working with the federal government in identifying a small sub-set of
6–10 regions that may become the target of concentrated work programs with the Bank.
Regions are being chosen from wealthier, middle income, and poorer areas. Important
criteria for the selection of regions for Bank engagement are (i) the willingness and
commitment of the regional administration to work with the Bank; (ii) a past history of
successful cooperation; (iii) the reform-orientation and competence of the regional
administration; (iv) strategic importance of the region for Russian development and the
existence of other similar regions for possible scaling up of successful cooperation; and (v)
the region’s creditworthiness and potential interest in Bank operations (for wealthier or
middle income regions). Following initial engagement of selected regions, the strategic
directions and modalities of cooperation with the Bank will be included in a joint
Memoranda of Understanding, to be signed with the leaders of the focus regions. As noted,
Bank involvement at the regional level would involve a combination of targeted AAA on
diagnostics of the local economy and investment climate, and development of regional
strategies, coupled with selected lending operations to address key challenges.
8.
The World Bank Group will concentrate some work in poorer Russian regions,
which are often in most need of development assistance. The list of priority regions will
include some such poorer regions. IBRD engagement in poorer regions that lack
creditworthiness will depend significantly on opportunities for participation in federal
programs or the coordination of donor funds. IFC will make special efforts to support private
sector activities in poorer areas. For some poorer Russian regions which have achieved
creditworthiness, potential opportunities exist for fee-for-service activities or sub-national
lending without sovereign guarantees. Discussions on the development of new instruments
will give particular attention to facilitating Bank work in poorer areas.

13
ANNEX III. RUSSIAN FEDERATION: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Economic and financial data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for
surveillance purposes. The Russian Federation has a reasonably comprehensive and timely
statistical database, with a wide range of regular, timely publications on financial and
economic statistics. However, difficulties remain in terms of data accuracy and frequent data
revisions. State and private enterprise activities are measured through forms sent to firms
included in enterprise registers, with sample surveys increasingly replacing full-count
collections. The authorities are generally cooperative in reporting data to the Fund, mainly
through the resident representative office, and during missions. The Russian Federation
subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard on January 31, 2005. The authorities
report data for the Fund’s International Financial Statistics (IFS), Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY), the Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook.
2.
While a draft data ROSC prepared in 1999–2000 was not published, a new data
ROSC prepared in October 2003 was published on the IMF website in April 2004. Federal
legislation regulating the statistical system became effective on December 17, 2007.
National accounts
3.
The Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) compiles and publishes quarterly and
annual national accounts data on a timely basis, using the 1993 System of National Accounts.
Rosstat introduced chain-linking into their quarterly and annual national accounts in 2006,
and chain-linked data have been published for 2003 onwards. Source data are obtained from
surveys of businesses and households, including financial surveys of businesses and
employment surveys of households, and are supplemented by administrative data. Efforts are
underway to improve coverage, but further progress is needed to cover small and medium
enterprises. Estimates of GDP are compiled by type of economic activity and expenditure
category, with the former considered more accurate. The statistical discrepancy between the
production and expenditure approaches is generally no more than two percent, broadly
acceptable by international standards. The data are also presented by income category, and
institutional sector accounts are also compiled, although the financial account by institutional
sector is not compiled.
4.
Inadequate reporting by firms has constrained improvement of the national accounts.
In addition, revisions are often not flagged when they are disseminated, making it difficult
for users (including the Fund) to maintain consistent time series.
Prices
5.
Rosstat compiles a national consumer price index (CPI) of good quality, which was
developed with Fund technical assistance. Following a moderation of inflation, Rosstat
stopped the weekly publication of headline inflation in January 2003, retaining only monthly
reports. In addition, Rosstat has begun publication of monthly core inflation data. Further

14
improvements could be made on the basis of a new household budget survey—which has
been under consideration for some time—and by the current efforts to improve the treatment
of seasonal items in the index. Assistance from the World Bank and the European
Commission’s Technical Aid to the Commonwealth of Independent States is available in
these areas. Rosstat also publishes a producer price index, and the State Customs Committee
has initiated the development of foreign trade price indexes.
6.
Monthly CPI and PPI, both Laspeyres indices (2000=100), cover all regions of the
Russian Federation. In addition to the general CPI index, Rosstat publishes indices for the
foodstuffs, non-food products, and services. However, the weights of the CPI components
have been made available since 2006 while PPI components are not disclosed, rendering time
series analysis difficult.
Government finance statistics
7.
The staff is provided with monthly information on revenues, expenditures, and
financing of the federal government and annual information on revenues, expenditures, and
financing of local governments and extrabudgetary funds. The published functional
classification of expenditure differs slightly from international standards. Expenditure data,
classified by economic type, need improvement. Presently, annual data are compiled with a
long delay. Data on domestic and external federal debt are compiled monthly, but are made
public only in summary form on a quarterly basis. In addition, there is no unified debt
monitoring and reporting system. In the context of a work program for statistical
improvement agreed with STA, there have been ongoing improvements in the coverage and
quality of government finance statistics; there remains, however, scope for improvement of
expenditure data. The reform of budgetary accounting is well advanced and includes the
introduction of accrual accounting for the whole of government. In the 2007 GFSY, data for
the central, local and general government were reported through 2006 on both an accrual and
a cash basis, in accordance with the methodology recommended in the Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001. Beginning in 2007, the Treasury began reporting detailed
government finance statistics for publication in IFS on a cash basis.
Monetary and financial statistics
8.
Monetary and financial statistics are reasonably comprehensive and generally in
accordance with international standards. Classification and sectorization are in line with the
methodological guidelines, except that financial derivatives data, currently under
development, are not included in the instrument classification. The basis of recording broadly
follows methodological recommendations. Since 2006, monetary gold is valued at current
quotations set by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). Following the 2003 data ROSC
recommendations, the authorities included all non-operational credit institutions in the
coverage of the monetary statistics and reclassified their deposits as restricted deposits. The
CBR intends to revise further its compilation procedures to conform fully to the guidelines of
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual 2000.

15
9.
Analytical accounts for the monetary authorities and commercial banks are reported
for publication in IFS with a lag of one month. Timely interest rate data are available. The
CBR has yet to conclude compilation of monetary data using new Standardized Report
Forms (SRFs). At the request of the authorities, a TA mission visited Moscow in April 2007
to assist in expanding the coverage to include other (nondepository) financial corporations
and to facilitate the completion of the SRFs.
External sector statistics
10.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled on the basis of the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Though significant improvements have been made to
enhance data quality, there remains scope to improve the coverage of certain components of
the current and the capital and financial accounts. In particular, improving the detail of data
on the financial account would facilitate the analysis of relatively complex flows.
11.
Merchandise import data published by the State Customs Service tends to underrecord transactions due to “shuttle trade,” smuggling, and undervaluation, as evidenced by
large differences with partner country export data. While the statistical agencies are seeking
to reconcile their data with those of partner countries, the CBR has developed a methodology
for calculating export and import transactions that are unrecorded by the customs authorities
for use in balance of payments statistics. There is a need to improve the coverage and quality
of surveys on direct investment and trade in services. On the latter, the authorities are
planning to harmonize statistical methodologies with those prescribed in the Manual on
Statistics of International Trade in Services.
12.
As noted, Russia disseminates the data template on international reserves and foreign
currency liquidity. However, published historic series on reserves have not been corrected for
changes in definitions. Headline data on reserves are reported to the Fund and the markets on
a weekly basis with a four-business day lag. The Fund receives additional detail on reserves
and reserve liabilities through the central bank balance sheet, but this information is not as
comprehensive as the reserve template, which is disseminated with a lag of twenty days.
Quarterly external debt data are now published by sector, maturity, instrument, and currency,
with a lag of one quarter as prescribed by the SDDS. Furthermore, the CBR has started
publishing quarterly debt service projections by sector and instruments. Reserves template
series are available on http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/ir/colist.htm, and external debt
series are available on
http://www.worldbank.org/data/working/QEDS/sdds_countrydata.html.
13.
The CBR publishes an annual international investment position for all sectors with
data starting in 2000. The international investment position for the banking sector has been
available on a quarterly basis since 2001Q1 and published with a three-month lag.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Russian Federation
August 1, 2008
1.
This statement summarizes information that has become available since the staff
report was issued. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
2.
As expected, GDP growth has slowed somewhat, but is set to remain well above
potential. Both private consumption and fixed investment have softened in recent months.
Construction activity also appears to be slowing. This is not only due to the high base effect
in 2007, but also reflects some easing in the momentum of month-on-month growth rates.
The moderation in GDP growth was already assumed in staff’s original projections and does
not alter the near-term outlook. The risks to growth remain tilted to the upside as the recent
volatility in oil prices will, to a large extent, be absorbed by the stabilization fund, while
stronger-than-expected capital inflows (see below) may provide an additional boost to
growth.
3.
Inflationary pressures remains strong. Headline CPI inflation was 15.1 percent
(year-on-year) in June, the same level as in May. Core inflation has continued to increase,
however, rising from 14.5 percent in May to 15 percent in June. These developments are
consistent with staff’s end-year inflation projection of 14.1 percent.
4.
Capital inflows have continued to recover. In mid July, Moody’s upgraded
Russia’s foreign-currency debt by one notch to Baa1, citing the recent smooth transition of
presidential power as well as Russia’s low level of sovereign debt. A number of Russian
banks, especially state-owned banks, were also upgraded. Net capital inflows in the second
quarter were stronger than expected—about US$37 billion—and together with higher oil
prices have helped boost Russia’s international reserves by over US$56 billion over the same
period.
5.
The CBR has continued to tighten monetary policy. In mid July it increased
interest rates again by 25 bps—the fourth such

hike since the beginning of 2008. However,

supplementary 2008 budget. The supplementary budget is expected to be sent to the Duma
in late August. Its parameters remain as described in paragraph 17 of the staff report.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 08/112
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 28, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation
with the Russian Federation
On August 1, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Russian Federation. 1
Background
Russia’s economic recovery is gaining strength as investment rises. Returns on investment
are high—reflecting the scarcity of capital—and surging oil prices, large capital inflows, and a
steady deepening of financial markets are providing investors with the financing and retained
earnings needed to take advantage of this. The resulting rise in investment, and the
associated reallocation of labor to more productive sectors, are unlocking catch-up gains in
productivity. This is providing a further boost to growth in real incomes and consumption,
which have already been buoyant for some time, owing to large terms-of-trade gains. Financial
deepening is also reinforcing this process, by allowing households to take advantage of low
indebtedness to borrow against expected future income gains. Against this background, GDP
growth has accelerated to an annual rate of more than 8 percent.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
But despite a strong supply response, signs of overheating are emerging. Domestic demand
growth has risen to an annual rate of 15 percent in real terms, significantly above estimates of
potential growth. Inflation has more than doubled since early 2007, running at 15.1 percent
(year-on-year) in June 2008. While the increase was initially spurred by rising food and energy
prices, it is now beginning to extend to a broader range of goods and services. Tightening
domestic resource constraints are particularly evident in labor markets, where shortages have
caused real wage growth to accelerate to about 16 percent annually, well above growth in
labor productivity. While the ruble is still undervalued, competitiveness margins are narrowing
and the real effective exchange rate is moving close to staff’s estimate of its equilibrium.
Procyclical fiscal policy is adding to demand pressures. Primary expenditures by the federal
government rose by 15 percent in real terms, and the non-oil deficit—excluding a one-off
collection of tax arrears from the Yukos oil company—rose by 0.8 percent of GDP in 2007. The
2008 budget entails a further notable impulse, as the non-oil deficit of the federal government
is set to increase for the fourth consecutive year, by 0.9 percent of GDP.
The Russian banking system has proven to be relatively resilient in the face of worldwide
turmoil. A number of banks that had relied heavily on external borrowing have had to sharply
curtail credit growth and restructure their balance sheets. Overall, banks in Russia remain
profitable, non-performing loan ratios are still relatively low, and depositor confidence is robust.
Taking note of the high rates of lending growth, a recent Financial System Stability
Assessment update by IMF and World Bank experts expressed concern about credit risk,
recommending a further strengthening of provisioning standards and implementation of
consolidated supervision.
The fixed exchange rate is also fueling demand pressures. In defense of the de facto peg, the
very strong balance of payments position has required large unsterilized interventions in the
foreign-exchange market, which have in turn translated into excess liquidity in the banking
system. While the turmoil in global financial markets resulted in a significant drop in foreign
inflows in the second half of 2007, this had little net impact on credit growth as large external
borrowing prior to the onset of the turmoil had left the banking system highly liquid. In addition,
the CBR quickly stepped up its repo operations and broadened its list of eligible collateral for
liquidity support when money market rates began to rise. More recently, capital inflows have
recovered strongly, and the CBR’s repo operations have been scaled back sharply. In fact, the
CBR has raised interest rates four times in 2008, for a combined increase of 100 bps, and has
increased reserve requirements twice. Additionally, the bank has allowed greater exchange
rate volatility against the euro-dollar basket since June—the basket has appreciated by 0.9
percent over June-July, 2008. Nonetheless, the central bank is still intervening heavily in the
foreign exchange market and Russia’s banking system is still comfortably liquid with overnight
interbank rates at the lower end of the usual trading range.
The near-term economic outlook is favorable, although inflationary pressures are likely to
remain high. GDP growth will continue to be underpinned by strong domestic demand growth,
reflecting further fiscal relaxation, additional large terms-of-trade gains, and the renewed
recovery in capital inflows. However, with growth already running well above estimated
potential, and with a further significant real exchange rate appreciation in the offing, leakage

3
through the balance of payments is likely to increase. In view of this, IMF staff project GDP
growth to ease slightly in 2008 to 7¾ percent. With continued robust growth and little
remaining spare capacity, inflation is set to exceed the revised end-year target of 10.5 percent
by a notable margin. The unwinding of the surplus in the current account is expected to
resume in 2009 in the absence of further large terms of trade gains.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the continued strong performance of the Russian economy, manifested in
higher and more broad-based economic growth and supported by robust investment and
productivity increases. Directors considered that sound economic management and high oil
prices have both contributed to this performance. They commended the authorities on the
prudent management of oil revenues so far—in particular, the policy of saving most of the oilprice windfall in the stabilization fund.
Directors expressed concern about the threat to Russia’s growth prospects from rising
inflationary pressures. Price rises now extend well beyond what can be explained by
worldwide increases in food and energy prices, and are likely to exceed the authorities’
objective by a substantial margin. Directors considered that the current macroeconomic policy
mix is contributing to the overheating of the economy. In particular, a procyclical fiscal stance
in the 2008 and 2009 budgets and the policy of resisting exchange rate appreciation through
unsterilized interventions are exacerbating demand pressures.
Directors accordingly suggested a careful reconsideration of the authorities’ policy stance, so
that price developments are not shaped primarily by uncertain external developments that
remain beyond the authorities’ control—in particular, an eventual deceleration of food prices
and a further unwinding of the current account. Directors generally cautioned that upward
pressures on the ruble will likely remain high as long as buoyant private demand and a
procyclical fiscal policy maintain GDP growth above potential.
Against this background, Directors encouraged the authorities to tighten monetary policy, while
noting that the peg of the ruble to a dollar-euro basket could become increasingly inflationary
as Russia’s cyclical position strengthens relative to that of the U.S. and euro area economies.
They also observed that the growing tension between inflation and exchange rate objectives is
fuelling capital inflows, and further complicating monetary management. While welcoming the
authorities’ commitment to fight inflation and the recent increases in interest rates and the
steps to introduce more flexibility in the exchange rate, most Directors called for a further
refocusing of monetary policy towards inflation reduction accompanied by greater exchange
rate flexibility—an approach that would also pave the way for an eventual move to inflation
targeting. They suggested that at this juncture competitiveness concerns should not stand in
the way of further exchange rate appreciation given the productivity gains that have
accompanied recent real exchange rate appreciation. While generally seeing merit in greater
exchange rate flexibility, some Directors were not convinced of the need for early adjustment
of the nominal exchange rate, pointing, in particular, to the risk that faster appreciation might
exacerbate speculative capital inflows.

Directors expressed concern about the increasing procyclicality of fiscal policy. In the near
term, this will further burden monetary policy and increase inflationary pressures. In the
medium-term, a continued procyclical policy might cause the real exchange rate to overshoot
its equilibrium level. Directors accordingly called upon the authorities to adhere to their
medium-term fiscal strategy—which calls for a reduction in the non-oil deficit—and to
reinvigorate the pace of structural reform. A number of Directors also encouraged the
authorities to reconsider the pending supplementary budget in 2008, and to avoid any further
fiscal stimulus until demand pressures ease.
Directors noted that Russia’s financial sector has weathered the recent global financial turmoil
well, and is generally well positioned to withstand further turmoil. They noted that this
assessment is in line with the findings of the recent FSAP update, which concluded that the
financial system has strengthened significantly since 2003. At the same time, Directors pointed
to the risk that, after years of negative real interest rates and rapid lending growth, a significant
policy-induced increase in real interest rates might have an adverse impact on the banking
system. Directors encouraged the authorities to further improve the regulatory and prudential
framework, in line with the recommendations of the FSAP update. Directors also welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to follow generally accepted principles and best practices as
guidelines for Russia’s sovereign wealth funds.
Directors welcomed the government’s focus on improving Russia’s investment climate. This
will require the elimination of infrastructure bottlenecks and the promotion of a more favorable
business environment. Directors were encouraged by the new government’s development
strategy and priorities, in particular its focus on strengthening the judiciary and tackling
corruption. Plans to reinvigorate the reform of the civil service and the public administration will
also be important. Directors saw the economy’s strong growth and gains from high oil prices
as providing a valuable opportunity for the authorities to press ahead with their earlier plans for
reform. The authorities’ plans to join the World Trade Organization should also serve as a
catalyst to strengthen the reform momentum.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
