IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Chile
On August 4, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Chile, and considered and endorsed the staff
appraisal without a meeting2.
GDP growth has remained lackluster over the past year. The main force behind the economic
slowdown in 2014 has been the sharp fall in private investment, mainly the consequence of
the end of the mining boom but also reflecting the uncertainty and adjustment costs
associated with the structural reform agenda. The external position has improved markedly,
with a large decline in the current account deficit and a real exchange rate now close to
equilibrium.
The economic recovery that started towards the end of 2014 is still fragile and recent
economic indicators suggest that private domestic demand is relatively weak. Staff expects
growth to increase modestly to 2.5 percent in 2015, mainly thanks to strong fiscal support.
Private domestic demand should strengthen somewhat in 2016, primarily as very simulative
monetary conditions and a gradual recovery of business confidence sustain private
investment.
The balance of risks is on the downside. The main risk is a persistent weakness of private
sector confidence and investment, amid continued uncertainty over the structural reform
agenda and the external outlook. On the external front, a further decline in copper prices or
greater global financial volatility could also derail the recovery. High leverage and heavy
reliance on foreign currency debt make Chile’s corporate sector vulnerable to a tail-risk

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

downside scenario, where foreign interest rates increase sharply, the availability of foreign
funding dries out, the peso depreciates strongly, and the economic slowdown accentuates.
The financial sector appears generally healthy, with banks showing solid profitability and
adequate capital buffers. On the other hand, life insurance companies and pension funds
continue to be pressured by the low yield environment and have kept on restructuring their
portfolios towards riskier or less liquid assets.
The macroeconomic policy mix has remained highly accommodative. Staff estimates that the
cumulative fiscal impulse in 2014–15 was equivalent to 1.7 percent of GDP, mainly
reflecting an increase in spending (in infrastructure, education and current transfers). The
Central Bank has kept the policy rate at 3 percent after reducing it by 200 basis points
between September 2013 and November 2014. The authorities have continued to advance
their structural reform agenda. Legislation approved early this year reforms the primary and
secondary education systems by ending for-profit education, co-payments and discrimination
practices. A labor market reform that aims at expanding the coverage and scope of collective
bargaining by empowering trade unions is currently under discussion at Congress.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2015 Article IV consultation with Chile, Executive Directors endorsed the
staff’s appraisal as follows:
Growth has remained lackluster over the past year, as the economy continues to adjust to the
end of the mining boom. The main force behind the slowdown has been the sharp fall in
fixed investment. To a large extent, this reflects the inevitable adjustment of the Chilean
economy to the end of the commodity boom, which had pushed investment and GDP growth
to above potential rates over the past few years. The external position has improved
markedly, with a large decline in the current account deficit and a real exchange rate now
closer to a level consistent with macroeconomic and policy fundamentals.
But the economy has also been negatively affected by the adjustment costs from the
structural reform agenda launched in 2014. The decline in fixed investment partly reflects the
fall in business confidence which cannot be fully reconciled with the external shocks, and
likely results from the uncertainty generated by the structural reform agenda and its shortterm costs. If well implemented, the reforms have the potential to boost productivity and
long-term growth, but the higher cost of capital and the complexity of the new tax regime are
likely to have a negative effect on economic activity in the short-term. Moreover, the
announced constitutional and labor market reforms appear to have increased private sector’s
uncertainty over Chile’s future economic environment.
GDP growth is expected to increase modestly in 2015 and 2016, but the balance of risks is
tilted to the downside. In the baseline scenario, GDP growth picks up modestly to 3.1 percent

3

in 2016 from 2½ percent in 2015. Continued accommodative monetary policy conditions and
a gradual recovery of business sentiment will improve non-mining business investment, more
than offsetting continued weakness in mining investment. The main risk to the baseline
scenario is a more persistent weakness of private sector confidence and investment, amid
protracted uncertainty over the structural reform agenda and the external outlook. On the
external front, a further decline in copper prices from a deeper than expected downturn in
China’s economy would imply more depressed activity in the mining sector, while renewed
bouts of global financial volatility and disruptive asset price shifts may tighten external
financial conditions for Chile’s highly leveraged corporate sector.
Against this background, the macroeconomic policy mix should combine tighter fiscal policy
with continued monetary policy accommodation. As the economy is expected to recover
gradually, starting a process of fiscal consolidation next year is warranted. Reaffirming the
commitment to fiscal discipline after the fiscal impulse in 2015 would also help boost
business confidence. The pace of fiscal consolidation would need to take into account the
deterioration of the long-term prospects for GDP growth and copper prices. On the other
hand, the beginning of fiscal consolidation, the well-anchored inflation expectations, and the
downside risks to growth all give room for monetary policy to remain accommodative until
there are strong signs that the economic recovery consolidates.
Nurturing the return of business confidence also requires a careful design and
implementation of the structural reform agenda. It is important to minimize the potential for
short-term negative effects on growth, including those related to higher uncertainty. In this
regard, effective action could be taken to clarify the procedures of the constitutional reform;
ensure that the reform of the labor market improves its efficiency; and pursue the education
reform with a view to raising the quality of Chile’s human capital, increasing productivity,
and lowering income inequalities.
The authorities’ efforts to strengthen public and private sectors’ governance and institutions
are commendable. The measures that aims at improving corporate governance, investor
protection, and market transparency, could bolster business confidence, increase market
liquidity and reduce the cost of capital. Improvements in the institutional framework for PPP
arrangements could contribute to mobilizing private financial resources needed to fill Chile’s
infrastructure gap, as well as promoting the efficient use of public funds. The recent efforts to
restore confidence in public institutions are also needed and timely.
While Chile’s financial sector is healthy, there are a few areas where financial oversight
could be strengthened further. The relatively high level of corporate and household debt does
not appear to pose risks to economic and financial stability per se, but it may reduce Chile’s
resilience to negative shocks and needs to be monitored closely. If the increase in corporate
leverage were to accelerate in the future, the authorities could consider adopting additional
prudential measures to safeguard Chile’s financial sector against these shocks. The adoption

4

of minimum liquidity standards and the authorities’ plan to send the new General Banking
Law to Congress during the second half of 2015 (which will introduce Basel III bank capital
standards) are welcomed. While the Financial Stability Council law represents an important
step forward, the authorities should keep strengthening the supervision of financial
conglomerates. As the insurance companies’ expansion into riskier and less liquid
investments continues, it is essential to approve the bill proposal that implements risk-based
supervision and introduces new solvency requirements for insurance companies.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 21, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context: Chile’s GDP growth slowed sharply in 2014, as lower copper prices hurt the
mining sector while non-mining investment suffered from the decline in business
confidence after the launch of an ambitious set of reforms by the new administration.
The strong fiscal and monetary policy response helped stabilize the economy, but
output is expected to recover only gradually to a lower medium-term growth rate than
forecasted in the 2014 Article IV Consultation staff report, and the balance of risks
remains tilted to the downside.
Policy challenges: Fiscal consolidation is warranted after this year’s large fiscal impulse
to help anchor expectations and restore confidence. There is room for monetary policy
to remain accommodative, given the downside risks to the recovery and well-anchored
inflation expectations. The structural reform agenda should be designed and
implemented with the objective to minimize the potential for short-term negative effects
on growth, including those related to higher uncertainty. In this regard, effective action
could be taken to clarify the procedures of the constitutio nal reform; ensure that the
reform of the labor market improves its efficiency; and pursue the education reform with
a view to raising the quality of Chile’s human capital, increasing productivity, and
lowering income inequalities. While the financial sector is generally healthy, prudential
measures might need to be considered if corporate debt continues to grow rapidly in
order to reduce Chile’s vulnerability to adverse shocks. Strengthening the regulatory and
supervisory framework for life insurance companies and financial conglomerates would
also buttress the resilience of Chile’s financial sector.
Past policy advice: In last year’s report, staff welcomed the structural reforms (as they
held the promise to strengthen long-term growth and reduce income inequality) while
noting that clarity on the details, timetables, and prioritization would reduce uncertainty.
Recent advances in financial regulations are in line with advice in previous staff reports,
and a number of further changes recommended by staff in the past are contained in the
legislation currently under discussion in Congress.

GDP growth has remained lackluster since last year’s staff report, as Chile’s economy
continues to adjust to the end of the commodity super-cycle. GDP growth was 1.9 percent in

Chile’s growth weakness also reflects the uncertainty and adjustment costs from the
structural reform agenda launched in 2014. The decline in investment in 2014 also owes to a
sharp fall in business confidence which cannot be fully reconciled with the stage of the business
cycle and the external shock (Box 1), but may also reflect the reaction of Chile’s business community
to the uncertainty associated with the ambitious structural and economic reform agenda announced
by the new administration in 2014. This agenda rightly aims at fostering stronger and more inclusive
long-term growth, including by addressing wellBusiness and Consumer Confidence Indices

Box 1. The Role of Domestic and External Factors in the Fall of Private Investment
Investment fell by about 6 percent in 2014, owing to both external and domestic factors.
While there are no data on private fixed investment in the National Accounts, staff estimates that
it fell by about 7 percent in 2014. The strong fall of copper prices (as of June 2015, down
35 percent from their 2011 peak) put an end to the investment boom that began right after the

An alternative explanation is that it might reflect the

agenda announced at the beginning of 2014.
Staff estimates suggest that external factors were
the most important driver of the decline in private
fixed investment. To assess the relative weight of
external and domestic factors, we estimated equations
for private investment in mining and non-mining
sectors. The decline in private fixed investment in 2014
is largely explained by external factors. In particular, the
depreciation of the peso and lower copper prices
together account for about two-thirds of the decline
in overall private fixed investment in 2014. Among
domestic factors, an important variable behind the
decline in mining investment was the increase in labor
costs. Non-mining investment was also affected by
the drop in business confidence and the fall in Tobin’s
Q (proxied by the price-to-book value for listed
companies) which may also reflect the higher cost of
capital from the tax reform.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Economic activity picked up somewhat towards the end of 2014 and early this year
(Figure 1). The pickup was propelled by very stimulative macroeconomic policies: in particular, fiscal
policy has turned highly expansionary in 2014 and this year, with a strong acceleration of
infrastructure spending in the last quarter of 2014 (Figure 2). On the monetary side, Central Bank has
kept the policy rate at 3 percent (well below its neutral level, estimated by staff at 4½–5 percent)
after reducing it by 200 basis points between September 2013 and November 2014. Lower gasoline
prices sustained private consumption, while the weaker peso supported non-mining exports, in
particular agriculture and forestry products (the real effective exchange rate depreciated by about
15 percent in 2014 relative to early 2013).
4.
However, recent indicators suggest that the
economic recovery has lost momentum in the last few
months. After improving in the first quarter of 2015,
business confidence deteriorated again in the second
quarter. Imports of capital goods have continued to
decline on a year-on-year basis. Non-mining export
growth has slowed, although partly because of one-off
factors. Labor market conditions have been softening, with
slower growth in private sector employment and nominal
wages since early 2015. After remaining relatively low at
about 6 percent in the last six months, the unemployment
rate increased to 6.6 percent in May 2015, as labor force
participation inched up.
5.
Inflation has remained stubbornly high. Headline
inflation has exceeded the central bank’s target band (2–
4 percent) for 15 consecutive months (Figure 3). After
peaking at 5.7 percent in October 2014, inflation has
declined steadily as the pass-through from the sharp peso
depreciation of 2014 dissipated, and has hovered around
4 percent in the last few months. In the non-tradable
(service) sector, disinflation has been slower, reflecting the
sustained growth of nominal wages (in turn largely
explained by the high degree of wage indexation to the
CPI). Nonetheless, inflation expectations at the 24-month
horizon have remained well anchored at 3 percent.

The external position has improved significantly. The current account deficit fell by over
two percentage points of GDP in one year, from 3.7 percent in 2013 to 1.2 percent in 2014, mainly
driven by the strong contraction in investment-related imports (Figure 4). EBA-based estimates
suggest that the currency was modestly undervalued in 2014 in real effective terms. However, as the

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Growth is expected to firm up this year and the next, though remaining well below its
potential. Staff expects GDP growth to average 2½ percent in 2015, mainly on the back of a strong
fiscal impulse, and to accelerate to 3.1 percent in 2016 as private domestic demand gradually
strengthens. Inflation is projected to slowly decline towards 3 percent by mid-2016, under the
combined effects of the negative output gap and the waning pass-through of the peso depreciation
in 2014.
10.
The main assumptions underlying the expected recovery of private domestic demand
in 2016 are as follows:


A moderate pick-up in non-mining investment, as monetary policy conditions remain highly
accommodative and business sentiment gradually improves. This will more than offset
continued weakness in mining investment, as copper prices are expected to remain stable in
2016 after falling by another 10 percent in 2015.



Stronger non-mining exports, mainly thanks to the more competitive real effective exchange
rate as trading partners’ growth fails to increase substantially (going from 3.2 percent in 2015 to
3.4 percent in 2016, based on the July 2015 update of the World Economic Outlook).



A modest firming of private consumption, reflecting a gradual return of consumer confidence,
still easy access to credit, and some pick-up in real income as lower inflation partly offsets slower
nominal wage growth in the context of weaker labor market conditions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETAR Y FUND

CHILE

11.
The balance of risks is mainly on the downside (see Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM), and
Annex II on spillovers). The main risk to staff’s baseline scenario is a more persistent weakness of
private sector confidence and investment, amid continued uncertainty over the structural reform
agenda and the external outlook. On the external front, a further decline in copper prices (for
example associated with a deeper-than-expected downturn in China) would imply more depressed
activity in the mining sector. Tighter and more volatile global financial conditions also pose risks to
Chile’s economic recovery. Although Chile’s deep local capital market, sound macroeconomic
fundamentals, and credible policy framework are likely to reduce the risk of a “sudden stop” of
capital inflows, a sharp asset price adjustment and decompression of credit spreads could reduce
the availability, and increase the cost, of funding for the non-financial corporate sector and banks.
Moreover, high leverage and heavy reliance on foreign currency debt make Chile’s corporate sector
relatively vulnerable to a tail-risk downside scenario, where foreign interest rates increase sharply,
the peso depreciates strongly, and the economic slowdown accentuates .

POLICY DISCUSSION
A. Policy Mix
13.
Staff argued in favor of a macroeconomic policy mix that combines tighter fiscal
policy with continued monetary policy accommodation.


Fiscal policy: The strong fiscal impulse in 2015 was appropriate, given the severity of the
slowdown, the need to cushion the temporary effects of structural reforms, the low level of debt,
and the emphasis on infrastructure and education spending (which account for about half of the
9 percent projected increase in public

achieving the target of a balanced
structural fiscal position in 2018 would require an average growth of public spending of just
below 3 percent in real terms over 2016–2018. Given the strong credibility of Chile’s fiscal
framework and lack of debt sustainability issues (Table A.2), staff noted that the authorities have
room to proceed with a slower pace of fiscal consolidation if the fiscal tightening were to weigh
excessively on pro-growth expenditures (such as infrastructure and education). At the same
time, if the return of business confidence were to be slower than expected, the fiscal policy
stance should not be relaxed, as sticking to the commitment to eliminate the structural fiscal
deficit over time would likely contribute more to supporting private sector demand than finetuning public spending.



Monetary policy has room to remain accommodative until there are strong signs that the
economic recovery consolidates. The central bank’s baseline scenario (as presented in the June
2015 Monetary Policy Report) projects no interest rate increase until early 2016. Staff sees this
stance as appropriate, and noted that there is room to adopt a wait-and-see attitude until the
risks surrounding the economic recovery dissipate, given the well-anchored inflation
expectations, the projected decline in headline inflation, and the downside risks to growth.
Fiscal consolidation would give the Bank more room to maintain an accommodative monetary

policy even with a slower return of inflation toward the mid of the target band, and to cut rates
if the economy weakened further or the downside risks materialized.
14.
The authorities broadly concurred with staff. They agreed that the beginning and pace of
normalization of interest rates should remain conditional on the strength of the economic recovery,
and noted that the large fiscal impulse in 2015 is not sustainable and needs to be followed by a
process of fiscal consolidation, safeguarding the credibility of the fiscal framework. They also agreed
that restating the commitment to a structural budget over the medium run would support
confidence and reduce uncertainty, although the pace of consolidation would depend on the new
assumptions on long-term growth and copper prices, which will be made public at the time of the
Budget in the fall of 2015. However, they noted that staff’s assumptions on long-term GDP growth
and copper prices appear relatively pessimistic. Hence, the reduction in real public expenditure
growth required to reach a balanced budget in 2018 may not be as pronounced as envisaged by
staff. They also highlighted their intention to simplify the implementation of the tax reform by
providing more guidance to firms, and are preparing a new fiscal responsibility law that would
strengthen the role and governance of the Fiscal Council.

Labor Reform: Overview of Selected Areas
Area

Current framework

Proposed changes

Right-to-bargain

Non-union groups can negotiate collectively in the presence of
unions.

In companies where they exist, unions will have a priority for collective
negotiation. Non-union workers may only bargain collectively by
affiliating to the union, or creating a new one. Non-union groups can
negotiate in firms where there are no unions.

Level of collective
negotiation

Company-level negotiation; intercompany unions are allowed to
bargain collectively only if the individual employers agreed to
negotiate (employers are not obliged to negotiate).

Collective negotiation remains at firm level. Intercompany unions are
allowed to negotiate only at the company level (provided that they
have a sufficient number of members in that company), and employer
must negotiate.

Extension of benefits of
collective agreements

Employers can unilaterally extend the benefits to non-union
workers (who must pay 75% of the union fees)

Both union and employer should agree whether benefits are extended.
In order to benefit, non-union workers should pay the total union fee.

Coverage of collective
negotiation

Workers on apprenticeship or temporary contracts are excluded
from collective negotiation.

Workers on apprenticeship and temporary contracts are allowed to
negotiate with some restrictions (for example, if they work in SMEs).

Adaptability pacts

By law, the workweek is set at six days or 45 hours. The maximum
workday length is 10 hours (including two hours of overtime pay),
with some exclusions (e.g., caretakers, domestic workers).

Allow negotiation of special work conditions (exceptional work/leave
days, overtime, retribution of non-work days) if the company has 30%
affiliation in one or more unions.

Other terms of collective
negotiation

Minimum time period to start negotiating collectively is one year
from the beginning of firm's operations. There are no restrictions
on employer's response to employees' proposals.

Minimum time period is reduced to six months for new large firms
(unchanged for SMEs). Negotiation process starts with a 'floor': the
employer cannot offer lower benefits than the ones that already exist,
with some exclusions.

Right-to-strike

Under certain circumstances and subject to constraints, employers Employers cannot replace workers on strike; unions must provide

Note: Staff summary based on Moderniza el sistema de relaciones laborales, introduciendo modificaciones al Código del Trabajo, No. Boletin 9856-13 . The labor reform is
presently under discussion in Congress. Therefore, some of the specific changes mentioned in the table may undergo some changes as a consequence of the
legislative process.

16.
Staff stressed that fostering Chile’s labor market efficiency and flexibility should
remain a priority. Empirical evidence suggests that greater unionization and more extensive
collective bargaining may help reduce wage inequality and promote social dialogue. But changes in
labor market institutions should not happen at the cost of reducing labor market efficiency. In this
regard, it is particularly important that the reform maintains collective bargaining at the firm level
and introduces more flexible work arrangements within the collective bargaining process
(independently of the level of unionizatio n within the firm). Protecting workers’ right to strike should
be balanced by clearly defining the range of “minimum services” that are guaranteed in case of
strikes while remaining mindful of the effects of the reform on small firms. Staff welcomed recent
changes in unemployment insurance (which have increased the amount and duration of the benefits
from a relatively low base, and linked them to mandatory training), and the efforts to improve skill
training programs for youth and women outside of the labor force. Lowering the relatively high
severance payments could also contribute to reducing the duality of Chile’s labor market.
17.
The education reform has the potential to raise the quality of Chile’s human capital,
increase productivity, and lower income inequalities. The legislation approved early this year
(that ends the for-profit education, co-payment, and discrimination practices at primary and
secondary levels) could deliver higher quality and equity in education by reducing the level of
segregation in Chile’s school system. The proposed introduction of a national teaching policy could

also increase the quality of education by raising entry wages for teachers and linking teachers’

willingness to extend free tertiary education to all students (beyond those currently covered by

18.
The authorities highlighted the legislative efforts to strengthen public and private
sectors’ governance and institutions. A series of political and corporate scandals in the recent past
may have undermined investors’ confidence in Chile’s public and corporate sectors, contributing to
the fall in business confidence. The authorities’ response has been admirably swift, with a series of
legislative and regulatory measures announced over the past few months (under the government’s
“Transparency Agenda”). A host of measures aim at improving corporate governance, investor
protection, and market transparency, including by tightening internal and external audit processes,
improving transparency about the composition and practices of publicly trade corporations’ boards,
and giving additional intervention, enforcement, and sanction powers to the new Securities and
Insurance Commission. A series of legislative efforts is also underway that aim at restoring
confidence in public institutio ns, including by regulating funding to both political parties and
campaigns and tightening norms over conflicts of interest, corruption, and lobbying. Finally, the
institutional framework for PPP arrangements is strengthened by a law proposal that establishes a
centralized unit within the Minister of Public Works tasked with the responsibility of assessing,
approving and developing new concessions. The bill also improves the transparency and terms of
renegotiations of old concessions, and introduces minimum standards of service. Staff welcomed
the initiative that, if well implemented, could contribute to mobilizing the private financial resources
needed to fill Chile’s infrastructure gap, as well as promoting a more efficient use of public funds.

C. Financial and Corporate Sector
19.
Staff discussed with the authorities the policy implications of high corporate and
household debt. Staff stressed that prudential measures might need to be considered if corporate
debt continues to grow, in order to reduce Chile’s vulnerability to adverse shocks. In p articular,
consideration could be given to higher risk weights or higher provisioning for commercial credit, in
order to increase the resilience of the banking sector to shocks in the corporate sector. The

INTERNATIONAL MONETAR Y FUND

15

CHILE

authorities noted that the best indicator of debt is leverage (debt-to-equity ratio) which has been
relatively stable over the past two years and comparable to other economies. They also noted that
imposing prudential measures that have a broad reach over the corporate sector may be
inappropriate at this stage, given the weak economy and the lack of systemic risks from corporate
leverage. On household debt, staff welcomed the new provisioning regulation for mortgage loans,
which from 2016 onwards will increase provisions for high loan to value (LTV) ratios and delinquent
mortgages. Staff argued that tighter LTVs and debt service-to-income ratios could be considered if
mortgage credit growth were to accelerate. The authorities responded that the new regulation on
provisions was sufficient to address the risks, particularly because mortgage credit growth should
decelerate in 2016, after the VAT on first homes is introduced.
20.
Forthcoming changes in the General Banking Law will bolster the resilience of the
banking sector. The authorities expect to send the new Banking Law to Congress during the second
half of 2015. The new law will adapt Basel III capital standards to Chilean banks on a transitional
basis and introduce a capital surcharge for domestic systemically important banks. Staff also
welcomed the new liquidity regulation (effective from August 2015) and the authorities’ plans to
specify the minimum requirements for the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net-funding stable ratio
(NSFR). This will strengthen liquidity risk management and address the risks stemming from the
reliance on wholesale funding, particularly for medium and small banks. The authorities noted that
the banking sector in general is well prepared to implement Basel III capital and liquidity
requirements on a transitional basis. The authorities are also planning to implement a legal
framework for bank resolution, broadly in line with the 2011 FSAP recommendations. While the
authorities are willing to strengthen the SBIF operational independence, staff emphasized the
importance of ensuring that SBIF is given sufficient fina ncial resources to conduct effective
implementation of the new regulatory requirements.
21.
The search for yield by life insurance companies warrants close attention. Staff stressed
the importance of monitoring the potential implications for financial stability from the insurance
sector’s expansion to riskier investments. The authorities

that the expansion abroad was mainly in response to the lack of investment opportunities in the

22.
Improving the supervision of conglomerates would reinforce the resilience of the
financial sector. The Financial Stability Council (FSC) law represents an important step to ward
strengthening consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates. The law removed all barriers to
information-sharing among supervisors; expanded their power to request information from the final
owners of financial institutio ns within the conglomerate; and established solvency requirements for
the controlling shareholders of banks and insurance companies. However, supervisors still lack the
powers and authority to conduct comprehensive group-wide supervision (including setting riskbased minimum prudential standards and monitoring conglomerates’ compliance with limits on risk
exposure). The 2011 FSAP recommended stronger coordination among supervisors and the
identificatio n of a group-level supervisor with enhanced powers, including that of establishing riskbased minimum prudential standards for financial conglomerates . The authorities said the biggest
challenges are to design a crisis management framework for conglomerates and to s upervise mixed
conglomerates, and said they are waiting the final report from a recent technical assistance mission
of the IMF.

D. Other Structural Issues
23.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to increase female labor force participation,
which is one of the lowest in the OECD and Latin America (Annex III). Recognizing the main
impediments to female participation, the authorities plan to

Export Diversification

24.
The authorities agree with the need to diversify

(such as “Start-up Chile”, a program that provides seed
money to start ups) and productivity, but there is room to expand and rationalize these programs ,
as well as to strengthen collaboration between firms and universities or other research institutions.
The authorities also see potential for developing managerial skills through the creation of a series of
Small Business Centers that provide technical assistance to small businesses and aspiring
entrepreneurs, following international experience; and for reducing the red tape associated with
creating a new company. Staff also welcomed the announcement of a new agency to attract foreign
investment with a more proactive strategy. The authorities also emphasized that developing better
infrastructures was key to improving access to the international market and boosting non-mining
exports.
25.
Access to credit should be strengthened for small and medium-size firms. The
authorities mentioned tha t the productivity gap between SMEs and large fir ms in Chile is relatively
large (about twice as large as in Europe, for example), and argued that this may also reflect a
relatively more difficult access to credit. Staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to accelerate the
approval of a bill that introduces a Public Credit Bureau. A swift approval of the bill could improve
access to credit, particularly for SMEs, by reducing information gaps and improving financial
institutions’ assessment of credit risks. The authorities also plan to introduce a registry of firms’
mobile assets, which will make it easier for banks to assess the value of that type of collateral.
Finally, the authorities noted that they intend to implement a regulated crowd-funding framework
that will increase competition in the credit market, with greater incentives for non-bank institutions
to provide credit to SMEs.

STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Growth has remained lackluster over the past year, as the economy continues to adjust
to the end of the mining boom. The main force behind the slowdown has been the sharp fall in
fixed investment. To a large extent, this reflects the inevitable adjustment of the Chilean economy to
the end of the commodity boom, which had pushed investment and GDP growth to above potential
rates over the past few years. The external position has improved markedly, with a large decline in
the current account deficit and a real exchange rate now closer to a level consistent with
macroeconomic and policy fundamentals.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHILE

27.
But the economy has also been negatively affected by the adjustment costs from the
structural reform agenda launched in 2014. The decline in fixed investment partly reflects the fall
in business confidence which cannot be fully reconciled with the external shocks, and likely results
from the uncertainty generated by the structural reform agenda and its short-term costs. If well
implemented, the reforms have the potential to boost productivity and long-term growth, but the
higher cost of capital and the complexity of the new tax regime are likely to have a negative effect
on economic activity in the short-term. Moreover, the announced constitutional and labor market
reforms appear to have increased private sector’s uncertainty over Chile’s future economic
environment.
28.
Staff expects GDP growth to increase modestly in 2015 and 2016, but the balance of
risks is tilted to the downside. In staff’s baseline scenario, GDP growth picks up modestly to
3.1 percent in 2016 from 2½ percent in 2015. Continued accommodative monetary policy
conditions and a gradual recovery of business sentiment will improve non-mining business
investment, more than offsetting continued weakness in mining investment. The main risk to the
baseline scenario is a more persistent weakness of private sector confidence and investment, amid
protracted uncertainty over the structural reform agenda and the external outlook. On the external
front, a further decline in copper prices from a deeper than expected downturn in China’s economy
would imply more depressed activity in the mining sector, while renewed bouts of global financial
volatility and disruptive asset price shifts may tighten external financial conditions for Chile’s highly
leveraged corporate sector.
29.
Against this background, the macroeconomic policy mix should combine tighter fiscal
policy with continued monetary policy accommodation. As the economy is expected to recover
gradually, starting a process of fiscal consolidation next year is warranted. Reaffirming the
commitment to fiscal discipline after the fiscal impulse in 2015 would also help boost business
confidence. The pace of fiscal consolidation would need to take into account the deterioration of
the long-term prospects for GDP growth and copper prices. On the other hand, the beginning of
fiscal consolidation, the well-anchored inflation expectations, and the downside risks to growth all
give room for monetary policy to remain accommodative until there are strong signs that the
economic recovery consolidates.
30.
Nurturing the return of business confidence also requires a careful design and
implementation of the structural reform agenda. It is important to minimize the potential for
short-term negative effects on growth, including those related to higher uncertainty. In this regard,
effective action could be taken to clarify the procedures of the constitutional reform; ensure that the
reform of the labor market improves its efficiency; and pursue the education reform with a view to
raising the quality of Chile’s human capital, increasing productivity, and lowering income
inequalities.
31.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen public and private sectors’
governance and institutions. The measures that aims at improving corporate governance, investor

INTERNATIONAL MONETAR Y FUND

19

CHILE

protection, and market transparency, could bolster business confidence, increase market liquidity
and reduce the cost of capital. Improvements in the institutional framework for PPP arrangements
could contribute to mobilizing private financial resources needed to fill Chile’s infrastructure gap, as
well as promoting the efficient use of public funds. The recent efforts to restore confidence in public
institutions are also needed and timely.
32.
While Chile’s financial sector is healthy, there are a few areas where financial oversight
could be strengthened further. The relatively high level of corporate and household debt does not
appear to pose risks to economic and financial stability per se, but it may reduce Chile’s resilience to
negative shocks and needs to be monitored closely. If the increase in corporate leverage were to
accelerate in the future, the authorities could consider adopting additional prudential measures to
safeguard Chile’s financial sector against these shocks. Staff welcomes the adoption of minimum
liquidity standards and the authorities’ plan to send the new General Banking Law to Congress
during the second half of 2015 (which will introduce Basel III bank capital standards). While the
Financial Stability Council law represents an important step forward, the authorities should keep
strengthening the supervision of financial conglomerates. As the insurance companies’ expansion
into riskier and less liquid investments continues, it is essential to approve the bill proposal that
implements risk-based supervision and introduces new solvency requirements for insurance
companies.
33.
Staff proposes to hold the next Article IV consultation on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Annex I. Chile: External Sector Assessment Report

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Chile
Foreign asset and
liability position

Background. Chile’s net international investment position (NIIP) has hovered around -15 percent of GDP since 2008, and is
stronger than other countries in the region. Chile has a net negative FDI position reflecting large inflows in the mining sector,
and a net positive equity position, with the financial sector (pension funds, mutual funds, and insurance companies) being the
main holders of foreign assets. The IIP is projected to remain largely unchanged in the next few years amid small current
account deficits.
Assessment. Gross external debt grew rapidly in the last 4 years, from 39 to 56 percent of GDP (as of end 2014) with most of
the increase concentrated in the nonfinancial corporate sector. However, the external debt remains sustainable under a range
of adverse scenarios (Figure A.1 and Table A.1).

Current account

Background. Chile’s current account (CA) has improved significantly since mid-2013, reflecting lower imports of capital
goods and oil, as well as higher non-mining exports (boosted by the peso depreciation). In terms of savings-investment
balance, over the last 2 years national savings has remained relatively stable as a percent of GDP, while the investment ratio
has declined sharply reflecting lower copper prices and a fall in business confidence.
Assessment. At 0.4 percent of GDP in 2015, the projected CA deficit is below the EBA norm of 2 percent—the gap being
mostly unexplained by the EBA regression (after correcting for the commodity and output cycles). A possible reason is that
the CA improvement is partly due to domestic factors not captured by the EBA equation, in particular the deterioration in
business confidence. Once confidence and investment recover, the CA deficit should rise and converge towards the norm.

Real exchange
rate and
competitiveness

Background. Chile’s exchange rate is strongly correlated with copper prices, and, to a lesser extent to the interest rate
differential with the US. Reflecting lower copper prices, rising market U.S. interest rates, and weaker portfolio inflows, Chile’s
REER has depreciated by about 15 percent in 2014 relative to early 2013. Since the fall of 2014, however, the REER has
appreciated (partly reflecting high domestic inflation) and its average between January and May 2015 was 2½ percent above
its average in 2014.
Assessment. The peso was moderately undervalued in 2014 (between -4 and -11 percent according to EBA estimates), but
the recent real appreciation is likely to have reduced the misalignment, bringing the currency closer to its equilibrium value.

Capital and
financial accounts

Background. The CA deficit is mainly financed from a relatively stable source of FDI inflows. After declining in 2013, FDI
inflows partly recovered in 2014. The debt component of FDI has increased gradually in the last decade.
Assessment. Chile has a fully open capital account. Vulnerabilities are limited by a credible commitment to a floating
exchange rate and a strong fiscal position.

FX intervention
and reserves level

Background. Chile has a free floating exchange rate regime. The central bank generally does not intervene in the foreign
exchange market. Nonetheless, Chile had two recent intervention programs in 2008 and 2011, both aimed at weakening the
peso and both based on purchases of USD. The Bank of Chile has 6 months of reserves, which is estimated as adequate
according to standard reserve adequacy metrics.
Assessment. A flexible exchange rate is the first line of defense in a small economy exporting commodities like Chile, with a
large exposure to international shocks.

Overall Assessment
The external position and the
exchange rate are broadly consistent
with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings. As discussed
in the RAM, the increase in FX private
debt warrants close monitoring.

CHILE

Annex II. Chile: Trade and Financial Linkages
As one of the most open economies in Latin America, Chile is subject to important financial
and trade spillovers. Chile’s trade openness (sum of exports and imports) at 65 percent of GDP is
well above the average of LA-5 countries (Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay). Chile is also
an important recipient of FDI inflows to the region, receiving nearly 15 percent of total FDI to LA-5.
It has strong links to the global financial system, with foreign claims on Chile by BIS-reporting banks
amounting to over 40 percent of GDP, twice the average of the region. In addition, about one-third
of total funding of both financial and non-financial corporate sectors relies on foreign sources and
has been on the rise in recent years.
Inward Spillovers: Trade Channels
Chile’s economy is particularly vulnerable to shocks originating from China, Europe, the
United States, and Japan, with more than two-thirds of its exports directed to these economies.
The exposure is further amplified by the highly concentrated

Inward Spillovers: FDI and Financial Channels
There are a number of channels through which spillovers from the international financial
market could affect Chile’s economy.


FDI inflows. FDI inflows are an important source of investment in Chile, in particular for the
mining, financial and utilities sectors. They have increased from an annual average of 6 percent
of GDP in the early 2000s to 8½ percent in recent years. The United States, the Netherlands, and
Spain represent the main source markets.

Banks. Chile’s banking sector is most directly exposed to Spanish banks. Foreign banks (mainly



Pension funds, with total assets above 70 percent of
GDP, are key players in Chile’s financial system, and
present another import channel for inward spillovers.
Their foreign investment amounts on average to 45
percent of total assets up from 35 percent at end2011. Most of foreign investment is in mutual funds
and equities, mainly in the United States and
Emerging Asia assets. A rapid expansion of pension
funds to investments in foreign assets would make
them more vulnerable to shocks from abroad, with
adverse effects on domestic financial institutions that
rely on pension funds for funding, such as banks.



Portfolio investment in Chile amounted to 30 percent of GDP in 2014 (based on IIP data). Chile
has a positive net portfolio equity position (about 30 percent of GDP) but this is more than
offset by a large negative net FDI position. The U.S. residents hold nearly half of total portfolio
investment assets (both equity and debt) vis-à-vis Chile, followed by Luxembourg and the
United Kingdom (each 10 percent). Non-residents hold about 5 percent of Chile’s sovereign
bonds.



Risk premium shock. Staff simulations show that in a scenario where both corporate and
sovereign risk premia rise by 100 basis points (for example, following a sharp price adjustment
and decompression of credit spreads globally, as described in the text), Chile’s GDP would
decline by ¼ percent in the medium term.

Outward Spillovers
Outward trade spillovers from Chile are very small. About 60
percent of Chile’s imports are from the United States, Asia, and
Europe. Intermediate goods, mainly energy products and
machine parts, comprise about two-thirds of Chile’s total
imports, followed by capital goods (about 20 percent) and
consumption goods and vehicles (each 10 percent). In Latin
America, Chile imports primarily from Brazil, Argentina, and
Mexico, but even in the case of the major trading partner Brazil,
exports to Chile represent only 1¾ percent of Brazil’s total
exports. Indeed, staff simulations show that a decline in GDP
growth in Chile would have a negligible impact on the region’s
GDP.

Annex III. Women in Chile’s Labor Market: Addressing the Gender
Gap
Despite the important progress in female labor force participation since the 1990s, the gender
gap remains relatively large in Chile. Women currently comprise 40 percent of Chile’s labor force,
up from less than one-third in 1990. But at 55

Also, there is a significant wage gap with men,

characteristics (Sánchez, 2014) but largely gender
discrimination (INE, 2015).
A combination of several factors can potentially explain Chile’s gender gap:
 Low coverage of childcare and early childhood education, with family reasons being cited as the
main reason for inactivity by one-third of women.
 Mandated provision of childcare services by firms with more than 20 female employees, which
increases the relative cost of employing women, and is shown to reduce starting wages of
women by 10–20 percent (Prada, Rucci, and Urzúa, 2015).
 Strict approach to flexible working hours and poor-quality part-time work. While part-time work is
common, it is mostly informal (leading to lower wages and greater risk of poverty) and
involuntary (ILO, 2014; Sánchez, 2014).
 Long commuting hours and high transport costs. Transportation is constrained by limited
connectivity (with Chile lagging 60 percent in terms of km of road behind the OECD average),
and transport costs represent almost 10 percent of the net wage of a part-time worker
(6.5 percent for a full-time worker) in Santiago (Rau, 2010).
 Gender-based legal restrictions. While mindful of cultural norms, women are economically less
independent in terms of ability to access and use property: Chile is one of the very few countries
in the world where laws still vest control over marital property in husband’s hands, although with
a number of exceptions.
Narrowing the gender gap would lead to important economic gains for Chile. A growing
literature highlights that gender gaps in labor force participation, entrepreneurial activity, and
education impede economic growth (IMF, 2013 and 2015). Cuberes and Teignier (2014) estimate
that GDP losses due to economic gender gaps amount to 17 percent of GDP for Chile (12 percent
for LAT6 countries). Looking at the labor force participation gap, staff estimates suggest that closing

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

CHILE

the current gap with LAT6 average (by increasing female participation by 1¼ percent per year over
2015–20) would result in a cumulative GDP gain of about 3 percent by 2020, relative to baseline.
Reforms enacted in recent years are likely to make Chile’s labor market more inclusive. These
reforms include: the extension of early-childhood education and childcare services (since 2006, Chile
Crece Contigo); the introduction of employment bonuses for low-income women (in 2012, Ingreso
Etico Familiar, to be expanded in 2015); the extension of maternity leave, with a possibility to share
leave with fathers (in 2011); and the ongoing education reform discussed in the text.
However, there is a need to broaden the recent reforms and increase their take-up. While it is
too early to evaluate most of the recent policies, the empirical evidence over the impact of past
policies (particularly, greater childcare provision) on Chile’s female participation is mixed. Further
efforts would need to focus on:
 Extending early-childhood education and childcare services (the administration is planning to open
4,500 new childcare institutions for children under 3 years of age during the next four years),
including through longer hours of care and out-of-school care services;
 Removing the mandated employer-provided childcare (as currently considered);
 Improving flexibility in hours of work and promoting a better transition to full-time, permanent
jobs, including through strengthening workers’ rights to request changes in working hours and
the possibility to “reverse” from part-time to full-time hours, as in other countries (e.g., France,
Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland), and more generally addressing labor market duality.
 Investing in transport infrastructure—the authorities are planning to nearly double the
expenditure in transportation in 2015 relative to 2014 (although this still represents a small
fraction of the entire investment plan for the year);
 Ensuring a desired take-up of policy measures, such as by making paternal leave non-transferable
“take-it or lose-it” (e.g., Norway), and facilitating access to available subsidies for female workers;
and
 Reducing occupational segregation by gender through education and job training policies that
would contribute to improving gender equality in the labor market.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation
shocks. Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline
and scenario being presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten -year period, and the
information is used to project debt dynamics five years ahead.
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current
account balance.
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2016.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP
growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium-and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

1/ Public sector is defined as central government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ EMBIG (bp).
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = effective nominal interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of July 1, 2015)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The National Institute of Statistics (INE)
regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial data. The Central Bank of Chile (CBC)
also publishes comprehensive macroeconomic and financial data. The Ministry of Finance
publishes fiscal data.
Key publicly accessible websites for macroeconomic data and analysis are:
National Institute of Statistics: http://www.ine.cl/
Central Bank of Chile: http://www.bcentral.cl/
Ministry of Finance: http://www.minhda.cl/
Recent Developments: The Central Bank started to publish housing real estate price data in
2014, and a new series on external debt at market values in 2015 which allows better monitoring
and identification of risks. The National Institute of Statistics (INE) has revised the basket and
methodology of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) including to address some limitations in the
clothing sub-index.
Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since May 17,
1996. In coordination with STA, Chile is in the
process to gain adherence to SDSS plus.

A data ROSC was published September 17,
2007.

Reporting to STA (Optional)
The CBC uses the standardized report forms (SRFs) to report monthly data for the central bank,
other depository corporations (ODCs), other financial corporations (OFCs), and monetary
aggregates. However, data for the ODCs exclude savings and credit cooperatives and OFCs
exclude investment funds, general funds, housing funds, foreign capital investment funds,
factoring societies, leasing companies, and financial auxiliaries.
The CBC reports all core and 7 of 28 encouraged financial soundness indicators on a monthly
basis.
