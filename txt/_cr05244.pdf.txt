•

Article IV consultation discussions were held in Astana and Almaty during
March 23–April 5, 2005. The mission met with Assistant to the President Massimov,
National Bank of Kazakhstan Governor Saidenov, Minister of Economy Kelimbetov,
Minister of Finance Dunayev, Minister of Labor Karagussova, Financial Supervision
Agency Chairman Zhamishev, other government officials, parliamentarians, and the
private sector.

joined some of the discussions.

•

In the last consultation, concluded on July 21, 2004, Directors welcomed the more
relaxed fiscal stance. They encouraged close monitoring of spending efficiency and
higher social and infrastructure spending. In view of the surge in foreign exchange
inflows, and the difficulties the NBK was encountering in sterilizing them, Directors
urged greater upward flexibility of the tenge. They also urged acceleration of structural
reforms to boost long-term growth.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and outlook
Kazakhstan’s economy continued to grow rapidly in 2004, boosted by expanding oil output
and high world oil prices. Real incomes and employment rose, key social indicators
improved, and non-oil output growth was strong. Economic activity is expected to remain
buoyant in 2005, although some moderation in real GDP growth to about 8 percent is
projected on account of a deceleration in the pace of oil production coming onstream.
Inflation could edge up further to over 7 percent, although the outcome will depend on the
authorities’ willingness to allow nominal appreciation of the tenge. The fiscal policy stance
was eased significantly in 2004, and a further moderate easing is planned in 2005. Social
spending rose in relation to GDP last year and is projected to increase further this year.
Policy discussions
Discussions focused on the following issues:
•

The non-oil budget deficit remains sustainable. However, staff cautioned that the
large increase in government salaries could intensify inflationary pressures.

•

The challenges facing monetary policy are unlikely to abate in the near term with
increased spending of oil revenue and continued capital inflows. In the face of the
inevitable real appreciation of the currency, the National Bank of Kazakhstan should
allow for sufficient nominal appreciation to keep inflation in check.

•

Booming bank credit, particularly to the property sector and financed in part by
external borrowing, carries significant risks. The Financial Supervision Agency
(FSA) is planning a series of measures to curb banks’ property lending and external
borrowing. These will need to be supplemented by vigorous supervision.

•

Rules governing the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan are being
redesigned with the aim of establishing a long-term strategy for the use and
accumulation of oil revenues. Staff recommended targeting the non-oil deficit on the
basis of a fiscal sustainability framework grounded by prudent assumptions regarding
longer-term oil prices and production.

•

Diversification of the economy will be best achieved by reinvigorating structural
reforms, which have slowed in recent years. Priorities include acceleration of WTO
accession discussions and improvement of the investment climate, especially in the
areas of competition policy and enterprise restructuring.

revenue has been saved. Despite the impressive gains on the macroeconomic front,
considerable regional disparities persist and social indicators remain weak.
2.
Real GDP growth remained robust at an estimated 9.4 percent in 2004. Increased
hydrocarbon production continued to underpin growth (Box 1), although the output of
nonhydrocarbon sectors also expanded at a rapid pace (Table 1).1 Consumer price inflation
picked up to 6.9 percent, near the upper end of the National Bank of Kazakhstan’s (NBK)
band of 5–7 percent. Labor market conditions tightened, with real wages increasing by
14 percent, the unemployment rate declining to 8.4 percent (from 8.8 percent in 2003 and
12.8 percent in 2000), and a marked pickup in immigration of documented as well as
undocumented workers. Activity remained strong in early 2005, and inflation rose to an
average of 7.1 percent during January–April.

Box 1. Kazakhstan’s Hydrocarbon Sector
• According to production-based national accounts data, hydrocarbon output made up 8 percent of real GDP in
2004. Staff estimates that, including the output of the construction, transportation, and other sectors (that are
directly related to crude oil and gas extraction), the share of hydrocarbons in GDP could be over 15 percent.
• The share of crude oil and natural gas output in industrial production has almost tripled since 1998, reaching
45 percent in 2004.
• Oil and gas exports accounted for over 55 percent of total export earnings last year. Data on imports related
to investment in oil production capacity are not available, but their share in total imports is likely to be
substantial.
• Investment in the hydrocarbon sector constituted about a third of total investment and one half of FDI in
2004.
• Oil revenue accounted for almost 30 percent of total fiscal revenue last year, compared with about 5 percent
in 1999.

3.
Fiscal policy imparted stimulus to the economy. While the overall budget surplus
remained broadly unchanged at 2.7 percent of GDP, the non-oil deficit widened by about
1½ percentage points to 4.7 percent of GDP in 2004 (Table 2). On the revenue side, the
impact of tax cuts was partly offset by higher nontax revenue and one-off receipts, including
back taxes and penalties stemming from
intensified tax inspections.3 As a result, nonFiscal Developments

The tax changes included reductions in the VAT rate from 16 percent to 15 percent and in
the highest personal income tax rate from 30 percent to 20 percent. The social (payroll) tax
rate was reduced from a flat 21 percent to a range from 7 percent to 20 percent.

aided by buoyant nonfuel commodity
prices (Box 2). The capital account
surplus widened, reflecting continued large foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and an
increase in private sector external borrowing, as banks took advantage of low international
interest rates and favorable investor perception of Kazakhstan to mobilize funds abroad
through syndicated loans and eurobond issuance.3 As a result, official reserves (excluding
NFRK assets) rose to $9.3 billion at end-2004, equivalent to six months of imports, with a
marked pickup in the pace of accumulation during the last quarter of the year.
5.
The conduct of monetary policy has been complicated by the inflows of private
capital, surging oil earnings, and buoyant demand conditions. In an effort to stem upward
pressure on the tenge while containing money growth, the NBK supplemented its exchange
market intervention with continued large-scale sterilization operations. In the event, with
sterilization costs mounting, the increase in the NBK’s reserves was not fully sterilized. As a
result, reserve and broad money growth accelerated (to 118 percent and 68 percent,
respectively, at end-2004), with the tenge appreciating by 9 percent against the U.S. dollar
and 4 percent against the ruble over the course of the year (Table 4). Despite a decline in
short-term interest rates on account of ample liquidity in the banking system, the NBK
incurred substantial sterilization costs and unrealized revaluation losses in 2004,
experiencing a net loss of about T 60 billion for the year (0.9 percent of 2005 GDP and close
to one third of its combined capital and reserves at end-2003). Of this, T 6.4 billion was
covered by reserve capital, and the remainder by special reserves, which include previous
unrealized revaluation gains.

Box 2. Kazakhstan: Non-oil Sector Growth and Competitiveness
Kazakhstan’s non-oil output has increased by an impressive 8 percent a year in real terms, on average, since 1999.
Part of this rapid growth, however, reflects the expansion of output directly related to the hydrocarbon sector, such
as the construction of extraction facilities and transport of petroleum.
A number of external competitiveness indicators suggest that the non-oil sector remains broadly competitive. The
real effective exchange rate is presently more than 10 percent more depreciated than its 1999 level, and labor
productivity growth in Kazakhstan’s non-oil sector has broadly kept pace with that in other large CIS economies.
Non-oil export growth has been robust, averaging about 16 percent a year during 1999–2004. It should be noted,
though, that Kazakhstan’s non-oil exports comprise mainly of metals and other raw materials, which also benefited
substantially from higher world prices in 2003–04. Moreover, rapid wage growth in recent years, especially in
construction and finance, has likely pushed up unit labor costs.
The composition of the non-oil sector has changed The share of the manufacturing sector has declined
significantly, both in terms of value-added and employment. At the same time, traditional “nontradable” sectors,
services and construction, have expanded and now account for 54 percent of employment and 57 percent of value
added.

assets side, through branch operations,
acquisitions of financial entities in neighboring countries, and a pickup in cross border
lending operations (Box 3). The banking system’s ratios of classified loans and loan losses
have edged up (Table 5).5
7.
Although Kazakhstan has made considerable progress in the structural area
since the early 1990s, the pace of reform implementation has slowed in recent years.
Privatization of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is basically complete, prices
have been liberalized, and a framework for prudential regulation and supervision of the
financial sector is in place, including with the establishment of the Financial Supervision
Agency (FSA) in 2004. However, the EBRD’s transition indicators show little improvement
in recent years, and the gap in relation to more advanced reformers has widened (Box 4).
8.
Rapid growth has translated into lower poverty, but social indicators remain
weak. The share of the population living below the poverty line fell from 34 percent in 1998
to 16 percent in 2004. However, the World Bank estimates that over a quarter of the
population lives in crowded conditions and more than 10 percent is poorly educated.
Moreover, life expectancy at birth is lower than the CIS average, and access to safe water
remains limited.6 The World Bank’s latest Country Economic Memorandum also notes that
Kazakhstan’s education programs need far more flexibility, the basic health care system
should be significantly enhanced, and water and sewerage facilities are in dire need of
rehabilitation.

Bank lending rates averaged over 15 percent for tenge loans and 11 percent for foreign
currency loans.

The classified loan ratio was 41 percent at end-2004. However, about 90 percent of
classified loans listed as doubtful are actually being serviced on a timely basis.

Box 3. Kazakhstan’s Banking Sector
Banks balance sheets have expanded rapidly over the past five years. Banking system assets have grown on
average by 50 percent a year and amounted to almost 50 percent of GDP in 2004, compared with 17 percent of
GDP in 1999. This expansion has been accompanied by a process of consolidation. The number of banks has
declined, with the three largest banks presently accounting for over 60 percent of total banking sector assets.
The spread between average lending and deposit interest rates has narrowed but remains high (10 percent in
2004). There has also been some de-dollarization. As of end-2004, foreign currency deposits and loans
accounted for 43 percent and 52 percent of total deposits and loans, respectively, compared with 61 percent and
71 percent at end-2001.
Banks’ international borrowing and lending has increased rapidly in recent years. Cross border lending—
mainly in other CIS countries—rose by 225 percent in 2004 and now accounts for almost 10 percent of the total
assets of the banking system. Mobilization of funding from abroad has grown rapidly, and by end-2004 net
foreign liabilities accounted for 40 percent of the total liabilities of the banking system.
Banks are profitable, well capitalized,
and presently have ample liquidity. As
of end-2004, the average risk weighted
capital adequacy ratio was 16 percent,
significantly above the required
minimum of 12 percent. Banks’ return
on assets has ranged from 1 percent to
3 percent over the past 6 years, and their
return on equity from 8 percent to
14 percent. At end-2004, the ratio of the
banking system’s liquid assets (mainly tbills and cash) to short-term liabilities
(mainly demand deposits) was over
100 percent, more than three times the
regulatory minimum.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
Fund surveillance in recent years has focused on policies that harness
Kazakhstan’s natural resource wealth and sustain rapid development of the economy.
The macroeconomic policy mix has been largely in line with the staff’s advice—an easing of
the tight fiscal stance with increased social spending, accompanied by greater exchange rate
flexibility to keep inflation stable—although the authorities have resisted further tenge
appreciation, particularly in the last quarter of 2004. Staff has also called for structural
reforms to improve the investment climate and diversify the economy. Progress in this area
has been mixed, however. Important steps have been taken in some areas, including financial
sector regulations and supervision, but the implementation of the other structural reforms,
particularly in the competition policy and enterprise restructuring areas, has been slow.

- 10 -

Box 4. Kazakhstan: Structural Reform and Business Climate Indicators
The EBRD’s Transition Indicators, which measure liberalization and reform in a number of structural areas,
indicate rapid progress in Kazakhstan in the early and mid-1990s. Since the late 1990s, however, progress has
been much slower and the gap relative to the EU-8 has widened, although Kazakhstan still compares favorably
with most CIS countries. Within the structural areas, Kazakhstan ranks relatively high in banking sector reforms
but relatively low in competition policy and enterprise restructuring.
The World Bank’s Doing Business 2005, which measures the extent of business regulation and enforcement,
ranks Kazakhstan above the regional and OECD averages in the area of labor hiring and firing, and between the
two in terms of challenges faced by entrepreneurs in launching businesses, disclosure of ownership and
financial information, and property registration. However, Kazakhstan ranks behind both comparator averages
in many of the indicators relating to contract enforcement and closing a business.

10.
Near- and medium-term policy challenges in an environment of sustained high
oil prices were again the core theme this year. The discussions focused on the fiscal
stance, the composition of increased spending, the appropriate monetary/exchange rate policy
response, emerging risks in the banking system, the strategy for the use of oil revenue over
the longer term, and structural reform priorities.
A. Outlook
11.
Economic activity is expected to remain buoyant in 2005, despite some moderation
in GDP growth on account of a deceleration in the pace of oil production coming onstream.
Staff estimates that inflation is likely to stay above 7 percent, although the outcome will
depend on the authorities’ willingness to tolerate further nominal appreciation of the tenge
(see below). Continued high oil prices (in line with the March 29 WEO baseline) are
expected to increase the external current account surplus. With oil sector FDI remaining large
and banks continuing to borrow overseas as international financing conditions tighten only
gradually, the capital account is likely to register another strong surplus.

- 11 -

12.
The medium-term outlook for the Kazakhstan
economy is promising. Despite the projected easing of oil
prices, the rising volume of oil production implies considerable
fiscal receipts from the hydrocarbon sector over the next three
decades and, consequently, the availability of significant
financial resources to support the growth and development of
the rest of the economy. In line with this longer-term outlook,
real GDP growth is projected to average about 7½ percent a
year over the medium term. Large-scale FDI-related imports
and increased earnings of foreign investors are expected to
move the external current account into a moderate deficit
which, notwithstanding larger intracompany debt amortization,
should easily be financed by the projected positive net capital
account balance. The main risks to the outlook relate to global
oil prices and domestic credit market conditions.

External debt indicators are expected to remain comfortable. The bulk of external
obligations is long term, and in large part comprised of intracompany loans without specified
repayment schedules.11 Under the baseline scenario and standard stress tests, external debt
ratios are projected to decline steadily on account of continued high economic growth, tenge
appreciation, and the projected amortization profile, particularly of intracompany loans in an
environment of sustained high oil prices (Table 6).12 However, banks’ large-scale external
borrowing, much of which is conservatively classified as short term in the monetary
accounts, has increased risks in the banking sector (Table 7).13
B. Fiscal Policy
14.
Continued high oil prices have intensified pressures to increase spending
further. A supplementary budget (1½ percent of GDP) has recently been passed by
parliament. As a result, the non-oil fiscal deficit is expected to ease by a further ½ percentage
point (in relation to 2004) to 5.3 percent of GDP, implying a somewhat expansionary fiscal
stance. The overall budget, however, will remain in surplus (2.6 percent of GDP).The
additional spending comprises: the introduction of a basic pension for all retired citizens that
will raise average pensions by about one third; increases in the wages of education and health
workers and in base civil service salaries by about 30 percent; a capital injection for the
development fund for small- and medium-sized enterprises; and increased scholarships and
stipends for students.14 As a result, public spending on the social sectors—including health,
education, and social security—will increase further in relation to GDP.
11

About one half of all external debt obligations at end-2004 were intracompany loans
(mainly in the oil sector), almost one quarter represented obligations of banks, about
10 percent were government or government-guaranteed obligations, and about 7 percent were
trade credits.
12

While a sharp depreciation of the tenge would lead to a sizable increase in the overall
external debt ratio, the effect on external debt excluding intracompany obligations and net of
NFRK assets—the relevant measure for vulnerability analysis—would be relatively muted. A
very sharp fall in oil prices—through its impact on growth and the current account—would
result in a much slower decline in the external debt ratio over the medium term, but the debt
situation would be expected to remain manageable. In view of the low level of domestic
public debt, including NBK obligations, a separate sustainability analysis for domestic public
debt was not conducted.

13

Due to tax advantages, banks’ eurobond obligations, though of a medium- or long-term
maturity, have generally been undertaken via special purpose vehicles registered in western
Europe that onlend the bond proceeds to Kazakhstani banks.

Development priorities were outlined in the president’s February 2005 speech “Kazakhstan

15.
The authorities emphasized that the spending increases were aimed at improving
living standards in an equitable fashion. They also observed that large differentials
between government and private sector salaries had made it difficult to attract and retain
qualified staff in the civil service. In the education and health sectors, where salaries are less
than half the average for the entire nonagricultural economy, the wage increase is based on
equity considerations and should help improve the quality of services.11 The authorities also
noted that social sector programs are being broadened in an effort to improve living standards
of the financially vulnerable members of society. The pension system is being reorganized,
and social benefits for the disabled are being expanded through enhancements to the
disability insurance program. Under the social jobs program, local governments are helping
support temporary employment for the socially vulnerable, thereby improving their prospects
for securing permanent employment. Professional and vocational training programs are also
in place to assist in skills acquisition.
16.
While welcoming the increase in social spending, staff cautioned that large
across-the-board pay increases are not the most effective way to remedy difficulties
faced by the civil service. In addition, the pay increases could intensify inflationary
pressures, especially if they lead to an acceleration in private sector wages.12 Moreover, in
11

The government wage bill, which includes salaries of health and education workers, will
rise from 3.8 percent of GDP in 2004 to 4.1 percent in 2005.
12

The authorities estimate that the supplementary budget will raise inflation by about
¼–½ percentage point in 2005, although there are significant uncertainties. In particular, the
impact of the minimum wage—which is also being increased by about one third with the
supplementary budget—is difficult to judge.

- 14 -

view of the planned further 30 percent increase in civil service salaries from 2007, these
commitments will have longer-term fiscal implications that could require a compression in
social or infrastructure spending to ensure fiscal sustainability. The authorities recognized the
need to address issues relating to the structure of the civil service and its pay, and are
receiving technical assistance from the World Bank on designing a strategy. This will likely
include steps to better target pay increases; rationalize ministries’ discretion to award
bonuses; link remuneration more closely to performance, merit, and regional cost of living
differences; and address employment redundancies in some areas.
17.
The longer-term fiscal strategy is being refined through changes in the rules
governing the NFRK to help guide the decision of how much of the oil income to save.
Under the new rules, which will likely be implemented with the 2007 budget, all central
government oil revenue is expected to accrue to the NFRK, and the authorities are
considering linking the release of funds from the NFRK to the budget with the amount of
development spending (which broadly corresponds to capital expenditure), while keeping the
rest of the budget in balance (Box 5). In their view, such a link would help ensure adequate
saving by tying the amount of oil income spent to public investment aimed at enhancing the
future productivity of the economy. Staff welcomed the plans to integrate the NFRK with the
budget, but noted that setting the non-oil deficit equal to development spending was not
sufficient to anchor fiscal policy, and that the non-oil deficit would need to be set in a
medium-term fiscal framework to ensure sustainability. The authorities agreed that
sustainability considerations would have to guide fiscal policy.13
18.
The new NFRK rules should also enhance the transparency of oil revenues and
their use. The authorities indicated that they would request a fiscal ROSC reassessment,
which they thought would aid the formulation of the new rules. They also indicated that a
decision on Kazakhstan’s participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI) would be taken soon, following consultation with oil companies operating in
Kazakhstan on their willingness to participate.
19.
The authorities saw some scope for further tax cuts over the medium term. They
noted that a reduction in the tax burden could help diversify the economy by boosting
investment in the non-oil sector. However, they did not anticipate any major changes to the
tax system in the near term because of the limited fiscal space afforded by their ambitious
social program. Moreover, they emphasized that the full impact of the 2004 tax cuts needed
to be assessed before decisions on further changes were taken.

13

Chapter II of the 2005 Selected Issues Paper (forthcoming) assesses the sustainable longterm path for the non-oil deficit that would maintain Kazakhstan’s oil wealth in real per
capita terms.

- 15 -

Box 5. Kazakhstan: Oil Revenue Management and the NFRK
The NFRK was established in 2001 to reduce the economic impact of volatile oil prices and serve as a vehicle
for saving part of Kazakhstan’s oil income for future generations. A significant portion of fiscal revenue from
oil—which increased from $0.2 billion in 1999 to over $3 billion (7.4 percent of GDP) in 2004—has been
saved in the NFRK. The NFRK balance, which is invested abroad, amounted to $5.2 billion at end-April 2005.
The rules governing the NFRK are complex and have changed over time. Under the current system, fiscal
payments from identified companies in the natural resources sector are subject to transfer to the NFRK. The
number of companies was reduced in 2004, and the transfer of their fiscal payments is calculated on the basis
of a reference oil price. Privatization receipts, special bonus payments, and royalties from certain natural
resource companies have also been allocated to the NFRK.
The authorities are presently in the process of redesigning the NFRK rules. They aim to fully integrate the
NFRK with the budget, and devise a rule to guide the use of oil revenue, possibly by linking the non-oil fiscal
deficit to the amount of development spending.
As the experience in other countries indicates that the existence of an oil fund by itself does not ensure fiscal
discipline, staff recommended setting the non-oil deficit in a long-term fiscal sustainability framework. Based
on the current outlook for world oil prices

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
20.
The choice of a looser fiscal stance implies further real exchange rate
appreciation. Staff recommended accepting this through nominal appreciation rather than
higher inflation. As regards intervention policy, the NBK does not have an official target for
the real exchange rate, as evidenced by the significant appreciation of the tenge in real
effective terms (5 percent) in 2004. However, their intervention policy appears to be guided
by real exchange rate developments. The authorities indicated that intervention had been
scaled back sharply in recent months and the NBK had actually sold foreign currency on a

- 16 -

net basis in the first quarter of 2005. They reiterated their commitment to maintaining low
inflation and noted that no change in the NBK’s inflation objective (a band of
4.9–6.5 percent for average inflation for the year) had so far been announced, although they
acknowledged that the supplementary budget could push inflation slightly above the band.
However, in light of the significant appreciation of the tenge last year, the authorities were
concerned that further strengthening of the currency could hamper competitiveness. Some
officials saw scope for containing real appreciation, at least over the near term, by limiting
nominal appreciation.
21.
The NBK’s ability to combat inflation is being strengthened. Draft legislation,
currently with parliament, will put in place a mechanism to recapitalize the NBK to offset
losses from monetary operations. In addition, existing ambiguity over which agency—the
NBK or the FSA—has the authority to adjust reserve requirements will be removed in favor
of the NBK. Staff supported the planned recapitalization, recommending that it be in the
form of tradable securities at market interest rates and suggesting that further profit transfers
from the NBK to the budget—which amounted to 0.3 percent of GDP in 2004—not take
place until the NBK posted positive net profits. The mission noted that continued large-scale
exchange market intervention to resist nominal appreciation could encourage even greater
capital inflows and require still higher sterilization, and encouraged the authorities to move
quickly to extend the current reserve requirement—which applies only to short-term
domestic liabilities—to foreign liabilities and all domestic liabilities. NBK officials indicated
that they did not envisage profit transfers to the budget in 2005. They said that various
options regarding the coverage, rate, and remuneration of reserve requirements were under
consideration.
22.
The authorities aim to move to inflation targeting over the medium term.
However, the relatively shallow money market, limited instruments, and unpredictable
money demand amidst ongoing rapid remonetization preclude moving to such a framework
in the near term. Noting progress at the NBK in modeling inflation and the monetary
transmission process, staff encouraged continued efforts to prepare for inflation targeting and
observed that greater exchange rate flexibility would facilitate the eventual transition.
23.
Remaining capital account restrictions are to be removed by 2007. Existing
regulations and restrictions are administered liberally, and their removal is not expected to
result in major shifts in the pattern of capital flows. Nevertheless, the authorities see a free
capital account regime as an important step in Kazakhstan’s integration with international
financial markets. The mission noted that while existing restrictions mainly govern capital
outflows, their removal could well attract increased inflows if investors find the new policy
environment more attractive. A more flexible exchange rate regime would help cushion the
economy from volatile capital flows while reducing speculative flows associated with
perceptions of one-sided exchange rate risk. Staff also emphasized the importance of a strong
and well-supervised banking system to limit risks stemming from sudden shifts in capital
flows.

was 15.9 percent at end-2004—signs
of some deterioration in loan quality even as credit booms raise concern. FSA officials noted,
however, that loan classification rules are conservative, as most of the loans that are
classified as substandard continue to be serviced on a timely basis.
25.
The authorities recognize the risks in the banking sector and are taking
measures to mitigate them. A number of measures are under consideration, including
higher liquidity ratios, tighter asset classification rules, and steps to close gaps in prudential
regulations over related-party lending. In addition, Kazakhstan’s first credit bureau has been
established, which FSA officials expect will increase the availability of credit information on
households and small enterprises and thereby facilitate the application of appropriate scoring
methods for classifying—for prudential and provisioning purposes—loans to individuals and
small firms. The FSA has also announced the incorporation of market and operational risks
in capital adequacy requirements, using elements of the Basle II framework.
26.
Specific measures to reduce risks associated with banks’ real estate lending are
under consideration. FSA officials saw heightened risk stemming from the rapid growth in
mortgages and consumer lending, which had more than tripled and doubled, respectively,
over the past year. Based on a broad definition that includes consumer loans actually used for
property-related purposes, they estimate that up to 37 percent of banks’ loan portfolios is
exposed to the real estate sector. While direct limits on banks’ property exposure were not
14

- 18 -

regarded as useful because they could be easily circumvented—for example by disguising
mortgage loans as consumer lending—FSA officials indicated that they were considering
applying tighter loan concentration ratios for banks with higher property exposure and
tougher asset classification rules for property and consumer loans. In addition, the extension
of income disclosure requirements—which presently apply only to mortgages—to
commercial property loans (including construction) was under consideration. Such a step
would help curb credit demand, thereby cooling the real estate market. Consideration is also
being given to developing an index of real estate prices, which would help in monitoring
property market developments and associated risks.
27.
Increased bank borrowing abroad to fund domestic credit expansion also
warrants close attention. To guard against currency mismatches on banks’ balance sheets,
open foreign currency position limits have been reduced from 50 percent of bank capital to
30 percent.15 A tightening of classification rules for foreign currency loans to borrowers with
limited foreign currency cash flow is also under consideration. Staff recommended close
scrutiny over long-term bonds issued by banks to ascertain whether the associated contracts
contain options that would permit creditors to exercise early repayment, thus affecting the
bonds’ maturity profile. FSA officials indicated that banks’ long-term foreign borrowing was
under standard loan contracts that did not contain such options, but agreed that close
attention was warranted. They also indicated that they planned to incorporate country risk in
the calculation of capital adequacy ratios to stem risks associated with banks’ cross-border
lending, and observed that broadening reserve requirements to include foreign liabilities
would help contain foreign borrowing.
28.
Intensified supervisory activity to complement the regulatory initiatives is
critical. Regular in-depth bank examinations will be needed to ensure compliance with
regulations, supported by continuous off-site monitoring and analysis of bank balance sheets.
The rapid growth of the banking sector calls for increased supervisory resources to assess
risks and vulnerabilities, and care should be taken to avoid overstretching existing
supervisory capacity. The authorities agreed that an elevated degree of supervisory vigilance
was appropriate and increasing resources available to the FSA was a high priority.
29.
The authorities are keen to develop Almaty into a regional financial center over
the medium term. In light of Kazakhstani banks’ increased activity overseas and the lower
funding costs faced by Kazakhstani borrowers in relation to entities in neighboring countries,
the authorities see scope for an expanded role for Kazakhstani institutions as financial
intermediaries for the region. A number of measures are being considered to establish
supporting legal and regulatory infrastructure, including a contract enforcement system with
related courts and draft legislation in the areas of anti-money laundering and combating the
financing of terrorism, protection of minority shareholder rights, and insider trading and
market manipulation. In addition, a draft securitization law is under consideration to facilitate
15

- 19 -

the development of the securities market. Staff welcomed plans to enhance the financial
sector’s regional role by upgrading infrastructure and regulatory standards, but cautioned that
this places even higher priority on developing a suitable legal framework and a strong
supervisory system, and on enhancing cooperation with supervisory agencies in other
countries.
E. Structural Reforms
30.
Structural reform is critical for sustained growth of the non-oil sector. Noting
Kazakhstan’s relatively low ranking in the areas of competition policy and enterprise
restructuring in the EBRD’s transition indicators, staff recommended an acceleration of
reforms to promote competition and thereby lower user costs for infrastructural services. In
addition, reforms to reduce excessive regulation, cumbersome inspection procedures, and
restrictions on procurement and immigrant employment will lower the cost of doing
business. Staff also underscored the importance of institutional reform—including with
regard to procurement systems, public investment planning and monitoring, and the
development of a sound mechanism for transferring resources to local governments—to
improve economic governance. The authorities indicated that significant progress had been
achieved over the past year, including the preparation of draft legislation to boost
competition and investment in the telecommunications, railroad, and electricity sectors. They
acknowledged, however, that the reform momentum had slowed in recent months but
indicated that they were aware of the need to press ahead with further reforms, especially
since the ongoing upward pressure on the real exchange rate could lead to an erosion in the
non-oil sector’s competitiveness.16
31.
WTO accession will also enhance growth potential. Staff welcomed recent steps to
make national legislation and foreign trade policy enforcement practices compliant with the
WTO, and recommended an acceleration in bilateral market access negotiations. The
authorities noted that bilateral negotiations were progressing and, meanwhile, the
government had intensified its campaign to apprise domestic stakeholders of the benefits of
WTO accession. Further trade liberalization is also underway; nontariff barriers have been
reduced, a comprehensive review of import tariffs has been launched with a view to reducing
specific tariffs rates and rate dispersion, and a number of agreements have been signed with
neighboring countries to enhance regional trade.17
32.
The authorities are seeking to further boost the non-oil sector through sectoral
initiatives and expanded lending by specialized financial institutions. They explained that
16

Chapter IV of the 2005 Selected Issues Paper (forthcoming) assesses long-term prospects
for the real exchange rate of the tenge.

17

The average tariff—at about 8 percent (excluding specific tariffs) since 1998—is relatively
low.

- 20 -

the “clusters” initiative, which is being piloted in seven industries, aims to establish a
dialogue between business and government in order to enhance companies’ productivity.
Government support will focus on infrastructure provision and ensuring the availability of
suitably skilled labor. They also indicated that the role of the development institutions was to
fill a void in the availability of long-term financing, and emphasized that safeguards were in
place to ensure that project selection was on a strictly commercial basis and free from
political influence.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Kazakhstan’s economy continues to grow rapidly and, underpinned by high oil
prices, the outlook remains highly favorable. This presents an opportunity for Kazakhstan
to address pressing social needs and improve living standards. Securing such gains, however,
will depend critically on continued management of petroleum wealth in an efficient and
sustainable manner while keeping inflationary pressures in check and reinvigorating
structural reform to promote diversification of the economy.
34.
The fiscal position in 2005 remains within the sustainable level implied by the
current outlook for oil prices and production, and the further increase in social
spending is welcomed. The planned increases in civil service salaries, however, could
exacerbate inflationary pressures and, in the context of the longer-term policy to narrow the
public-private wage gap, it will be essential to reexamine reforms to improve the structure of
the civil service. More generally, in light of the continued rapid expansion of government
expenditures, intensified scrutiny over spending efficiency is required.
35.
Greater exchange rate flexibility is needed to dampen inflationary pressures.
Resisting nominal appreciation may postpone somewhat the inevitable adjustment of the real
exchange rate to the increased spending of oil revenue, but will push up inflation eventually.
It would be important, therefore, to allow sufficient upward exchange rate flexibility in order
to bring inflation down to comfortably within the NBK’s band. Achieving the inflation
objective will also demonstrate that the pursuit of price stability is the primary goal of
monetary policy, consistent with the authorities’ intention to move to inflation targeting over
the medium term. To the extent that the authorities give priority to maintaining a stable
nominal exchange rate, the fiscal stance would need to be reassessed.
36.
Increased exchange rate flexibility will also facilitate the conduct of monetary
policy in an environment of large capital inflows. In the near term, however, while the
necessary infrastructure to support a full inflation targeting regime is being developed, some
exchange market intervention and accompanying sterilization may still be needed. In this
connection, reserve requirements should quickly be extended to cover foreign liabilities as
well as longer-term domestic liabilities in order to aid the conduct of monetary policy. The
authorities should also move ahead with the planned recapitalization of the NBK. This will
transparently place sterilization costs on the budget and help convince markets that monetary
policy will not be constrained by income considerations.

- 21 -

37.
Emerging risks in the banking system require heightened vigilance. While the
continuing rapid remonetization and significant dedollarization reflect confidence in the
system, the recent surge in bank lending warrants close monitoring of the quality of loan
portfolios. Staff recommends early implementation of the measures under consideration,
including enhanced monitoring of property price developments, to stem risks related to
banks’ foreign borrowing and property-related lending. Efforts to close gaps in prudential
regulations over related-party lending are also welcome, as are plans to mitigate risks
associated with cross-border lending by incorporating country risk in capital adequacy
requirements.
38.
Vigorous banking supervision will need to supplement regulatory measures.
Supervisory resources should keep pace with the growth and development of the financial
system, particularly in view of the planned capital account liberalization and efforts to
promote Almaty as a regional financial center. Enhanced procedures for the exchange of
information with central banks and supervisory agencies in neighboring countries will
facilitate effective consolidated supervision of financial institutions. Prompt approval and
implementation of enhanced legislation to meet international standards in combating money
laundering and the financing of terrorism is also critical.
39.
The initiative to redesign the longer-term oil wealth management strategy and
the rules governing the NFRK is timely. Full integration of the NFRK with the budget will
improve the transparency of oil revenue and inform fiscal policy decisions. To safeguard oil
wealth and protect the economy from fluctuations in world oil prices, the release of funds
from the NFRK to the budget should be determined on the basis of a medium-term fiscal
sustainability framework—grounded by prudent assumptions regarding longer-term oil prices
and production—that targets the non-oil deficit. Adoption of the EITI would further enhance
transparency.
40.
Decisions on further sizable tax cuts should be aligned with the new oil wealth
management strategy. A reduction in the tax burden of the non-oil sector may spur non-oil
growth over the medium term. However, caution is required in this area, as further cuts
should be based on the availability of sufficient budgetary resources once priority spending
needs have been met, and should await a full assessment of the impact of the 2004 tax cuts.
Proposals to differentiate tax rates across sectors, particularly VAT rates, would be highly
distortive and should be resisted.
41.
Reinvigoration of structural reforms is necessary to improve the investment
climate and enhance economic governance. In particular, there is a need to speed up
institutional development, especially in relation to procurement systems and public
investment monitoring. In addition, an acceleration of reforms in the areas of competition
policy and enterprise restructuring will improve the provision of basic infrastructural services
and lower the cost of doing business in Kazakhstan. Early WTO accession and further trade
liberalization, particularly through a reduction in tariff dispersion and further steps to
facilitate regional trade, will also boost the non-oil sector’s growth prospects.

42.
The expansion of development institutions and industrial promotion initiatives
warrants caution. Staff urges a high degree of vigilance to ensure that the clusters initiative
remains focused on labor training and infrastructure provision, and that development
institutions’ lending is well-targeted and restricted to addressing genuine market failures in
the availability of long-term financing. Tax incentives and credit provision on subsidized
terms or to projects of uncertain commercial viability should be avoided. International
experience suggests that special incentives and subsidies carry significant risk of resource
misallocation, reduction in fiscal revenue, and extension of the government’s role in the
economy.
43.
While data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes, better data
disaggregation into the oil and non-oil sectors would aid macroeconomic analysis. Staff
therefore recommends adopting a more analytically rigorous separation of national accounts
data (including imports) into the oil and non-oil sectors of the economy. Technical assistance
in this area would be helpful.
44.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Kazakhstan take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ For 2001 and 2002, the numbers also reflect the effect of market valuation, in addition to transactions. The start-up assets in 2001 included
$660 million from the sale of a 5 percent government share in TCO. The remaining balance was from oil revenue.
2/ Estimates and projections are based on GDP at market exchange rates. Import data have been revised for the period 2000–04 in light of
revisions to NBK's cif coefficients in March 2005. Reported figures for 2001 curent account have been adjusted for staff estimates of the
underinvoicing of exports.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

Sources: The Kazakhstan authorities, and Fund staff estimates.
1/ The National Bank of Kazakhstan does not compile short-term debt statistics on a remaining maturity basis. Before 2000, the short-term debt data
are on an "original maturity" basis. From 2000 onward, the short-term debt is estimated by Fund staff on a remaining maturity basis.
2/ Includes deposits from Special Purpose Vehicles, which are set up and owned by Kazakhstani commercial banks abroad and used for channeling
foreign financing to Kazakhstan.
3/ Total external public debt minus gross official reserves, and minus NFRK assets.
4/ Excludes transitory domestic currency deposits.
5/ Kazakhstan eurobonds are mostly held by domestic investors who have limited investment opportunities abroad. Therefore, bond spreads of
Kazakhstan are not comparable to those of other countries and do not fully reflect country risks.

Safeguards Assessments

The safeguards assessment procedures are not applicable to the National Bank of Kazakhstan
(NBK) at this time.
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangements
The currency of Kazakhstan is the tenge, which was introduced in November 1993. The
official exchange rate is determined on the basis of foreign exchange auctions that are held
daily. Auctions are held for U.S. dollars, euros, and Russian rubles, and official rates are

- 32 -

APPENDIX I

quoted for over 30 other currencies on the basis of cross-rates. Since late 1999, the exchange
rate regime has been a managed float with no pre-announced path, although the tenge has
appreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar since 2002. On April 29, 2005, the rate was
T 131.61 per U.S. dollar. The exchange rates at numerous exchange bureaus are very close to
the auction rate, and the spread between buying and selling rates is very small. The exchange
system is free from restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions.
IX.

Article IV Consultation

Kazakhstan is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last consultation was
concluded on April 30, 2004 (see IMF Country Report No. 04/339).

FSAP Participation and ROSCS

Kazakhstan participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2000.
The staff report on the Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) was issued on
November 27, 2000. The FSSA included the following ROSC modules: Basel Core
Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, Core Principles for Systemically Important
Payment Systems, Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial
Policies, IOSCO Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation, and IAIS Insurance
Core Principles. An FSAP update mission took place in February 2004. The fiscal
transparency module was completed in October 2002 and the final report published in April
2003. A data module mission took place in April/May 2002, and its final report was
published in March 2003.
XI.

Technical Assistance

Kazakhstan has received considerable technical assistance and training by the Fund in
virtually every area of economic policy, including through about 75 technical assistance
missions provided during 1993–2003 by FAD, LEG, MFD, STA, and the IMF Institute. In
addition to short-term missions, the Fund has provided resident advisors to the National
Bank of Kazakhstan, to the Agency of Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan, and to
the ministry of finance. Other international agencies and governments, including the
World Bank, EU TACIS, EBRD, UNDP, and OECD, also are providing a wide variety of
technical assistance.
The following list summarizes the technical assistance provided by the Fund to Kazakhstan
since 1995.
Monetary and Financial Systems
Technical assistance has enabled steady progress to be made in a number of arrears related to
monetary and exchange affairs, including banking legislation, central bank accounting,
payments system reform, central bank organization and management, foreign operations and

Statistics
The Fund’s technical assistance program in statistics has focused on the development of the
institutional framework appropriate to the needs of a market economy. The assistance has
concentrated on establishing procedures for collecting and compiling monetary, government
finance, balance of payments (including external trade), national accounts, producer price
statistics, and consumer price statistics in accordance with international standards. Since

Kazakhstan—Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of May 2, 2005)
Kazakhstan became a member of the World Bank and International Development
Association in July 1992, and of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in September
1993. The Bank’s lending program has been curtailed in recent years as a result of the
country’s reduced borrowing needs. At present, there are nine active projects with a total
commitment of $598 million (eight IBRD loans and one grant), of which $365 million have
been disbursed. The Bank is preparing five new operations in support of the agricultural
sector, the environment, ecology, innovation and technology transfer, and possibly customs
administration, with an expected financing envelope of about $180 million.
A Country Partnership Strategy, agreed in September 2004, focusing on knowledge transfer
(some of which embedded in lending operations) and a strategic partnership. It will build on
the $3 million three-year Joint Economic Research Program, which is cofinanced by the
Government of Kazakhstan.
The IFC maintains 20 active operations, equivalent to total financing of $330 million,
including syndications in the financial sector, manufacturing, agribusiness, oil and gas, and
extending IFC’s Reach Program; to date, $137.7 million have been disbursed.
The Bank is assisting the government in attracting grants from the Global Environmental
Facility, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and, together with UNAIDS,
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria, and TB.

APPENDIX III

Kazakhstan––Relations with the EBRD
(As of April 30, 2005)
As of end-April, 2005, the EBRD’s gross cumulative disbursements amounted to
€750 million. The current portfolio is composed of 71 projects with a total value of
€2.3 billion, of which €1.1 billion are financed by the EBRD. The Bank expects to sign new
project agreements in Kazakhstan on the order of €200–250 million per year.
EBRD’s strategic priorities include: (a) the advancement of commercial principles in public
sector infrastructure, including through nonsovereign lending; (b) the promotion of economic
diversification through support for domestic and foreign investment, SMEs, and trade
liberalization; and (c) the development of the financial sector in order to increase its capital
base, enhance its stability, encourage prudent credit expansion, and facilitate the
diversification of domestic financial assets.
Assistance to Kazakhstan focuses on infrastructure operations, the financial sector and
general industry. The infrastructure projects target the development of roads, railroads, ports,
airports, and telecommunications. In 2004, EBRD credited MunaiTas, a company jointly run
by Kazakhstan’s oil pipeline operator and China’s largest oil and gas group, $81.6 million for
a project linking the landlocked country’s oilfields to its main export routes. The 10-year
loan will finance construction a part of its 448 km oil pipeline connecting oilfields in the
Aktobe region of central Kazakhstan to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium and the AtyrauSamara export pipelines. Also in 2004, EBRD agreed to provide without sovereign guarantee
$60 million to the state-owned Kazakhstan Electricity Grid Operating Company for the
construction of a new electricity line facilitating the transmission of surplus power from
north to south Kazakhstan (cofinanced with Raiffeisen Bank Österreich, Bayerische
Landesbank, and Kazakhstan Development Bank). In September 2003, EBRD provided a
loan amounting to €48 million to Kazakhtelecom as part of a larger support package
involving international banks and the donor community. EBRD also provided $119 million
for the rehabilitation of the 900 km road between Kazakhstan’s main port of Aktau on the
Caspian Sea and the regional center of Atyrau. The Bank also provides targeted technical
assistance in the areas of tariff reform and infrastructure.
In the financial sector, the Kazakhstan Small Business Program has disbursed since 1998 in
excess of 130,000 microcredits totaling over $800 million. EBRD increases its efforts to
support nonbank financial sector such as insurance, leasing, and mortgages. In February
2005, it signed a $10 million loan to BTA Ipoteka to finance residential mortgages.

APPENDIX IV

Kazakhstan––Relations with the Asian Development Bank
(As of April 30, 2005)
Kazakhstan became a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1994. As of
31 December 2004, total loan commitments amounted to $501.6 million, covering nine
projects in agriculture and natural resources, education, finance, transport and
communication, and water supply, sanitation and waste management.
At end-April 2005, total loan disbursements amounted to $424 million. In 2003, ADB
approved a $34.6 million loan for a rural area water supply and sanitation sector project, the
first loan since 2001. The current country strategy and program was prepared in 2003 and is
being updated annually. ADB emphasizes knowledge transfer as one of the main pillar of
collaboration. ADB’s focus in Kazakhstan in 2005–07 will be rural poverty reduction and
activities with a regional impact. The former will be supported by activities in rural water
supply, rural development, natural resources management, small and medium enterprise
support, and rural education. The latter could include work in the transport, trade and finance,
and energy sectors. Kazakhstan is no longer eligible for concessional resources from the
Asian Development Fund.
The ADB has provided Kazakhstan with technical assistance (TA) grants in several sectors,
including agriculture, education, finance, pension reform, transportation, energy, water
supply and sanitation, aid coordination and management, public investment programming,
and poverty reduction planning and implementation. As of April 30 2005, total TA
commitments amounted to $28.05 million, covering 57 projects.

APPENDIX V

Kazakhstan—Statistical Issues
The quality and coverage of Kazakhstan’s economic statistics are generally adequate for
macroeconomic surveillance. The April 2002 data ROSC mission found that international
standards for methodological soundness, accuracy and reliability of data are either fully
observed or largely observed by Kazakhstan. Nevertheless, there were shortcomings in some
statistical practices that could detract from accurate and timely analysis of economic and
financial developments and the formulation of appropriate policies.
Kazakhstan has made considerable progress since the 2002 data ROSC mission.
On March 24, 2003 Kazakhstan became the 53rd subscriber to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS), marking a major step forward in the development of the
country’s statistical system. It is the first country to graduate from the General Data
Dissemination System to the SDDS, and the second country of the Commonwealth of
Independent States to subscribe to the SDDS.
Notwithstanding the progress achieved since 2002, a more analytically rigorous
disaggregation of national accounts into the oil and non-oil sectors of the economy would aid
in assessing macroeconomic developments and formulating the policy stance.
Sector specific issues
In the area of national accounts, several weaknesses remain in both the quality of GDP
estimates by sector produced by the National Statistical Agency and the quality and
timeliness of GDP estimates by expenditures. First, the quality of GDP estimates by
industry is affected by the poor coverage of production and financial statistics, particularly
concerning small enterprises and informal activities. Second, while some progress has been
made in making GDP estimates by final expenditure consistent with output-based
measures, there remain substantial shortcomings, particularly in the estimation of fixed
capital formation.
As a result of extensive technical assistance, the quality of fiscal data has improved, in
particular following the consolidation, in 1999, of most extrabudgetary and social
security funds into the fiscal accounts and the provision of more detailed expenditure data
on a quarterly basis. However, the coverage of oil revenues, particularly royalties, is not
transparent and may be significantly undervalued. Progress has also been made in the
establishment of a classification of the fiscal accounts consistent with the Fund’s
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) methodology. However, as a
result of the reorganization of the public sector, including the redefinition of budgetary units,
difficulties have arisen with regard to the recording and reporting of expenditure arrears.
Since 1997, the authorities have reported detailed data for publication in the GFS Yearbook.
The latest data reported for publication cover consolidated general government and are
presented using the new template consistent with the GFSM 2001. The ministry of finance
also provides monthly indicators (general government) for publication in International
Financial Statistics (IFS).

- 40 -

APPENDIX V

The existing framework for compiling monetary statistics generally conforms to
recommended Fund methodology, and data are compiled on a timely basis. Steps are being
taken by the NBK to further improve the quality and coverage of data. In particular, the
chart of accounts for commercial banks has been revised to enable the NBK to distinguish
sectors and financial instruments in accordance with the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. The NBK has extended institutional coverage to compile a financial sector survey
that includes the Development Bank and credit companies. The authorities have started
implementing the recommendations of past money and banking statistics missions regarding
the use of residency criteria as defined in the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition
(BPM5), including changing the data base where foreign branches and foreign companies’
representatives should be classified as resident. However, there are inconsistencies among
banks in recording syndicated lending which can distort the measure of net foreign assets
and credit to the domestic economy. Also, data revisions in the monetary statistics are not
synchronized with those for the International Investment Position and balance of payments
statistics. MCD and STA staff are working with the authorities to harmonize the presentation
of monetary statistics.
In the area of balance of payments, the overall quality and timeliness of data are
satisfactory. Considerable progress has been made in implementing the Fund technical
assistance recommendations to address two major deficiencies.
First, the coverage of trade data has been improved through a survey to determine the
volume of shuttle trade and travel expenses. The NBK has also worked closely with relevant
agencies, including the STA staff, to update the ratios used for adjusting c.i.f. imports to an
f.o.b. basis, which was implemented in March 2005 and resulted in revision of import data
from 2000 to 2004. Compilation of export and import price indices has been initiated, and
historical data are also now available. Nevertheless, the timeliness of trade data remains an
issue; improvements can be expected with the continuing computerization of customs
administration. In addition, separation of import data into those related to the oil sector would
aid in macroeconomic analysis and assessment of the policy stance.
Second, the NBK has initiated changes and additions to the Law of the Republic of
Kazakhstan “On State Statistics” to improve the coverage of international operations of
branch offices of foreign companies and, thus, bring foreign direct investment statistics in
line with the standards set forth in BPM5. In particular, work is continuing to ensure the
correct treatment of construction services provided by foreign companies that operate local
branch offices. The Data ROSC mission in 2002 also noted some other shortcomings in the
compilation of balance of payments statistics. These shortcomings include (a) commercial
banks defining nonresidents on a legal basis rather than on the BPM5 principle, affecting data
reporting by these banks for balance of payments purposes; and (b) discrepancies between
balance of payments and other macroeconomic statistics.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Kazakhstan
On July 1, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Kazakhstan.1
Background
Kazakhstan’s economy continued to grow rapidly and real GDP growth remained robust at an
estimated 9.4 percent in 2004. Increased hydrocarbon production continued to underpin growth,
although the output of nonhydrocarbon sectors also expanded at a rapid pace. Consumer price
inflation picked up to 6.9 percent, near the upper end of the National Bank of Kazakhstan’s
(NBK) band of 5–7 percent. Labor market conditions tightened, with real wages increasing by
14 percent, the unemployment rate declining to 8.4 percent, and a marked pickup in
immigration. Activity remained strong in early 2005 with an estimated 9.3 percent real GDP
growth in the first quarter, and inflation picked up to an average of 7.1 percent during
January–April. Sustained rapid growth has led to a significant reduction in poverty, but some other
social indicators remain weak.

Fiscal policy imparted stimulus to the economy as the non-oil deficit widened by about
1½ percentage points to 4.7 percent of GDP in 2004, while the overall budget surplus remained
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2broadly unchanged at 2.7 percent of GDP. The impact of tax cuts was partly offset by higher
nontax revenue and one-off receipts. As a result, non-oil revenues increased broadly in line with
estimated non-oil GDP, but declined in relation to overall GDP. On the expenditure side, public
spending increased by 0.8 percent of GDP, reflecting a rise in social expenditures by
0.4 percentage point as well as sizable increases in the housing, agriculture, and energy areas.
Assets of the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK) rose by US$1.4 billion
(3.4 percent of GDP) to over US$5 billion.
The external position strengthened further in 2004, supported by high oil prices and large-scale
external borrowing by banks. The current account swung into surplus, with the rise in
hydrocarbon export receipts more than offsetting a very rapid expansion of imports and higher
profit remittances abroad. Non-oil exports also expanded rapidly, aided by buoyant nonfuel
commodity prices. The capital account surplus widened, reflecting continued large foreign direct
investment inflows and an increase in private sector external borrowing, as banks took
advantage of low international interest rates and favorable investor perception of Kazakhstan to
mobilize funds abroad through syndicated loans and eurobond issuance. As a result, official
reserves (excluding NFRK assets) rose to US$9.3 billion at end-2004, equivalent to six months
of imports, with a marked pickup in the pace of accumulation during the last quarter of the year.
The conduct of monetary policy has been complicated by the large inflows of private capital,
surging oil earnings, and buoyant demand conditions. In an effort to stem upward pressure on
the tenge while containing money growth, the NBK supplemented its exchange market
intervention with continued large-scale sterilization operations. In the event, with sterilization
costs mounting, the increase in the NBK’s reserves was not fully sterilized. Reserve and broad
money growth accelerated, the tenge appreciated by 9 percent against the U.S. dollar and
4 percent against the ruble, and the NBK incurred a net loss for 2004.
With the deposit base expanding and external funding readily available at attractive terms, bank
lending has boomed. Credit surged by over 50 percent in 2004, while deposits increased by
about 70 percent, with the share of tenge deposits rising markedly to almost two thirds.
Property-related lending expanded especially rapidly and, by end-2004, accounted for
18 percent of bank credit. Banks have also become increasingly active internationally on the
assets side, through branch operations, acquisitions of financial entities in neighboring
countries, and a pickup in cross border lending operations. The banking system’s ratios of
classified loans and loan losses have edged up.
Although considerable progress in the structural area has been achieved since the early 1990s,
the pace of reform implementation has slowed in recent years. Privatization of small- and
medium-sized enterprises is basically complete, prices have been liberalized, and a framework
for prudential regulation and supervision of the financial sector is in place, including with the
establishment of the Financial Supervision Agency in 2004. In addition, steps have been taken
to bring foreign trade policy legislation and enforcement practices into compliance with the
World Trade Organization. However, transition indicators compiled and reported by the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development show little improvement since the late
1990s in the areas of competition policy and enterprise restructuring.

-3-

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Kazakhstani authorities’ prudent macroeconomic policies
in the past several years, which have been critical in achieving rapid economic growth, declining
unemployment, and sustained reduction in poverty. Looking forward, Kazakhstan’s economic
outlook remains highly favorable, providing a good opportunity to continue addressing the
country’s pressing social needs and regional disparities, and improving living standards on a
lasting basis. Kazakhstan’s sizable petroleum wealth offers tremendous opportunities but also
presents significant challenges. Directors agreed that meeting these needs and challenges will
require continued efficient and sustainable management of petroleum wealth, keeping
inflationary pressures in check, and implementing structural reforms to promote economic
diversification.
Directors noted that the fiscal stance remains consistent with fiscal sustainability, given the
outlook for oil prices and production. While welcoming the increase in social spending, Directors
cautioned that the large across-the-board increases in civil service salaries could exacerbate
inflationary pressures and have longer-term fiscal implications. Accordingly, they encouraged
the authorities to consider reforms aimed at restructuring the civil service and improving its pay
structure. Directors also emphasized the importance of intensifying scrutiny over spending
efficiency.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to maintaining low inflation. Given the choice of
a looser fiscal stance, they considered that sufficient upward exchange rate flexibility should be
allowed to dampen inflationary pressures and bring inflation down within the NBK’s band.
Achievement of the inflation objective would clearly demonstrate the commitment of the
authorities to price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy. Directors also discussed the
impact that appreciation of the tenge could have on competitiveness. They recognized that the
overall policy mix, particularly the quality of fiscal and structural policies, would be crucial for
generating the productivity gains needed to preserve the competitiveness of the non-oil sector
over the longer term.
Directors noted that the conduct of monetary policy in the present context characterized by
large capital inflows, and given the authorities’ plan to remove the remaining capital account
restrictions by 2007, would benefit from increased exchange rate flexibility. Looking ahead,
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to move to a full-fledged inflation-targeting regime
over the medium term. While the related supporting infrastructure is being developed, some
exchange market intervention and accompanying sterilization may still be warranted in the near
term to avoid excessively rapid appreciation. Directors welcomed plans to broaden reserve
requirements, and agreed that coverage of all foreign and domestic liabilities would aid the
conduct of monetary policy. They also looked forward to the planned recapitalization of the
NBK.

-4Directors saw the ongoing process of remonetization and dedollarization as a welcome sign of
increased confidence in the banking system. While the banking system remains well capitalized,
the recent surge in bank lending warrants close monitoring of the quality of loan portfolios.
Directors urged the authorities to implement promptly the measures under consideration to stem
risks related to banks’ foreign borrowing and property-related lending. They welcomed efforts to
close gaps in prudential regulations over related-party lending as well as the plans to mitigate
risks associated with cross-border lending.
Directors urged the authorities to ensure that banking supervision, including supervisory
resources, keeps pace with the growth and development of the financial system, particularly in
light of the ongoing efforts to promote Almaty as a regional financial center. To facilitate
effective consolidated supervision of financial institutions, Directors encouraged the authorities
to enhance procedures for the exchange of information with central banks and supervisory
agencies in neighboring countries. They also called for approval and implementation of
enhanced legislation to meet international standards in combating money laundering and the
financing of terrorism.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ initiative to redesign the longer-term oil wealth management
strategy and the rules governing the NFRK. Directors welcomed the authorities’ interest in a
fiscal ROSC reassessment, which would help in the design of the new NFRK rules. They noted
that full integration of the NFRK with the budget will improve the transparency of oil revenue and
better inform fiscal policy decisions. To safeguard oil wealth and protect the economy from
fluctuations in world oil prices, Directors recommended that the release of funds from the NFRK
to the budget be guided by a medium-term fiscal sustainability framework that targets the nonoil deficit—grounded by prudent assumptions regarding longer-term oil prices and production.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative,
which would further enhance transparency.
Directors stressed that decisions on further sizable tax cuts should be aligned with the new oil
wealth management strategy, and be based on the availability of sufficient budgetary resources,
once priority spending needs have been met. They urged the authorities to resist proposals to
differentiate tax rates across sectors, particularly VAT rates, given their highly distortive nature.
Directors called for reinvigorating structural reforms to enhance economic governance and
improve the investment climate. Institutional development should be stepped up, especially in
relation to procurement systems and public investment monitoring. Reforms in the areas of
competition policy and enterprise restructuring should improve the provision of basic services
and lower the cost of doing business in Kazakhstan. Directors observed that early WTO
accession and further trade liberalization, particularly through a reduction in tariff dispersion and
steps to facilitate regional trade, would help boost the non-oil sector’s growth prospects.
Regarding development institutions and industrial promotion, Directors stressed the need to
ensure that the clusters initiative remains focused on labor training and infrastructure provision,
and that development institutions’ lending is well-targeted and restricted to addressing genuine
market failures in the availability of long-term financing. They urged the authorities to refrain

-5from offering tax incentives and providing credit on subsidized terms or to projects of uncertain
commercial viability.
Directors commended the improvements in the quality and provision of economic statistics.
They encouraged the authorities to work toward a more rigorous separation of national
accounts data (including imports) into the oil and non-oil sectors of the economy, and to seek
technical assistance to this end.
