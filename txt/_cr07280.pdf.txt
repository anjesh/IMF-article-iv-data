JAPAN
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Japan
Approved by Daniel Citrin and G. Russell Kincaid
July 12, 2007

•

This report is based on discussions held in Tokyo during May 14–24. The staff team
was headed by Mr. Citrin (APD). Mr. Lipsky joined the mission for the final round of
policy discussions. Messrs. Kashiwagi and Kitahara (both OED) also participated.

•

Counterparts. The mission met with Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Fukui, Minister of
State for Economic and Fiscal Policy Ota, Minister for Financial Services Yamamoto,
Vice Minister of Finance for International Affairs Watanabe, BoJ Deputy Governor
Iwata, Member of the BoJ Policy Board Suda, and other senior officials, academics, and
private sector representatives.

•

Context of past surveillance. In recent years, the Fund and the authorities have agreed
on the broad policy priorities—implementing an appropriate post-deflation monetary
framework, pursuing medium-term fiscal consolidation, further strengthening the
financial and corporate sectors, and stepping up productivity-boosting reforms.
Compared to the authorities, the Fund has advocated a somewhat faster pace of reforms,
inter alia to strengthen growth prospects in the context of population aging and promote
an orderly adjustment of global imbalances.

•

Japan’s exchange rate is market determined. Japan has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of current
international transactions, with the exceptions of those notified to the Fund in accordance
with Executive Board Decision 144-(52/51) and UN-sanctioned restrictions on external
payments for security reasons.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Japan’s economic expansion has entered into its sixth year. GDP growth has been above
potential, while the external position remains strong. The health of the banking system
continues to improve, and corporate profits are at record highs. CPI inflation has been very
weak, due mostly to moderate wage growth and global competitive pressures.

•

The outlook remains favorable, with growth increasingly driven by domestic demand.
The risks are evenly balanced with downside risks mainly from the external side, while a
tightening labor market could feed into faster consumption.

•

Fiscal consolidation has proceeded faster than expected, but the public debt ratio is still
high. The primary deficit for the general government (excluding social security) is projected
to decline to about 1 percent of GDP in FY2007 (fiscal year starting in April). However, the
public debt ratio remains uncomfortably high and, on a net basis, is rising.

•

With little signs of inflation pressures or worrisome financial imbalances, the Bank of
Japan has opted for a very gradual pace of tightening. Low interest rates have supported
the expansion, but they have also contributed to capital outflows that have weakened the yen.
The yen remains below its long-term equilibrium value in real effective terms.

•

Japan continues to make progress in structural reforms. Initiatives are underway to
streamline product regulation, reform the public sectors, improve labor utilization, and foster
competition and trade.

Key issues and policy discussions
•

A faster pace of fiscal consolidation would buy policy insurance against shocks and help
cope with the cost of population aging. Given the size of the adjustment and uncertainties
surrounding future spending cuts, revenue measures are needed. Among possible measures,
raising the consumption tax would be more equitable and supportive of growth.

•

With little inflation ahead, monetary policy should remain supportive and attuned to a
broad appraisal of the economy and prices. Continued efforts to improve communications
would help strengthen the monetary framework and anchor inflation expectations.

•

Financial policies are focused on the challenges ahead. A growing appetite for risky
assets—both domestic and foreign—calls for continued regulatory vigilance and sound risk
management. Other key challenges include further developing the capital markets, raising
bank core profitability, and managing the reforms of the government financial institutions.

•

Broader structural reforms are needed to boost productivity and competitiveness. The
reform priorities are to increase labor market flexibility and promote competition through
greater market opening and further deregulation.

•

The authorities’ policy intentions are broadly appropriate to promote an orderly
adjustment of Japan’s external imbalance—and the yen should continue to be market
determined.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Japan’s current expansion has gone hand
in hand with increased integration with the
global economy. Emergence from a decade of
economic stagnation began in 2002 with an exportled recovery that helped jumpstart growth and break
a cycle of falling prices and financial instability.
Five years later, growth has become more broadbased, confidence has improved, and Japan’s
engagement with the global economy has deepened.
Trade openness is advancing; Japanese investors are
seeking higher returns overseas; and foreign
participation in Japan’s capital markets and
economy is expanding.

Globalization is adding new dimensions to Japan’s macroeconomic and financial
policies. Together with benefits for the world and Japan, closer financial and trade ties are
bringing two-way channels for spillovers as well as new challenges. What are the
implications for policymaking? Do policy requirements differ from a domestic and a
multilateral perspective? What are the tradeoffs, if any, between domestic and external
objectives? This year’s Article IV discussions explored the main policy challenges facing
Japan in a more globalized world.
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
Background
3.
•

•

Japan’s economic expansion has entered its sixth year.
GDP growth has been above
potential. Growth in 2006 averaged
2.2 percent, though the quarterly
pattern was uneven (Figure 1;
Table 1). After slowing in mid year,
private consumption rebounded in the
fourth quarter and activity regained
pace. With renewed momentum in
domestic demand, GDP grew at an
annual rate of 3.3 percent in the first
quarter of 2007.

Price pressures remain absent. Core CPI inflation (excluding fresh food) in 2006 was
only 0.1 percent (y/y) and lately has dipped below zero—mainly due to lower energy and
telecommunication prices. The GDP deflator fell by 0.9 percent (y/y) last year and by
0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2007 (Box 1).

negative output gap as well as other factors. Staff
estimates the output gap about minus ½ percent (i.e., some slack remains). Official estimates are
positive but close to zero, and may reflect downward biases in estimated potential growth after
protracted stagnation. Either way, the gap alone does not seem to be the main cause of low inflation.
Four additional likely factors are:
•

Low inflation expectations. Surveys and proxies of inflation expectations derived from indexed
bonds point to inflation expectations remaining very low. Low inflation expectations in turn may
reflect Japan’s history of low trend inflation (which averaged about 2¼ percent during 1980–1994
before deflation set in).

•

Persistent wage moderation. Changes in labor markets are dampening cost-push pressures.
Wage moderation reflects, among other things, aggressive cost containment by restructuring
firms, the replacement of retiring high-wage workers with younger lower paid ones, and
pervasive hires under non-regular contracts.

•

Reduction in pricing power. There have been
persistent differences in price behavior between
goods and services. Since the mid-1990s, core
goods prices have trended downward—reflecting
heightened competition and technological
progress in Japan as elsewhere. By contrast,
service sector prices have generally been rising—
although weakly since 2001. Service price
inflation nonetheless is still well below that in
other G-7 countries. These trends suggests that
deregulation, productivity growth, and
globalization have increased competitive
pressures and market contestability, limiting
pricing power in many sectors (WEO, April 2006).

Domestic regional factors. Regional developments are also creating a downdraft on aggregate
price indices. While major metropolitan areas have thriving economies, other regions are still
struggling with weak activity. (For example, in April, nearly half of the prefectural capitals had
negative core inflation and a shrinking population.)

All these factors have contributed to a flattening—and a downward shift—of the Phillips curve, and
explain a persistently low inflation in the upswing.

-2

6
•

Labor markets continue to tighten, but wage growth is still sluggish. The unemployment
rate fell to 3.8 percent in May, its lowest level in nine years. Nonetheless, average wages
languish, in part because of shifts in the composition of employment (Box 1). However,
compensation of employees (which includes bonuses) has been growing at about
1 percent on average for the last three years.

•

Financial underpinnings have improved. Bank NPL ratios fell further in 2006, and capital
ratios improved. Corporate profits are at record highs—and gearing ratios at a 50-year
low. With lending rates low and stock prices rising, financial conditions remain easy. The
yield curve has steepened since a year ago, with the 10-year rate at nearly 2 percent. And
the recovery in land prices has now spread from selected cities to the entire country
(Figure 2; Table 3).

•

Japan’s external position remains very strong (Figure 3). Boosted by investment income,
the current account surplus widened last year to nearly 4 percent of GDP. Record net
capital outflows provided an offset (Box 2). The current account strengthened modestly
also in the first quarter of 2007. Valuation effects and accrued income have propelled
official reserves to around $900 billion. Intervention has not taken place since March
2004.

•

The yen has depreciated against major currencies. During 2006, it fell 5½ percent and
6¼ percent against the U.S. dollar and the euro, respectively. After depreciating more this
year, the real effective yen is at its weakest in about 20 years. On a bilateral basis,
widening interest rate differentials and a fading home bias have driven the yen to all-time
lows against the euro and some “target currencies” in carry trades. Against the U.S.
dollar, the yen is somewhat under its most recent five-year average.

Outlook and risks
4.
In the near term, GDP is expected to grow at an annual pace of around
2¼ percent and the risks are balanced.
•

Baseline. On an annual average basis, GDP growth is projected at 2.6 percent for 2007
and 2.0 percent for 2008, increasingly driven by domestic demand. With activity close to
full capacity, CPI inflation is expected to pick up, but very slowly. The current account
surplus is expected to remain around 4 percent of GDP in 2007–08.

•

Risks. Downside risks stem mostly from the external environment and include an
unanticipated slowdown in the United States, volatile energy prices, and global financial
turbulence. Also, household spending could be held back by uncertainties about
entitlements and tax reforms. On the upside, a tight labor market could lead to faster
wage gains and consumption growth. Exports could also overperform, given the
depreciated yen and the strong regional outlook.

7

Box 2. Recent Developments and Outlook for Japanese Capital Outflows
To diversify their portfolios and earn higher returns, investors have increasingly turned overseas.
The stock of capital investments abroad by Japanese residents has almost doubled since 2000 (to just
above 120 percent of GDP), mainly from
growth in private holdings.1
200%

Capital Outflows Outstanding from Japan

Retail investments through mutual funds
have been the main source of these flows,
followed by pension funds. Deregulation that
allowed banks in 1998 (and Japan Post in 2005)
to sell mutual funds directly to customers
helped households shift from low-interest
deposits to higher-yielding global securities,
mainly sovereign bonds. More recently, there
has been some shift in securities investment
from bonds to equities. Outward FDI has also
picked up, particularly to emerging Asia,
supported by credits from Japanese banks.

Recent capital outflows have also involved carry trades—the practice of borrowing in yen to
purchase higher-yielding assets in other currencies—and other speculative flows. Low market
volatility and widening interest rate differentials have raised the incentives for such trades. Market
participants report two approaches that are becoming popular, but are difficult to track. First, in some
markets, creditors are issuing yen-linked loans or debt to borrowers trying to take advantage of low
Japanese interest rates. However, creditors have reportedly shed currency risk by using cross-currency
swaps, transferring the exchange rate risk to the borrower.2 Second, foreign exchange trading has
become popular among individual investors in Japan, who can leverage (up to 10–20 times) deposits in
margin accounts to take currency positions. The actual leverage of Japanese investors is not known, but
deposits have grown rapidly and have reached about $5¾ billion at the end of May 2007. Data on the
size of outstanding positions for yen-linked loans and margin trading are generally unavailable on a
detailed and timely basis.
Given their large structural nature, capital
outflows are likely to remain large, with a
growing share to Asia. Currency and
deposits account for nearly half of
households’ portfolios—a significantly higher
proportion than in other advanced countries.
As such, there is significant potential for
households to increase their overseas
investments. The ongoing decline in home
bias should only add to the momentum for
holding global securities. Although the U.S.
and Western Europe currently receive much
of these flows, Asia’s share (around
10 percent) is rapidly rising, including for
FDI.

In contrast, capital inflows to Japan have been much smaller. Overseas investors currently hold around $2½ trillion
in Japanese securities and loans.

For example, in Korea, yen-denominated loans are estimated to have increased by around $5 billion in 2006.
However, the amount is small compared to the stock of won-denominated loans ($300 billion in the housing sector).

Over the medium term, GDP growth reverts to potential.
Medium-term baseline. In the central scenario, GDP growth moderates to potential
(estimated at 1.7 percent). This trajectory assumes a continued strengthening of the
financial sector, efficiency gains from corporate restructuring, a shrinking labor force,
and fiscal consolidation in line with the authorities’ latest reference path. The current
account balance narrows modestly by 2012 with a decline in private saving as population
ages, while investment remains strong. Inflation picks up gradually as the economy
operates close to capacity.

Reform scenarios. Implementation of reforms, such as those announced in the context of
the IMF Multilateral Consultation (MC), would strengthen the medium-term outlook,
perhaps boosting long-term growth to nearly 2 percent (Annex I). Further structural
reforms that build on the MC commitments would lift growth prospects—and strengthen
the yen—more significantly. Over the longer term, potential growth could increase by
about ½ percentage point over the baseline if an ambitious reform agenda is pursued.1
Under this scenario, the current account surplus would narrow and the yen would
appreciate in real terms over time. However, sustained capital outflows, productivity
gains in the non-tradables sector, and a policy mix tilted toward fiscal austerity are likely
to slow the adjustment.

Detailed recommendations on reform priorities are in Annex I of last year’s Article IV report (IMF Country
Report No. 06/276).

risks, BoJ officials are of the
view that strong demand from the rest of Asia and Europe has so far limited the impact of
the U.S. slowdown on Japan’s exports but that developments in the global economy need
to be watched closely. They also noted that vigilance is warranted against the risk that
expectations of very low interest rates—regardless of output and price conditions—
become entrenched and distort asset prices.

•

Medium-term outlook. Potential growth is currently estimated at or somewhat above
1½ percent per year by both the BoJ and the Cabinet Office.3 However, the Cabinet
Office considered that it could rise to 2.4 percent under a far-reaching reform plan in the
works (paragraph 33).

The Cabinet Office projections have not been updated yet.
This is a bit less than in the staff’s baseline, owing to different methodologies.

III. POLICY CHALLENGES IN A MORE GLOBALIZED WORLD
A. Reducing the Public Debt Ratio to Achieve Fiscal Sustainability
Fiscal consolidation has proceeded faster than expected. Nonetheless, a worrisome fiscal
situation calls for continued efforts to put the public debt ratio firmly on a downward path.
Consolidation might slow the current account adjustment, but this seems a reasonable price
to pay for better long-term growth prospects.
Background
7.
Despite better-than-expected fiscal outturns, the public (net) debt ratio at above
80 percent remains one of the highest among OECD countries—and is still rising.
•

Consolidation is proceeding. There has been noteworthy progress, thanks to cyclical
revenue buoyancy (particularly in corporate taxes) and sustained expenditure restraint
(Table 2). The primary deficit for the general government (excluding social security) is
thus projected to decline to about 1 percent of GDP in FY2007 from over 5 percent four
years ago. However, the public debt ratio remains uncomfortably high and—on a net
basis—is not yet stabilized.

•

The medium-term fiscal strategy. The goals and timeline in the authorities’ revised fiscal
projections released in early 2007 are basically unchanged from last year (Box in Annex
III). Given past overperformance, this implies only a modest additional adjustment in the
primary balance, going forward—¼ percent of GDP annually through FY2011.
Additional issues relate to the underlying assumptions, which entail a favorable growthinterest rate differential.

Tax reforms. The authorities’ consolidation strategy does not factor in major new tax
initiatives. However, discussions on comprehensive tax reforms are expected to start after
the July Upper House elections. In the background, the possibility of earmarking any
increase in the consumption tax rate (which at 5 percent is low by international standards)
for social security spending has been raised.

Other fiscal reforms. With a view to improving expenditure control and budgetary
transparency, the Diet enacted a law inter alia to gradually reduce the number of Special
Accounts and their ability to borrow, and enhance oversight of the budget process. Stock

Expenditure and tax measures. So far, the linchpin of the government’s strategy for
medium-term fiscal adjustment has been expenditure cuts. Although there is still room
for further savings (e.g., in public works and administration, and through additional
entitlement reform), limits may be in sight. Revenue measures could be best identified in
the context of a broad reform of the tax system (Box 3).5 Options include: (i) raising the
consumption tax; (ii) revising the corporate tax system; (iii) widening the income tax
base; and (iv) strengthening tax administration, including through tax payer identification
numbers.

Country Report No. 06/276 presents model-based estimates of the gains from faster fiscal adjustment.
The mission made a presentation to the government’s Tax Commission on the challenges to tax policy from
globalization. Further discussion of the issues is presented in the accompanying Selected Issues paper.

Box 3. Tax Policy Challenges from Aging and Globalization
The tax system in Japan faces
increasing pressures from aging
and globalization. Looming spending
pressures have raised the need for
additional revenue, while
globalization has complicated tax
setting by making capital more
mobile. Any fundamental reform of
Japan’s tax system would need to
focus on its three pillars—the
corporate income tax (CIT), the
consumption tax, and the personal
income tax (PIT)—and take account
of these wider forces.

Corporate taxation. The CIT in Japan is a more important source of revenue than in other
OECD countries, reflecting partly its high statutory (around 40 percent) and average effective
rates. With growing pressures from Japanese corporations to lower rates to international norms,
the challenge will be to maintain revenue while enhancing Japan’s international
competitiveness. Possible measures include limiting depreciation allowances or shifting away
from tax credits for R&D to more targeted spending, such as on R&D, that have clearer social
benefits. More radical reform possibilities include further restricting interest deductibility, as in
Germany, or providing an allowance for the cost of equity finance.
Consumption tax. Japan derives a smaller share of its tax revenue (9½ percent) from this source
than any other OECD country with a VAT (19½ percent on average). Raising the VAT is an
obvious option with its own merits. Unlike taxing capital income, a consumption tax does not
distort savings decisions, helps spread the burden more evenly across generations and tends to
support faster growth in the long run. To the extent that additional revenue from the VAT is
spent on the most disadvantaged, including through social security benefits, the net impact
would be more progressive.
Personal income tax. The yield of the PIT is among the lowest in the OECD at 4¾ percent of
GDP, due mainly to the low tax base. Base-broadening measures such as reducing basic
exemptions and covering more self-employed could generate revenue without significant labor
market distortions given the fairly low marginal rates, especially at lower incomes. In terms of
broader reforms, the “dual income tax” pioneered in the Nordic countries (which applies a flat
rate to all capital income and a progressive schedule for labor income) could be considered as a
compromise between the difficulty of taxing capital income and the desire for progressivity.

13
•

Raising the consumption tax. Consumption tax reform has been a controversial political
issue for some time. Yet, compared with alternative revenue-enhancing measures, a
consumption tax hike would be more supportive of growth and spread the burden more
evenly across generations.6 Earmarking any increase to fund social security is worth
considering on pragmatic grounds, particularly if the alternative is no action at all.

10.
Fiscal consolidation could have favorable international spillovers. All considered,
restoring Japan’s fiscal health is in the world’s interest since it would strengthen mediumterm growth and limit financial risks.
•

Growth and the current account. Any negative impact of consolidation on GDP growth
and the current account is likely to be small and could be more than offset by
productivity- and confidence-boosting structural reforms.7

•

Risk premia. Securing fiscal sustainability could also help stabilize risk premia in the
JGB market—the world’s largest sovereign bond market—where volatility could pick up
with greater foreign participation and a declining home bias.

The authorities’ views and policy intentions
11.
Officials agreed that further consolidation is necessary, but stressed the need to
focus on spending cuts before a tax reform strategy is put in place.
•

The revised medium-term projections. They noted that the latest medium-term reference
path built on earlier commitments to reduce spending and did not speculate on the
possible role of revenue measures, pending the outcome of the tax reform debate. Future
updates could factor in more ambitious targets or an accelerated timeline, depending on
the scope of agreed tax changes and the economic outlook.

•

Expenditure policy. For now, the authorities place top priority on curbing public
expenditure. While the broad envelope of the savings necessary to attain the mediumterm goal of a primary balance (excluding social security) was decided in 2006, year by
year implementation still requires tough choices. With less likelihood of additional tax
buoyancy, the fiscal adjustment along the revised reference path reflected, in the
authorities’ view, a realistic effort. The mission acknowledged the point, but thought that
the credibility of the fiscal strategy would benefit from an early start of a national debate
on revenue-side measures, in light of spending pressures from population aging.

Regarding the further internationalization of the JGB market, the authorities
saw foreign participation as a very positive development. A larger international presence
could at the margin add to volatility, but over the longer run a more diverse investor base will
make the market more resilient (for example, to shifts in the asset portfolio of Japan Post as
government’s divestment proceeds).
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies in a More Globalized World
With fiscal policy firmly focused on consolidation, monetary policy should continue to target
price stability and output growth. This calls for removing accommodation only gradually—
which may imply sustained capital outflows and a weak yen for some time to come. The BoJ
should continue efforts to improve communication to help anchor inflation expectations and
facilitate policy implementation. The authorities’ commitment to a market-determined
exchange rate remains appropriate.
Background
13.
Since exiting from its quantitative easing policy in March 2006, the BoJ has tried
to strike a balance between its desire to “normalize” monetary conditions and the
danger of premature tightening. Higher rates would reconstitute room for maneuver and
forestall financial imbalances like those at the root of the late 1980s bubble economy. Then
again, too rapid rate hikes could stop the expansion in its tracks, rekindle deflation, and
worsen the debt dynamics.
•

Gradual normalization. The BoJ has opted for a very gradual pace of tightening—two
quarter-point hikes in the past year. This pace has been consistent with a virtual absence
of inflation (under the BoJ’s “first perspective” for assessing the policy requirements) and

15
no signs of frothy asset markets or other financial imbalances (under the more forwardlooking “second perspective”).8

reflecting the BoJ’s success in convincing
the market that short rates will rise gradually. However, one year after its introduction,
the BoJ’s post-deflation monetary framework is still viewed by market participants as
offering insufficient guidance on policy intentions. Criticism has also been leveled
against the lower bound of the BoJ Policy Board’s “understanding of price stability”—
zero to 2 percent CPI inflation. This summary of Board members’ opinions was reviewed
in April, but left unchanged.

Risk of position reversal. In line with this view, implied volatility in option markets
suggests only a modest risk of large near-term swings in the yen.

Policy issues and staff views
15.
Japan’s low interest rates are contributing to global liquidity and a weaker yen,
but with inflation near zero, the BoJ should remain focused on domestic price stability
and growth.
•

External vs. internal considerations. At first glance, the policy requirements from an
international and domestic perspective appear at odds.
o On the one hand, low interest rates contribute to capital outflows that complicate
policy decisions in recipient countries (by putting upward pressure on their exchange
rates). A persistently weak yen could also fan a protectionist backlash abroad.
Arguably, an accelerated tightening cycle in Japan could slow the more interest ratesensitive outflows, support the yen, and safeguard open trade.
o On the other hand, low inflation calls for only a gradual return to a more neutral
stance, informed by how incoming data change the perceived balance of risks for
growth and prices.

•

The primacy of domestic objectives. In fact, it is not obvious that a different policy mix
aimed at a stronger yen entails benefits that outweigh the attendant costs and risks. For
example, a rebalancing toward looser fiscal policy and tighter credit conditions could be
considered, but there is no room for fiscal easing and a monetary tightening sufficient to
dampen outflows could be a counterproductive drag on the Japanese economy, stoke
deflation, and work against reducing global imbalances.10 On the whole, the global
economy seems better off with a gradual pace of monetary withdrawal in Japan that
would secure a continued expansion with benefits elsewhere.

•

Managing international spillovers. Under these circumstances, prudential regulations,
particularly in recipient countries, and greater market discipline would be the first-best
policies to manage the risks from rising capital outflows from Japan. Greater cross-border
sharing of information by regulators, including on speculative flows, could also highlight
potential vulnerabilities.

10

Simulation based on the IMF’s Global Economic Model show that a 200 basis point increase in the BoJ’s
policy rate combined with a fiscal expansion of about 1 percent of GDP reduces growth by about ¾ percentage
point below baseline, restarts deflation, and increases the debt ratio with little change in the external surplus.
Higher interest rates would also create capital losses for banks and insurers with large bond portfolios.

17
16.
With little inflation ahead, the mission argued that policy rates need to increase
only gradually.
•

Policy stance in the near term. With
no signs of price pressures or
worrisome financial imbalances, a rate
hike should be delayed until inflation
expectations have recovered and
prospective CPI inflation is firmly
positive. A cautious approach along
these lines would contribute to an
environment with a “safety margin”
against negative shocks and a return of
entrenched deflation.

17.
Regarding the BoJ’s one-year old monetary framework, discussions centered on
how to lift inflation expectations and improve communication.
•

Anchoring expectations. In the mission’s view, inflation expectations (which appeared to
have weakened according to indexed bond prices and some surveys) would be better
anchored in positive territory if BoJ communications emphasized that most Policy Board
members assess price stability as ranges for CPI inflation with medians close to
1 percent. This emphasis could shift attention away from the often criticized—and
misunderstood—zero lower bound of the Board’s “understanding of price stability” and
support the view that the BoJ would not consider stable CPI inflation at about 1 percent
as a policy concern, in and of itself. Signals along these lines could help expand the
buffer against a recurrence of deflation.

•

More communication of risks. The mission noted that communication with the market
could also be enhanced through more frequent releases of forward-looking analysis of
risks, in the period between the publications of the BoJ’s semi-annual Outlook. While
interim assessments of the Outlook have been provided, they could benefit from a more
systematic coverage of risks.

18.
•

Japan’s policy of a market-determined exchange rate remains appropriate.
The exchange rate. The current level of the exchange rate is adding staying power to the
expansion without unmanageable domestic side effects. For example, inflation remains
extremely subdued, suggesting that rising import prices are not a threat to price stability.
And record-high profits at exporting corporates are supporting business investment and
personal income (through more generous dividend distributions). On the downside, there
are strains at importing firms (a contributing factor to sluggish wage growth) and
protectionism overseas is a risk.

18
•

The impact of capital outflows. Both structural (i.e., longer-term) and speculative
investment flows are depressing the external value of the yen, in spite of the current
account surplus. The unwinding of defensive post-bubble financial postures and the
search for more diversified portfolios are boosting demand for foreign currency assets by
Japanese investors. Low nominal yields on yen assets and very low volatility are also
feeding capital outflows, including leveraged carry trades of uncertain size. Some of
these factors are likely to create persistent headwinds for a yen appreciation in the period
ahead.11 A deep foreign exchange market and the presence of institutional and retail
investors with relatively long horizons mitigate the risks of a sudden shift in sentiment
that could trigger a disruptive unwinding of capital flows.

•

External adjustment over the longer term. Over time, Japan’s current account surplus is
expected to narrow and the yen to strengthen in real terms. With domestic policies
appropriately focused on the pursuit of growth and price stability, the eventual
adjustment of the current account will be facilitated not by a change in the current and
prospective macroeconomic policy mix, but by far-reaching structural reforms that
promote a broad-based increase in labor productivity and the return to capital. As
highlighted in the context of the IMF’s Multilateral Consultation, these reforms hold out
the promise of more vigorous domestic demand and greater capital inflows, which will be
accompanied by a stronger real effective yen and a slower accumulation of net foreign
assets. On balance, the authorities’ intentions regarding macroeconomic, financial, and
structural policies are consistent with sustaining both domestic and external stability.

•

Intervention policy. Against this background, the mission continued to support the
official policy that the external value of the yen should remain market determined and
appropriate action will only be taken to counter disruptive exchange rate movements. In
the context of orderly market conditions, official intervention to absorb excess volatility
is not warranted at present. Moreover, with structural capital outflows behind the yen’s
weakness, official foreign exchange intervention to strengthen the yen would be of
uncertain effectiveness and damage the credibility of the authorities’ policy. By the same
token, the yen should be allowed to appreciate if upward pressures emerge, since the
economy can now cope with a stronger currency.

The authorities’ views and policy intentions
19.
BoJ officials agreed that monetary action should be geared to domestic
conditions, but noted that international spillovers could nonetheless affect policy.
11

Chapter II of Selected Issues paper accompanying this report presents econometric evidence on the influence
of capital flows on the medium-term dynamics of the yen. The paper finds that in the case of the yen-dollar rate,
nontrade factors, such as capital flows related to portfolio rebalancing, are likely to delay the adjustment of the
rate to its long-term equilibrium value.

19
Comparatively low interest rates may be weakening the yen, but this is how the monetary
transmission mechanism works. Since the BoJ does not target the exchange rate, the yen
enters the economic calculus only indirectly. For example, under the “second perspective” of
its framework (which considers low-probability but high-cost financial imbalances a policy
concern), the BoJ weighs the risks of imbalances elsewhere feeding back into Japan. This
risk does not seems serious at present.
20.
As for the near-term conduct of policy, the BoJ restated its intention to remove
monetary accommodation gradually, provided that the expansion continues as expected
and financial imbalances do not emerge. A forward-looking approach to policymaking
should not attach undue weight to recent inflation developments which have been weaker
than anticipated because of temporary factors. Looking ahead, the signs are for a bottoming
out of the CPI and a more secure toehold for inflation. Nonetheless, a broad appraisal of the
economy and prices will guide policy decisions, not just prospective CPI developments. The
gradual monetary tightening already priced in the yield curve was, in the authorities’ view,
consistent with their current assessment of outlook and risks.
21.
On communications, the BoJ thought it was doing a good job fostering
transparency without tying its hands.
•

Lifting inflation expectations. The BoJ noted that it already emphasizes the median view
behind the “understanding of price stability” in some official releases. However, a
balanced representation of the Policy Board’s views could not just highlight the central
tendency and gloss over the diversity of opinions. Regarding the currently limited “safety
margin” against deflation, the BoJ thought that this vulnerability would dissipate as
reflation gathered momentum in the years ahead. Finally, the authorities cautioned
against reading too much into surveys of inflation expectations (or break-even inflation
from indexed bonds), which typically mirrored recent price developments. In their
assessment, longer-term expectations remained stable.

•

Communication strategy. The BoJ officials made three points. First, major changes in the
outlook could be communicated as needed through a wide variety of channels. Second,
policymakers value greatly the ability to express freely their own views—and without
resorting to “code words.” Finally, good communication does not mean spoon feeding
information to markets. In particular, outreach should not give away the timing of future
policy moves—markets should decide on their own, and set asset prices accordingly.

22.
The authorities agreed that exchange rate policy should continue to be market
determined. Ministry of Finance officials reaffirmed that their policy is unchanged. There is
no case for intervention as long as conditions remained orderly and the external value of the
yen remained in line with fundamental drivers—currently including structural capital
outflows. The authorities thought that any risks associated with speculative carry trades are
manageable, since these are likely a fraction of the more stable outflows related to portfolio

20
rebalancing. Nonetheless, they continue to monitor market developments closely—and warn
investors against one-sided risks.
23.
The authorities remained skeptical of estimated deviations of the exchange rate
from its medium- or long-term value based on an “equilibrium” current account. First,
the notion of a deviation from a longer-term equilibrium does not appear relevant for a
market-determined exchange rate like the yen’s. Second, the concept does not take into due
account trends in capital flows: financial globalization may have made seemingly large
external imbalances sustainable. Third, the role of exchange rate movements in the
adjustment is overplayed. For example, Japan’s current account surplus had recently
reflected rising net investment income in the face of a declining trade balance—a trend that
would mute the sensitivity of the external balance to changes in the yen exchange rate.
Overall, the officials cautioned strongly against an unqualified public release of staff
estimates of exchange rate undervaluation relative to an estimated long-term value which, in
their views, do not adequately factor in non-trade fundamentals such as capital flows—and
could be misread as forecasts by observers unaware of these issues.
C. Financial Policies for Enhancing Integration and Intermediation
Greater capital flows from and to Japan have enhanced the global intermediation of savings,
but they have also created the potential for sudden reversals and financial turbulence. To
reap more fully the benefits from integration, financial policies should focus on ways to
better manage these risks and enhance intermediation. On the domestic front, the priorities
are to raise bank core profitability and develop further the capital markets.
Background

source of capital outflows, while foreign participation in the Japanese financial markets

foster a market for loan securitization and credit-risk transfer. Further reforms to the

Estate Investment Trust) market are a
potential concern. Establishing reliable
price benchmarks and greater
transparency would enhance price
discovery and risk management.
Problems in the consumer finance
industry should also be closely followed.

Managing GFI reform. Reform of the GFIs, particularly Japan Post, needs to be carefully
managed to ensure a level playing field for all institutions. For Japan Post, it will be
important that the successor savings and insurance entities be supervised in the same
manner as private institutions and not be allowed to offer new products until the
conditions for equal competition are clearly established.

The authorities’ views and policy intentions
29.
The authorities agreed that policies should continue to focus on the risks from
greater capital flows, the low profitability of banks, and GFI reform.
•

Supervision and regulations. On cross-border capital flows, the authorities noted the need
for close monitoring (including of hedge funds) and a flexible regulatory structure. In
their view, the 2006 Financial Instruments and Exchange Law will strengthen investor
protection across products and sectors.

•

Raising bank profitability. Officials saw diversifying income sources and enhancing risk
management as key priorities for boosting bank profits. They agreed that a broader
sharing of credit information would strengthen risk management and financial stability
and noted progress under the new consumer finance law. Basel II, which began in March
2007, will also help. Regional banks have strived to reduce costs by sharing computer
systems and, in some cases, merging, and should be encouraged to do more.

•

Japan Post. The FSA will supervise the savings and insurance entities in the same
manner as private financial institutions and ensure that they have sound risk management
systems in place to avoid possible disruptions.

•

Emerging risks. The authorities are monitoring closely the rapid growth in the J-REIT
markets and have warned institutions on attendant risks. For the consumer finance sector,
losses have risen sharply, but are within provisioning levels, and the overall impact on
credit and consumer spending is likely to be minimal.

30.
Regarding the further development of capital markets, the authorities’ strategy
centers around enhancing Tokyo’s appeal as an international financial center. Ideas
include relaxing barriers between banks and securities firms and consolidating financial
exchanges. Although the proposals are in the early stage of discussion, the mission saw
potential for banks to diversify into new business lines and for attracting more foreign
investment.
D. Structural Reforms to Boost Productivity and Competitiveness
Broader reforms are needed to raise potential growth and strengthen Japan’s international
competitiveness. Steps to improve the allocation of resources would also help tackle

24
emerging inequalities (Box 4). The government is implementing reforms on various fronts,
but the agenda could be broadened.
Background
31.
Japan continues to make progress in structural reforms, including with
undertakings made in the Multilateral Consultation (MC). Initiatives have been
underway for some time to streamline product market regulation and the public sector,
improve labor utilization, and foster competition and trade. Over the last few months,
advances have been made in fulfilling several of the MC commitments (Annex I). For
example, rules governing M&A involving a foreign company have been clarified, privately
run job placement centers have been set up on a pilot basis, workers marginalized by postbubble labor shedding are being offered new opportunities, and new Economic Partnership
Agreements (EPAs) are under consideration.
Policy issues and staff views
32.

That said, there is still room for deepening reforms in a number of areas.

•

Enhancing labor market performance. Labor utilization would improve with more
flexible work arrangements, clearer rules for dismissal or layoffs, greater portability of
pensions, and more balanced conditions between regular and temporary workers (e.g., as
regards employment protection, social insurance coverage, and training opportunities). A
more liberal immigration policy could also play a role.

•

Strengthening competition. Further deregulation and market opening (notably, in
services) is necessary to unlock productivity gains.13 Continued rolling out of successful
reforms in the Special Zones and steps to enhance the effectiveness of the Fair Trade
Commission could be key to this end.

Box 4. Japan’s Emerging Economic Dualities
Globalization, technological change, and an aging
population have contributed to widening economic
disparities, raising concerns that the benefits of Japan’s
expansion are not being evenly shared. These disparities
include those within the labor market, across sectors,
between large and small firms, and across regions.
Income inequality. After falling steadily during Japan’s high
growth post-war period, income inequality, as measured by
the Gini coefficient, has risen steadily and now exceeds the
OECD average. The rise reflects several factors, including
the increasing number of elderly households as well as a
widening gap among those 35 years or younger who were
more severely affected by the economic stagnation of the
late-1990s.
Labor market. Growing inequality is also related to shifts in
the labor markets. One notable feature of the recent
expansion has been the rise in the share of non-regular
workers in the labor force to 34 percent of the labor force in
2007 compared to 20 percent in 1990. In response to global
competitive pressures, firms have shifted to hiring mainly
non-regular workers who typically earn around 40 percent
less than regular worker and are easier to dismiss, although
recently this shift has slowed.
Regional inequality. After falling steadily since 1990,
income disparities across prefectures also began to rise in
2001, as the more urban and export-oriented regions have
exhibited faster growth.
Industrial disparities. Dualities are also emerging across
industries, as those with closer links to exports and
advanced technology production have benefited more from
the expansion. Within manufacturing, IT production since
2000 has increased by about 50 percent while output of nonIT firms has remained nearly flat. The gap between large
and small companies in terms of profitability has also
widened, reflecting SMEs’ larger exposure to the domestic
economy.

•

Trade liberalization. To enhance benefits for all, the network of bilateral EPAs should
work effectively on a regional basis (e.g., through regional cumulation of origin to
facilitate the sourcing of inputs) and include low and secure “most favored nation”
(MFN) tariffs. At the same time, Japan could also play a leadership role in encouraging
its EPA partners to lower their MFN tariffs and work toward an ambitious Doha Round
agreement (Annex II).

•

Agricultural reform. Recent steps on eligibility criteria should facilitate a shift in farm
support from trade barriers to direct income assistance. Reforms of agricultural
cooperatives and land use could support moves to allow nationwide entry of joint-stock
companies.

The authorities’ views and policy intentions
33.
The authorities have outlined action plans for further reforms in the 2007 Basic
Policies. The document (released after the mission) lays out in broad contour a strategy to
enhance Japans’ growth potential, capitalize on the opportunities offered by globalization,
modernize fiscal structures and intergovernmental relations, and strengthen the education
system. In particular:
•

Boosting productivity. A key objective of the strategy is to boost by 50 percent labor
productivity growth in five years. Improved labor utilization and greater dynamism at
SMEs and in services will be pursued (among other things) by fostering deregulation, the
accumulation of human capital, and IT investment. A “job card” system to facilitate
hiring decisions and labor mobility through an official record of individual employment
histories is also under development.

•

Addressing globalization. The economy’s growth potential will also be raised by (at
least) tripling the number of preferential trade agreements and EPAs in force over the
next two years and by strengthening further the financial and capital markets. Steps to
improve the flexibility of the labor market and the resilience of regional economies are
also on the agenda. A plan for agricultural reforms will be elaborated this fall.

34.
The authorities saw a rapid conclusion to the Doha Round as important for
Japan and the rest of the world. They noted that their recent extension of duty and quotafree access to 98 percent of tariff lines has increased access for LDCs. In their bilateral EPAs,
they are seeking to include clear liberal rules of origin with regional cumulation to promote a
regional supply chain.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
The economic outlook for Japan remains favorable. Growth has become more
broad-based, as robust corporate profits continue to lift business investment and external
demand, particularly in Asia, remains strong. Although wages continue to be sluggish, the
labor market is tightening and the quality of jobs is improving. These positive developments

27
have propelled the expansion—the longest in Japan’s post-war history—into its sixth year
and are expected to continue over the near term. Inflation remains disappointedly low, due
mainly to temporary factors and global competitive pressures, but should rise gradually as the
economy operates close to potential.
36.
The expansion has been accompanied by increased integration with the global
economy. Japan’s openness to trade is rising, while a fading home bias and low domestic
interest rates have encouraged Japanese investors to seek higher returns overseas. At the
same time, improving prospects at home have boosted foreign participation in the corporate
and financial sectors. Closer financial and trade integration have also created two-way
channels for spillovers and added a new dimension to policy making.
37.
The favorable economic performance has been supported by appropriate
macroeconomic and structural policies, but important tasks remain on the policy
agenda. The priorities are to secure fiscal sustainability, to further strengthen the financial
system, and to boost productivity through deeper structural reforms. Achieving these goals
will help Japan not only to cope with the cost of an aging society and improve medium-term
growth prospects, but also to facilitate the adjustment to the quickening pace of globalization.
38.
Significant progress has been made in reducing the fiscal imbalance, but more is
needed. Buoyant corporate tax revenue and spending cuts have helped to reduce the deficit
and stabilize the public debt ratio. Public debt remains uncomfortably high and pressures
from an aging society are mounting. Although robust growth ahead may ease the urgency of
adjustment, a stepped-up pace of consolidation will buy “policy insurance” against shocks
and support private spending by alleviating concerns on social entitlements. Faster progress
could also bolster market confidence as the JGB market becomes more globalized.
39.
Given the size of the task, additional revenue measures are needed. Revenue
measures could be best identified in the context of a broad reform of the tax system that
addresses the challenges posed by Japan’s aging society and globalization. Among the
possible measures, increasing the consumption tax has the benefit of being more supportive
of growth and more equitable across generations.
40.
Monetary policy remains appropriately accommodative in the very low inflation
environment. Given the muted outlook for prices and absence of worrisome financial
imbalances, monetary policy should remain supportive. The return to a neutral monetary
stance should proceed in tandem with improved inflation prospects. To better guide
expectations, communications of the monetary framework could rely on additional forwardlooking policy statements. A greater emphasis of the 1 percent median within the Policy
Board members’ range of understanding on price stability could also contribute to anchor
expectations firmly in positive territory.
41.
With the health of the banking system improving, financial policies are rightly
focused on the challenges ahead. A growing appetite for investing in risky assets—both

28
domestic and foreign—calls for continued regulatory vigilance and sound risk management.
For banks, the priorities are to raise core profitability by diversifying income sources and
enhancing lending practices. Further development of the capital markets will strengthen the
financial system, help allocate more efficiently Japan’s large savings, and ultimately promote
growth and efficiency in the economy at large. The reform of the government financial
institutions should be managed carefully to ensure a level playing field for all institutions.
42.
More broadly, deeper structural reforms are needed to improve Japan’s growth
potential and international competitiveness. As highlighted by the recent Multilateral
Consultations, the broad reform priorities are to improve labor utilization and promote
competition through greater market opening and further deregulation.
43.
The authorities’ policy intentions are broadly appropriate to promote an orderly
reduction of Japan’s large current account surplus—and the yen should continue to be
market determined. The yen appears to be misaligned relative to its long-term value in real
effective terms, notwithstanding the correct focus of macroeconomic and structural policies.
A narrowing of Japan’s current account to its longer-term equilibrium level will be facilitated
by policy reforms that support domestic demand and capital inflows, paving the way for a
stronger yen over time. However, the external adjustment will likely be protracted in part
because of persistent capital outflows linked to portfolio rebalancing by Japanese retail and
institutional investors.
44.
Finally, in expanding bilateral trade, Japan should also look multilaterally to
secure a balanced and ambitious Doha Round agreement. Lowering tariffs on a most
favored nation–basis globally would limit the discrimination inherent in preferential trade
agreements, while using rules of origin provisions would ensure that bilateral Economic
Partnership Agreements work effectively on a regional level.
45.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

ANNEX I. JAPAN: POLICY PROGRESS AND PLANS RELEVANT TO THE IMFC STRATEGY1
Over the past year, developments in Japan's policies related to the IMFC strategy
included:
• Incentives to encourage young and female labor force participation. Expenditures for
reducing skills mismatches for women and younger workers have been included in the
FY2007 budget, and tax relief for FY2007–08 expenditures on child care has been raised.
A stronger law on equal job opportunity has been passed and will take effect in FY2007.
Job placement services have been partly liberalized.
• Measures to enhance competition. A new antimonopoly law granting stronger authority
to the Fair Trade Commission was enacted in April 2005 and has been effective since
January 2006.
• Advancing fiscal consolidation. In order to forestall a possible loss of confidence to the
economy, which could result in adverse external spillovers, and in order to achieve
sustainable private demand-led growth, the government has been making every effort to
advance fiscal consolidation. In the FY2007 budget, the issuance of new government
bonds is reduced by ¥4.5 trillion (15 percent in year-on-year terms), the largest such
reduction in history. As a result, the primary deficit of the central and local governments
combined will be reduced from 1.7 percent of GDP in FY2006 to 0.6 percent of GDP in
FY2007.
Looking forward, Japan's policy plans include the following:
• Labor market reforms. A bill to extend pension coverage to temporary workers is in the
works, and some job placement services are under "market testing" with a view toward
further liberalization. Reform priorities (to be elaborated in June), for inclusion in the
cabinet's Basic Policies for FY2007, include enhancing labor mobility and market
attachment, and retraining marginalized workers.
• Facilitating inward foreign direct investment (FDI). The tax treatment of mergers and
acquisitions involving non-cash transactions is under parliamentary debate. The
government will implement the program for acceleration of FDI in Japan in order to
achieve its strategic goal to increase the FDI stock to 5 percent of GDP by 2010.
• Strengthening competition in key sectors. The importance of raising productivity,
especially in the non-tradable sector, is well recognized. The government has worked out
modalities for rolling out the deregulation measures in the "Special Zones for Structural
Reform." A draft bill for reform and eventual privatization of some government-owned
financial institutions is under legislative review. A Council of Economic and Fiscal
Policy committee is looking at ways to promote additional Economic Partnership
Agreements bilaterally and regionally. Agricultural and immigration reforms will also be
addressed.
• Further advancing fiscal consolidation. The government has set fiscal targets to reduce
the debt-to-GDP ratio in a stable manner by the mid 2010s and, as a first step, to achieve
a surplus in the primary balance of the central and local government combined by 2011.

ANNEX II. JAPAN’S ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS (EPAS): UPDATE AND ISSUES
1.
Extensive global trade relationships give Japan a strong interest in a liberal,
non-discriminatory trade system, but also a role in helping shape regional trade
relations. Japan has entered EPAs with Singapore (2002), Mexico (2005), and Malaysia
(2006), and signed EPAs with the Philippines (2006), Brunei, Chile, and Thailand (all in
2007). Negotiations are underway with ASEAN, Korea, Indonesia, and Vietnam and, more
recently, Australia, the GCC, India, and Switzerland. Japan is also interested in EPAs with
the EU and the United States, and by 2009, the authorities aim to sign twelve EPAs.
2.
Evolving regional trade relations raise several broad issues for Japan. As nondiscriminatory trade reforms have helped to more tightly integrate regional manufacturing
trade, preferential arrangements run the risk of fracturing, instead of reinforcing, this trade.
The issue arises as to whether overlapping bilateral/sub-regional arrangements, which
discriminate against the largest bilateral flows in the region (among China, Japan, and
Korea), should evolve toward a broader pan-regional EPA. Some proposals include a
“ASEAN Plus Three” (China, Japan, Korea), an “ASEAN Plus Six” (Australia, China, India,
Japan, Korea, New Zealand), and a FTA of the Asia Pacific, but no single structure has
emerged.
3.
A pan-regional approach to rules of origins (RoO) and their cumulation would
support greater regional integration, even without a full regional structure.1 Restrictive
RoO encourage PTA partners to source inputs from one another to qualify a final product for
preference, extending protection given by each country to producers in partner countries. In
its EPA negotiations with ASEAN, Japan proposes relatively transparent and liberal RoO—a
value-added criterion to convey preference and (alternatively) a change in tariff classification
criterion (CTC),2 a relatively liberal and transparent approach, as RoO in some FTAs are very
sector specific. Japan also expects its agreement with ASEAN to allow cumulation of origin
throughout ASEAN and Japan. Such regional cumulation provisions mimic advantages of
regional, versus bilateral and sub-regional, agreements. The Pan-European Cumulation
System (PECS) brought common RoO and regional cumulation to the Euro-Mediterranean

Agricultural reforms within EPAs should be balanced with MFN-based reforms.
Japan has so far limited agriculture’s role in EPAs, but this may prove increasingly difficult
as it pursues EPAs with major farm exporters. Bilateral agricultural reforms could lead to
subsequent MFN-based reforms. However, the risk in this sequencing is that preferential
access to those heavily-protected markets in Japan could cause significant trade diversion—
and possibly trade tensions. As EPAs extend further to agriculture, it will be important that
they be balanced with MFN-based reforms, either unilaterally or in the Doha Round.

of consolidation in FY2012. The
projections also include the 2009 increase in the central government’s state contribution to
the pension fund and other recent pension and medical care reforms.
2.
The analysis suggests that the authorities are likely to achieve their goal of a
primary surplus by 2011, but fall short of reducing the debt ratio. Under the authorities’
medium-term plans, the net public debt ratio is projected to stabilize at above 90 percent of
GDP. Further adjustment is needed to put the debt ratio on a downward path.
3.
The analysis highlights the sensitivity of the debt dynamics to an interest rate
shock and the benefits from a faster pace of consolidation. For example, with a 100 basis
point increase in the real interest rate (more than a one-standard deviation shock) from 2010
onwards, the debt-to-GDP ratio would

Annex III (continued).
Box. Japan’s Medium-Term Fiscal Plans
The government’s medium-term
fiscal plan revolves around a
reference path for the primary deficit
of the general government (excluding
social security) that is updated every
year. In recent vintages, the overarching
objectives have been laid out in two
phases: achieve balance by FY2011 and
start reducing the debt ratio by the mid2010s. In July 2006, the target date for a
primary balance was brought forward to
FY2011. The related trajectory for the
primary deficit implied a yearly
adjustment of ½ percent of GDP, on
average, based largely on a 25 percent
cut in discretionary spending over 5 years.

following areas:
Social Securities' Expenditure: ¥1.6 trillion.
Government Wage Bill: ¥2.6 trillion.
Public Works: ¥5.6 trillion.
Others (including ODA): ¥4.5 trillion.

In January 2007, the fiscal plan was updated to reflect recent progress. The plan
incorporates the better than expected FY2005 and FY2006 outturns and the FY2007 budget, as
well as new macroeconomic assumptions:
•

The new plan presents two scenarios. Under a “Growth” scenario, the primary deficit turns
into a surplus in FY2011 with the gross debt to GDP ratio stabilizing a year earlier. Under a
less favorable “Risk” scenario, a primary balance will not be secured and the debt ratio
continues to rise.

•

The required adjustment is centered on spending cuts. In the “Growth” scenario about
¥14 trillion (or 2½ percent of GDP) of cumulative savings is required and could be
achieved exclusively by limiting spending in public works, social security, and the civil
service. In this scenario, no revenue measures are needed.

The new plan suffers from
shortcomings and fails to capitalize on

(excluding social security) declines by

only about 0.2 percent of GDP per year.
By contrast, the primary balance fell by about 3 percent between FY2004 and FY2007,
implying that the authorities do not capitalize on the remarkable advances made through
FY2007.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 6, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Japan
On July 27, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Japan.1
Background
The current economic expansion is well into its sixth year. In 2006, GDP grew at 2.2 percent,
led mainly by business investment and net exports. After slowing in mid-year, private
consumption rebounded and activity has regained pace. Labor markets continue to tighten, but
wage growth is still sluggish. Inflation remains low, as core CPI inflation (excluding fresh food)
averaged 0.1 percent (year-on-year) in 2006 and since February, has dipped below zero—
mainly due to lower energy and communication prices. The GDP deflator continues to fall, but
the pace of decline has moderated and other indices, such as service and land prices, are on a
rising trend.
Japan’s external position remains strong. Boosted by investment income, the current account
surplus widened in 2006 to nearly 4 percent of GDP, despite a shrinking trade balance.
Financial outflows also picked up, reflecting mainly the secular decline in investor home bias
and to a lesser extent, yen-financed carry trades. Japan’s exchange rate is market-determined,
and there have been no official interventions in the foreign exchange market since March 2004.
In 2006, the yen depreciated against the U.S. dollar and the euro by 5½ percent and
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

6¼ percent, respectively. After depreciating more this year, the yen in real effective terms is at
its weakest in about 20 years.
The financial and corporate sectors continue to strengthen. Bank nonperforming loans fell
further in 2006, while capital ratios improved. Progress at regional banks has been more
uneven. Corporate profits reached record highs, and leverage is at a 50-year low. With lending
rates favorable and stock prices rising, financial conditions remain easy.
Fiscal consolidation has proceeded faster than expected, but the public debt ratio is still high.
Supported by buoyant corporate tax collection and sustained spending cuts, the primary deficit
for the general government (excluding social security) is projected to decline further to about
1 percent of GDP in FY2007 from over 5 percent of GDP four years ago. However, at above
80 percent of GDP, net public debt is one of the highest among Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and is still rising.
Monetary conditions remain supportive of the expansion. With no signs of inflation pressures or
worrisome financial imbalances, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has opted for a gradual pace of
adjustment—two quarter point hikes since July 2006.
The near-term economic outlook is favorable. GDP growth is projected at 2.6 percent in 2007
and 2.0 percent in 2008, increasingly driven by domestic demand. With activity close to full
capacity, CPI inflation is expected to pick up, but very slowly. The risks are balanced, with
downside risks mostly external (an unanticipated slowdown in the United States, volatile energy
prices, or global financial turbulence), while a tightening labor market could lead to faster
consumption.
Over the medium term, growth is expected to slow to potential—estimated at around
1.7 percent—and for the current account to narrow modestly. This scenario assumes a
continued strengthening of the financial and corporate sectors, a shrinking labor force, and
fiscal consolidation in line with the authorities’ plans. Deeper structural reforms could raise
potential growth and narrow further the current account.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Japan’s continued economic expansion and its solid
underpinnings. Supported by appropriate macroeconomic and structural policies, growth has
become more broad-based; the financial and corporate sectors have strengthened further, and
the labor market continues to improve. Directors took note that inflation remains very low but
expected it to pick up gradually as the economy operates close to full capacity.
Directors observed that Japan’s recovery has been accompanied by greater financial and trade
linkages with the global economy that are creating new challenges for policies. In this regard,
Directors stressed that achieving fiscal sustainability, promoting sustained non-inflationary
growth, strengthening further the financial system, and boosting productivity through additional
structural reforms would help Japan reap more fully the benefits from globalization.

Directors commended the authorities for the progress in reducing the fiscal deficit. They noted,
however, that the public debt-to-GDP ratio still remains uncomfortably high, and most Directors
encouraged the authorities to accelerate the pace of consolidation. Directors agreed that putting
the debt ratio firmly on a downward trajectory will make room for the fiscal costs of population
aging, buy “policy insurance” against adverse shocks, support private confidence, and improve
overall growth prospects with positive international spillovers.
Most Directors considered that given the size of the task at hand, additional revenue measures
will be needed, including for base broadening. They indicated that revenue measures could be
best identified in the context of a broad reform of the tax system that addresses the challenges
posed by Japan’s aging society and globalization. Among possible measures, increasing the
consumption tax has the benefit of being less detrimental to growth and equitable across
generations. Some Directors, however, viewed the authorities’ focus on expenditure
adjustments as broadly appropriate at this juncture.
Directors considered that monetary policy remains appropriately accommodative, given very
muted inflation risks. Some Directors pointed out that low interest rates in Japan are
contributing to capital outflows, including speculative carry trades, that complicate policy setting
in some recipient countries. On balance, Directors agreed that monetary policy should remain
focused on domestic price stability. With no signs of worrisome financial imbalances, a return to
a neutral monetary stance should proceed in tandem with inflation prospects. Many Directors
considered that to better guide expectations, communication of the monetary framework could
rely more on forward-looking policy statements and a greater emphasis on the 1 percent
median within the Policy Board members’ range of understanding on price stability.
Directors felt that, with the health of the banking system improving, financial policies are rightly
focused on the challenges ahead. They urged the authorities to maintain regulatory vigilance
and ensure sound risk management by financial institutions in the face of a growing appetite for
risky assets. Directors also highlighted the need to raise core profitability of banks, press ahead
with reforms of government financial institutions, and further develop the capital markets.
Directors stressed that deeper structural reforms are needed to improve Japan’s growth
potential and competitiveness. The reform priorities are to improve labor utilization and promote
competition through greater market opening and further deregulation. As highlighted by the
recent Multilateral Consultation, such reforms would also facilitate an orderly resolution of global
current account imbalances.
Directors agreed that the yen should continue to be market determined. They noted the staff’s
assessment that—notwithstanding the appropriate focus of macroeconomic and structural
policies—the yen appears to be undervalued relative to its longer-term value in real effective
terms, although this reflects, in part, a waning home bias of Japanese investors and their
greater demand for foreign assets. Several Directors noted factors that the Consultative Group
on Exchange Rate Issues (CGER) methodology does not fully take into account, including in
cases where the exchange rate is market determined. Directors felt that the yen could be
expected to appreciate over time, supported by policy reforms to boost domestic demand—
although capital outflows related to Japanese portfolio rebalancing might slow the adjustment.

4
In this regard, Directors supported the authorities’ policy of limiting intervention to counter
disruptive exchange rate movements. Continued careful monitoring of exchange rate
developments and their impact on the regional and global economy will be needed in the period
ahead.
Directors urged the Japanese authorities to do their utmost to help secure a balanced and
ambitious Doha Round agreement and seek provisions in Economic Partnership Agreements
that limit trade diversion and work effectively on a regional level.
