PHILIPPINES
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the
2009 Consultation with the Philippines
Approved by James Gordon and Tessa van der Willigen
January 4, 2010


Discussions: Manila, November 16–25, 2009. The mission met: Finance Secretary Teves,
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Tetangco, Budget Management Secretary
Andaya, National Economic Development Authority Secretary Santos, other senior
government officials, and private sector representatives.



Team: Messrs. I.H. Lee (Head), Eskesen, Ide, Li (all APD), Tuladhar (FAD),
Khandelwal (SPR), Choi (INS), and Botman (Resident Representative).
Ms. Vongpradhip (OED) attended some of the meetings.



Consultation focus: With signs of a nascent recovery, the discussions focused on the
need to put in place a credible fiscal consolidation strategy while avoiding premature exit
from other supportive macroeconomic policies. Discussions also focused on policies to
enhance financial sector stability and sustain growth over the medium term.



Policy dialogue: Fund advice has found traction in the areas of fiscal consolidation,
monetary policy regime, and reforms of the financial system and supervision.



Outreach: The mission held a press conference on November 25, which was well
attended and received extensive local media coverage.



Exchange rate: Philippine’s currency is the peso, which is classified as a floating
exchange rate regime. The Philippines has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments
and transfers for current international transactions.



Data: Data provision is overall adequate, but shortcomings remain. The 2004 Data ROSC
identified national accounts and balance of payments statistics as weak. The authorities
have made progress in these areas with technical assistance from STA.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: Growth is projected at ¾ percent in 2009 and is expected to recover to around
3¼ percent in 2010. The slowdown was cushioned by supportive fiscal and monetary policies
and resilient remittances. The recovery will likely be led by private consumption as confidence
improves. Investments and exports are also expected to benefit from the global recovery. Risks
to this outlook are broadly balanced.
Policy issues: The discussions focused on the need to put in place a credible fiscal consolidation
strategy while avoiding premature exit from other supportive macroeconomic policies.
Discussions also focused on policies to enhance financial sector stability and sustain growth over
the medium term.
Staff’s views: In view of the nascent recovery, staff recommends a measured fiscal withdrawal
in 2010 given the limited fiscal space. To demonstrate commitment to fiscal prudence, the
authorities should announce a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plan in parallel with the
2010 budget anchored on revenue raising measures. Exit from supportive monetary policies
should await clear signs that the recovery is on a solid footing. The financial sector is relatively
sound, but still faces some vulnerabilities. The authorities should consider introducing risk-based
capital requirements and a counter-cyclical macro-prudential framework. Passage of
amendments to the New Central Bank Act (NCBA) is also key to provide the supervisors with
needed legal powers and protection. To shift to higher growth over the medium term, the budget
should be reoriented towards public investment and the weak business environment must be
revamped to encourage private sector activities.
Authorities’ views: The authorities plan to contain the fiscal deficit in 2010, but noted that it
would be difficult to introduce revenue raising measures ahead of the May election. They shared
staff’s views that it would be useful to introduce a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation
plan anchored on tax reform. They did not see an urgent need to tighten the monetary policy
stance given the within-target inflation projected over the policy horizon, and agreed that exit
from supportive monetary policies should commence only when there are clear signs that the
recovery is self-sustainable. They were also mindful that a premature rate hike could attract
capital inflows. The authorities concurred that the exchange rate was broadly in line with
fundamentals and intend to continue to limit foreign exchange interventions to smoothing
operations. The financial sector is assessed to be generally sound, with banks benefiting from
high capital buffers and low nonperforming loans. The authorities were also closely following
the international debate on the lessons from the global crisis for micro- and macro-prudential
regulation. They are planning to introduce a counter-cyclical liquidity framework and are eager
to see the passage of the amendments to the NCBA. They acknowledge that structural reforms
were imperative to generate higher growth.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The economy was adversely impacted in late 2008 and early 2009 by the spillovers
from the global economic slowdown, but signs of stabilization have emerged. The Philippine
economy entered the crisis from a position of relative strength with limited direct exposure to
strained global financial institutions, much improved bank soundness, adequate international
reserves, and lower public debt due to fiscal consolidation in the preceding years. Moreover,
resilient remittances and a timely policy response helped cushion the impact on the economy.
Signs of stabilization have emerged in recent months in tandem with the improved global
economic trends and outlook.
2.
Mission focus: The 2009 Article IV discussions focused on two main themes. First, how
can the authorities best safeguard the nascent economic recovery? Second, which policies are
needed to reduce vulnerabilities and support growth over the medium term?
II. RECENT ECONOMIC TRENDS AND OUTLOOK
A. Stabilization and Signs of Nascent Recovery
3.
Following the dip early in the year, economic activity has rebounded while inflation
remains low.


Growth: The Philippine economy avoided a technical recession, as second and third
quarter GDP rebounded by 1.7 percent and 1.0 percent (q/q), respectively following the
2.1 percent (q/q) contraction in the first quarter when precautionary savings dampened
private consumption and weak exports discouraged investment. The rebound was driven
by resilient remittances, supportive macroeconomic policies, and a modest rebound in
exports on a sequential basis, underpinned by global restocking.

Inflation: Consumer price inflation has trended down during the year, reaching
3¼ percent (y/y) during January–November 2009, slightly below the middle of the BSP’s
inflation target range of 3½ ± 1 percent. The deceleration in inflation has primarily been

5
driven by the decline in food and
commodity prices following their 2008
spike. Core inflation has also declined
over the year from around 7 percent (y/y)
at end-2008 to 2¾ percent (y/y) as of
November 2009.


Financial markets: Market conditions
have normalized with equity prices at precrisis levels, broadly in line with regional
trends. Credit spreads have narrowed
supported by the return of risk appetite and
ample liquidity in advanced economies.
The improved market sentiment has
encouraged increased corporate and
sovereign bond issuances.

Capital flows: The Philippines has not experienced the same strong reflow of capital as
many of its Asian peers. While the return of risk appetite has led to a resumption of
foreign inflows, the funds have primarily flowed into Philippine government and
corporate bond markets. The recovery in the stock market, on the other hand, has
primarily been fueled by local investors.

Current account and exchange rate: The current account has held up well. Exports were
severely affected by the crisis on account of the high share of electronics, although they
have recovered recently on a sequential basis. The trade balance was less affected due to
the significant decline in food and commodity prices, and a drop in imports of capital and
intermediate goods. Moreover, resilient remittance flows have helped prop up the current
account balance. The exchange rate has appreciated around 7 percent against the U.S.
dollar since the height of the crisis in November 2008, but has depreciated by around
2 percent on a trade-weighted basis over the same period.

B. Economic Recovery Underway but Return to Higher Growth Not Assured
4.
Economic activity is expected to recover gradually over the near term and risks
appear broadly balanced.


Baseline: Growth is expected at ¾ percent in 2009 and to recover to around 3¼ percent in
2010. The recovery in 2010 will likely be led by private consumption as confidence and
remittances improve. Exports and investments are also expected to benefit from the
global recovery.



Risks to short-term outlook: The risks are broadly balanced and largely depend on the
global economic outturn through the export and remittance channels. On the domestic
side, the output losses from the devastation caused by the two recent typhoons could turn
out to be higher than currently estimated. A wider-than-anticipated fiscal deficit could
dampen investor confidence and result in higher risk premia. On the upside, the
post-typhoon rebuilding efforts could spur higher investment and consumption.

5.
Sustaining the recovery over the medium term will require progress in key reform
areas.


Baseline: Potential growth will likely be lower than during the pre-crisis period. External
demand and remittances from advanced economies could prove permanently lower in the

7
post-crisis environment (Box 1). Furthermore, a weak recovery could affect bank balance
sheets, including banks’ willingness to lend. This baseline already assumes 2 percent of
GDP in tax measures over the medium term, which could be partly generated from the sin
tax reform measures currently awaiting Congressional approval. However, in the absence
of these tax measures, public debt would remain at an elevated level (Appendix I, “no
policy change” scenario).


Reform scenario: To exceed the baseline growth rate, structural reforms will be required
in a number of areas. While subject to the same external risks as in the baseline scenario,
stepped-up fiscal reforms, including a substantial strengthening of the tax base, would
allow for higher outlays on growth-enhancing infrastructure and a deepening of social
programs. In addition, product market and governance reforms to tackle the weak
business environment could further raise the growth potential through stronger domestic
and foreign investment. This would not only help strengthen domestic sources of growth,
but would support competitiveness and allow the Philippines to tap into new export
markets, especially in Asia.

6.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s assessment. They expected that the
economy would continue to recover on account of resilient remittances and supportive
macroeconomic policies. However, due to the negative impact of the recent typhoons on
economic activity in the fourth quarter, they expect that growth will reach the lower end of the
0.8–1.8 percent forecast range in 2009, but recover to 2.6–3.6 percent in 2010, in line with the
staff’s projections. They also shared staff’s view that the rebalancing of the global economy
could reduce Philippines’ potential growth in the medium term. Inflation was projected to fall
within the target range over the policy horizon and was broadly in line with staff’s forecast.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on the need to put in place a well-designed fiscal consolidation strategy
while avoiding premature exit from supportive macroeconomic policies in light of the moderate
recovery. Discussions on the medium-term policies centered around the need to reduce
vulnerabilities and support economic growth through further progress on fiscal consolidation,
enhanced financial sector stability, and an improved business climate.

Box 1. Sustainability of the Recovery in the Post-Crisis Period
Two different approach are used to identify the main drivers of growth in the years prior to the global
economic crisis:



Growth accounting: Staff analysis suggests that the contribution of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) to
growth has been large in the recent past. At the same time, the Incremental Capital Output Ratio
(ICOR) has declined suggesting gains in capital efficiency in the Philippines (and other ASEAN
economies) in recent years. The latter may also partly reflect that investment levels pre-Asian crisis
were not sustainable.

Cross-country panel regression: Panel
regressions suggest that investment and
exports have been the main contributors to
growth in Asia, although somewhat less so in
the case of the Philippines. Export is
estimated to have contributed between
1-3 percentage points to growth during 2002
to 2007, and investments made a similar
contribution. Based on this regression, a
one percent drop in advanced economies’
growth rate will reduce export growth in
ASEAN economies (excluding Singapore) by
almost four percentage points on average and
GDP growth by ½ percentage point.

A number of tentative conclusions can be drawn from these results. First, the improvement in TFP
suggests that the economic reforms efforts in the Philippines since the Asian crisis may have lifted productivity
and should be further enhanced to support growth over the medium term, including through a strengthening of
the weak business climate (see below). Second, these reforms may also help raise the relatively low
contribution from external demand to growth by strengthening competitiveness and the ability to tap into new
export markets over the medium term. Finally, these reforms may also encourage higher investments in the
Philippines, which according to the lower ICOR could result in a relatively high impact on growth.

9
over 2 percentage points of GDP higher than in 2008. The 2009 deficit outturn is estimated at
about 4½ percent of GDP, overshooting the budgeted target primarily due to cyclical and
legislative revenue-eroding measures such as increases in personal income tax exemptions and
replacement of the VAT on power transmission with a franchise tax. Some progress was made,
however, in tax compliance following stronger tax enforcement activities. This deficit implied an
expansionary fiscal impulse of around 2¼ percent of GDP in 2009 and a growth impact of
around 1 percentage points based on GIMF simulations (Box 2).
8.
The authorities have so far not faced financing constraints, but further fiscal
slippage next year could raise concerns about sustainability. Ample domestic liquidity and
favorable international market conditions have so far allowed the government to easily finance
the nonfinancial public sector borrowing need of 20 percent of GDP in 2009. Nonetheless,
structural erosion of the tax base could raise investors’ concerns about fiscal sustainability and
increase financing costs as they demand higher risk premia.
9.
The government plans to target a deficit of 3 percent of GDP (IMF definition) in
2010 and to balance the budget by 2013. The planned reduction in the deficit is expected to be
achieved through (i) an ambitious revenue collection target well above the expected 2009 outturn
in percent of GDP, and (ii) a sharp scale-back of infrastructure and maintenance spending.
Combined, these are projected to more than offset the expected increase in personnel expenses
due to the salary standardization law approved this year. With the onset of the global economic
crisis, the government decided to delay the balancing of the budget by three years to 2013, but
the concrete measures to underpin the planned consolidation efforts have yet to be identified.
Policy Issues and Staff Views
10.
The fiscal policy easing in 2009 was appropriate and relatively effective, but the
limited fiscal space would argue for a measured withdrawal in 2010. The stimulus spending
measures targeted at infrastructure and liquidity constrained households have likely been
effective in supporting growth in 2009 (Box 2). However, despite the only moderate economic
recovery expected in 2010, staff advised capping the deficit at 3½ percent of GDP to contain the
high public debt level. This deficit would imply a negative fiscal impulse of about 1 percent of
GDP. Yet, even this target is not achievable without new fiscal measures given that the erosion
of the tax base has weakened the fiscal position and the growing proliferation of tax incentives
suggests that revenue in 2010 will remain at best at the 2009 level. Staff, therefore,
recommended (i) slowing the increase in the civil service wage bill and (ii) introducing new
legislative and administrative revenue measures yielding about ½ percent of GDP. This will also
help make room for public investment, including for post-typhoon rehabilitation and
reconstruction.
11.
To underscore the commitment to fiscal prudence, a credible medium-term
consolidation plan should be announced in parallel with the 2010 budget. This could help

Public investment is found to be most effective
in increasing growth in the Philippines.
Simulations using the IMF’s Global Integrated
Monetary and Fiscal (GIMF) model calibrated for
the Philippines show that the short-term (1-year)
multipliers for expenditure measures range from
0.2 to 0.8 percent, with investment spending
having the largest impact on growth. This is
comparable to estimates of 0.4 to 1.1 percent
found for emerging Asia 1. The growth impact of
general tax cuts, however, is smaller, ranging
from 0.1 to 0.4 percent.

GIMF simulations also show that the government’s stimulus package, the Economic Resiliency
Plan, clearly helped support growth. Key components in the plan included transitory increases in
infrastructure and targeted social benefits spending, along with permanent cuts in personal and corporate
income taxes (with the latter approved before the onset of the crisis). If fully implemented, this package of
around 2½ percent of GDP in 2009 could have increased output in the short term by an estimated
1¼ percent and in the medium term by 2¼ percent. However, only around ¾ has been implemented,
implying a somewhat smaller fiscal impulse.

growth. This is consistent with other studies that found tax-based consolidations to have a stronger impact
in countries with a low tax effort. Spending reforms that protect and increase investment are also found to
have a more favorable growth impact. 2 Debt would also be contained as consolidation is partly achieved
through revenue measures.

dampen investor concern about sustainability. The consolidation strategy should build on
revenue-raising measures, which should also allow for more pro-poor spending and growthenhancing investment. In this context, staff supports the authorities’ plans to review the broader
tax reform strategy with IMF technical support and encourage an early passage of the sin tax and
incentives rationalization measures currently before Congress. Strengthening of revenue
administration efforts, especially for large tax payers, is also crucial to bolster tax collections.
The government’s consolidation plans should also include steps to rationalize the National Food
Authority (NFA) through full cost recovery and by limiting its role to food security. The finances
of other government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) should also be strengthened.
12.
A formalized fiscal framework would further underscore the credibility of the
consolidation plans. A good first step in this direction would be to submit a medium-term
budget framework alongside the budget to the legislature. Consideration could also be given to
adopt a Fiscal Responsibility Law, eventually supplemented with an explicit numerical rule to
anchor fiscal policy. Such a rule would help reduce concerns about the public debt level, which
while broadly sustainable, remains at a relatively high level and is sensitive to exchange rate and
contingent liabilities shocks. Closer monitoring of contingent liabilities, including public-private
partnership (PPP) guarantees, therefore, is key to enhance the management of fiscal risks.
The Authorities’ Views
13.
As reflected in the 2010 budget, the authorities agreed on the need for a measured
fiscal withdrawal next year to contain the deficit. The authorities did not favor the revenueeroding measures passed by Congress, and have been advocating a moratorium on such
proposals. However, they cautioned that even in the event of lower-than-budgeted revenue
performance, it would be very difficult to pass any of the revenue enhancing reforms currently
before Congress in the run-up to the May elections. They agreed that the decline in public
investment in the 2010 budget should be reviewed, especially considering the higher investment
spending needed for post-typhoon reconstruction. They saw limited scope to compress the rapid
rise in the civil service wage bill due to political constraints, but were hopeful that expenditures
in other areas could be cut, especially unallocated reserves.
14.
The authorities agreed that it would be important to prepare a credible mediumterm consolidation strategy. With input from an FAD TA mission early next year, they will
prepare a strategy to raise the tax effort for the new government taking office in July 2010. The
authorities acknowledged that rationalizing the NFA and strengthening finances of other GOCCs
is challenging. However, they also pointed out the considerable progress made on the
privatization of the power companies and the stepped-up efforts to ensure cost recovery. The
authorities saw merit in gradually introducing a more formalized medium-term fiscal framework
and explained that they were currently working on strengthening the medium-term expenditure
framework and budgeting procedures. Moreover, the authorities recognized the need for an
integrated debt management framework, which could also help internalize the risks associated
with the various guarantees extended.

Inflation expectations remain well-anchored and credit growth has decelerated in
recent months. As the economy slowed and inflation declined in response to the easing of food
and fuel prices, inflation expectations followed suit and remain well-anchored at a level
consistent with the BSP’s inflation target. Credit growth has also decelerated due to key
customers reaching the single borrower limits, some tightening in credit standards, and a
substitution to corporate bond financing.

Box 3. Monetary Policy Transmissions
The transmission mechanism in the Philippines works through the interest rate as well as
indirectly through the exchange rate channels. The policy rate influences prices directly through the
signaling effect, and various market rates which in turn affect asset prices and domestic demand.
Monetary policy also works through the exchange rate, whereby prices are affected by the direct passthrough and, less plausibly, the indirect expectation channel as explained below.
The policy rate (RRP) is transmitted onto various market rates and maturities. To find the
impact of rate R on rate X, a quarterly error-correction model (ECM) is estimated on the basis of a
simple long-run relationship: X t   0   R Rt   t (  R  0 ) with  being an error term. Evidence of

The estimated long-run exchange rate pass-through to consumer prices is about 60 percent for
1989–2009. In recent years, financial integration has made the exchange rate more responsive to
changes in domestic interest rates as balance-of-payment flows have become more sensitive to interest
rate changes. In the former case, net foreign assets (NFAs) relative to M3 will rise, while in the latter
case the exchange rate will move. A stable empirical link of prices with the exchange rate and
NFA/M3 is identified for 1989Q1–2009Q2 using quarterly data.2 A sub-sample analysis covering
2000Q1–2009Q2 suggests weaker direct exchange rate pass-through but a substantially stronger
NFA/M3 impact on consumer prices. Also, the contemporaneous pass-through effect has increased
significantly during this period. The rationale behind the impact of NFA/M3 on prices appears to be
either a wealth effect-type pressure arising from the sterilized amount or future consumption
expectation.

projected output gap and divergence of inflation from the central bank target, the current policy
rates are assessed to be broadly appropriate.

19.
The exit from accommodative monetary policy should commence only when the
recovery is on a solid footing. A premature tightening might stall the recovery, especially once
the fiscal stance becomes contractionary. Higher policy rates could also induce speculative
inflows, leading to currency appreciation that could slow the recovery in exports. The mopping
up of any excess liquidity as monetary policy is tightened will not be challenging as the
expansion of the central bank balance sheet in the Philippines was very limited.
20.
Staff supports limiting foreign exchange market intervention to smoothing excessive
movements. Official international reserves accumulation in the Philippines has been
pronounced, but the increase was only to a limited extent due to direct foreign exchange
intervention. Instead, the BSP used foreign exchange swap to smooth the volatility in dollar
liquidity from short-term capital inflows and a shift in residents’ preference from dollar to peso
holdings. With the exchange rate currently assessed to be broadly aligned with fundamentals, the
authorities should continue to allow the exchange rate to adjust to market pressures. At the same,
some further buildup in reserves could be allowed to continue to adequately cover short-term
debt as well as foreign currency deposits.

The Authorities’ Views
21.
The authorities saw no urgent need to raise policy rates over the near term. While
the latest inflation forecast suggests a slightly higher path, the BSP emphasized that it remained
closer to the lower bound of the target range over the policy horizon. They further pointed out
that demand-side pressures continue to be limited and inflation expectations are well anchored,
while price pressures from typhoon-related crop losses would likely only prove temporary. The
authorities would hold off exit from supportive monetary policies until there are clear signs that
the economic recovery is self-sustainable and the downside risks to the inflation outlook have
dissipated. In terms of sequencing, they would roll back liquidity enhancing measures before
raising the policy rate.
22.
The authorities concurred with staff’s assessment of the exchange rate. They
reiterated that the peso is market determined and foreign exchange market interventions are
limited to smoothing excessive movements, while allowing for the adequate accumulation of
reserves. Consistent with this, the authorities explained that they would allow the exchange rate
to adjust to further upward pressures in the event of stronger balance of payments flows while
allowing for a modest buildup in reserves for prudential reasons.
C. Financial Sector—Drawing Lessons from the Crisis
23.
The financial sector has weathered the global financial crisis relatively well, and
balance sheet risks would appear manageable.

16


Bank earnings have improved during the first half of 2009 as global economic and
financial conditions stabilized. Operating income was up by 18½ percent (y/y) during the
first six months led by widening net interest margins and solid credit growth despite the
slowdown, partly reflecting a return to traditional banking following the global crisis.
Moreover, first-half net profits were up by
33 percent over the same period last year.
Capital Adequacy Ratios
(In percent)



Capitalization remains high with the
capital adequacy ratio (CAR) at
15.3 percent as of March 2009. Moreover,
most capital is Tier 1 (12.4 percent), which
remains above minimum requirements
even after adjustment for deferred losses.1

Nonperforming loans (NPLs) also remain
low on average, although not uniformly
across institutions. Thrift and rural banks,
accounting only for about 10 percent of
banking sector assets, have relatively
higher NPLs. In addition, the NPL ratio on
loans extended to households is elevated at
around 9 percent as of June 2009, largely
due to high delinquencies on credit card
debt. However, household loans account
for less than 20 percent of total bank loans.
The large holdings of foreclosed properties,
however, are assessed to pose less risk than
previously thought. Total nonperforming
assets (net of provisions) are relatively high
at close to 30 percent of equity. But, they
have declined in recent years and the
properties are in many cases booked
conservatively on the balance sheets.

These losses were realized when banks sold part of their stock of nonperforming loans generated during the late

24.

A potential vulnerability stems from the relatively high concentration risk. Given the
presence of large conglomerates, some banks’ exposures are concentrated on relatively
few large corporate borrowers, making them vulnerable in case one or more of them
defaults.
Corporate balance sheets have improved noticeably in recent years.



The corporate sector entered the global
crisis from a stronger position than during
the Asian crisis. Leverage for nonfinancial
corporates is considerably lower; the share
of short-term debt has declined; liquidity
risks have receded; and the interest
coverage ratio (earnings to interest
expenditures) has increased significantly.

The financial sector faces a number of vulnerabilities, but appears relatively
resilient to potential downside risks. While banks remain well capitalized and NPL ratios are
low, the projected moderate economic growth may constrain bank earnings and could lead to a
deterioration in asset quality. However, stress tests by IMF staff and rating agencies (Fitch
Ratings and Moody’s) suggest that the financial sector is quite robust to adverse shocks. Stress
tests conducted during the November 2009 joint IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSSA) update mission showed that the largest banks were generally resilient to
adverse shocks, including relatively severe macroeconomic shocks.3 However, the tests showed
that banks are vulnerable to the failure of one or more large conglomerates, due to the high

concentration risks, and a permanent jump in interest rates given their significant holdings of
government securities.
26.
The global financial crisis has brought a number of important lessons for future
reform, which are also relevant for the Philippines.


Micro-prudential regulation: A more risk-based approach to capital requirements is
desirable to better reflect institutional risk profiles. In this regard, staff welcomes the
planned introduction in 2011 of the internal capital adequacy assessment process
(ICAAP) under the Basle II, Pillar 2 framework as an important first steps. Continuing to
strengthen banks’ risk management capacities also remains key and staff welcomes the
authorities continued efforts to enhance their own stress-testing capacities.



Macro-prudential regulation: Current regulatory tools in the Philippines and elsewhere
do not serve to dampen the potential pro-cyclicality of financial markets. As such, there
may be scope for considering changes to required capital, collateral, liquidity, or loss
provisioning requirements. However, these should be subject to the outturn of the
ongoing international debate on the appropriate design of counter-cyclical frameworks.

27.
The authorities reacted promptly to the crisis, but there is still some scope to
enhance the existing contingency framework. The BSP enhanced monitoring and
stress-testing, and provided liquidity support. Moreover, deposit insurance coverage was
doubled. Looking ahead, there may be further scope to strengthen the prompt corrective action
(PCA) framework by instituting earlier, faster, and increasingly severe action. The resolution
framework could also be further enhanced, including through the elimination of the rehabilitation
period for owners during receivership, the introduction of a bridge-bank facility, and a more
flexible purchase and assumption facility. Moreover, restructuring decisions should be legally
irreversible; and BSP and Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation staff should be protected
against litigation.
The Authorities’ Views
28.
The authorities generally agreed with staff’s assessment of the soundness of the
financial sector. The overall financial system is sound and resilient to the potential deterioration
in earnings and asset quality, which had been confirmed through their own stress-testing
exercises. While the authorities agreed that concentration risks are relatively high, they
considered this inevitable given the dominance of the large conglomerates. Moreover, they
emphasized that the large corporates were well-monitored and their financial positions were
generally sound. The authorities noted that the large holdings of foreclosed properties did not
present a risk to banks since the conservative book values would allow for a significant decline
in property prices before it would impact capitalization.
29.
The authorities agreed with the basic contours of staff’s policy recommendations.
They were keenly following the international efforts to address the gaps revealed in micro- and

19
macro-prudential regulation by the recent crisis. In fact, they plan to introduce counter-cyclical
liquidity measures, in line with steps taken in Australia and Hong Kong SAR. The authorities
also explained that the passage of the NCBA amendments would provide them with adequate
legal powers and protection to meet their core mandates by (i) lifting the remaining constraints
imposed by bank secrecy laws on examiners, (ii) enhancing the scope for risk-based supervision,
(iii) further strengthening the PCA and resolution framework, including by limiting shareholders’
rights when capital falls below minimum requirements, and (iv) authorizing the BSP to issue its
own debt securities to ensure more effective monetary management.
D. Structural Policies—Rebalancing and Strengthening Growth
Background
30.
The global financial crisis will have a long-term impact on the global sources of
growth, with clear implications for the Philippines. Specifically, the Philippines could be
impacted through slower growth in exports and remittances from workers in advanced
economies (Box 4). At the same time, the new global economic landscape also provides
opportunities for the Philippines. If the global rebalancing proves successful, increased domestic
demand in emerging Asian economies could partly offset the decline in advanced economies’
growth.
31.
However, the weak business climate will make it difficult to shift to new sources of
growth and attract needed foreign investment. The weak business climate reflects the
lingering problems with corruption as identified by various surveys, including by Transparency
International. It also reflects the high administrative burdens, including with respect to starting a
business. In turn, the weak business climate is reflected in a relatively low investment-to-GDP
ratio and foreign investment.

flows.
1/ Based on data available as of end-Oct. 2009
To analyze the macroeconomic implications of remittances, we extended the IMF’s Global
Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF).




Specifically, remittances are introduced as (exogenous) lump-sum transfers to consumers and as
lump-sum taxes on households (used as transfers to consumers) between countries. Net remittances
received are added to human wealth for “optimizing consumers;” while for “liquidity-constrained
consumers” they are added directly to consumption. Remittance flows are channeled through the
balance of payments, which required an augmentation of the current account equation in GIMF.
Obviously, the macroeconomic effects of remittances are sensitive to whether these flows are
consumed or saved by the receiving

households.
Impact of Permanent 2.5 Percent Decline in Remittances
1

The simulation result shows that a
permanent decline in remittances brought on
by weaker growth in advanced economies
could have an impact on GDP growth and,
in particular, on private consumption given
the high share of liquidity constrained
households in the Philippines (assumed at
around 60 percent). This could have
significant welfare consequences, which
underscores the risks associated with relying
so heavily on this income source.

Tackling corruption: Continued and decisive measures are urgently needed to address

additional costs of doing business.



Reduce administrative hurdles: Steps could include: (i) cutting back on the number of
procedures needed to start a business and speed up the processing; (ii) stepping efforts to
strengthen corporate governance by raising disclosure requirements and director
liabilities; and (iii) improving the existing bankruptcy law and administrative bottlenecks
in the bankruptcy process.

reducing or phasing out minimum wages while strengthening social safety nets, and
reducing redundancy notice periods and severance pay.



Improving the basic infrastructure: Continued fiscal consolidation will be important to
finance greater public investment, essential to solicit private sector investment.

The Authorities’ Views
33.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s view that reforms were needed to sustain and
strengthen economic growth over the medium term. To help achieve this, they would
continue to push for the implementation of development strategies to improve competitiveness
and investment in human capital. They also shared staff’s views that governance reform would
be crucial to strengthen the business climate and attract foreign investment. Making fiscal room
for additional outlays on growth-enhancing government spending and continued power sector
privatization was also considered a key pillar in the medium-term growth strategy.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Following the initial adverse impact from the global crisis, the economy is now
recovering. Growth is projected to reach ¾ percent in 2009 and rise to about 3¼ percent in
2010. The deceleration in 2009 is broad based with expansionary macroeconomic policies and
resilient remittances cushioning the slowdown. The recovery in 2010 will likely be led by
consumption as confidence and remittances improve. Exports and investments are also likely to
benefit from the global recovery. Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced.
35.
The expansionary fiscal stance in 2009 was appropriate, but a measured withdrawal
would be desirable in 2010 given the limited fiscal space. The fiscal stimulus proved an
effective response to the weak economic environment at the height of the global crisis. However,
the revenue target was breached due to a structural weakening of the tax base, well beyond
cyclical factors. Despite the only moderate economic recovery expected in 2010, staff
recommends capping the deficit at 3½ percent of GDP to avoid jeopardizing investor confidence.
To achieve this, the authorities should introduce fiscal savings measures.
36.
A credible medium-term consolidation plan announced in parallel with the 2010
budget would demonstrate commitment to fiscal prudence. Consolidation efforts should
build on revenue-raising measures, which would also allow for more pro-poor spending and
growth enhancing investment. Consolidation plans should also focus on improving the finances
of GOCCs, including NFA.

22
37.
The eventual introduction of a formalized fiscal framework would further
underscore the credibility of the consolidation plan. A good first step would be to submit a
medium-term budget framework alongside the budget to the legislature. This could be
supplemented with an explicit numerical fiscal rule to help anchor fiscal policy. Closer
monitoring of contingent liabilities, including PPPs, will also enhance the management of fiscal
risks.
38.
The exit from accommodative monetary policy should await clear signs that a
sustained recovery is underway. BSP’s proactive steps, including a 200 basis point cut in
interest rates since end-2008, helped cushion the adverse spillovers from the global crisis. In
view of the still negative output gap and the need to tighten fiscal policy, it is too early to tighten
monetary policy at this stage. The exit should start with a rollback of liquidity-enhancing
measures.
39.
Foreign exchange market interventions should remain limited to smoothing
operations. Currently, the exchange rate is assessed to be broadly aligned with fundamentals and
should be allowed to adjust to market pressures, including from resurgence in capital inflows.
40.
The financial sector is broadly sound and appears relatively resilient to potential
downside risks. While banks remain well capitalized and NPL ratios are low, moderate
economic growth will constrain bank earnings and potentially lead to a deterioration in asset
quality. However, stress tests by IMF staff and rating agencies suggest that the financial sector is
quite robust to adverse shocks, although the relatively high concentration of exposures makes
banks vulnerable to tail-risk events.
41.
The financial sector is generally sound, but current BSP initiatives are expected to
further strengthen bank supervision. Capital requirements should be more risk-based and, in
this respect, staff welcomes the planned introduction of the ICAAP in 2011. Early passage of the
amendment to the NCBA currently in Congress is also important as it will lift the remaining
constraints imposed by bank secrecy laws on examiners and enhance the scope for risk-based
supervision. There is, however, scope to further strengthen the PCA framework by allowing for
earlier, faster, and increasingly severe actions. The resolution framework should eliminate the
rehabilitation period for owners during receivership, and allow the use of a bridge-bank and a
more flexible purchase and assumption facility.
42.
To raise potential growth over the medium term, higher investment will be essential.
To achieve this, two bottlenecks will have to be overcome: enhancing basic infrastructure and
improving the business environment. A substantial strengthening of the tax effort will be needed
to finance essential public infrastructure investments. At the same time, it will be important to
take significant steps to improve the weak business climate, including by reducing the high
administrative burdens.
43.
Staff recommends the next Article IV consultation be on the standard 12-month
cycle.

APPENDIX I. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The Philippines’ public sector debt is broadly sustainable. Fiscal reforms, strong growth and
an appreciating exchange rate have contributed to a rapid decline in nonfinancial public sector
(NFPS) debt over recent years. In staff’s baseline scenario, an uptick in debt levels is expected in
2009–10 as the impact from the global financial crisis reverses these trends. Moreover, assuming
in this scenario that revenue reforms are implemented with the goal of achieving a 1 percent of
GDP National Government deficit by 2013, the NFPS debt is expected to decline gradually to the
pre-crisis level by then. In the absence of reforms, however, debt is expected to remain at an
elevated level of 60 percent of GDP in 2013. Public debt dynamics remains most vulnerable to
shocks to the exchange rate and contingent liabilities.
Projected external debt dynamics are generally benign. In recent years, external debt has
steadily declined—from nearly 80 percent of GDP in 2002 to around 40 percent at end-2008.
Under the staff’s baseline scenario, the external debt ratio would fall gradually over the medium
term to just over 33 percent in 2014. However, the debt dynamics are still vulnerable to exchange
rate volatility. Indeed, a one-time real depreciation of 30 percent is estimated to entail a
22 percentage point jump in the external debt ratio from its 2008 level, which would exceed
60 percent in the medium term. However, the debt dynamics are more resilient to interest rate
and growth shocks, and are only moderately affected by noninterest shocks to the current
account.

1/ Nonfinancial public sector includes the national government, CB-BOL, 14 monitored government-owned enterprises, social security institutions, and local governments. Debt is gross and consolidated (net of
intra-nonfinancial public sector holdings of debt).
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Exchange Arrangement:

The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating, while the de facto exchange
arrangement is classified as floating. The value of the Philippine peso is determined in the
interbank foreign exchange market; the Bangko Sentral intervenes in the spot and forward
markets in order to smooth undue short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate and to
strategically build reserves.

ANNEX II. PHILIPPINES: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
The World Bank Program
Strategy
The current Philippines Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) covers the period July 1, 2009 to
June 30, 2012 (FY10-12). It is anchored in the country’s Medium-Term Philippine
Development Plan, and carries the theme of Making Growth Work for the Poor. Its overall
goal is to achieve inclusive growth through five Strategic Objectives: (i) Stable Macro
Economy; (ii) Improved Investment Climate; (iii) Better Public Service Delivery;
(iv) Reduced Vulnerabilities; and (v) Good Governance, which is also a cross-cutting theme.
Shifts in strategy from the previous CAS include increased focus on direct poverty reduction;
operationalized focus on governance; expanded and re-focused knowledge agenda; and
strengthened linkages to global issues––climate change and disaster risk management.
Lending Program
Since the World Bank started operations in the Philippines, it has committed approximately
$13 billion under IBRD loans and $244 million under IDA credits. As of October 31, 2009,
the Philippine portfolio consisted of 24 projects, amounting to $1.4 billion with undisbursed
balance of $908 million. Four operations amounting to $320 million were approved in FY09:
Food Crisis Response Development Policy Operation ($200 million); Participatory Irrigation
Development Project ($70.4 million); Additional Financing for Rural Power Project
($40 million); and Additional Financing for Agrarian Reform and Community Development
Project ($10 million). Based on net commitments by sector, the current portfolio can be
broken down as follows: infrastructure ($532 million, 38 percent); human development
($372 million, 26 percent); rural development and environment ($332 million, 24 percent);
social development ($139 million, 10 percent); and others ($33 million, 2 percent). For
FY10, the Social Welfare and Development Reform Project ($405 million) was approved on
November 17, 2009.
Under the CAS, IBRD anticipated lending program is in the order of US$700 millionUS$1 billion per year, with lower commitments expected for FY10 due to the May 2010
elections. The IFC investment program is expected to be in the order of US$250–300 million
per year, while advisory services will be supported by funding of approximately US$3
million per year.
Non-Lending Program
An important aspect of World Bank support to the Philippines is in the form of analytical and
advisory activities (AAA) leveraged through partnerships with other organizations,
administration of trust funds, and policy dialogue. Examples of AAA outputs in FY09
include the Quarterly Economic Updates, the Philippine Development Report, and the Public
Expenditure Report for the Transport Sector.
The Bank has an extensive outreach program in the Philippines to promote knowledge

6
sharing. Currently, there are 12 Knowledge for Development Centers (KDCs) around the
country that make available Bank publications and development literature either through online access or through hard copies. The Bank has also partnered with the Asian Institute of
Management to create a Global Distance Learning Network that offers distance learning
sessions for a broad national, regional, and international audience.
Partnerships
Strategic partnerships, supported by large bilateral and multi-donor trust funds administered
by the World Bank, form a significant part of the country program. Large trust funds in the
health and education sectors are supported by the European Commission and AusAID
respectively. In addition, partnerships are facilitated through global funds such as the Global
Environmental Facility, Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility, Carbon Finance
Funds, Cities Alliance, Water and Sanitation Program, and others. Important recently
approved trust funds include the Australian=funded umbrella Trust Fund, the Global
Partnership Fund (GPF), and the State and Peace-Building Fund (SPF).
The Philippines Development Forum (PDF) is the primary mechanism of the government for
facilitating substantive policy dialogue among various development partners and other
stakeholders on the country’s development agenda. The PDF is chaired by the Philippine
Government, represented by the Department of Finance, and the World Bank serves as the
co-chair. The PDF has eight working groups, which facilitate the policy dialogue throughout
the year related to the working groups’ specific themes. Partnerships with the Government,
other development partners, and other stakeholders on the policy reform agenda are
facilitated through the PDF process.

ANNEX III. PHILIPPINES: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
From January 2005 to September 30, 2009, the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) approved
fourteen public sector loans totaling $2.86 billion,1 including $2.65 billion for nine policybased loans2 and $41.64 million for 39 technical assistance and grant-financed projects;
generated $559 million in co-financing; approved $224.4 million for private sector
operations; and supported two peso bond issues totaling pesos 7.5 billion to finance local
currency operations.3
Since joining the AsDB in 1966, the Philippines has received 192 loans for a total of
$11 billion, and 354 technical assistance grants amounting to $162.37 million. Energy and
agriculture account for the largest proportion of lending (Table 1). Since 1998, 80 percent of
lending has been for policy-based operations and 20 percent for investment projects.

AsDB’s private sector operations in the Philippines, which are made without government
guarantee, began in 1986. As of 30 June 2009, cumulative approvals for 25 private sector
projects amounted to $648.1 million. The Philippines is among the largest recipients of
private sector operations support from AsDB, receiving 28 percent of its total 2008 private
sector loan and equity disbursements. AsDB’s private sector operations in the Philippines
1

Five project loans for $210 million were among these.

In 2009, two policy-based loans totaling $750 million (90 percent of all lending) and two project loans were
approved.

These comprised bond issues of P 2.5 billion in October 2005 and P 5 billion in May 2007 to fund a loan to a
special-purpose vehicle for the resolution of nonperforming loans.

10
included financing for power plants, and investments in banks and private equity funds. In
2000, AsDB approved a direct loan of up to $45 million and $25 million in loans under
AsDB’s complementary financing scheme for the rehabilitation of the expressway that links
Metro Manila, the national capital, to the central and northern provinces of the Philippines.
Completed in February 2005, the expansion and improvement of the road to world standards
spurred development in other regions and decentralized economic activities from congested
Metro Manila. In 2004, AsDB approved a loan and equity investment totaling $34 million for
a project that will help fund the purchase of a portfolio of nonperforming mortgage loans
secured by single-family homes located throughout the Philippines. In 2008, a $200 million
loan was approved and disbursed for the acquisition, rehabilitation, and operation of an
existing coal-fired thermal power plant in the Philippines.
Private sector operations can be applied flexibly across projects, though the focus would be
on the development of critical infrastructure projects and promotion of key financial sector
initiatives. Targeted infrastructure projects include power generation and transmission,
renewable energy, energy efficiency, water supply, sanitation and waste management sectors,
toll road construction and operation, light rail systems, housing finance, and port operations.
In the financial sector, target opportunities include (i) provision of a loan to domestic banks
or nonbank companies to support microfinance and small and medium enterprises; (ii) asset
backed securities; (iii) support for the issuance of corporate bonds to develop the capital
market, and (iv) partial credit guarantees to support lending to small and medium-term
enterprises.
The AsDB’s Philippines Country Strategy and Program 2005–07 (CSP) provides the
framework for the alignment of AsDB’s operations with Philippine priorities. Given the
strategic continuous relevance of CSP and AsDB intention to synchronize the next five-year
CPS with the Mid-Term Philippines Development Plan 2011-2016, the 2005-07 CPS was
extended three times through Country Operations Business Plans for 2007–08, 2009–2010,
and 2010–2012, respectively. Through its annual lending allocation of around
$620 million/year during 2010–2012, AsDB would continue its support for medium-term
reforms via the Financial Market Regulation and Intermediation, Justice Reform, Investment
Climate, and Power Distribution Sector Reform programs. The share of policy-based loans in
total loans is expected to be 40 percent.
In the recent Country Assistance Program Evaluation (CAPE)4 conducted by AsDB’s
Operations Evaluation Department, AsDB’s assistance over the past four years was assessed
as highly relevant and aligned with national priorities. The assistance program was
particularly effective in helping the government achieve progress in addressing the need to
improve fiscal performance. AsDB has directly supported government efforts to increase
development effectiveness and has helped implement new, more transparent procurement
regulations. Loans, technical assistance projects and advocacy have had a significant impact

on the direction of sector reforms and capacity development, especially for financial sector
regulation and intermediation, and local government reform. To increase its relevance,
AsDB’s partnerships outside the national government are being intensified or created,
including those with government-owned and controlled corporations, local government units,
the Supreme Court and other pillars of justice, business groups, and civil society.

ANNEX IV. PHILIPPINES––STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of December 4, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: Despite the authorities’ efforts to improve quality, weaknesses remain in the national
accounts. These include large statistical discrepancies in GDP estimates between the expenditure and
production sides (the official GDP estimates), with consequent differences in estimates of GDP growth.
The data ROSC identified a number of causes for these problems. First, deaths and births of
establishments are not adequately captured. This gap is of growing importance given the rapid structural
change in the economy in recent years, with a large number of new establishments. Second, compilation
relies on an outdated benchmark year and fixed input-output ratios. Estimates are derived by extrapolation
of the 1988 benchmark year using fixed input-output ratios. Finally, statistical techniques in estimating
GDP at constant prices are inadequate. For most activities, not all components of the production accounts
are compiled, instead only value added is estimated. Value added at current prices is calculated by
extrapolating the benchmark year value with an indicator for the value of output.
Price Statistics: The consumer price index has been compiled since February 2004 using weights based
on the 2000 Family Income and Expenditures survey. A notable change was that the weight given to the
group comprising food, beverages, and tobacco decreased to 50 percent in 2000 from 55 percent in 1994,
the previous weight reference year.
External Sector Statistics: Steps have been taken to improve the quality of balance of payment statistics.
In 2005, the BSP created a new Department of Economic Statistics, with one of its units to concentrate on
compiling, analyzing, and publishing the balance of payments and the international investment position.
Progress since 2004 has included a significant improvement in the measurement of imports to correct an
underestimation of imports of electronic goods on a consignment basis and improvements in the
classification of remittances. The revisions to imports have narrowed the gap between national trade data
and those of partner countries on a net basis. However, challenges remain for addressing certain
compilation issues. Since deregulation in the early 1990s, international transactions have increasingly
flowed through nontraditional channels that are not adequately covered by the statistical reporting system.
The Foreign Currency Deposit Units (FCDUs), which account for about 70-75 percent of foreign exchange
settlements, are exempt from reporting requirements because of strict banking secrecy rules.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Compilation of monetary and financial statistics (MFS) largely
conforms to the Fund’s methodology. The October 2007 MFS mission introduced the standardized report
forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary statistics to the IMF and an integrated monetary database (IMD) that
will meet the data needs of the BSP, APD, and STA.
Government Finance Statistics: While the Philippines meet the requirements of fiscal transparency in
many important respects, the fiscal and data ROSCs found areas that require strengthening. An important
problem is that the budget is presented on an obligation basis, while the deficit is reported on a cash basis.
In addition, the budget classification differs from the accounting classification, complicating comparisons
of budget and outcomes. Moreover, for levels of the public sector beyond the budgetary central (national)
government, consolidated fiscal outturns for items other than the fiscal balance are generally unavailable.
The introduction of a standardized chart of accounts, and the electronic New Government Accounting
System has facilitated the compilation of annual financial statements for all the levels of the public sector.
II. Data Standards and Quality
A data ROSC was published in August 2004.
The Philippines subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standards (SDDS) in August 1996.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 18, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation
with the Philippines
On January 29, 2010 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Philippines.1
Background
Following the adverse impact from the global economic and financial crisis, there are signs
of a nascent recovery. The Philippine economy avoided a technical recession as second
and third quarter GDP in 2009 rebounded by 1.7 percent and 1.0 percent (quarter-onquarter), respectively, following the 2.1 percent contraction during the first quarter. Inflation
has trended down during the year, reaching 3¼ percent during January–November, in the
middle of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP’s) target range. Following the post-Lehman
financial market stress in late 2008, market conditions are normalizing and equity prices
have returned to pre-crisis levels. The current account has held up well, with the decline in
exports cushioned by waning imports of commodities and resilient remittances. With the
return of risk appetite, the exchange rate has appreciated and capital inflows have resumed,
although so far primarily into the corporate and government bond market.
Growth is expected at ¾ percent in 2009 and to recover to around 3¼ percent in 2010. The
recovery will likely be led by private consumption as confidence strengthens and
remittances pick up further. Investments and exports are also expected to benefit from the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

global recovery. Risks to the near-term outlook are broadly balanced and sensitive to the
global growth outturn. On the domestic side, the output losses from the devastation caused
by the two recent typhoons could turn out to be larger than currently estimated, and fiscal
slippage could raise investor concerns. On the upside, the post-typhoon rebuilding efforts
could spur higher investment.
The financial sector has weathered the global financial crisis relatively well and generally
remains sound. Bank earnings have improved during the first half of 2009 as global
economic and financial conditions have stabilized. The capital adequacy ratio remains high
at around 15 percent and nonperforming loans are also generally low (around 4 percent of
loans), although they are relatively high for thrift and rural banks. Bank exposures are often
concentrated on few large corporate borrowers due to the prevalence of big conglomerates.
However, they are reportedly well monitored and financially sound.
Fiscal policy was loosened in response to the crisis, but poor revenue performance will
likely lead to a breach of the widened deficit target in 2009. The deficit is now estimated at
4½ percent, overshooting the budget target of 3¾ percent of GDP (IMF definition). This
deficit implies a positive fiscal impulse of around 2¼ percent of GDP and an estimated
growth impact of around 1 percentage point.
The BSP took proactive steps to lessen the adverse impact of the global financial crisis.
Policy rates have been cut by 200 basis points since end–2008, which had a significant
impact on lending rates. Moreover, the reserve requirement rate on bank deposits and
deposit substitutes was lowered by 2 percentage points (to 19 percent for universal/
commercial banks) in late 2008 and the rediscount window was tripled to pesos 60 billion.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their implementation of sound economic
policies in recent years. Supportive macroeconomic policies, together with resilient
remittances, cushioned the impact in 2009 of the global economic crisis. Recovery is
expected in 2010, led by private demand as confidence and remittances improve. A timely
return toward a sustainable fiscal path while avoiding a premature exit from a supportive
monetary policy will be important, along with continued reforms to ensure sustained growth
in the medium-term.
Directors concurred that the fiscal stimulus in 2009 proved to be an effective response to
the weak economic environment. Given the limited fiscal space, they supported a measured
fiscal withdrawal in 2010. Public debt remains relatively high, and tax collections have
weakened beyond cyclical factors. Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal
deficit reduction starting this year. They stressed that this will require new revenue
measures as well as expenditure restraint focused on non-priority current spending.
To further strengthen public finances, bolster market confidence, and create fiscal space for
pro-poor spending and growth-enhancing public investment, Directors encouraged the

3

authorities to introduce a credible medium-term consolidation plan, building on revenue
raising measures. They supported the authorities’ request for technical assistance in this
area. The introduction of a formalized fiscal framework would further underscore the
commitment to fiscal prudence.
Directors welcomed the BSP’s proactive easing steps in response to the crisis. In view of
the still negative output gap and the planned tightening of fiscal policy, they concurred that
monetary policy should remain accommodative until a sustained economic recovery is
assured, while ensuring that inflation expectations remain well-anchored. Directors noted
the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate appears aligned with fundamentals. They
recommended that foreign exchange interventions remain limited to smoothing operations,
while allowing the exchange rate to adjust to market pressures.
Directors commended the authorities’ good progress in implementing the recommendations
of the 2002 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), noting that the financial sector
weathered the crisis well, with banks remaining well capitalized and nonperforming loan
(NPL) ratios low. While the moderate economic growth expected over the near term could
dampen the banks’ earnings and potentially lead to a deterioration in asset quality, stress
tests conducted in the context of the FSAP update suggest that banks are quite resilient to
adverse shocks. At the same time, concentration risks are more elevated due to the
exposure to large conglomerates.
Directors supported additional steps to further strengthen financial sector supervision and
the regulatory framework, including through early adoption of the proposed amendments to
the New Central Banking Act. The latter would also provide supervisory staff with adequate
protection from litigation. Directors suggested that capital requirements could be more riskbased, and welcomed the authorities’ planned introduction in 2011 of the internal capital
adequacy assessment process as an important first step. Directors also recommended
further steps to strengthen the prompt corrective action and resolution frameworks.
To sustain the recovery and raise growth, Directors encouraged the authorities to make
further efforts to strengthen governance and the business environment and improve basic
infrastructure. This will be important to raise domestic demand, including through increased
investment, and allow businesses to tap into new export markets.

Executive Board Meeting 10/10
January 29, 2010
Introduction
The Philippine authorities welcome the comprehensive review by staff as well as the productive
exchange of views which paved the way for a candid assessment of the country’s economic
performance, policy considerations, and the challenges that lie ahead. The discussions which focused
on the policies needed to reduce vulnerabilities to support growth over the medium-term were
appropriate and constructive. Overall, the authorities broadly agree with the staff appraisal and
appreciate the policy recommendations.
Recent Economic Trends
The Philippine economy held up relatively well from the global crisis as signs of stabilization
emerged. Despite the global economic downturn and severe contractions elsewhere in the region, the
economy managed to post a modest growth of 0.7 percent for the first three quarters of 2009,
supported by a package of monetary and fiscal stimulus measures, continued strength of overseas
remittances, marked easing of inflation and stable interest rate.
Headline inflation averaged 3.2 percent in 2009, considerably lower than the 9.3 percent level in 2008
and well within the government’s target range. Meanwhile, the critical flow of credit, particularly
during the height of the global credit crunch, was enabled by liquidity-enhancing measures of the
central bank through a fundamentally sound banking system.
On the external front, the overall balance of payments surplus in 2009 amounted toUS$5.3 billion
bolstered mainly by the strong performance of the current account. The substantial surplus gave the
authorities the opportunity to further build up the country’s international reserves (to US$44.2 billion
as of end December 2009, equivalent to finance 9.0 months imports of goods and services), and
improve the external debt structure. However, despite the substantial inflows, the modest peso
movement reflected the concerns on the widening fiscal deficit. In the stock market, the local bourse
showed signs of recovery beginning July 2009 buoyed by renewed investors’ risk appetite, positive
macroeconomic data and improving corporate earnings. Philippine credit spreads have narrowed as
market perception on the country’s credit risk improved, evidenced by the stable/positive outlook
given by Fitch Ratings, Moody’s and Standards and Poors credit rating agencies.
Outlook, Challenges and Policy Thrusts
While there have been definitive signs of recovery in some sectors, there remain some vulnerabilities
that need to be addressed. The immediate challenge is to safeguard the gains achieved so far and ensure
that growth is sustained. For 2010, the economy is projected to grow by 3-4 percent. To support this,
the fiscal authorities envisage to continue the stimulus spending without undermining fiscal
consolidation. The authorities will continue to monitor the risks to the inflation outlook, which include
rising commodity prices, and will adjust policy settings if needed to achieve the price stability
objective. Consistent with the inflation-targeting framework, the authorities remain committed to a
market-determined exchange rate. In the financial sector, focus will be given to assessing the
vulnerabilities of the financial system and implementing measures to ensure that the latter remains
strong to support recovery. Structural reforms addressing the constraints to growth will be also
pursued.

Fiscal Policy
Over the past five years prior to the crisis, the fiscal authorities have made significant strides in fiscal
consolidation and in strengthening debt management. If not for the global economic crisis, the country
could have attained its goal of a balanced budget by 2010. Fiscal deficit, as a percent of GDP, declined
from 5.3 percent in 2002 to 0.2 percent in 2007. Despite the onset of the global crisis in the latter part of
2008, the fiscal authorities managed to contain the deficit at 0.9 percent of GDP during the year.
However, in 2009 fiscal pressures from economic stimulus and post-calamity restructuring program
coupled by weak revenue collections resulted in the deficit climbing to 4.3 percent of GDP for the
period January to September.
The higher fiscal deficit is expected to increase the public sector debt which has been successfully
brought down from 110 percent of GDP in 2002 to 71 percent in 2008.
For 2010, the fiscal authorities are proposing a fiscal deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP to sustain the
needed capital expenditures and accommodate an increase in pro-poor spending. The authorities
believe that such a fiscal policy stance may strike the appropriate balance between the need to continue
a supportive recovery and fiscal consolidation. To achieve the programmed deficit, they expect that tax
revenues would be increased to 16 percent of GDP while expenditures would be kept at about 19
percent of GDP. Nonetheless, in the event of a shortfall in tax revenues, expenditures will be adjusted
in order to contain the possible fiscal slippage. Over the medium-term, the authorities are committed to
balance the budget, and reduce the debt burden to below 50 percent by 2013.
With the view of increasing tax revenues, the implementation of tax administrative measures to
improve compliance and strengthen enforcement will be intensified. Tax compliance programs will be
enhanced, including monitoring of compliance by large tax payers. The authorities are also strongly
supporting Congress to enact revenue enhancement and simplification measures to bring in more
sustainable sources of revenues. Government will also pursue privatization of some assets to augment
its resources. On the expenditure side, priority capital outlays will be given to high impact
infrastructure projects. Operations of some public corporate entities will be rationalized to increase
cost-recovery and reduce government’s subsidies. Government will continue to restructure its debt
portfolio to manage debt payments and lengthen the maturity profile of both domestic and foreign debt.
Payment of adjustment in civil service wages which has already been passed into law is planned to be
implemented over four years (2009-2012) to ease potential pressure on the budget.
To support medium-term fiscal consolidation, the Department of Finance has recently requested
technical assistance from the IMF to assist the agency in mapping out a credible medium-term strategy
to raise tax effort for the incoming administration. On the aspect of enhancing fiscal risk management,
the Development Budget Coordinating Committee (DBCC), 1 recently approved a framework to
improve contingent liability management by introducing value analysis in the assessment of projects,
especially those that will involve government guarantees. The government is also moving to review the
effectiveness of present joint venture guidelines to mitigate the fiscal risks to public-private
partnerships.
1

The DBCC comprises of heads of government economic institutions who oversee the implementation of economic
and financial programs of Government.

Monetary and External Policies
With inflation pressures subdued and domestic demand conditions relatively weak, the BSP promptly
adopted an accommodative monetary policy stance during the onset of the crisis. The monetary policy
setting allowed the substantial monetary stimulus to counter the effect of the negative feedback loop on
the real sector. As a result, the series of monetary policy actions allowed domestic credit to flow.
For 2010, the monetary authorities target inflation to stay within the range of 3.5 – 5.5 percent to
support the country’s growth objectives. Toward this end, the monetary policy stance will continue to
focus on achieving price stability over the policy horizon while remaining supportive of sustained and
broad-based economic growth. A challenge to monetary policy is the risk posed by the uneven pace of
global recovery. Thus, the timing and speed of the shift to a tighter or less accommodative monetary
policy stance will be guided by the outlook on inflation and the balance of risks between the inflation
forecasts and economic growth. This implies that monetary policy will continue to be flexible to
support domestic demand and economic activity in the near term as long as inflation remains anchored
toward the target over the policy horizon. The authorities will be mindful of domestic conditions,
particularly with regard to inflation and output, when it gradually exits from its accommodative
monetary policy stance.
The authorities welcome the staff’s assessment that the Philippines’ exchange rate is broadly aligned
with fundamentals. The exchange rate policy will continue to remain market-determined with the
BSP’s participation in the foreign exchange market aimed only at smoothing observed volatilities to
promote more orderly market movements and to seize the opportunity to increase reserves as a
precautionary measure to provide policy space should there be a reversal of market sentiments.
Financial Sector Policy
Financial stability, along with monetary stability, is another key policy objective of the authorities to
support recovery. A stable and well functioning banking system will efficiently mobilize funds and
channel these to productive uses. As such, authorities will continue to implement key reforms that will
further improve the regulatory and supervisory framework, enhance risk management, improve
corporate governance structure, and strengthen disclosure practices for better consumer protection.
So far, the banking system has weathered the global financial crisis relatively well because of its
limited exposure to troubled US assets, and low exposures to securitization and off-balance sheet
activities. Moreover, the financial reforms instituted over the years had created a sound banking system
with stronger capital base. The banks’ capital adequacy ratio of 15.7 percent (as of June 2009) is well
above the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ (BSP) minimum capital ratio (at 10 percent) and the BASEL
Accord’s standard ratio (8 percent). Likewise, Tier 1 capital ratio of the banking system remain
significantly higher than the prudential minimum ratio. The banking system’s asset quality also
continued to improve with the non-performing loan ratio as of November 2009 easing further to 3.3
percent from 3.8 percent a year ago.
The results of the stress tests conducted by the BSP indicated that the financial sector is quite robust to
adverse shocks, even under relatively severe macroeconomic shocks. These findings were validated by
the Fund staff’s and the rating agencies’ (Fitch and Moodys) own stress-test exercises.
Staff raised a potential vulnerability issue stemming from the relatively high concentration risk
involving banks’ exposure to large conglomerates. We would like to note that conglomerates are an
important feature of the Philippine economy, where a majority of which are in the banking industry.
Failure of more than one large economic group would reduce the CARs of most of the top 10 banks and

could wipe out Tier 1 capital for some of the largest banks. However, stress test simulations show that
the impact of this type of failure would actually be less than that of the impact of the sharp rise in NPLs
from 3 percent to 20 percent.
Staff also raised an issue of vulnerability of banks to interest rate movements. The BSP is aware of the
increasing importance of banks' investment portfolio, which has been growing in double digits since
2000 (except for 2005-2007). In recognition of the importance of this concern, the BSP implemented
the market risk amendments to Basel I in 2003. In addition, the BSP formed a Capital Markets
Specialist Group (CMSG) in 2006. The CMSG is a specialist on-site examination team that focuses on
banks' trading activities. Shortly after the creation of the CMSG, guidelines on market risk and
liquidity risk were issued.
Structural reforms
Staff has rightfully pointed out the need to further improve the business environment and address the
growth constraints. Aware of these negative factors that constrain the inflow and the build-up of the
much needed investments into the country, the government is focusing on improving the business
environment.
In line with the objectives of the Economic Resiliency Plan in 2009, much of the pump-priming
activities of the government in response to the global economic crisis were channeled towards the
upgrading/rehabilitation of existing infrastructures such as repairs of irrigation facilities,
farm-to-market roads, and road widening, as well as initial ground works for large scale multi-year
projects like the construction of airports, expressways, and linking of railway systems for an efficient
transport. The increased fiscal spending aims to prepare the country for the eventual recovery by
addressing its lack of competitiveness primarily through infrastructure development. For 2010, given
the budget constraints, the government will push for large-scale infrastructure projects with
participation of the private sector through partnerships, joint ventures, and/or Build-Operate-Transfer
programs, but taking in due consideration the risks these entail to ensure that such strategy will not
compromise macroeconomic stability in the medium term.
On governance, several laws to curb corruption are already in place such as the Procurement Law and
the Anti-Red-Tape Act. The government is determined to properly implement these measures in order
to improve the efficiency in the delivery of government services and lower transaction costs.
The government is aware that much still needs to be done to address the issues and concerns that could
potentially discourage prospective investors. Addressing the country’s lack of competitiveness and
other factors that contribute to a weak business climate in the country is one of the primary objectives
of development policies in the near to medium term.
Concluding Remarks
The Philippine economy has been holding up relatively well under the global economic downturn.
While economic growth has moderated, as external demand weakened, overall macroeconomic and
financial stability has remained. The authorities are fully cognizant of the vulnerabilities and
challenges facing the economy. As such, they are firmly committed to continue pursuing sound
macroeconomic management and structural reforms to strengthen the economy in addressing the
challenges and allowing growth to revert to a sustained path. The authorities value the Fund’s views
and intend to continue working closely with it through the regular Article IV consultations and
technical assistance programs.
