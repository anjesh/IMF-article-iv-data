REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
March 6, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context: Over the last half decade, San Marino’s economy has managed to weather the
implosion of its offshore banking model, the global crisis, and Italy’s decision to put
San Marino on a tax blacklist. Together, these shocks resulted in a loss of a third of
output since 2008, caused banking system NPLs to rise to over 40 percent—with the
largest bank requiring 13 percent of GDP in public support—and pushed up net public
debt by some 20 percent of GDP (from virtually nil five years ago). Looking forward, the
economy is stabilizing, reflecting the inclusion of San Marino in Italy’s tax whitelist, but
downside risks persist.
Challenges: Advance the restructuring of the banking system, realign fiscal policy with
new economic realities, integrate into international markets, and lay solid foundations
for sustainable growth.
Key policy recommendations:
 Financial sector policy. Accelerate the incomplete restructuring of the largest bank.
Conduct in-depth asset quality assessments of the other banks in the system. Where
needed, assessments should be followed quickly by appropriate plans to bring banks
back to meeting regulatory requirements. Facilitate more aggressive NPL management.
 Fiscal policy. Pursue gradual consolidation of 2½ percent of GDP over five years to
put public debt on a sustainable path and rebuild buffers. Focus adjustment on reducing
the public sector wage bill, pensions, and health benefits. Increase revenue by reinstating
a real estate tax or setting a higher-than-envisioned VAT rate. Establish market access
for the sovereign.
 Structural policy. Enhance competitiveness by improving the business environment.
Facilitate the reallocation of resources to the nonbanking sector. Continue to strengthen
international cooperation.
Traction of past Fund advice: The authorities undertook measures to achieve fiscal
consolidation, consistent with past Fund advice. They have recapitalized the largest bank
in the country, in line with Fund advice, but they did not follow Fund recommendations
on the modalities of best-practice restructuring (IMF Country Report 14/104).

CONTEXT, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
1.
San Marino’s offshore banking model of economic growth imploded over the last
half decade. The global financial crisis and the inclusion of San Marino on Italy’s tax blacklist led
to a large outflow of nonresident deposits and a sharp decrease in the size of and asset quality in
its financial sector. The country’s largest bank has needed three bailouts, following the debt
restructuring of its Italian Delta subsidiary. Combined with low external demand due to the crisis
in Europe, this led to an extraordinary loss of a third of San Marino’s output since 2008. As the
offshore banking model of growth will not return, much of this output loss likely represents a
permanent level shift in GDP. The banking system remains in transition to a new business model,
focused more on domestic lending.

2.
Although a sound fiscal stance before the crisis provided ample buffers, the large
output decline and bank recapitalization needs have put the fiscal position under pressure.
The central government balance swung from a surplus of some 2–3 percent of GDP prior to the
crisis to a deficit of about 2½ percent of GDP, notwithstanding the authorities’ consolidation
efforts. This, together with the fall in GDP and bank recapitalization costs, exhausted cash buffers
and raised public debt to 23 percent of GDP. Furthermore, the social security fund’s position has
weakened significantly.
3.
The economy is exhibiting tentative signs of stabilization. The inclusion in Italy’s tax
whitelist in late 2014 and stabilization of bank deposits are paving the way for a modest recovery
over the next few years. Although GDP fell 4½ percent in 2013, high-frequency data such as
business turnover and confidence, and decreasing bank losses, point to a more moderate
contraction in 2014. Overall, the economy is estimated to have shrunk by 1 percent in 2014 and to
return to modest growth of 1 percent in 2015. Meanwhile, unemployment has risen to over
8 percent.
4.
Similar to a year ago, risks remain tilted to the downside, as the weak financial
sector continues to cast a shadow over San Marino’s medium-term outlook (Annex I).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

Prolonged slow growth in Italy and the euro area remains a downside risk to growth and the
financial sector going forward, through external demand and the quality of banks’ Italian assets.
Much economic activity is linked closely with Italy, while 42 percent of bank assets and 25 percent
of deposits are nonresident, mostly Italian. On the upside, the recent inclusion in Italy’s whitelist
could stimulate bilateral economic activity more than expected. Still, high nonperforming loans
(NPLs) in the banking system and the incomplete restructuring of the largest bank in the country
pose vulnerabilities. Should stress in the financial system escalate, further recapitalization needs
are likely to arise with direct implications for fiscal balances and growth, increasing the potential
for a negative bank-sovereign feedback loop.
5.
In the medium term, San Marino faces the significant challenge of adapting to the
new economic environment. Sustaining growth and job creation will require diversifying away
from banking, and integrating more fully into neighboring Emilia-Romagna—as well as Europe
and the world.
Authorities’ views
6.
The authorities shared staff’s assessment that the economy is stabilizing. In
particular, they emphasized that San Marino’s inclusion in Italy’s tax whitelist and the recent
conclusion of a bilateral economic cooperation agreement will provide support to the incipient
recovery. The authorities recognized the need for the economy to find a new growth model. Still,
they also saw opportunities for the financial sector to grow through increased international
activities once the banks will be allowed to operate in Italy as deposit-taking institutions, rather
than serving Italian clients mainly from San Marino as they currently do.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Financial Sector
The Banking System
7.
Liquidity ratios appear adequate, but NPLs have surged to over 40 percent, putting
pressure on capital buffers. The ratio of liquid assets to short-term liabilities rose to 50 percent,
from 30 percent in 2012. The recent Italian policy on voluntary disclosure of assets to the tax
authorities—under which Italian citizens may have an incentive to repatriate offshore assets—has
raised uncertainty about outflows of nonresident deposits. Still, the liquidity buffers should enable
banks to withstand such withdrawals. Overall, the banking system’s capital adequacy ratio stands
at 12.7 percent, well above the 11 percent minimum capital ratio, although recently recapitalized
Cassa di Risparmio della Repubblica di San Marino (CRSM) still falls short with an estimated
capital ratio of 7.5 percent. However, NPLs spiked by €932 million to 42 percent of total loans in
the year to June 2014, from 22 percent a year earlier. Most of the increase, €876 million, was
related to CRSM’s recapitalization (see below), when loans from its restructured Delta subsidiary
were restructured and brought on to its own balance sheet. Still, NPLs in the rest of the system

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

also rose significantly, in part due to strengthened enforcement of existing regulation. NPLs are
concentrated in the household, construction, and service sectors and expected to remain elevated
for a prolonged period of time even as the economy returns to modest growth. Since provisions
did not keep up with the increase in NPLs, the coverage ratio dropped to 28 percent (33 percent
for the system excluding CRSM). In the first half of 2014, losses in the banking system decreased
by 20 percent year-over-year to €14 million (equivalent to 1 percent of GDP).
8.
The weak asset quality raises concerns about the financial system, and may hinder
economic growth. While a bank-by-bank asset quality review is needed to determine
appropriate provision levels, the current level of 28 percent appears low both by historical
standards (provisions stood at 44 percent on average in 2009–10) and compared with peer
countries (Box 1). Underprovisioning of NPLs raises several issues. First, it taints the reliability of
capital measures, as full recognition of expected losses on NPLs would negatively impact capital.
This has happened already at CRSM in the recapitalization process, while at several other banks,
the need to take additional provisions has affected profits. Second, banks’ incentives to sell NPLs
remain weak, as such sales would result in large book losses. Third, it may reduce credit supply
and limit economic adjustment if banks keep underperforming firms that are not able to repay
their loans from restructuring. Lastly, forbearance with respect to provisioning may ultimately
increase losses, as no action towards a solution is taken.
Box 1. San Marino’s Banking System in International Perspective
With 470 percent of GDP in assets (€6.2 billion), the Sammarinese banking system is very large. However, it is
much smaller than at the onset of the global financial crisis, when it accounted for 650 percent of GDP. In
relative terms, it is close to Cyprus’s (575 percent of GDP) but an order of magnitude smaller than
Luxembourg’s (about 2,000 percent of GDP). Overall, 40 percent of assets are claims on nonresidents. Two
banks are more domestically oriented, with about 70 percent of domestic loans in their portfolio. On the
funding side, 75 percent of deposits are from residents. Most banks are domestically owned.
At 28 percent, the coverage ratio of NPLs is relatively low by international standards. San Marino’s ratio is
significantly below most other European countries’. While the system’s capital ratio exceeds the required
level, NPLs net of provisions are very large relative to capital. Thus, higher-than-expected losses on NPLs
could quickly erode capital buffers. International comparisons should be interpreted with caution, though,
since restructured Delta loans on CRSM’s balance sheet account for 35 percent of system NPLs. Excluding
restructured loans—which can be expected to yield relatively high recovery and hence feature relatively low
provisioning rates—the coverage ratio is 42 percent. For the bad loan portfolio—the worst category of
NPLs—coverage is significantly higher at 57 percent. In historical perspective, coverage is about
15 percentage points lower than in 2009–10. Overall, the NPL coverage ratio hence appears to be low.

9.
The authorities should come up with a plan to deal with low coverage ratios and
potential capital shortfalls in the banking system. Failure to do so may exacerbate losses
going forward and depress credit supply. Such a plan should include the following steps:


Asset quality review (AQR). An AQR is critical to reduce uncertainty by establishing a clear
baseline, based on accurate loan classification, collateral valuations, and bank-by-bank
assessments of expected losses and provisioning levels. These AQRs should build on the
Central Bank of San Marino’s (CBSM) ongoing on-site supervisory bank inspections. In case of
capacity constraints, the authorities should consider hiring external parties to perform the
AQRs.



Provisioning. The CBSM should encourage banks to raise their provisions ahead of the AQR
results. Once the AQR has been completed, the CBSM should demand banks bring provisions
up to the needed level, while strict on-site supervision should ensure compliance with
provisioning rules going forward. The CBSM should also gradually introduce more stringent
provisioning requirements to ensure adequate provisioning levels in the future.



Capitalization. Higher provisions could result in capital shortfalls. Banks with capital shortfalls
should retain their earnings to increase capital. Banks where retained earnings would not
quickly close the gap should be given a limited amount of time to present market-based
recapitalization plans to the central bank, and another time limit to execute them.



Resolution. Banks that remain critically undercapitalized should be resolved. Banks deemed
systemically important should be recapitalized according to best international practices,
including full unconditionally and upfront dilution of existing shareholders.

10.
Foreign investment could support recapitalization efforts, but high standards should
apply to investors. In particular, the authorities should carefully examine the business plans of
potential foreign investors and apply best-practice fit and proper standards.
11.
It is essential to address the large stock of NPLs, by escalating collection efforts and
exploring sales of bad assets. Banks should pursue collection of bad loans aggressively. For
some banks, setting up special purpose vehicles to host NPLs or the outright sale of part of their
NPL portfolios could aid this process. In case banks lack specific collection expertise, the
authorities could encourage banks to set up modalities to share such expertise (e.g., through joint
training). Furthermore, the limit on tax deductibility of provisions should be raised from its current
level of 5 percent of loans per annum, as it disincentivizes provisioning.
12.
The plan to adopt Basel III is welcome, and there is scope to improve the supervision
and resolution framework. The authorities are preparing a timeline to guide the adoption of
Basel III standards by 2017. This process will allow for continued improvements in the supervisory
framework, which should pay special attention to liquidity buffers, ensuring they continue to be
large enough to withstand sizeable outflows of nonresident deposits. The bank resolution
framework should be adapted to improve the deposit insurance system and to put

6

speedy and least-cost resolution of failed banks at its core, amending the banking law to
introduce a special bank resolution regime.
13.
The role of the central bank is central to many of these recommendations. In order
to deliver on the above plan on provisioning, work on the implementation of Basel III, and more
generally deal with its growing set of responsibilities, the CBSM needs additional resources and
independence in their deployment. Furthermore, the role of the CBSM in both the operation and
supervision of pension funds needs to be reviewed to avoid conflicts of interest. Constraints on
hiring foreign experts to deal with bank restructuring should be reconsidered.

Cassa di Risparmio
14.
CRSM was recapitalized, but modalities did not follow best-practice. The bank has
required a total of 13 percent of GDP in public support during 2012–14, with the last
recapitalization agreement implemented in April 2014.1 This was due mainly to large losses on its
investment in the Italian Delta group, which was intervened by Italian supervisors and put under
compulsory administration. The 2013–14 recapitalization was a necessary step and introduced
partial dilution of shareholders. However, the shareholders were not fully and unconditionally
diluted, but instead kept a majority equity stake. And while the state now gets to nominate a
majority of the banks’ board members, the foundation (CRSM’s majority shareholder) still
nominates a minority of board members and has to approve any sale of the state’s shares in the
bank.
15.
The bank’s turnaround remains
incomplete, amid continuing operational
losses. Even after recapitalization, at end 2014
CRSM’s capital ratio is only 7.5 percent,
€51 million short of the minimum regulatory
capital. This shortfall is significantly worse than
envisaged in the original recapitalization plan.
Moreover, the bank continues to make losses
(€31 million in 2014, compared to €36 million in
2013 and €156 million in 2012) and its provisions
cover just a quarter of NPLs.

16.
To limit the risk of further public support, it is important to speed up CRSM’s
restructuring and improve its governance. The authorities should demand a business plan from
CRSM that shows how, under a realistic but conservative scenario, the bank will become profitable
and reach the minimum capital requirement within three years. Significant cost cuts and reducing
the size of the balance sheet further should be part of the strategy. Adverse contingency plans
should be drafted, to be prepared in case the business plan proves unsuccessful. The state should
1

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

promptly appoint seasoned turnaround experts to CRSM’s board and executive positions. To
facilitate this, revisions to the recapitalization agreement between the foundation and the state
should be considered to give the state complete ownership and control of CRSM. Without these
actions, the risk that CRSM will require further public support in the future is considerable.
Authorities’ views
17.
The authorities noted that the financial system as a whole is transitioning to a new
business model and that on-site bank inspections are ongoing. They thought that better
relations with Italy will soon allow Sammarinese banks to operate in Italy as deposit-taking
institutions, thus creating opportunities for growth. Still, they recognized this strategy remains
untested. The authorities contended that judging the adequate level of provisions should depend
on the composition of the NPL portfolio. In particular, a large share of NPLs concerns leasing
assets, where banks own the underlying asset. They also noted that restructured Delta loans in
CRSM account for a large share of total NPLs, and that, as these loans have already been
restructured, their recovery rate is expected to be higher. Nonetheless, the authorities agreed on
the need for AQRs for the largest banks, which the CBSM is conducting as part of its ongoing onsite inspection program.
18.
On CRSM, the authorities saw getting the bank back to health as the most important
challenge. They emphasized the successful recapitalization that took place last year, while
acknowledging modalities deviated from best practice. Looking forward, they will carefully review
the business plan CRSM recently submitted to ensure its viability.

B. Public Finances
19.
The central government deficit is expected to decline slightly to 1.1 percent of GDP
in 2014. After peaking at 4.1 percent of GDP in 2011, fiscal consolidation brought the deficit
down to a more manageable level of 1.5 percent of GDP in 2013. The 2014 income tax reform
adjusted tax brackets and reduced exemptions. Together with the introduction of an electronic
certification system to enhance collection, 2014 tax revenue is projected to have increased by
almost 1½ percent of GDP to 17 percent of GDP. At the same time, reining in the public sector
wage bill helped contain expenditure growth. However, some of the improvement in the central
government balance reflects cuts in transfers to the social security fund. Between 2012 and 2014,
these transfers declined by €14 million, while the fund’s operational deficit increased by
€16.5 million to €27 million (2 percent of GDP).
20.
The 2015 budget preserves the consolidation efforts based on modest further
efficiency gains. The authorities plan to reduce expenditure on the public administration by a
further 0.2 percent of GDP, principally by reducing allowances and overtime, merging public
offices, encouraging early retirement, and more generally reviewing the number of employees.
Tax revenue is projected to remain stable, while expenditure on transfers to social security and
interest payments are projected to increase. However, capital expenditure is expected to fall,
leaving the overall balance unchanged at -1.1 percent of GDP.
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

21.
Debt is on an upward path, projected to reach 27 percent of GDP by 2020 under a
scenario without policy change. A comprehensive reassessment of outstanding tax refunds led
to a sharp decrease in net accounts payable in 2011–12, revising public debt down by almost
7 percent of GDP. However, successive recapitalizations of CRSM together with budget deficits
increased public debt to 23 percent of GDP at end 2014, up from 11 percent in 2007. Over the
same period, government deposits decreased from 12 to 3 percent of GDP. Going forward, debt is
projected to gradually increase further on moderate fiscal deficits amidst modest economic
growth. Debt is mostly financed by domestic bank loans and the CRSM recapitalization bond. San
Marino has not issued bonds on the international capital market.
22.
Rebuilding the buffers that served San Marino well during the crisis remains
paramount. Fiscal adjustment of 2½ percent in discretionary measures at the central government
level, realized over five years, would put debt on a downward path. The adjustment should start in
2016, once the recovery is firmly underway, but credible plans should be announced as early as
possible. Plans should be skewed towards expenditure cuts, in recognition of San Marino’s new
post-crisis economic realities in which output declined by a third and hence spending as a share
of GDP increased markedly compared to 2008. However, such expenditure cuts should not result
in increased deficits in the social security fund. Under such a fiscal stance, the government would
have sufficient fiscal buffers to withstand a contingent shock (e.g., from further bank
recapitalization needs) in the magnitude of 20 percent of GDP, with debt still peaking below 50
percent of GDP (Annex II). Over the medium term, parametric reform of social security is needed
to ensure its sustainability. Without it, social security balances will run down fast amid pressure to
increase transfers from the central government.
23.
Expenditure policy should center on curtailing the public sector wage bill, public
pensions, and health benefits. A recent expenditure review suggested measures should target
the public sector wage bill—both through wages (which remain some 10 percent above those in
the private sector) and employment—the public pension system, and health care benefits. Such
policies would reduce deficits both at the central government level as well as in the social security
fund. The measures could yield some 2 percent of GDP, creating space for well-targeted increases
of around ½ percent of GDP in capital spending, which has been reduced to unsustainably low
levels over the last few years. Private sector participation in capital spending could be explored, as
long as modalities provide real risk sharing and limit contingent liabilities.
24.
The planned introduction of the VAT is welcome and efforts should be made to find
additional revenue sources. In particular, a real estate tax yielding about 1 percent of GDP
would provide an equitable and efficient source of income. Alternatively, raising the VAT rate
above its planned level could be considered. The decision on the actual rate should be informed
by an analysis of projected VAT revenue and its sensitivity to the VAT rate. Exemptions from the
standard VAT rate should be limited to a narrow set of basic goods. An increase of the corporate
tax rate is not advisable, as it would negatively affect competitiveness.
25.
Establishing market access for the sovereign would help diversify funding sources.
Even if more expensive than domestic borrowing, market access provides a crucial buffer in the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

event of shocks that simultaneously raise borrowing needs and leave domestic banks unable to
lend to the government. Accessing the markets for the first time could involve non-negligible
costs but the current international financial environment could prove attractive for issuance.
Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities agreed with the importance of rebuilding fiscal buffers to cushion
the impact of future shocks. In this regard, they plan to continue to curb current expenditure
and reduce the deficit. This will create room for planned additional capital expenditure relating to
infrastructure and a high-tech business incubator. They also saw the need for policy action to
make pension liabilities sustainable. On revenues, the authorities did not believe reinstating a real
estate tax is feasible and note that a higher VAT would have inflationary effects. With respect to
accessing international markets, the authorities agreed on the possible benefits and noted that
they are investigating various avenues for financing.

C. Structural Policies and International Cooperation
27.
Recent improvements in the business environment and government policies support
development of the nonbanking sector. The new simple and fast online process to establish a
business and ongoing effort to simplify the registration of property should boost investment and
economic activity. Once up and running, the new credit registry would facilitate access to credit.
Other recent welcome government initiatives include setting up a high-tech business incubator
and starting talks with Italy to allow Sammarinese companies to operate business aviation and
cargo services at a nearby Italian airport. Nevertheless, it remains important to perform careful
cost-benefit analysis of the incentives and tax breaks involved in such projects.
28.
Changes to labor market policies and vocational training should further support
employment and growth. Recently introduced incentives for employment include the
establishment of entry-level wages below the lowest level in collective wage agreements, and
temporary lower social security contributions when hiring unemployed workers. Further reform of
the labor market, culminating in changes to the labor law, is under discussion. The process to hire
nonresidents remains slow and complicated, and in practice results in hiring caps. Recent
exemptions from this process for high-tech business in the incubator may provide a model for the
broader economy, allowing San Marino to take greater advantage of the labor market in EmiliaRomagna, the dynamic neighboring Italian region. Unemployed workers are provided with
vocational training, in order to diminish existing skills gaps. To increase the productivity of the
labor force further, worker education and vocational training could be employed more broadly.
29.
An inflation differential and a wage gap with Italy suggest price competitiveness
may be an issue. A proxy2 for San Marino’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has fallen back to

2

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

early 2008 levels, but the inflation differential with Italy continues on a gradual upward trend.
Together with a 12 percent wage gap with Italy, this suggests San Marino’s REER may be
overvalued. The recommended structural and fiscal policies should serve to close this gap over
time.

International cooperation improved significantly and continued commitment in this
area remains crucial for a very small open economy like San Marino. Most importantly,
towards end 2014, Italy included San Marino in its tax whitelist and the bilateral economic
cooperation agreement was concluded. Looking forward, the prompt conclusion of the
memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Bank of Italy that will allow the uninterrupted
payment card services and may fully open the Italian banking market for Sammarinese banks is a
priority. In this regard, the ongoing setup of the credit register is very important. Moreover,
San Marino—together with Andorra and Monaco—has started negotiations on an association
agreement with the EU, focused on fully integrating the country with the EU’s four freedoms.
31.
The imminent launch of a national AML/CFT risk assessment is commendable. The
authorities are also preparing to be among the early adopters of the OECD initiative for exchange
of tax information (to be launched in 2017 following the FATCA model). Together with
MONEYVAL’s recognition of San Marino’s anti-money laundering efforts, these actions will
contribute to further shedding the perception of San Marino as an offshore haven.
Authorities’ views
32.
The authorities agreed that San Marino has to diversify its economy and find a new
growth model and saw their focus on international cooperation as key. They pointed to the
various initiatives underway including the high-tech business incubator, a science park, and
various efforts to boost tourism revenue and infrastructure more generally. The authorities are
committed to simplifying bureaucracy and improving the business environment in order to both
attract foreign direct investment and improve productivity for existing companies. They explained
the wage cost differential with Italy is smaller than implied by the data, as wages in neighboring
Italian regions are significantly above the Italian national average numbers. They are moving
forward with the technical setup of the credit register, and have amended the banking law to

allow for reciprocal international credit information exchange. This should allow negotiations on
the MoU with the Bank of Italy to proceed, with the aim of concluding soon. Ultimately, the EU
association agreement is seen as taking the country to its goal of full integration of all sectors of
the Sammarinese economy into the EU single market.

D. Data Issues
33.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, but gaps exist. While
these data gaps are not uncommon for a small country like San Marino, there is a need to
improve timeliness of, in particular, national accounts and fiscal statistics and ensure consistency
with international standards. Balance of payments data are not currently available, but San Marino
is working with specialized IMF staff to start the compilation of these data. Importantly, banking
sector data are comprehensive and timely.

STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Over the last year, San Marino has made very significant progress normalizing
international relations and it is set to emerge from a deep recession. On the back of the
inclusion in Italy’s tax whitelist and the conclusion of bilateral financial and economic cooperation
agreements, there are signs that the economy is stabilizing. Staff expects GDP to expand by 1
percent this year, followed by modest growth over the medium term. Nevertheless, the output
loss during the crisis has been very large, and it will take a long time for GDP to return to its precrisis level.
35.
Still, serious policy challenges remain. Liquidity conditions in the banking system
improved and steps were taken in an attempt to put CRSM on sound footing. Yet, issues remain
with respect to CRSM and high NPLs in the banking system more broadly.
36.
CRSM needs a strong and credible business plan to minimize the risk of further
public support. The plan should show how the bank will become profitable and reach the
minimum capital requirement within three years. Its baseline should be based on realistic, but
conservative assumptions and a contingency plan “Plan B” should spell out what will be done in
case the business plan is unsuccessful. As a matter of urgency, seasoned experts to engineer a
turnaround should be appointed to CRSM’s board and executive positions. Moreover, revisions to
the recapitalization agreement between the foundation and the state to give the state complete
ownership and control of CRSM should be considered.
37.
Banks need to deal with their very large NPL portfolios in order to be able to
support the recovery. They should enhance their NPL collection efforts and increase NPL
provisioning. The following steps are needed to assert asset quality and increase provisions:


First, a bank-by-bank asset quality review, building on the CBSM’s ongoing bank inspections,
is needed to ascertain the quality of banks’ loan portfolios. The support of external parties
should be considered.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO



Second and in parallel with the first step, the CBSM should continue to encourage banks to
increase provisions immediately since they are low by international and historical standards.
Stricter on-site supervision should ensure adequate provisioning going forward.



A third step would be needed if the exercise indicates capital shortfalls. Market-based
recapitalization plans would have to be presented to the CBSM. If such plans fail, banks that
remained critically undercapitalized would have to be resolved. In the case of systemic banks,
public support may be inevitable.

38.
The Central Bank will have to play a central role in this process. In order to deliver on
the plan above and deal with its growing set of responsibilities, the CBSM needs additional
resources and independence in their deployment.
39.
Further fiscal effort is needed to rebuild the buffers San Marino had before the
crisis. Without these buffers, the crisis would have been even deeper and the state could not have
cushioned social expenditure. The central government’s fiscal position has worsened as tax
receipts declined, but efforts over the last two years to reduce the deficit represent important
steps in the right direction. Furthermore, the balance of the social security institute has
deteriorated significantly. To strengthen the fiscal balance further, the authorities should design a
multi-year strategy, with implementation starting in 2016 once the economy is solidly growing
again.
40.
The fiscal strategy should aim to lower overall expenditure, while modestly
increasing tax revenue. Overall, 2½ percent of GDP in measures over five years are needed to
start rebuilding buffers. Areas for action identified by a recent spending review include the public
sector wage bill, pensions, and health costs. A real estate tax would be the optimal choice to
increase tax revenue, as it provides an equitable and efficient source of income. Alternatively, a
slight increase in the envisaged VAT rate could be considered. This fiscal strategy would also
create space for the authorities’ planned timely increase in capital spending. Still, over the
medium term, parametric reform of social security is needed to ensure its sustainability. The
authorities should also consider modest borrowing in international capital markets, as
establishing market access would provide an important additional buffer to deal with shocks.
41.
San Marino has recently achieved very important milestones in international
cooperation. The inclusion in Italy’s tax whitelist is a key step, as is MONEYVAL’s report on antimoney laundering efforts. Continued international cooperation building on these achievements is
essential for a new growth model to emerge. Priority should be given to concluding the MoU with
the Bank of Italy in the near term. Negotiating an association agreement with the EU is a key
medium-term priority.
42.
Recent improvements in the business environment are a welcome development.
Efforts to speed up the process of starting a business and simplify the registration of property
should support economic activity. Completion of the ongoing work to create a credit registry will

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

improve access to credit. Government initiatives such as the high-tech incubator are positive as
long as their fiscal costs are monitored closely.
43.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Republic of
San Marino be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix II. Public Sector Debt Sustainability
1.
San Marino’s central government debt is on an upward trajectory. Before the crisis,
gross debt was mostly in the form of unclaimed tax refunds and stood below 15 percent of GDP.
Net debt was negative, as the government held cash buffers slightly in excess of gross debt.
However, the sharp decline in revenues triggered by the crisis swung budget surpluses into deficits.
In addition, financial support to the largest bank amounting to 13 percent of GDP1 increased debt to
about 23 percent of GDP. Over the same timeframe, the government almost depleted its large cash
buffers (cash buffers diminished to 3 percent of GDP in 2014). Based on current policies, the central
government deficit is projected to remain around 1–1½ percent of GDP implying further increases in
the debt to GDP ratio to 27 percent by 2020 (Figure A2.1).
2.
The possible need for further bank capital support represents the main risk to public
finances and debt sustainability. A shock scenario where further recapitalization needs amount to
20 percent of GDP—reflecting a combination of further capital for CRSM as well as other banks—
would increase debt and, without a change in the fiscal stance, set it on an upward trajectory,
reaching almost 50 percent of GDP by 2020. Such dynamics may prove unsustainable in a country
without a track record of sovereign bond issuance and hence untested ability to access external
financing.
3.
These observations highlight the need for fiscal adjustment. Staff’s suggested
adjustment of 2½ percent of GDP would put debt on a downward trend—providing fiscal space for
contingent liabilities (Figure A2.2). Accounting for such adjustment, debt would peak just below
45 percent of GDP in 2016 even after a 20 percent of GDP contingent shock.

11 percent was provided by the central government and 2 percent by the Social Security Institute.

Prior to 1999 the currency of San Marino was the Italian lira. Since January 1, 1999, San Marino uses
the euro as its official currency. The central monetary institution is the Central Bank of San Marino
(CBSM). Foreign exchange transactions are conducted through commercial banks without restriction
at rates quoted in Italian markets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign
exchange. San Marino's exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for those maintained solely for the
preservation of national or international security and which have been notified to the Fund pursuant
to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).1

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of February 26, 2015)
Data Provision
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but some data gaps exist. Progress has been
made since San Marino’s participation in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) on
May 16, 2008, but important weaknesses in the statistical database remain, mainly due to resource
constraints. In January 2007, in view of their intention to participate in the GDDS, the authorities
named two national GDDS coordinators and announced their objective to increase the frequency of
website updates in order to improve data dissemination. As of March 2012, national and fiscal
accounts, as well as monetary and financial sector data are compiled according to international
standards, but some key statistics (such as real and fiscal data) are available only with delay and, in
many cases, are at a lower-than-standard frequency and level of detail.
Real Sector Statistics
National accounts data for 1995 onward have been calculated in accordance with ESA95, and data
are compiled annually based on the income approach with about 10 months delay. The authorities
have also calculated sectoral contributions. As part of ongoing STA technical assistance on national
accounts statistics, production and expenditure approaches are being adopted. Consumer prices
and employment data are available monthly with short delays. An industrial production index based
on electricity consumption, launched in 2000, became available monthly in 2009. Consumption and
business sentiment indices have been compiled starting in 2007 based on annual household and
business surveys.
Government Finance Statistics
The authorities have provided data for the central government, state-owned enterprises, and social
security fund for 2004–14, as well as the budget for 2015. However, some of the data have not been
compiled in accordance with IMF standards. Financing items, such as amortization, are included as
expenditures while “borrowing requirement” is included among the revenues.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Since 1997, the authorities have provided balance sheet data on the commercial banks and the
monetary authorities to STA databases. These data are provided on a quarterly basis, with
approximately a six-week reporting lag. The authorities have introduced laws and took some
measures to improve coverage and timeliness of banks’ reporting. The CBSM has improved
sectorization and expanded data collection to cover the offshore asset management activities of
banks. The breakdown of deposits (and other assets and liabilities) between residents and
nonresidents and the breakdown of short-term credit by public and private sector components are
also available. However, there is no broad money survey. Data on nonbank financial intermediaries
are also lacking.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of San Marino

On March 25, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of San Marino.
Over the last five years, San Marino has weathered the implosion of its offshore banking system,
the global crisis, and difficult relations with Italy. These shocks resulted in a loss of a third of
output since 2008. Nonperforming loans in the banking system have risen to high levels, and the
largest bank in the system has required 13 percent of GDP in public support.
The economy is now stabilizing, reflecting San Marino’s improved relations with Italy and
stable bank deposits. As a consequence, modest positive growth is expected this year. However,
risks remain tilted to the downside, as the weak financial sector continues to cast a shadow over
the medium-term outlook.
More needs to be done to ensure the banking system can support the recovery. The incomplete
restructuring of the largest bank needs to be accelerated. The authorities should conduct in-depth
asset quality assessments of the other banks, followed by plans to increase bank capital where
needed.
Fiscal policy should aim at rebuilding the buffers that served San Marino well during the crisis.
Gradual consolidation of 2½ percent of GDP over five years would be appropriate. Structural
policies need to facilitate the reallocation of resources to the nonbanking sectors of the economy
by further improving the business environment.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

San Marino has recently achieved important milestones in international cooperation, including
in the area of anti-money laundering. A continued focus in this area is essential for a new
growth model to emerge.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed signs that the economy is stabilizing and the greatly improved
international relations, but noted that challenges remain, particularly in the banking sector.
Directors noted the improving liquidity conditions in the banking system, but stressed the
importance of dealing with the very large stock of nonperforming loans. They underscored that a
plan including reviews of banks’ asset quality, higher provisions, and contingency plans to deal
with any capital shortfalls would help put the banking system in a position to support the
economic recovery. In this context, Directors urged the authorities to accelerate the incomplete
restructuring of Cassa di Risparmio della Repubblica di San Marino, improve its governance,
and implement a strong and credible business plan to limit the risk of further public support.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ initial progress toward rebuilding the fiscal buffers that
served the country well in the past. They stressed, however, that additional measures over the
medium term are needed. Directors recommended a strategy aimed at lower expenditure and
modestly higher revenue. Expenditure policy should focus on curtailing the public sector wage
bill, public pensions, and health benefits, while creating space for capital spending. Directors
also noted that establishing access to international capital markets would provide additional
buffers to deal with shocks.
Directors commended the authorities for achieving important international cooperation
milestones such as the inclusion of San Marino in Italy’s tax white list. They considered the
conclusion of a memorandum of understanding with the Bank of Italy and an association

Statement by Mr. Carlo Cottarelli, Executive Director for the Republic of San Marino
and Ms. Marta Spinella, Advisor to Executive Director
March 25, 2015

The Sammarinese authorities would like to thank staff for the open and productive discussions
held during the Article IV consultations. They broadly agree with the comprehensive analysis
reflected in the report and once again found the Fund’s recommendations valuable and welltargeted.
Overview
In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, San Marino was faced with a series of negative
shocks both in the financial sector and in the real economy, which jointly provoked a cumulative
30 percent GDP fall and required a substantial bank consolidation. The external image of the
country as an opaque tax-haven and its permanence in the Italian “black list” contributed to the
decline of its banking model, while demand for tourism services and Sammarinese export goods
were affected by the global crisis. Most of the large public buffers were depleted to respond
effectively to the emergency; and the major credit institution (the Cassa di Risparmio di San
Marino, CRSM) had to receive public sector support. Since then, the authorities of San Marino
embarked on a profound and far reaching restructuring of the economy, involving significant
adjustment to public expenditure, the introduction of new taxes and the development of a new
economic strategy.
The country still faces downside risks, but the outlook is certainly improved and the economy is
stabilizing. The recent inclusion of San Marino in the Italian “white list” is expected to enhance
the business opportunities with the neighboring Italian counterparts and the international
community as a whole.
The authorities are cognizant of the capacity constraints facing their country and the risks
stemming from its small scale and openness, but stand fully behind their reform program and
remain strongly committed to further increase San Marino’s transparency, promote active
participation in international fora, and maintain international best practices in the financial
system.
Macroeconomic Outlook
The economy is projected to grow in 2015, albeit at a still moderate pace (1 percent), after
several years of contraction, confirming the positive impact of the measures implemented by the
authorities on the industrial sector and tourism. The inclusion into Italy’s tax “white list” and the
subsequent winding up of a bilateral economic cooperation agreement is expected to create new
business opportunities not only with Italian firms (especially in the rich and active neighboring

5

Emilia-Romagna), but also with other foreign partners, boosting exports and attracting
investments.
The authorities remain committed to diversify the economy and broaden its scope by developing
new activities, turning the dramatic financial system contraction into an opportunity to attract
foreign investors and rekindle the labor market.
Fiscal Policy
Before the crisis San Marino enjoyed a government surplus and high public buffers, and gross
public debt was more than offset by the government deposits. During the crisis, budget surpluses
turned into growing deficits, also due to the CRSM intervention. At present public debt stands at
23 percent of GDP and government deposits have been sensibly depleted.
The government, therefore, conducted a spending review, as a key component of its fiscal
consolidation plan, with technical assistance from the IMF, which identified three main areas of
intervention: the public sector wage bill, the public pension system and the health care benefits.
In 2014 a major income tax reform was passed, adjusting tax brackets, increasing tax rates and
reducing exemptions. Administrative shortcomings in tax collection were tackled by the
implementation of an electronic filing system that improved compliance.
As a result, and despite having repealed the extraordinary surtax on income and the real estate
taxes, the central government deficit declined to 1.1 percent of GDP.
Savings were also achieved through the cut in public sector compensation, which only spared
the lowest wages. The authorities are cognizant of the need to further consolidate, but believe
that, also on account of the still uncertain output outlook, some gradualism in further fiscal
consolidation is appropriate, with the 2015 budget targeted to remain broadly unchanged with
respect to 2014. In accordance with the spending review recommendations, the fiscal package
on public wages confirms the incentives for early retirement and maintains a low turnover ratio.
This should lead to a further decline in public sector employment and wage bill. Some fringe
benefits have also been cut or reduced.
The authorities agree with staff on the importance of replenishing the country’s eroded fiscal
buffers, and, on this account, will introduce from 2016 a fully fledged VAT regime. The VAT
rates have not been defined yet.
The authorities are also planning a thorough pension reform to ensure the viability of the public
pension system and guarantee generation evenhandedness. The existing generous system cannot
be funded in the long term and the foreseen measures will intervene on the replacement ratio,
the contribution rates and the prospective retirement age. Health expenditure will be streamlined

6

too; also in this area the authorities are currently considering recommendations of the spending
review report.
Financial Sector
After the financial crisis that led to the consolidation of several Sammarinese banks, the sector is
now sound, overall, with an average of 12.7 percent capital adequacy ratio and replenished
liquidity buffers, also thanks to deposits remaining stable in the last couple of years. Only
CRSM still reports an inadequate capital ratio (7.5 percent) below the minimum required,
despite having received sizeable public contributions (amounting to some 13 percent of GDP),
and accounts for the highest level of NPLs in the system.
The authorities are aware that the banking system is still facing considerable risks due to the
high level of NPLs, the still negative trend of credit demand, and reduced profitability. They
agree on the need to conduct individual Asset Quality Reviews on the largest banks, most likely
during the already planned on-site inspections. At the same time, they underscore the emerging
recovery signs in the system, including an ongoing revenue diversification. Besides, their
estimate of the NPLs’ recovery ratio is higher than the one envisaged by staff, based on the
analysis of the underlying assets, including with respect to the restructured Delta debits to
CRSM.
That said, the authorities recognize that further early action is needed to strengthen CRSM, to
achieve its complete and expedited recovery. The government currently appoints six board
members out of nine, and, while as the staff report points out, the original shareholders keep a
majority equity stake, the government holds the majority of voting rights, and thus, has effective
control over the bank’s strategy and future development. The Government is committed to
recruit highly qualified experts to restructure and revamp the bank’s business and the Central
Bank of San Marino (CBSM) will carefully evaluate the business plan recently submitted by the
CRSM management, to ensure that it fulfills all the necessary prudential requirements and will
lead the bank back to profitability.
On the way forward, the authorities particularly valued the in-depth technical discussions with
staff that provided insightful advice to improve the banking resolution framework and
implement Basel III supervisory requirements. They recognize the need to develop a new
methodological approach to supervisory practices and stand ready to enhance internal and
external training (including at the Basel Committee Centre for Central Banking Studies). They
are, in this respect, also considering requesting technical assistance from both the Fund (on
credit risk assessment and other technical issues) and the EU (on major legal issues and needed
amendments to the law).

7

The Central Bank will play a central role in the banking sector consolidation and enhancing
supervision. In order to deal with its growing set of responsibilities, the CBSM shares the staff
view on the need for additional resources and independence in their deployment.
As regards the anti-money laundering regime, MONEYVAL and the EU Commission
acknowledged that San Marino’s AML/CFT legal framework is compliant with the FATF
requirements and with the European AML/CFT Directives and regulation. Moreover, the quality
of the data collected by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), as well as the exchange of
information with foreign counterparts, improved significantly. The FIU, the Central Bank and
other Authorities recently started to perform a national anti-money laundering risk assessment,
applying the World Bank methodology, to identify existing vulnerabilities and design ad hoc
countermeasures. San Marino is also preparing for the early adoption of the OECD program for
the automatic exchange of tax information.
Structural Reforms
In the last couple of years, the Sammarinese authorities engaged in a comprehensive set of
reforms and corrective actions to reverse the effects of the economic crisis which hit the
country. The impressive progress in a limited time-span is the best proof of their concrete
willingness to turn plans into action and strengthen the accountability and transparency of San
Marino. Many remarkable accomplishments have already been described in previous sections of
this Buff, including the tax reform, the spending review, and the progress in anti-money
laundering issues.
The authorities have been very active in fostering initiatives to improve the business
environment and the labor market. A newly approved law on e-commerce promoted the creation
of 260 enterprises active in product scouting and basic e-commerce services; more than 20 of
them constituted during the last year. A high-tech business incubator has been established to
facilitate the development of a scientific and technological park connected with researchers and
universities. In a few months 13 new high-tech startups were founded. After hiring Prof. Ichino,
one of the major Italian experts of labor market reform, the unemployment benefits in the form
of cash transfers were reduced. At the same time, vocational and requalification training
programs were upgraded promoting the new recruitment of young and dismissed workers. The
next steps will be a further simplification of the existing bureaucracy to facilitate foreign
investments.
The continuous improvement in international cooperation also includes the recently started
negotiations for an Association Agreement with the European Union, aimed at completely
integrating San Marino into the EU four freedoms’ framework, after having been accepted last
year into the Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA).

8

One of the main priorities of the authorities is the prompt and successful conclusion of the
Memorandum of Understanding between the Central Bank of San Marino and the Bank of Italy.
To this end, they are working to realize a credit register and they amended the banking law to
consent international credit information exchange. Once finalized, the MoU will allow complete
exchange of credit information with Italy, provide for the resolution of some residual technical
issues connected with the credit card services, and represent the leeway for the Sammarinese
banks to fully access the Italian market.
The recently improved relationship with Italy are also a solid base for the new activities
connected with the reopening of the Rimini-San Marino International Airport, closed after the
Italian managing company went bankrupt. San Marino underwrote a public concession for the
use of the airport’s tarmacs and defined with the Italian authorities the logistics and the services
to be provided (mainly cargo services, general and business aviation and touristic charter
flights). The Sammarinese Aviation authorities along with the San Marino Aircraft Registry,
thanks to a new modern law, that features very limited red tape and is aligned with high security
standards, attracted to San Marino several new potential investors coming from all over the
world. The project will have a tremendous impact on employment and economy for both San
Marino and Italy.
A strong promotion of tourism is underway, by means of: a larger use of mass marketing
instruments (social media and fair participation, among which Expo Milan 2015); a
requalification of the offer, focused on a limited number of high quality cultural events; a multiyear strategic plan to attract private investment and build new structures thus increasing the
availability of accommodation; the enlargement of the museum centre via the acquisition by the
State of an ancient building contiguous to the existing museum; the conclusion of public-private
cooperation agreements to develop specific tourist programs for impaired people.
