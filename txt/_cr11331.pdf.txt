STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 3, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Context: The economy is still burdened by the legacy of the imbalances that preceded
the global crisis, including high leverage of the private sector and a real estate boom. A
worsening outlook for global growth, unsettled financial conditions in the euro area,
and the large exposure of Cypriot banks to Greece have created new obstacles to
recovery. Meanwhile, deterioration in public finances has taken a toll on investor
confidence. As a result of these factors, Cyprus has lost access to sovereign debt
markets.
Policy challenges: The two key challenges are to put in place a large and credible
fiscal consolidation that will reverse the increase in the public debt ratio and help
restore investor confidence; and to ensure that the banks and their supervisors are
well-prepared to respond to possible adverse developments. Even with these actions, it
may take time to regain market access, and covering public financing needs in the
period ahead will be challenging.
Policy response: The authorities are focused on implementing strong fiscal
consolidation measures that would culminate in a balanced budget by 2014, and on
closely monitoring developments in the financial sector while stepping up their
contingency planning. They are hopeful that they will be able to borrow from
non-market sources, which would provide a bridge until they can regain market access.

CYPRUS

BACKGROUND
A. Pre-Crisis
1.
Before the 2008 crisis, Cyprus
enjoyed a long period of high growth, low
unemployment, and sound public finances.
The unemployment rate reached a low of 3.6
percent in 2008, with rapid wage and
employment growth attracting an inflow of
foreign workers. The main growth drivers were
services exports, including financial, legal,
accounting, and shipping services, which were
attracted by an educated English-speaking
workforce, low corporate tax rates, double-tax
treaties with strategic partner countries, a
stable macroeconomic environment, and
Cyprus’ favorable geographic location.
Although declining in relative terms, tourism
contributed 10 percent of GDP in 2008.
Meanwhile, the public debt ratio was well
below the euro area average at 48 percent of
GDP at end-2008.

2.
However, vulnerabilities were
building in the form of widening external
shortfalls, rapid credit growth, a real estate
boom, and the large exposure of Cypriot
banks to Greece. Current account deficits,
which had previously been modest and mostly
covered by FDI, started to widen after EU
accession in 2004, reflecting a sharp drop of
private savings (Box 1). The current account
deficit hit a peak of 17 percent of GDP in 2008,
which was largely financed by inflows of nonresident deposits to the banking system and
external borrowing by banks. Rapid credit
growth fueled a housing boom. Meanwhile,
strong domestic demand, supported by
foreign financing, contributed to rapid wage
increases in excess of productivity gains.

CYPRUS

Box 1. Savings and Investment
After EU accession in 2004 and the run-up to adopting the euro in 2008, savings declined sharply,
contributing to the rapid increase in the current account deficit. This likely reflected optimism
about growth prospects as a full-fledged member of the euro area, as well as the easy availability
of external credit that also led to lower savings in other peripheral euro area countries. Between
the accession year of 2004 and the onset of the financial crisis in 2008, the saving rate dropped
from 15 to 7 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, the investment rate increased from about 19 to 23
percent of GDP between 2004 and 2008, also contributing to the current account deficit. The
private sector accounted for most of the saving decline and investment increase, while public
saving and investment stayed largely constant.
Almost all of the increased investment between 2004 and 2008 went into the construction sector
(investment in construction increased by 3.5 percent of GDP, while investment in machinery and
equipment increased by only 0.3 percent of GDP). Much of the construction boom was driven by
foreign demand for vacation homes (especially from the UK).

B. Impact of Crisis
3.
The crisis hit Cyprus through a drop
in services exports and an abrupt slowdown
in construction, whose impact was softened
by a large fiscal expansion. Cyprus
experienced the mildest recession in the euro
area in 2009, with a drop in GDP of
1.9 percent. A sizable fiscal stimulus played a
major role in cushioning demand. The
relatively low reliance on manufacturing
exports (which are more cyclical than service
exports) and on wholesale bank funding also
softened the impact of the crisis on exports
and credit growth. Nonetheless, the recession
triggered a sharp fall in consumption and a
significant increase in unemployment. Growth
recovered modestly in 2010, despite the
dampening effects of increasing
unemployment and high household leverage.
Contraction in the construction sector and
weak tourism remained important drags on
the economy.
4.
The current account deficit adjusted
sharply, but remained at high levels
compared to other euro areas countries. The
current account deficit improved from 16.8 to
7.5 percent of GDP between 2008 and 2009,
mainly due to weaker import demand and
lower commodity prices. It remained stable in
2010, as a recovery of services exports was
offset by a weaker goods balance due to
higher oil prices. FDI provide the main source
of financing over 2009-10, covering 65 percent
of the current account deficit.

5.
The fiscal deficit deteriorated
sharply in 2009 due to both structural and
cyclical reasons, and narrowed somewhat in
2010 as a result of one-off factors and a
small revenue package. A stimulus package
of 4 percent of GDP was implemented in 2009
to cushion the impact of the crisis. The main
measures were permanent increases in wages
and salaries (1.6 percent of GDP), social
transfers (1.6 percent of GDP), and public
investment (1.4 percent of GDP). Automatic
stabilizers were also allowed to operate, and a
sharp decline (2.5 percent of GDP) in
construction/real estate related revenues was
largely accommodated. The result was a swing
from a surplus in 2008 to a deficit of close to
6 percent of GDP in 2009. In 2010, one-off
central bank-related revenues (0.5 percent of
GDP), and a hike in petroleum excises and tax
compliance measures (0.5 percent of GDP),
contributed to a modest narrowing of the
deficit.

CURRENT VULNERABILITIES AND OUTLOOK
6.
Financial conditions have
deteriorated rapidly since late 2010, to the
point where Cyprus is now effectively shut
out of long-term sovereign debt markets.
Starting in late 2010, ratings agencies
launched a series of downgrades and investors
increasingly focused on the large exposure of
the country’s banks to Greece. Conditions
worsened over the summer in tandem with
adverse Greek developments and fiscal
slippage in Cyprus. By mid-2011, 10-year
government bond yields exceeded 10 percent
and Cyprus had lost access to long-term
sovereign debt markets. Meanwhile, bank
stock prices plummeted, with the Cyprus Stock
Exchange index (in which the three large banks
account for over 90 percent of market
capitalization) down 61 percent to date in
2011.

exploded, causing significant loss of life
and destroying the next-door Vassilikos
power plant, which supplied half the
island’s power. Reconstruction costs
estimated at €300–700 million and are
expected to be covered by the power
company and insurance proceeds. The
fallout included rolling blackouts in the
summer months, with adverse effects on
output and government revenues, and a
weakening of support for the government.
In early August, the President appointed a
new cabinet, including a new finance
minister. However, the centrist DIKO party
left the governing coalition, leaving the
ruling left wing AKEL party with a minority
in parliament.
8.

Growth is expected to be zero in
2011. The gradual recovery that started in
2010 was derailed by the loss of
production and confidence stemming from
the destruction of the power plant and
weaker external demand, as well as
increasing uncertainty and tighter financial
conditions related to worsening prospects
in Greece. The construction sector
continues to retrench from the excesses
leading up to the crisis. House prices and
rents have been on a declining trend since
the market peaked in 2008 and show no
sign of recovery so far (Box 2). Tourism is
one of the few bright spots, with revenues
up 16 percent through August and on
track to regain its 2008 level.

CYPRUS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. Cyprus: The Housing Market
The housing market in Cyprus experienced a boom over
2006-08. The central bank price index shows an increase
of over 50 percent over that period, followed by a decline
of 12 percent. Buyers from abroad contributed to the
run-up and subsequent drop, with the UK accounting for,
70 percent of foreign buyers. Since end-2008, weak UK
(and global) growth and the depreciation of the pound
against the euro have depressed foreign demand.

Staff projects an economic
contraction of 1 percent in 2012 and a
gradual recovery in outer years. The key
drivers behind the expected downturn
include yet tighter financial conditions as
banks curtail their lending (or even shrink
their balance sheets) in order to preserve
capital and liquidity buffers; the negative
short-term impact of fiscal adjustment
measures; and a worsening growth outlook
in the euro area and beyond.
Unemployment is expected to peak at
8½ percent in 2012, while inflation is
projected to decline to 2½ percent due to
stabilization of commodity prices and
subdued demand. Domestic demand is
expected to recover over the medium term
as both internal and external conditions
normalize.

10.

The current account deficit is
projected to narrow further in 2011–12.
The dampening impact of slow growth on
imports, together with strong tourism
(including a 50 percent increase in visitors
from Russia), are expected to more than
offset the impact of higher energy prices in
2011. As a result, the current account
deficit is expected to decline from
7.8 percent of GDP in 2010 to 7.2 percent
in 2011. The deficit is projected to narrow
further in 2012, as the expected downturn
depresses domestic demand, fiscal
adjustment raises public sector savings,
and commodity prices ease. Service
exports are projected to remain subdued
with only modest further gains in tourism
receipts and sluggish shipping and
international business services due to a
worsened external environment. Box 3
provides an assessment of
competitiveness.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11.
The downside risks to growth are
sizable. A key risk to the baseline projection
arises from developments in the euro area. If
financial turbulence were to intensify and
prospects for Greece to worsen, this could
have a large impact on Cypriot banks, leading
to even tighter financial conditions with
negative implications for confidence and
demand. Further, an adverse shock to world
trade would affect Cyprus through services
exports, which account for close to half of
GDP. Finally, the fiscal consolidation planned
for 2012–13 could have a larger than
anticipated contractionary impact. If these risks
were to materialize, 2012 growth could be
considerably lower than the baseline
projection.

CYPRUS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 3. Competitiveness and Structural Issues
Standard price-based real exchange rate measures show modest appreciation since 2000,
with unit labor cost (ULC) based measures showing more significant appreciation. The
overall ULC appreciation in Cyprus was higher than the euro area average. However it was
broadly in line with other peripheral euro area countries, albeit with less downward flexibility
around the period of the crisis. In particular, the ULC-based exchange rate for the
manufacturing sector appreciated more than elsewhere. The manufacturing sector is small
(currently at 7 percent of GDP) and has decreased as the economy has transitioned towards
specialization in services, and the ULC-based appreciation may have helped to speed that
transition.

A. Fiscal policies and Financing

12.
The government has launched a new
initiative aimed at reversing fiscal slippage
and restoring market confidence. Staff
projects that the deficit will widen from
5.3 percent of GDP last year to 7 percent in
2011, bringing public debt to 68 percent of
GDP, due to cyclically weak revenues and the
failure to contain spending. To reverse the
slippage, the government has announced fiscal
savings targets of €150 million (0.8 percent of
GDP) in 2011, €650 million (3.6 percent of
GDP) in 2012, and €400 million (2.2 percent of
GDP) in 2013. Its stated goals are to reduce the
fiscal deficit to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2012 and
achieve a balanced budget by 2014.




Parliament passed a first package of
measures in late August that the
authorities estimate will yield savings of
€109 million in 2011 and €152 million in
2012. Main measures include an increase
in the permanent contribution of 4.25
percent by public sector workers toward
their pensions, an increase in the
withholding tax on interest income from
10 to 15 percent, and a flat levy on
businesses. The government has also
closed the public service pension system
to new employees (who will participate
instead in the national pension system) .
A second package of measures was sent to
Parliament in mid-October. According to
the authorities, it would largely achieve the
remaining savings targeted for 2012 but
would leave the bulk of 2013 and 2014
savings for future legislation. Key measures
include an increase in the VAT rate from
15 percent (the lowest in the EU) to 17

percent, a 6-month freeze of cost of living
adjustments (COLA) for public servants (in
addition the government will seek
consensus by end-2011 on a permanent
reform of the COLA that aims to achieve
further fiscal savings), and improved
targeting of social transfers based on
income criteria. The authorities also
announced that they would take additional
measures in the event that realized fiscal
savings from the measures fall short of the
targeted amounts.
13.
The proposed measures would be an
important step towards addressing the high
public sector wage bill and poorly targeted
social transfers. At 15.4 percent of GDP in
2010, Cyprus has the largest public sector
wage bill in the euro area. This was
exacerbated in 2009 when wage increases
pushed the wage bill up by 1.5 percent of GDP.
Together with an array of poorly targeted
social benefits (5.5 percent of GDP in 2010),
these two categories consume 45 percent of
total general government spending.

CYPRUS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

14.
To support their fiscal consolidation
goals and improve budget processes, the
authorities plan to implement an agenda of
structural fiscal reforms. These include:
(i) introduction of fiscal rules and a mediumterm budget framework into national
legislation, consistent with EU directives;
(ii) passage of a new public debt management
law to improve debt and cash management;
(iii) accounting and statistics reforms to
expand coverage and increase timely data
availability; (iv) strengthening revenue and
expenditure forecasting to increase
transparency and reduce biases in projections.
15.
Age-related outlays pose a major
long-term challenge to public finances.
Pension expenditures, including both the
national scheme managed by the Social
Security Fund (SSF) and the pension scheme
for public workers, are projected to become
one of the highest in the euro area by 2050.
Health expenditures are also projected to
increase by 1 percent of GDP by 2050.



The SSF deficit is estimated at about
0.5 percent of GDP in 2010 (excluding
government contributions and interest on
government debt held in pension fund
reserves). Spending of the SSF is projected
to increase by about 8 percentage points
of GDP by 2050, to about 14 percent of
GDP, as the population ages and the

relatively new system matures.
Contributions from employees and
employers are scheduled to rise by only
about 3 percent of GDP, based on
contribution increases scheduled to take
place every 5 years from 2014 until 2039.
As a result, transfers from the budget
would need to increase by roughly 5
percentage points of GDP to meet SSF
obligations.


Public employee pension expenditures net
of contributions are expected to increase
from about 3 percent of GDP in 2010 to
5 percent of GDP in 2050, according to a
recent actuarial study. The study suggests
that an average contribution rate
exceeding 40 percent would be needed to
fully fund benefits through 2060,
compared to the 5 percent employee
contribution at present. The system
remains generous by international
standards even after recent reforms. Some
groups (such as teachers and police) have
low retirement ages. Benefits are based on
the final salary instead of the career
average, and a full pension can be accrued
with fewer years of service than in the
national scheme. Benefits are indexed to
both general wage increases in the public
sector and the consumer price index. In
addition to the pension, workers receive a
lump sum benefit at retirement that can
exceed 5 times the annual pension.

Financing
16.
Although the government has lost
access to long-term sovereign debt
markets, it will likely be able to meet
remaining financing needs for 2011
through issuance of short-term debt and
use of deposits. The amount of long-term

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CYPRUS

debt maturing in the last quarter of 2011 is
minimal. Provided the government can issue a
small amount (€244 million, or 1.3 percent of
GDP) of net new short-term debt, and that it
does not need to provide financial support to

its banks, it will be able to meet its financing
needs through year-end, with the help of
deposits equaling 1.2 percent of GDP.

17.
Government financing will be a
major challenge in 2012 absent non market
financing. Long-term debt maturities include
a €550 million domestic bond maturing in
January 2012 and a €550 million Eurobond
maturing in February. Financing needed to
cover all maturing long-term debt and the
fiscal deficit in 2012 totals roughly €2 billion.

B. Financial Sector
18.
A large banking system with heavy
exposure to Greece is a major vulnerability
of the Cypriot economy. Bank assets total
€152 billion (835 percent of GDP), while assets
of commercial banks with Cypriot parents are
€92 billion (500 percent of GDP). Exposure of
these banks to Greece totals €29 billion, or
160 percent of GDP, including both Greek
government bonds and loans to Greek
residents. They also hold €1.6 billion of Cypriot
government bonds but minimal amounts of

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

sovereign debt of other peripheral euro area
countries.
19.
The largest risk comes from
commercial banks with Cypriot parents,
although other banking groups also pose
potentially significant risks (Box 4). NPLs at
these banks have risen on both their local loan
portfolios and their branches’ Greek loan
books, and provisioning ratios have declined.
Only the non-collateralized portions of NPLs
are provisioned, which leaves banks exposed
to further losses in the event of significant
declines in collateral value.

Cypriot banks face significant capital
needs to meet the new European Banking
Authority requirements. The EBA calculations
released on October 26 indicate that Cypriot
banks require additional capital estimated at
€3.6 billion (20 percent of GDP) on a

preliminary basis to attain a 9 percent core Tier
1 capital ratio and create a buffer against
mark-to-market losses on their sovereign debt
holdings. An updated diagnostic could
possibly reveal larger capital needs.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CYPRUS

Box 4. Structure of Cypriot Banking System
Banks can be grouped into four main categories: Cypriot commercial banks (with domestic
and international operations), foreign branches, foreign subsidiaries, and savings
cooperatives.

16



Commercial banks with Cypriot parents hold €92 billion (505 percent of GDP) in assets,
dominated by three large banks (Bank of Cyprus, Marfin Popular Bank, and Hellenic
Bank) which together account for 97 percent of total assets of this group. They have
large foreign operations through branches and subsidiaries, primarily through the
Marfin and Bank of Cyprus branches in Greece. They hold €23 billion (130 percent of
GDP) in loans to Greek residents and €5 billion of Greek government bonds. Loans to
residents outside Greece through foreign affiliates (including in south-east Europe,
Russia, Ukraine, and the UK) total €7 billion.



Foreign branch assets total some €8 billion (42 percent of GDP). They are attracted to
Cyprus largely for tax reasons and their interaction with the Cypriot economy is limited,
as they receive minimal funding from and hold minimal claims on Cypriot residents.
This low degree of interaction would likely help shield the Cypriot banking system from
problems at these branches (or their parents), although reputational risks to the
broader banking sector are possible.



Foreign subsidiary assets total €35 billion (195 percent of GDP). Similar to foreign
branches, they are located in Cyprus largely for tax and regulatory reasons. Their
interaction with the Cypriot economy is only a share of their total assets, with €4 billion
in deposits from Cypriot residents and €6 billion in loans to residents. They are
predominantly Greek (Alpha, Eurobank, Piraeus, and NBG) and also include the
subsidiary of a Russian state bank. They largely rely on parent funding and their
parents hold much of the credit risk on their assets. However, the risk to Cyprus would
be larger than for foreign branches due to their greater interactions with the Cypriot
economy and their legal status as subsidiaries participating in the national deposit
insurance scheme.



Some 100 savings cooperatives hold €17 billion (92 percent of GDP) in assets. Their
assets are dominated by loans to residents and they are funded predominantly by
resident deposits. Cooperatives are regulated separately from banks, by the Authority
for Supervision and Development of Cooperative Societies.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CYPRUS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

21.
Funding pressures are another
significant vulnerability. Cypriot banks rely
mostly on deposits for funding, with a loan-todeposit ratio of 93 percent. Capital market
refinancing needs are low, at €550 million in
2011–13, and reliance on interbank financing is
modest. However, three sources of funding
vulnerability stand out.




First, non-resident deposits (NRD) in
Cypriot banks (excluding deposits raised
abroad by foreign affiliates) are €23 billion
(125 percent of GDP), most of which are
short-term at low interest rates. These
could prove unstable in the event of
further confidence shocks. This risk is
partly mitigated by the 70 percent liquid
asset requirement against the €12 billion in
NRD in foreign currency), and the
20 percent requirement for the €11 billion
in euro-denominated NRD).
Second, €17 billion in deposits collected in
the Greek branches of the three largest

Cypriot-owned banks could be subject to
outflows in response to difficult conditions
in Greece. Outflows in the first half of 2011
were close to €3 billion (nearly 15 percent
of the total), although a portion of these
returned to the Cypriot parents as NRD.
While the system as a whole could handle
continued moderate outflows, individual
banks could face liquidity shortages.


Third, funding pressures could also arise
from loss of access to ECB liquidity. The
ECB currently provides some significant
liquidity to the system, most of which must
eventually be replaced by market funding.
Moreover, further market losses on Greek
(as well as Cypriot) government debt
would reduce the value of collateral
eligible for ECB funding. Should Cyprus be
downgraded to below investment grade,
its government securities could no longer
be eligible as collateral for ECB refinancing
facilities under current rules.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
22.
Discussions focused on the need for
large and credible fiscal adjustment,
financial sector contingency planning, and
the challenge of securing fiscal financing.
Staff argued that a strong fiscal effort was
essential to restore sound public finances and
regain access to sovereign debt markets. Staff
highlighted the large risks facing Cypriot
banks, in particular from their Greek exposures,
and urged the authorities to engage in
contingency planning and ensure that they
have all the legal tools required to take
prompt corrective action if necessary. Staff
emphasized that fiscal financing in 2012,
including repayment of significant long-term

debt maturities, presented a major challenge.
The authorities broadly shared the staff
assessment.

fiscal savings over 2011–13, staff viewed
the authorities’ projection that this would
reduce the fiscal deficit to below 3 percent
of GDP in 2012 as too optimistic. First, it
takes as a starting point a deficit of
6.5 percent of GDP in 2011, whereas in
staff’s view the outcome will be about 7
percent of GDP (the difference is due to
more conservative staff assumptions on
the savings yield of adjustment measures).
Second, it is based on a projection of
0.2 percent growth in 2012, whereas staff
expects a contraction due to financial
sector deleveraging, weak external
demand, and the negative short-term
impact of fiscal cuts on output. A more
realistic deficit path over the next
3–4 years, underpinned by well-defined
fiscal savings, would enhance credibility.
Moreover, staff viewed implementation
risks around the planned measures as
considerable—both from potential
watering down of the measures and

Size of adjustment. Staff advised that
Cyprus does not have the option of backloading adjustment to protect growth,
given its lack of access to financing and
the need to restore confidence. The size of
adjustment in 2012–13 needs to be
sufficient to put the budget on a firm path
towards balance by 2014, with a
substantial down payment in 2012. Staff
agreed with the authorities that their
planned fiscal savings—6.6 percent of GDP
over 2011–13, of which 3.6 percent of GDP
is slated for 2012—strike an appropriate
balance between the need for a sizable
adjustment and the need to avoid fiscal
cuts so large that they would undermine
growth prospects and create negative
dynamics for investor confidence and bank
balance sheets. Under the staff baseline
scenario, these adjustments would stabilize
the public debt ratio in 2013 and reduce it
to 60 percent of GDP by 2016.
Credibility. Staff emphasized the
importance of being conservative in
estimates of the fiscal savings from
adjustment measures and identifying
additional contingency measures in case
savings fall short of target. The need for
conservative estimates is all the more
important in light of the projected
outcome for this year, which compares
unfavorably to the deficit target of
4 percent of GDP in the 2011 budget.
While endorsing the authorities’ targets for



Multi-year framework. The government
should move quickly to pass into
legislation specific measures in the context
of a credible multi-year consolidation plan
for 2012–14. After passage of the second

CYPRUS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

package of measures needed to secure the
targeted savings in 2012, additional
measures need to be adopted to achieve
the €400 million in savings targeted for
2013 and to balance the budget in 2014.

tax climate to protect Cyprus’ appeal as an
international business center, and Cyprus has
ample remaining room for reducing the public
wage and pension bill and targeting social
transfers (especially after the large increases in
2009). Specific areas should include freezing
the COLA for two years as an interim measure
pending more fundamental reform of the
COLA system; eliminating automatic salary
increments; targeting social transfers based on
income criteria; and reforms to the national
and public employee pension systems. While
achieving €400 million with these measures
should be feasible, staff recommended
preparing for an additional 1 point increase in
the VAT rate to 18 percent and savings from
reprioritizing public investment as a
contingency in case measures related to
current expenditure do not yield the intended
savings.

24.
Staff recommended that additional
measures to reach the 2013 fiscal targets
should be predominantly
expenditure-based. International evidence
suggests that expenditure-based consolidation
is more reliable in securing savings. In
addition, it is important to preserve a favorable

25.
In the event that downside risks to
growth materialize, staff recommended
keeping the magnitude of the planned
2011–13 fiscal savings unchanged, while
taking measures to safeguard fiscal
sustainability in the outer years. Additional
consolidation measures in a weaker economy
should be avoided provided sufficient funding
is available, since they would further depress
demand and growth, which could have an

adverse impact on investor confidence. In an
illustrative scenario with lower growth and
inflation but the same fiscal savings, the public
debt ratio would peak at 85 percent of GDP in
2015. To protect fiscal debt sustainability, it
would thus be important to implement
consolidation measures over the longer term,
including deeper reforms to the national and
public employee pension systems.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CYPRUS

26.
The government expressed its
commitment to achieving fully the savings
targets, and to taking additional measures
in the event of shortfalls. They agreed that
delays in taking effective adjustment measures
had resulted in the loss of valuable time and
damaged credibility. They remained more
optimistic than staff on both the 2011 deficit
outcome and 2012 growth, and thus believed
they would be successful in reducing the
deficit to below 3 percent of GDP in 2012, en
route to a balanced budget by 2014. The
authorities were mindful of the need to move
quickly on measures to secure fiscal savings in
2013–14, and emphasized the need for social
dialogue to achieve the needed consensus.
They were sympathetic to the benefits of
expenditure-based consolidation and believed

that there was significant room for further
rationalization of public spending.
27.
Staff highlighted the vulnerability
posed by the loss of access to sovereign
debt markets. Even with full implementation
of the authorities’ fiscal adjustment plans, it
would take time to regain market access in
light of uncertain external economic and
financial conditions and the need to establish a
track record of successful consolidation. The
authorities were confident that they would
receive a low interest loan of €2.5 billion from
Russia before the end of the year. In their view,
this would allow them to meet a substantial
portion of their 2012 gross financing needs
and provide time to implement fiscal
consolidation and restore market confidence.

B. Financial Sector
28.
Staff encouraged the authorities to
take measures to strengthen the capacity of
the banking system to weather adverse
shocks including by:


20

Strengthening crisis management
procedures and engaging in contingency
planning. This includes priority passage of
legislation to give the authorities adequate
powers to provide financial support
through fast-track procedures and to
resolve banks if needed (under current law
the authorities lack powers to liquidate or
sell insolvent banks without shareholder
approval or going through lengthy legal
procedures); planning for various scenarios
of capital and liquidity shortages in
different parts of the banking system,
including foreign branches of Cypriot
banks and foreign subsidiaries operating in
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Cyprus; and coordinating closely with
foreign supervisors and EU banking
authorities.


A plan to achieve higher capital levels and
to ensure adequate funding. The
authorities need to work with the banks to
agree on a plan to raise the preliminary
estimate of €3.6 billion in capital by June
2012 to meet the recently announced
strengthened EBA capital requirements.
Potential sources include new equity
investments, conversion of existing hybrid
capital to eligible convertible capital,
restricting profit distributions and bonuses,
and sale of assets such as foreign
subsidiaries. It remains unclear whether it
will be possible to raise the additional
capital from private sources. If not, the
envisaged recapitalization would require

CYPRUS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

government or official external support.
Before injecting capital into a bank, the
authorities should make a positive
assessment of it solvency. The authorities
should also evaluate bank liquidity needs
and work with EU banking authorities, as
necessary, to secure access to term
funding.
29.
The authorities acknowledged that
there were gaps in their powers to resolve
and recapitalize banks. They are in the
process of drafting legislation to remedy these
gaps, and asked for technical assistance in this
endeavor (in particular on legislation to
provide bank resolution powers) from the
Fund. In response, a Fund technical assistance
team visited Cyprus the week of October 24.
30.
Staff recommended that
cooperatives should be subject to the same
regulatory and supervisory regime as
commercial banks. While the cooperatives do
not have significant exposure to Greek or
other foreign borrowers, they should be
monitored closely in light of their large size
(over 90 percent of GDP) and elevated NPL
rates. The authorities should review the

regulatory and supervisory structure of the
cooperatives and identify any disparities with
the regime for commercial banks that could
give rise to regulatory arbitrage or market
distortions. Staff also reiterated its
long-standing advice that supervision and
regulation of banks and cooperatives should
be unified, and that as an intermediate step
the regulatory frameworks should be
harmonized. Staff also called for greater
transparency, including publication of the
same data as available for commercial banks.
31.
Staff discussed the outcome of the
recent MONEYVAL (the financial action task
force-style regional group of which Cyprus
is a member) anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT) mutual evaluation report, with
an emphasis on international cooperation
and supervision. The report’s
recommendations pertaining to international
cooperation are particularly important, given
the size of the international services sector,
and the potential for adverse spillovers on
other economies.

C. Structural Reforms
Pension Reform
32.
Staff recommended that the
authorities initiate a reform of the national
pension system to put it on a sustainable
long-term financial footing. While the fiscal
burden of the pension system is limited at
present, it will grow over time. Action at an
early juncture can spread out necessary
adjustments over time, making them easier to
absorb. Staff recommended a number of

reform options that could be explored,
including (i) introducing an early retirement
penalty; (ii) increasing the retirement age
gradually to 67 years and linking it to increases
in life expectancy; (iii) moving gradually
towards indexing pensions to inflation only;
and (iv) reducing the imbalance between
contributions and benefits by gradually
adjusting the pension accrual rate and
accelerating planned contribution rate
increases for employees and employers (see

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CYPRUS

Selected Issues Paper). The authorities
welcomed the staff analysis and agreed on the
importance of reforms to ensure the long-term
sustainability of the system. They explained
that they were preparing to release an
actuarial study that would evaluate the
system’s long-term finances, which would
provide an opportunity to explore reform
options.
33.
Staff welcomed the introduction of
higher contributions by public sector
workers towards their pensions and
encouraged the authorities to pursue
deeper reforms. To rationalize costs, staff
recommended a set of reform options,
including adoption of the same retirement age
as the national scheme; a gradual extension of
the period used to compute benefits to the full
career average; a gradual move towards
indexing pensions to the CPI; and a gradual
phase-out of the lump sum benefit at
retirement (See Selected Issues Paper).

Structural Fiscal Reform
34.
Staff encouraged the authorities to
push ahead on structural fiscal reforms to
support the introduction of a medium-term
budgetary framework. EU directives relating
to the fiscal framework should be
expeditiously implemented, including the one
that mandates the introduction of fiscal rules
in national legislation. Swift passage of
national fiscal rules will signal the authorities’
commitment to sound public finances,
although a transition regime will be needed for
their full implementation. Staff encouraged the
authorities to improve core budget processes
such as strengthening forecasting, simplifying
budget classifications, and increasing the
flexibility to reallocate spending across
different categories, which would help to

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

reduce the need for supplementary budgets
(see Selected Issues Paper). Staff also advised
reorganizing the revenue administration by
combining the separate departments
responsible for different taxes and
strengthening the exchange of information.
Finally, staff welcomed the authorities’
intention to pass a new debt management law.
The authorities agreed on the importance of
structural fiscal reforms and indicated that they
would seek Fund technical assistance in
priority areas.
35.
Staff advised the authorities to
improve the management of fiscal risks
from extra budgetary entities and PublicPrivate Partnerships (PPPs). In the short term
this can be achieved by closely monitoring the
finances of the largest extra budgetary entities
by the Ministry of Finance. In the medium
term, consideration should be given to
divesting suitable entities, liquidating entities
that are no longer needed, and bringing back
into the budget entities that carry out
government functions and lack adequate
rationale for operating as autonomous entities.
With respect to PPPs, staff recommended
reform of the framework to ensure the proper
evaluation of financial risks to the budget and
to put in place procedures that empower the
Ministry of Finance to stop PPP projects that
do not meet appropriate standards (see
Selected Issues Paper).

Competitiveness
36.
Reducing wage rigidities is the most
important structural reform needed to
address the competitiveness challenge. The
current crisis is an opportunity to undertake
significant reform or even eliminate the cost of
living adjustment system in the public sector
(which would be expected to lead to reduced

CYPRUS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

use of the COLA in the private sector). By
linking wages automatically to inflation rather
than productivity, the COLA reduces the
flexibility of relative wage levels across
different firms and sectors, which hinders the
ability of the economy to adjust to variations
in productivity or demand. At an
economy-wide level, the COLA also impedes
the flexibility of wages to adjust to shocks such
as the 2008 financial crisis or commodity price
swings. It also contributes to high public sector
wage levels, which makes it more difficult for
the private sector to attract skilled workers. For
these reasons, few countries in the euro area
have automatic adjustments mechanisms such
as the COLA, and Fund staff has generally
advised against their use.
37.
Cyprus has made some progress in
improving its regulatory environment, with
more yet to be done. Cyprus ranks 40th
among 183 countries worldwide in the World
Bank Ease of Doing Business indicator, and
47th among 142 economies in terms of
broader competitiveness as measured by the
World Economic Forum’s Global
Competitiveness Report. Measures taken have
included simplifying the administrative
procedures to set up new business (one-stop
shop). Further measures are needed to
improve the business environment. Cyprus
ranks only 39 out of 48 high income countries
in the World Bank’s Ease of Enforcing
Contracts index, reflecting the numerous
procedures and long waiting times to resolve
disputes in court. Moreover, some key
transport services are severely restricted in
terms of working hours (e.g., ports,
warehouses) or access to license to operate
(e.g., trucks).
38.
Investment in R&D and the rate of
adoption of new technologies by businesses

are very low relative to other euro area
countries, including those with similar size
and industry structure. Cyprus ranks low in
terms of its capacity for innovation and R&D,
one of the dimensions of competitiveness
defined by the Lisbon Strategy.1 Aggregate
spending on R&D, at 0.4 percent of GDP, is far
below the EU target of 3 percent of GDP and is
almost exclusively carried out by the public
sector. Information and communication
technologies usage by enterprises ranks
among the lowest in the EU, according to
survey data from Eurostat.
39.
Reforms to further improve the
business climate by reducing red tape and
removing obstacles to technology
upgrading would increase potential growth
in the medium and long term. The
authorities should identify the regulatory
hurdles affecting the business environment
discussed above and lay out appropriate
reforms. They should explore what obstacles
hinder more widespread technology adoption.
Initial measures to support Cypriot businesses
in their efforts to upgrade technology and
enhance productivity have been included in
the National Reform Program.

1

According to the Lisbon Review 2010, Cyprus ranks
13th out of 27 EU countries in terms of overall
competitiveness, but only 21th in terms of the subcategory Innovation and R&D.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
The Cypriot economy faces a very
difficult economic outlook as it confronts
new external challenges while still working
to overcome the legacy of the 2008 crisis.
Externally, the exposure of Cypriot banks to
Greece and worsening prospects for external
demand pose the main challenges.
Domestically, the foremost challenge is to
restore sound public finances, and to regain
access to sovereign debt markets.
41.
The situation calls for immediate
action to reverse the widening fiscal deficits
and put public debt on a downward path.
The pace of adjustment must be ambitious but
realistic to build credibility. If the economy
evolves as anticipated under staff’s baseline
scenario, it should be possible to bring the
deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2013.
Measures should focus mostly on expenditure
reductions, which are more durable and
reliable than revenue increases. Priority areas
for fiscal savings include containment of public
sector wages and benefits and further
improvements in the targeting of social
transfers towards the less well-off, as well as a
moderate increase in VAT rates. Fiscal savings
should be based on conservative assumptions
and implemented without slippage. These are
preconditions for restoring confidence and
ensuring the government can access markets
to meet its financing needs.
42.
The government has set ambitious
targets that would deliver a large reduction
in the deficit in 2012 and a balanced budget
within three years. This timeframe strikes an
appropriate balance between the need for
up-front savings and the benefits of avoiding
an excessive contraction in demand. The
government should now move quickly to pass

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

into legislation specific measures, in the
context of a credible multi-year consolidation
plan, and prepare additional measures that can
be rapidly put in place to address
contingencies.
43.
In view of unsettled external
conditions, utmost vigilance and careful
contingency planning are required for the
financial sector. The authorities should
require banks to put in place robust plans to
achieve higher capital ratios consistent with
new EBA requirements, and to identify and
address potential liquidity needs. They should
move quickly to enhance their powers so that
they can take prompt corrective action to
recapitalize or resolve banks, if necessary. To
this end, passage of the bank framework law
and amendments to the banking act,
preferably at the same time, should be an
immediate priority. Greater attention should
be paid to cooperative credit institutions, to
ensure that their regulation and supervision is
on par with that for banks and to detect any
problems at an early stage.
44.
The top priority in the area of
structural reform is to improve the
flexibility of labor markets in order to
improve the prospects for growth and
employment. Containing public sector wages
and benefits, sustained reductions in the size
of public employment, and significant reform
to the cost of living allowance mechanism will
make an important contribution by increasing
wage flexibility and augmenting the flow of
highly qualified workers to the private sector.
45.
Reforming the national pension
scheme is key to long-term fiscal
sustainability. Although the fiscal burden of

CYPRUS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

the system is limited at present, it will grow
quickly as the system matures. This is a good
time to initiate reform of the system to ensure
its financial equilibrium over the longer term. If
reforms are agreed soon, they can be phased
in gradually, avoiding the disruption that
would result if they were postponed until the
mounting costs of the system demand
immediate action.
46.
Reform of budget institutions is
needed to support fiscal consolidation
while also promoting greater
accountability, transparency, and efficiency
of public finances. Key areas include
introduction of a medium-term budgetary

framework and the full implementation of EU
fiscal framework directives, including the
introduction of fiscal rules.
47.
The Cypriot economy faces large
risks that demand a strong policy response.
Bold corrective actions can set the stage for
resumption of economic growth, based on the
underlying strengths of the economy,
including a highly educated workforce and
diversified international service economy.
48.
It is proposed that the next Article
IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Public sector debt-to-revenue ratio 1/
Gross financing need 6/
Billions of U.S. dollars
Scenario with key variables at their historical
averages 7/
Scenario with no policy change (constant primary
balance) in 2011-2016

Key Macroeconomic and Fiscal Assumptions Underlying Baseline
Real GDP growth (percent)
Average nominal interest rate on public debt (percent) 8/
Average real interest rate (nominal rate minus change in
GDP deflator, percent)
Nominal appreciation (increase in US dollar value of
local currency, percent)
Inflation rate (GDP deflator, percent)
Growth of real primary spending (deflated by GDP
deflator, percent)
Primary deficit

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a =
share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Balance of Payments historical data and projections exclude data related to the operations by entities without a physical presence in Cyprus as data coverage on these
entities is still incomplete and subject to substantial revisions. This is also consistent with the treatment of these entities in the National accounts.
2/ 2008-09 data reflect the transitions between Greek banks and their subsidiaries in Cyprus.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.
7/ External debt in Cyprus is made up to a large extent by non-resident deposits. In light of the more stable nature of these deposits together with the existence of liquidity provisions, risks stemming from external debt are smaller than what the headline debt number may suggest.

ANNEX II: CYPRUS—STATISTICAL INFORMATION
(As of October 31, 2011)

A. Assessment of Data Adequacy
for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for
surveillance.
National Accounts: The transition to the new
European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 1995)
has complicated the analysis of national
accounts and fiscal data. The new national
accounts do not provide information on the
disposable income of households, thus
hindering the calculation of the household
saving ratio.

a comprehensive manner (see attached table).
The authorities regularly publish a wide range
of economic and financial data, as well as a
calendar of dates for the main statistical
releases. Cyprus is also subject to the statistical
requirements and timeliness and reporting
standards of Eurostat and the European
Central Bank (ECB), and has adopted the
European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). No
data ROSC is available.

Financial sector data: The currency-linked
and indexed bonds held by nonresidents are
classified as domestic instead of foreign
liabilities.
External debt: The authorities have decided
to include non-resident deposits in resident
banks in gross external debt.
Other: The Central Bank has started to
compile data on property prices and
household sector assets in 2009.

B. Data Standards and Quality
Cyprus subscribed to the IMF’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) on
December 1, 2009 and has posted the
metadata on the Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (DSBB). Cyprus’ economic
database is comprehensive and of generally
good quality. Data are provided to the Fund in

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 29, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Cyprus
On November 18, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Cyprus.1
Background
The Cypriot economy faces strong headwinds and downside risks due to financial turbulence
in the euro area, the large exposure of Cypriot banks to Greece, and the need for substantial
fiscal consolidation to stabilize public finances. Reflecting these developments, the
government has lost access to international capital markets and confronts the challenge of
accessing financing to meet its fiscal needs in 2012 and beyond.
Following a weak recovery in 2010, staff expects no economic growth this year and a modest
contraction in 2012. Factors that will weigh upon growth include tight credit and a climate of
uncertainty, continued downsizing of the construction sector after past excesses, slowing
external demand, and planned fiscal consolidation. Downside risks are dominant, in light of the
potential for external conditions to worsen and for adverse feedback loops between fiscal
imbalances and bank balance sheet vulnerabilities.
Fiscal balances have deteriorated sharply over the past three years, reflecting in large part
underlying structural factors. Adjustment measures planned for 2011 fell short of target, and
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm

2
staff expect the deficit to widen to some 7 percent of GDP in 2011. The authorities have
renewed their commitment to restore sound public finances. They have passed a first package
of adjustment measures and are seeking passage of a second and larger set of measures that
would yield fiscal savings of some 4 percent of GDP in 2012, if fully implemented. Additional
measures will be required to reduce the deficit further and achieve the government’s target of
a balanced budget by 2014. Over the longer-term, the public pension system will generate
another source of fiscal pressures, as population aging and rising dependency ratios feed
through to large increases in pension outlays.
The large banking sector, with assets totaling over 8 times GDP by the broadest measure, and
with significant exposure to Greece, is a significant vulnerability. Banks face significant capital
needs to reflect mark to market valuations on their sovereign bond holdings and to achieve a
9 percent core tier one capital ratio, as mandated by the European Banking Authority.
Non-performing loans are increasing, and further loan deterioration could add to
recapitalization needs. Meanwhile, the system is also vulnerable to an outflow of deposits in
the event of adverse circumstances. Cypriot banks receive significant liquidity support from the
European Central Bank.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Cyprus faces daunting economic challenges in the face of
faltering external demand, growing exposure to the turmoil in the euro area, particularly in
Greece, and worsening domestic financial conditions. Directors thus urged the authorities to
act forcefully to restore sound public finances and safeguard the stability of the banking
system. Steadfast implementation of fiscal and structural reforms on several fronts would also
be critical for a return to durable growth over the medium term.
Directors agreed that an ambitious and credible fiscal adjustment is essential to regain access
to the international capital markets and put the public debt ratio on a downward path. They
supported the authorities’ plans to achieve fiscal balance over the next three years as an
appropriate strategy for undertaking the necessary fiscal correction without unduly damaging
growth prospects. Directors considered that front-loading the adjustment with measures to
reverse recent increases in public sector wages and poorly targeted transfers would provide a
credible signal of the authorities’ commitment to medium-term consolidation and bolster
investor confidence. Reforms of the cost-of-living allowance system would also be important
for achieving the fiscal targets and improving real wage flexibility and competitiveness.
Directors underscored the importance of other fiscal reforms to underpin the consolidation
efforts. Priorities should include the introduction of a medium-term budget framework and the
adoption of fiscal rules consistent with EU directives. Directors also highlighted the need for
reforming the national pension and healthcare systems, which threaten to put unsustainable
pressures on the budget as the population ages.

3
Directors expressed concern about the vulnerabilities arising from Cyprus’s large banking
sector and the possibility of adverse feedback loops with the public finances and the real
economy in the context of weakening balance sheets. They stressed the importance of
building prudent capital buffers and of ensuring adequate liquidity in the financial system.
These actions should be supported by contingency planning and the immediate passage of
legislation to provide the authorities with full powers to recapitalize or resolve banks, if
necessary. Cooperative credit institutions should also be watched closely and brought under
the same regulatory and supervisory frameworks as banks.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director for Cyprus, and Ester Barendregt, Senior
Advisor to the Executive Director for Cyprus
November 18, 2011
Introduction
The authorities thank the staff for helpful discussions in Cyprus and for their thorough
analysis, which they broadly share. In view of the adverse external developments, they are
vigilant and have agreed to remain in close contact with the staff so as to keep them abreast
of the impact of these developments in Cyprus and to discuss policy responses, including in
the context of technical assistance.
Cyprus has a history of stable economic growth and responsible fiscal policies. A businessfriendly environment and a well-educated population have contributed to its economic
success over the years. Following a recession in 2009, positive real growth was registered in
2010. For 2011, the government had projected 1.5 percent growth and the outcomes in the
first two quarters of this year were in line with this projection. However, a deteriorating
th

external environment and the tragic explosion on 11 July that destroyed the Vasiliko power
plant have had a negative effect on the outlook. Moreover, the worsening situation in Greece
has negatively affected economic confidence in Cyprus, where banks have high exposure to
Greece. Rating agencies have highlighted the interrelatedness of the large Cypriot banking
sector with the Greek economy together with deteriorated fiscal performance as the main
factors for their recent downgrades of the Cypriot sovereign. Since June, Cyprus has
effectively lost access to international sovereign debt markets. The authorities are fully aware
of the seriousness of this situation and have focused their efforts on strongly improving the
fiscal position in an effort to attract external financing and to ensure financial sector stability.
The government which emerged following the reshuffle of August is committed to achieving
these objectives.
Economic and fiscal outlook
The economic impact of the Vasiliko-explosion appears less pronounced than was feared at
first. Especially the services sector is performing better than foreseen. The government now
expects growth for 2011 to turn out at around 0.5 percent, at the higher end of the postVasiliko projections. For 2012, the government’s preliminary projections point to a possible
0.2 percent growth, mainly on account of promising prospects for tourism and in general for
the services sector, as evidenced by forward-looking indicators. They acknowledge the
highly uncertain global environment and particularly the risks related to the European debt
crisis. For the medium to longer term, potential gas reserves offshore Cyprus constitute an
upside potential for economic growth prospects.

2
Fiscal outcomes in the first half of this year were significantly worse than budgeted. This is
explained by some one-off factors, but also by factors of a more structural nature such as
higher outlays for unemployment benefits and, admittedly, by delays in the implementation
of corrective measures. However, fiscal performance has somewhat stabilized in the last
months despite the deteriorated economic environment. Performance has been helped by the
less pronounced fall in growth, better than forecast corporate tax revenues and the effect of
the first package of corrective measures adopted on August 26th. Fiscal outcomes for the
months of August and September were close to the original forecast (the deficit for 2011 was
originally forecast at 4 percent). On this basis, the government's latest projection is that the
fiscal deficit for 2011 will be substantially higher than budgeted, but will remain somewhat
below 6 percent of GDP.
Fiscal consolidation
The government is firmly committed to fiscal consolidation and to addressing market
concerns. In the House of Representatives, where the government does not have a majority,
broad consensus exists on the need for large fiscal consolidation. However, there are
differences on some aspects of the fiscal consolidation package.
The government aims to reach a deficit below 3 percent for 2012 and a balanced budget by
2014 and has already proposed two sets of measures that should achieve the bulk of this
effort. Together, these packages are estimated to reduce the deficit by approximately 4
percent of GDP. The largest part of the adjustment will be on the expenditure side. The
measures will primarily address wage dynamics and the public wage bill through a frontloaded adjustment, and are mostly of a structural and permanent nature. Targeting of social
measures is another important element, which should preserve social fairness. The authorities
welcome staff’s encouragement that this is an ambitious, but appropriate pace of
consolidation. A first package of measures was approved by Parliament in August, and a
second package is currently in Parliament as part of the proceedings for the 2012 budget.
As for the specific measures taken, the following are especially worth noting: The first
package introduced for the first time in Cyprus a contribution by employees to the public
pension scheme, and the abolition of the separate occupational public pension for new
entrants. Revenue enhancing measures were also part of this package, including an increase
of the withholding tax on interest, the introduction of a levy on all registered companies, and
an increase in the highest marginal income tax rate. The second package, which is currently
in Parliament, includes further measures to contain the public sector wage bill such as the
abolition of all vacant posts, a reduction of personnel in the broader public sector (one
recruitment for every four retirements), as well as a 10 percent reduction of salary scales for
newly recruited personnel, the impact of which will grow over time. The importance of the
agreement on the freeze in the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) during the first half of 2012
should not be underestimated, as the COLA has been a deeply embedded element of the labor

3
market framework in Cyprus. Targeting of social benefits based on income and other
economic criteria and, on the revenue side, an increase in the standard VAT rate from 15
percent to 17 percent are the other main elements of this second package. The proposed VAT
rate increase is the most debated element in parliament.
Importantly, in addition to these elements discussions with the social partners have started on
reform of the COLA. This discussion is expected to be finalized by the end of this year. One
of the options being considered is to keep the COLA payments constant above a certain
threshold as a permanent arrangement.
The Minister of Finance has publicly announced that the government will look into passing
new measures, beyond those passed in August and those included in the 2012 budget. In this
context, the government intends to start a dialogue with social partners on a wage freeze.
Moreover, the authorities are committed to taking further measures in order to reach the
fiscal consolidation targets set for the 2013 and 2014 budgets in the context of the Three
Year Budgetary Plan, which will be revised early next year. Windfall revenues will be used
for deficit reduction.
Financing
The government’s policies set out in this Buff are aimed at regaining access to international
capital markets within a reasonable timeframe. For the near future, however, the lack of
access to international sovereign bond markets poses important challenges for securing
adequate financing beyond 2011. The government has secured a EUR 2.5 billion loan from
Russia, which will be disbursed in three tranches between the end of this year and April
2012. The remaining needs for financing the deficit and rolling over maturing debt until the
end of 2012 are estimated at EUR 700 million (taking into account fiscal consolidation
plans). This is expected to be covered by short-term debt and/or long-term domestic debt.
The authorities follow the developments with respect to the European debt crisis closely, and
consider their options in case these would have prolonged negative effects on the country’s
financing abilities. It is worth noting that the authorities have advanced plans for improving
their debt management framework. New legislation dealing with all aspects of debt
management is being prepared in collaboration with the World Bank.
Pensions, Public Financial Management
The government is preparing a draft law that will introduce a medium-term budgetary
framework and ensure compliance with the EU fiscal framework Directives. The IMF staff
has been invited to review the draft and to advise on practical implementation issues. The
authorities are considering to request Fund technical assistance in the fields of natural
resources contracts taxation; (for the medium term) natural resources revenue management;
and revenue administration.

4
The government furthermore is currently reviewing the new actuarial study of the national
pension scheme and its implications for fiscal sustainability. In this context the study of the
IMF on the pension system in Cyprus will provide a helpful input.
Financial sector
The Cypriot financial sector is large in terms of GDP, and has been an important pillar of the
economic model. Cypriot banks conduct mainstream banking (mostly deposit taking and loan
granting). They have low dependency on wholesale funding. The regulatory framework is
conservative, as is illustrated by strict liquidity requirements and the relatively high
minimum capital ratios (minimum core tier 1 capital of 8 percent of risk-weighted assets) .
The two largest banks already comply with the Basel III minimum capital ratios. Moreover,
the supervisor has required Cypriot banks to build up available adequate core tier 1 capital of
at least 8 percent plus an additional amount reflecting the ratio of their total assets to the
Cypriot GDP by the end of 2014. However, the interconnectedness of the banking sector with
the Greek economy and the recent downgrades by rating agencies have made the sector
vulnerable. The private sector involvement in the Greek program that was agreed on the 26
October Euro Area Summit, implies high costs for Cypriot banks. Additional needs come
from the new EBA requirements for banks to mark sovereign exposures to market and to
increase their core tier 1 capital ratio to 9 percent by June 2012. The figures reported by the
EBA already include mark-to-market valuation for Greek government bonds.
In response to these developments, the authorities continue to monitor the situation very
closely and take preventive measures. They monitor liquidity and undertake rigorous stress
testing (including scenarios for significant increases in NPLs and bad debt provisions) on a
regular basis, are developing contingency plans, and are strengthening the legal framework,
including with the help of Fund TA. The authorities expect to publish in the second half of
this month the final figures for the expected capital buffer for individual banks according to
the new EBA requirements. They expect that the shortfalls will be lower than the preliminary
figure announced by the EBA, the difference being explained inter alia by the specific
characteristics of each bond (where the EBA necessarily had to make certain common
assumptions). At this stage, the authorities expect the banks to be in a position to cover their
capital needs according to the new EBA requirements. The supervisor will work with the
banks on plans to meet the requirements. The authorities note that Cyprus banks have
substantial contingent convertible capital instruments, which are compliant with Basel III and
with the relevant CEBS guidelines. Therefore, they expect that these instruments will be
eligible to cover part of the sovereign buffer required by the EBA.
The authorities have undertaken to strengthen the legal framework by the following three
elements: First, the draft Law on Establishment and Operation of the Independent Financial
Stability Fund is being discussed in parliament. Once approved, this law will enable the
establishment and running of a Financial Stability Fund. This Fund will gradually be built up

5
by bank and cooperative credit institutions’ contributions and, when required, will finance
the implementation of the appropriate bank resolution tools by the competent authority. A
second draft law, the Financial Crisis Management Law, is also in parliament. It aims to
provide the Council of Ministers, upon a recommendation by the Central Bank of Cyprus,
with the powers needed to effectively manage a financial crisis and maintain financial
stability as well as public confidence in Cyprus’s financial system. Thirdly, the current bank
resolution regime is being strengthened through amendments in the Banking Law that will
reinforce the powers of the Central Bank of Cyprus to take specific resolution measures visà-vis credit institutions. These draft law amendments will be submitted to parliament for
approval by the end of this month.
Finally, the authorities thank the staff for very helpful technical assistance and advice in
these areas.
