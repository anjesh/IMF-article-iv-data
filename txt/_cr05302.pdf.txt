June 24, 2005
• The 2005 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Abuja and Lagos during

March 8-25, 2005. The staff team comprised Messrs. Katz (Head), and Bartsch, Ms. Gobat
(all AFR), Mr. Villafuerte (FAD), Mr. Nielsen (PDR), and Mr. Thiam (Senior Resident
Representative). Mr. Ukpong (Senior Advisor to the Executive Director) attended some of the
discussions. Staff worked closely with an overlapping Monetary and Financial Systems Department
(MFD) technical assistance (TA) mission and the World Bank resident mission.
• Discussions were held with President Obasanjo; Dr. (Mrs.) Okonjo-Iweala, Minister of Finance

(MoF); Mr. Nasir El-Rufai, Minister of Federal Capital Territory (FCT); Mrs. Usman, Minister of
State for Finance; Professor Soludo, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN); and other
senior officials. The mission also met with Dr. Adewusi, Honorable Commissioner for Finance of
Lagos State, and representatives of the private sector, civil society, and the international
community.
• At the conclusion of the 2004 Article IV consultation on July 16, 2004, Directors welcomed the

improvement in Nigeria’s prospects for sustained adjustment and economic reform and, in
particular, the articulation of the National Economic Empowerment and Development
Strategy (NEEDS). See http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2004/cr04239.pdf. Directors fully
agreed with its overall policy thrust and viewed the reform priorities as broadly consistent with the
recommendations of the 2002 Article IV consultation. Directors stressed that consistent
implementation of NEEDS, backed by complementary reforms at the subnational government level,
was essential for Nigeria to confront the daunting challenges that lay ahead. They generally
endorsed intensified surveillance, which involved quarterly staff visits and six-monthly staff reports
for the information of the Executive Board. A semiannual staff report was issued to the Board.
(http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2005/cr0537.pdf).
• Nigeria has not yet accepted Article VIII obligations (Sections 2-4), but no longer maintains

restrictions under Article XIV.
• While staff considers the current quality of data provision adequate for surveillance purposes,

there remains significant room for improvement.
• The authorities intend to publish this staff report and the accompanying selected issues paper.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Nigeria’s macroeconomic policies in 2004 were consistent with the objectives of
achieving macroeconomic stability, and reducing the economy’s vulnerability to oil
price shocks. All three tiers of government adhered to a conservative oil price-based fiscal
rule, resulting in a large overall budget surplus. Monetary policy tightening contributed to
lower inflation, a more stable exchange rate, and a significant buildup of international
reserves. GDP growth was robust, benefiting from the improved macroeconomic
environment and policy initiatives to spur agricultural production.
The authorities also made good progress in implementing their structural reform
program. They took measures to tackle public sector corruption, improve the transparency
of public policies, advance the civil service reform and the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI), and strengthen budgetary procedures. The authorities have
continued to resist pressure to reverse the liberalization of the downstream petroleum sector.
The pace of privatization, however, was disappointing.
The economic outlook for 2005 is positive, although downside risks bear close
monitoring. Given favorable terms of trade, gross international reserves are projected to
increase substantially. The economy is expected to benefit from improved infrastructure and
policy initiatives aimed at spurring non-oil GDP growth, and removal of distortions. The
administration recognizes that the 2005 federal government appropriations act poses
substantial risks and has identified measures to contain spending. Nevertheless, the non-oil
fiscal deficit will increase significantly, putting pressure on domestic resources. The burden
of containing inflation will thus fall on monetary policy. Short-term interest rates should be
allowed to adjust as needed to meet the monetary targets, and the exchange rate should be
market-determined. However, it may be difficult to keep inflation within the authorities’
original target range.
The medium-term outlook hinges on the government’s ability to consolidate the
progress it has made in macroeconomic stability, strengthen public expenditure
management, and progress significantly in implementing structural reforms. Staff
agrees with the authorities’ ambitious structural reform agenda, which focuses on improving
governance, enhancing public service delivery, strengthening the financial system, unifying
the foreign exchange markets, liberalizing trade, and improving customs and tax
administration. Reform implementation should boost productivity, allow for more efficient
resource allocation, and accelerate growth. As a matter of urgency, the national statistical
system should be overhauled.
The authorities have requested that the Fund support the implementation of their
reform program under a possible non-borrowing instrument if it becomes operational.
Staff is committed to providing policy advice and helping build capacity in Nigeria.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Over the past year, the authorities have made notable progress in implementing
their homegrown program. Their macroeconomic policies and structural reforms have been
broadly in line with the Executive Board’s recommendations (Box 1). All three tiers of
government participated in an oil price-based fiscal rule,1 thus containing the fiscal stimulus
within acceptable levels. A tight monetary policy helped lower inflation and build up large
international reserves.
2.
Despite Nigeria’s recent progress in policy and reform implementation, the
economy continues to feel the effects of more than two decades of economic
mismanagement, neglect of infrastructure and social service provision, and disregard
for market-based institutions. Social indicators for Nigeria continue to compare
unfavorably with those of even other sub-Saharan African countries; nearly 60 percent of the
population lives in

3.
Economic management is further complicated by provisions in the 1999
constitution that allocate about half of all oil revenue to the state and local governments
(SLGs). The authorities’ reforms have also met resistance from various vested interest
groups. Administrative and technical capacity constraints affect the pace of reform
implementation, requiring careful reform prioritization, focused technical assistance, and
stronger donor coordination.

The windfall oil revenue in excess of the budget reference price of US$25 per barrel was set
aside in deposit accounts with the CBN.

In spite of these enormous challenges, Nigeria now has an opportunity to
embark on difficult reforms that could dramatically improve its medium-term
prospects for more rapid and sustainable growth. Indeed, its positive performance in 2004
and improved outlook for 2005, relative political stability (with presidential elections slated
for early 2007), and the strong reform commitment of the president and his economic team
provide a unique window of opportunity to accelerate, broaden, and lock in the gains realized
so far.
II. BACKGROUND
5.
Preliminary official data
suggest that GDP, benefiting
from the improved
macroeconomic environment,
grew robustly in 2004. Real
GDP is estimated to have
increased by about 6 percent,
stemming largely from higher
growth in the non-oil economy, in
particular agriculture, and some
areas within manufacturing and
services. The authorities reported
about US$2 billion in new
foreign direct investment
commitments in the non-oil
economy, mainly in food
processing, leather goods, power,
and telecommunications.
However, employment growth
remained sluggish, and the cost of
doing business in Nigeria
continued to be high. Moreover,
in the presence of a widening
non-oil fiscal deficit and tighter
monetary policy, private sector
demand growth was low with
respect to non-oil GDP.

adhered to a conservative oil price-based fiscal rule, which was strictly implemented. Public
spending was kept in check, thus containing the widening of the non-oil primary deficit as a
percent of non-oil GDP.2 The consolidated government’s overall surplus increased to 10
percent of GDP from a balance position in 2003. The windfall oil revenue of about US$6
billion was set aside.3

The CBN tightened monetary policy to meet the disinflation objective. For the
first time in well over two decades, it met its monetary policy targets. Certain reforms—in

rates starting in the third quarter of 2004.5 However, in early 2005 the CBN failed to sterilize
a build-up of excess liquidity in the banking system, which resulted in a 25 percent increase
in broad money in the 12-months to March 2005.

The non-oil primary deficit on a cash basis widened by 0.8 percentage points of non-oil
GDP, while the widening on a commitment basis was more sizable (2.6 percentage points of
non-oil GDP).

Deposits would have been about US$1.1 billion higher had the windfall oil revenue on
domestic crude oil sales been set aside as well.

The seven designated settlement banks deposited the equivalent of about 14 percent of end2003 base money in settlement collateral with the CBN.

In April 2004, the CBN in coordination with the Debt Management Office, began
smoothing the maturity profile on three-month treasury bills. In October, it introduced a sixmonth treasury bill.

Sovereign risk spreads suggest a stable outlook for the Nigerian economy. In
response to both an increased appetite for emerging market debt and the improved external
outlook, spreads have come down since their highs of late 2002. However, they still remain
about 400 basis points above the global emerging market spread. The Nigerian government is
seeking a Standard and Poor’s credit rating.
13.
Since the 2004 Article IV consultation, Nigeria has made good progress in
implementing its structural reform agenda. This progress is summarized in Box 2. The
overall pace of privatization was, however, disappointing. To reenergize the privatization
process, the top management of the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) was replaced in
March 2005. The authorities also withstood pressures to reverse the liberalization of the
downstream petroleum sector. The NNPC did not, however, fully pass on the higher costs of
fuel products to the domestic market. It has covered these costs by cutting operating
expenses, including retrenching about 40 percent of its staff, and deferring payments on
imports of petroleum products and domestic crude oil purchases to its main international
suppliers and the government.7

6

External debt fell from 115 percent of exports in 2003 to 92 percent in 2004. Arrears to
Paris Club creditors amounted to US$5.7 billion at end-2004.
7

The extent of these costs will become clear with the release of the 2004 audited accounts of
NNPC later this year.

Box 2. Implementation of Structural Reforms, July 2004-March 2005
Governance and Transparency Reforms
•

As part of Nigeria’s commitment under EITI, an external auditor was selected in March
2005, for conducting the oil sector audits. The authorities have published what revenue was
distributed to the three tiers of government since 1999.

•

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has seized about US$700 million
in assets. Including indictments by the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission, about
100 high-level public officials are being investigated for economic crimes and corruption.

•

In early 2005, two ministers were dismissed and a high-level parliamentarian was forced to
resign over corruption allegations.

•

The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) computerized its land records, uncovered forgery of
certificates of occupancy, and is validating more than 50,000 plot allocations made over the
past two decades.

Civil Service Reform
•
Monetization of in-kind benefits, restructuring of pilot ministries, the NNPC, and CBN led
to the retrenchment of 17,000 employees and elimination of 5,000 ghost workers.
•
Pilot ministries have completed payroll surveys, assessed skills needs and moved to
retraining and retrenchment. Core ministries (education, health, power, works) have taken
initial steps to follow.
Tax and Customs Administration Reform
•
The Federal Inland Revenue Service has been restructured along functional lines to provide
integrated taxpayer services, enhance tax collection and audit functions.
•
One-third of customs administration’s management was replaced. A three-year reform
program has been launched to enhance customs’ efficiency.
Pension Reform
•
The authorities replaced the pay-as-you-go pension system by a contributory, fully funded
pension system.
Public Expenditure Reforms
•
Capital planning has been integrated into the MoF, a new chart of accounts was introduced,
and line ministries’ capital accounts have been consolidated to a central capital account.
•
Due process units have been established in line ministries to strengthen capital budget
implementation. A new procurement bill has been sent to parliament.
Deregulation and Privatization
•
A major power sector reform bill was signed into law in March 2005. A public-private
partnership bill has been submitted to parliament. An international company was awarded a
concession to manage Nigeria’s biggest port, the Apapa Port in Lagos, in March 2005.

- 13 -

14.
In July 2004, the CBN announced a major bank restructuring reform. The
minimum capital requirement will be increased from about US$15 million to US$190 million
at end-2005. The capitalization program is supported by measures to encourage bank
consolidation through mergers and acquisitions. As of March 2005, 22 banks have offered
shares to the public. Six of them have completed their share offerings, raising about N 86
billion. In addition, 11 groups, comprising 39 banks, have agreed to merge. The CBN also
announced reforms to address major weaknesses in banking supervision. In line with
recommendations made in the 2002 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) report, it
would adopt a policy of zero-tolerance toward violations of prudential regulations, aim to
move toward a risk-based supervisory framework, and strengthen supervision over nonbank
financial institutions. The CBN has requested technical assistance from the Monetary and
Financial Systems Department (MFD) on the design and implementation of certain elements
of its banking reform program.

III. MACROECONOMIC POLICIES FOR 2005
16.
After protracted negotiations between the executive and the national assembly,
President Obasanjo signed a highly expansionary 2005 appropriations bill into law on
April 12, 2005. It implies a 57 percent increase in federal primary spending compared with
2004, financed by higher oil revenue, the use of one half of the 2004 savings of the windfall
oil revenue, and projected sales of government assets and privatization receipts. The budget
reference oil price was raised from US$25 to US$30 per barrel.
17.
Full implementation of the appropriations act, along with the distribution of
higher oil revenue to the state and local governments, would lead to a sharp widening of
the consolidated non-oil primary deficit and could threaten macroeconomic stability.
The non-oil primary deficit could widen to 45 percent of non-oil GDP from 36 percent in
2004. The consolidated government would still record a sizable cash surplus at the oil price
of US$49.5 per barrel (March 2005 projections of the World Economic Outlook (WEO)).
However, the authorities indicated that they would scale back the spending increase in 2005
(see baseline scenario below).
18.
The sharp spending increase in the federal budget reflects primarily the
government’s desire to address the country’s vast development requirements, consistent

- 14 -

with NEEDS. The budget’s focus is on removing the existing structural impediments to
growth and poverty reduction and on funding public expenditure reform programs. Its goals
are to (i) attain the government’s universal primary education target and health-related
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), (ii) complete existing road and electricity projects,
(iii) fund the new pension system, and (iv) improve internal security. The budget also
allocates funds for the clearance of outstanding domestic contractor arrears and the
recapitalization of three development banks.
19.
In early February, the CBN announced that it was revising its monetary
framework for 2005. It would limit the fluctuation of the naira to a range of (+/-) 3 percent
against the U.S. dollar to anchor inflation expectations; immediately cut the minimum
rediscount rate (MRR) by 2 percentage points to 13 percent; and begin to review, on a
quarterly basis, the appropriateness of the MRR in view of developments in inflation. In line
with staff’s recommendations, the statutory limit on the federal government’s overdraft
account has been lowered from 12½ percent of current projected revenue to 5 percent.
IV. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
20.
The focus of this year’s consultation discussions was twofold: (i) the management
of short-term risks stemming from the expansionary fiscal stance and the bank consolidation
program; and (ii) Nigeria’s medium-term prospects and the government’s reform priorities to
accelerate growth and poverty reduction. The discussions of the government’s reforms
centered on four main themes: how to solidify progress made on macroeconomic stability;
how to strengthen public expenditure management to ensure public spending is pro-poor and
pro-growth; how to significantly lower the cost of doing business and boost productivity and
external competitiveness; and how to upgrade public sector governance, tackle deep-rooted
corruption, and secure property rights.8
A. Economic Outlook and Vulnerabilities
21.
Staff broadly shared the authorities’ positive outlook for 2005. Real GDP is
projected to grow by 3½ percent. Crude oil and gas GDP would remain almost constant. The
non-oil economy would grow by 5 percent as a result of higher infrastructure spending, new
investment commitments, and policies aimed at accelerating agricultural output.9 End-year
inflation is expected to be contained to a range of 12-15 percent, above the authorities’ initial
target range (7-9 percent). Tight monetary policy, and the stable exchange rate, should help
dampen inflationary pressures in spite of the fiscal expansion. However, some crowding out
of private sector demand is likely to occur, with the ratio of the latter to non-oil GDP falling
8

The accompanying selected issues paper discusses a few of these issues, including pension
reform, the appropriate level of liquidity reserves, trade reform, and obstacles to growth.

All three tiers of government have launched initiatives aimed at promoting agricultural
production and facilitating market and credit access.

further. Given the favorable terms of trade, the external current account surplus is expected to
widen, despite higher import demand, and gross international reserves to increase by about
US$11.5 billion to US$28.5 billion at end-2005 (equivalent to 10 months of imports of goods
and services).

and progress significantly on structural reforms. Staff emphasized that to deliver higher
sustained growth in key labor-intensive sectors, reforms were necessary to significantly boost
productivity, address distortions, and allocate resources more efficiently. It pointed out that
various studies confirmed Nigeria’s difficult business environment, identifying poor
infrastructure, excessive and costly regulations, limited access to credit, and policy

uncertainty as major obstacles to growth.10 To this end, staff welcomed the authorities’
comprehensive reform program aimed at tackling corruption in public institutions, improving
infrastructure, strengthening the financial system, unifying the foreign exchange markets,
liberalizing trade, and enhancing the efficiency of customs and tax administration. In staff’s
view, these pro-growth and export-oriented reforms, along with prudent fiscal, exchange rate
and monetary management, will boost external competitiveness over the medium term and
offset any real exchange rate appreciation that may ensue in 2005 as a result of higher oil
prices and the expansionary fiscal stance. Staff considers the current level of the exchange
rate to be broadly appropriate, as evidenced by the narrow spread between the official and
parallel exchange rate, robust growth in non-oil GDP and relative stability in the real
exchange rate despite the sharp terms of trade improvement.
24.
In this context, staff presented its medium-term macroeconomic framework
under a range of scenarios, illustrating the economy’s vulnerability to an expansionary
fiscal stance, lower oil prices, and policy slippages. In the staff’s baseline scenario, the
non-oil economy grows at 5-5½ percent a year, benefiting from growth-oriented and
business-friendly policies and improvements in the investment climate. The main growth
drivers are expected to be agriculture, light manufacturing, solid minerals, and services.
Inflation is projected to decline to 3 percent by 2010, and the non-oil primary balance to
improve gradually as the authorities implement an oil price-based rule, limiting the budget
deficit to 1-2 percent of GDP at US$25 per barrel in constant 2002 U.S. dollars.11 Despite the
increase in public spending in 2005, the fiscal stance is consistent with maintaining oil and
gas wealth over the long run.12 Whereas the external current account worsens with declining
oil prices, the non-oil current account deficit narrows and net capital inflows increase,
reflecting the improved investment climate and external competitiveness.

10

According to the 2002 World Bank private sector assessment survey, manufacturing firms
considered inadequate infrastructure as their most severe business constraint in Nigeria; over
90 percent of firms surveyed provide their own power supply. The 2004 Africa
Competitiveness Report ranked Nigeria’s infrastructure second to last among 25 African
countries and third to last of 102 countries surveyed in the world.

11

This is consistent with the authorities’ deficit target of no more than 3 percent of GDP over
the medium term, including amortization of external debt in their definition.

12

Staff updated its analysis of long-run fiscal sustainability in a non-renewable resourcedependent economy (see IMF Country Report 03/60). In view of a higher oil price outlook, it
increased its estimate of the real long term reference oil price to US$25 per barrel in constant
2002 U.S. dollars. Staff also assumed higher proven and probable oil and gas reserves in line
with recent discoveries. A fiscal stance with a non-oil primary deficit of 37-41 percent of
non-oil GDP is consistent with maintaining real government wealth over the long term.

- 17 -

25.

The mission also presented two alternative scenarios:

•

The “high growth” scenario reflects the authorities’ aim to increase annual average
growth for the non-oil economy to 7-8 percent, the rate deemed necessary to produce
2 million new jobs a year, and achieve the poverty MDG. To accelerate growth
significantly, private investment would have to rise to about 25 percent of GDP from the
baseline scenario level of 13 percent, equivalent to about US$4-5 billion a year in
additional foreign savings. Faster reform implementation and productivity gains than
assumed in the baseline could significantly accelerate growth over time.

•

The “muddle through” scenario reflects domestic policy slippages, notably the failure to
implement a prudent

26.
Staff also discussed with the authorities the results of the debt sustainability
analysis (DSA) using the Bank-Fund template for low-income countries. The results
suggest that Nigeria’s external debt is sustainable at current and projected oil prices.
However, country-specific sensitivity analysis shows that the debt sustainability is highly
vulnerable to oil price shocks. An oil price shock of more than one half of a standard
deviation (equivalent to oil prices falling by more than US$4 per barrel compared with the
baseline scenario), and assuming unchanged fiscal policy, would render the external debt
unsustainable. In light of these vulnerabilities, staff reiterated the importance of sustained
commitment to reform implementation and a sound fiscal and public debt management
framework. This would help diversify the economy and cushion it against future oil price

- 18 -

shocks and to lower the public debt burden to a level more commensurate with the country’s
level of economic and financial market development.
27.
The authorities welcomed the development of the medium-term scenarios and
the DSA, but stated categorically that the “muddle-through” scenario was not an option
and that policy implementation would be consistent with the baseline scenario.
Nonetheless, they viewed the external debt burden as unsustainable given the country’s level
of development, vulnerability to oil sector shocks, and the substantial additional resources
necessary to attain the MDGs.13 They indicated that they were in discussions with their Paris
Club creditors about a possible agreement that would result in the clearing of external arrears
and a significant reduction in their external debt.
B. Fiscal Policy
28.
Staff expressed concern
about the significant relaxation
of fiscal policy as envisaged in
the 2005 appropriations act,
stressing that its full
implementation would entail
serious macroeconomic risks.
Moreover, staff reviewed the
authorities’ revenue projections,
expressing some concern over
what it believed to be an overly
optimistic projection for
petroleum profit taxes at the
budget reference oil price. Staff
also emphasized that distributing
the windfall oil revenue from
domestic crude oil sales, as
occurred in 2004, could greatly
increase subnational government
spending and jeopardize the

See Appendix III for an update of the DSA and the main findings of the World Bank DSA,
which builds on the IMF’s baseline scenario to include a higher level of public spending and
economic growth rate in order to achieve the MDGs. According to the World Bank,
achieving the MDGs under such a scenario would require about US$12½ billion in additional
resources per year and render public debt unsustainable. However, Bank staff viewed the
MDG cost estimates as preliminary and noted further refinement was needed, including
reviewing gains from redistributing current public spending toward pro-MDG programs and
activities.

- 19 -

disinflation objective. Staff also discussed the authorities’ strategy for clearing their arrears,
recommending that they undertake a proper inventory and due diligence of the stock of
domestic arrears and that the clearance strategy ensure equitable burden sharing. Finally, it
questioned whether such a considerable increase in public spending could be effectively
absorbed while getting value for money.
29.
The authorities agreed that full implementation of the 2005 appropriations act
entailed significant macroeconomic risks and reiterated their commitment to
implement a fiscal policy consistent with macroeconomic stability and the economy’s
absorptive capacity. They underscored, however, that higher spending was warranted given
the country’s enormous needs and the substantial increase in oil prices that had occurred. To
achieve a more prudent fiscal stance, the authorities stated that they would set aside the oil
revenue in excess of the budget reference oil price, including the windfall domestic crude oil
revenue, and distribute oil revenue to the three tiers of government on the basis of calculated
receipts at the reference oil price of US$30 per barrel. In addition, they would limit the
increase in primary spending to below 20 percent in real terms over 2004 by (i) executing
75 percent of the capital budget helped by the fact that the first quarter has lapsed and strictly
applying due process and procurement practices; (ii) containing overhead costs to 80 percent
of the budget; and (iii) revisiting the contractor arrears clearance strategy and holding off
payments on the budgeted amount until due diligence is completed.14
30.
On this basis, the consolidated government non-oil primary deficit would widen
by about 4½ percentage points to about 41 percent of non-oil GDP in 2005. Staff
welcomed this decision, which would reduce the pressure on domestic resources. However, it
noted that the authorities’ approach for containing spending, in the absence of a revision of
budget appropriations, carried risks and emphasized the need for discipline, policy
coordination and strong monitoring. Moreover, even the more limited spending plans
involved a considerable fiscal expansion and made monetary management more difficult,
with implications for the attainment of the authorities’ inflation target and for private sector
crowding out.15 Finally, the rapid increased in spending run the risk of causing spending
inefficiencies. The authorities indicated that the cash management committee and quarterly
fiscal programs together with the due process certification requirements will help ensure that
the lower spending limits are met. The authorities intend to publish a semi-annual budget
report, as in 2004.

14

Once due diligence is completed, the authorities indicated they would issue special bonds
with maturities of 3-10 years to clear arrears above a certain threshold and pay cash for the
rest.

15

Private sector non-oil demand is projected to rise by 2.3 percent in real terms in 2005, well
below the projected growth rate of non-oil GDP.

- 20 -

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
31.
The main challenge facing the CBN is to implement a credible monetary
framework that will lower inflation and keep it in a single digit over the medium term.
The expansionary fiscal stance in the face of an underdeveloped domestic money market and
unsound banks will challenge liquidity management in 2005.
32.
Staff discussed exchange rate policy and its consistency with the money targeting
framework. While maintaining an exchange rate band and targeting money seem feasible in
the short term, given Nigeria’s high foreign reserves and favorable projected oil prices, staff
emphasized that this would unnecessarily restrict the CBN’s ability to use the exchange rate
as a cushion against shocks. Furthermore, by lowering inflation sharply in 2004, the moneytargeting regime acquired credibility as a nominal anchor for inflation control. The
authorities clarified that the exchange rate band objective would be subordinated to the
money target should it turn out to be inconsistent and the exchange rate would be allowed to
adjust. They intended to continue with money targeting as their operational framework, but
to better understand factors affecting inflation, they would look at a broader range of
indicators, including developments in the exchange rate and foreign exchange demand and
supply.
33.
For 2005, the CBN’s monetary program targets 12-month base money growth of
11 percent and broad money growth of 15 percent. The CBN noted that it would still have
to sterilize some excess liquidity to meet the base money target. To achieve this, it will rely
on market-based monetary operations, including sales of treasury bills, CBN securities, and
foreign exchange consistent with the net international reserve target. It will also consider
shifting the deposits of nonfinancial public enterprises from commercial banks to the CBN.
34.
Staff welcomed the focus on monetary targets, but noted that it may be difficult
to keep inflation below 10 percent this year, in light of the price pressure that emerged
early this year and the fiscal expansion. Moreover, it recommended that the withdrawal of
public sector deposits be seen as a one-off operation, but cautioned that, given the ongoing
bank consolidation reforms, the withdrawal might neither be feasible nor desirable. Staff
reiterated the importance of allowing short-term interest rates to adjust to meet the monetary
targets, but agreed with the CBN officials that fiscal policy needed to be aligned with the
objectives of achieving macroeconomic stability to avoid placing an undue burden on
monetary and exchange rate policies.
35.
Staff also encouraged the CBN to consider more far-reaching reforms to
enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy with the aim of moving, once conditions
are right, toward an inflation-targeting regime. It emphasized that the CBN should
(i) phase out the government’s overdraft facility by end-2006; (ii) lengthen further the
maturity structure for treasury bills and fully withdraw from the primary treasury bill market;
(iii) expedite the introduction of the liquidity forecasting framework to enhance the
effectiveness of daily open market operations; (iv) adopt a proactive and forward-looking
framework, whereby monetary decisions are made in relation to expected developments in

- 21 -

money supply and inflation; and (v) improve its communication with the public, including
through frequent assessments of the monetary and inflation outlook.
D. Medium-Term Fiscal Reforms
36.
A primary challenge facing the government is to strengthen public expenditure
management (PEM) to ensure that spending is effective, efficient, and clearly linked to
the objectives of NEEDS. While substantial progress has been made to improve budget
formulation and overall expenditure control, staff pointed out that the current federal
government budget system still does not allow for adequate monitoring and tracking of
budgeted and actual outlays or for assessing their pro-poor and pro-growth content. To this
end, staff encouraged the authorities to further strengthen overall financial management by
increasing automation, moving more quickly to functional and program budget classification,
and developing an effective medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). Staff also called
for a public investment review, covering the capacity to assess, prioritize, and manage public
investment. It also recommended moving to a single treasury account, which should
strengthen cash control and improve budget transparency.
37.
Recognizing the
need to strengthen
PEM, the authorities
noted that they were
addressing several
shortcomings. They also
pointed out that several
state and local
governments are
strengthening their PEM
systems and aligning
their budgets with the
country’s development
requirements. This is an
important reform because
subnational governments
account for about
60 percent of the
consolidated
government’s non-oil
primary spending and
play an essential role in
working toward the
poverty MDGs.

Federal Government PEM Reforms

• Introduce functional budget classification on the basis of line ministries’ 2005
budget submissions using the new chart of accounts;

• Establish a special unit within the MOF to conduct cost/benefit analyses of
large investment projects;

• Undertake a fiscal module of a Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes (Fiscal ROSC) for assessing transparency of fiscal management
practices;
• Introduce a virtual poverty fund (VPF) to develop a poverty-reducing
expenditure tracking system with donor assistance;
• Roll out the Transactions Recording and Reporting System to all line
ministries to enhance budget automation;

• Plan to build on the success of the CCA and establish a single treasury
account;

• Build the 2006 budget process around a “top-down” MTEF. Major line
ministries will have to formulate their objectives in line with the NEEDS, and
link spending programs to these objectives within a medium-term framework.
Subnational Government PEM Reforms

• All states have committed to preparing their own development strategies—
State Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (SEEDS)—which
will be coordinated with NEEDS.

• Donors and the federal government have developed an incentive system with
matching grants based on measurable benchmarks to assess progress in
implementing SEEDS. Almost all states have agreed to be evaluated.

• The VPF will develop a strategy for close collaboration with SLGs;
• The MOF will extend training programs to 8 pilot states on cost/benefit
analysis of investment projects.

• One third of SLGs will introduce due process procedures similar to those in
the federal government.

- 22 -

38.
The authorities further noted that, as part of the PEM reforms, they planned to
roll out the civil service reforms to all federal line ministries and begin to restructure
the federal parastatals. Wages, which account for about 60 percent of recurrent
expenditure, are the main driver of cost, and there remains room for streamlining. Once the
core civil service has been restructured, the authorities plan to reform the more than 500
federal parastatals.16 The aim is to stop funding commercial parastatals, subject them to
independent audits and privatize them. Semicommercial entities (including universities) will
be required to undergo annual audits. Once the federal civil service is restructured, the
authorities will review civil service wages. Staff urged that automation of payroll and
personnel data be accelerated to enhance payroll transparency and strengthen expenditure
control.
39.
Another priority is to improve intergovernmental fiscal relations and clarify the
role of the executive and the legislature in the budget process. The authorities noted that
the Fiscal Responsibility Bill (FRB) would address these issues.17 Considerable time and
effort has been dedicated to educating various stakeholders of the importance of this bill. The
authorities indicated that incorporating comments made by stakeholders has delayed the
submission of the draft bill to the National Assembly, which is now expected around mid2005. The administration and outside observers feel that the bill will face difficulties because
states are concerned that it encroaches on their constitutional autonomy. As an alternative,
albeit less attractive, option, the authorities would limit its coverage to the federal
government while continuing to build support for the implementation of similar legislation at
the state and local government level.
40.
Finally, a major overhaul of tax administration and policy is underway. The
main goal is to broaden the tax base, make the budget less vulnerable to oil price shocks, and
address tax distortions. In line with international best practices, staff encouraged the
authorities to reform the value-added tax regime, including by expanding input credits, zero
rating non-oil exports, and introducing a registration threshold.
E. Banking Sector Reform
41.
Overall, the Nigerian banking system has not fostered financial stability nor
supported economic development. The presence of unsound banks with poor governance
practices, such as widespread insider lending, misreporting, and systemic underprovisioning,
has compromised the effectiveness of monetary policy, undermined public confidence, and
discouraged financial intermediation, savings, and investment.18
16

Including the federal parastatals, there are over a million civil service employees.

17

The FRB sets out transparency requirements, sanctions for noncompliance, guidelines for
budgetary practices, and a fiscal framework centered on an oil price-based rule.

18

The problems in the Nigerian banking system were discussed in the 2002 and 2004 Article
IV consultation reports, and in the 2002 FSAP.

- 23 -

42.
Staff supports the authorities’ objective to strengthen the banking system, but
stressed that the CBN’s strategy contains significant risks. Given concerns about balance
sheet weaknesses in the banking system and the likely difficulty a significant number of
banks will have in achieving the new minimum capital requirement, the strategy could lead
to a loss of confidence, exert pressure on the financial system, and, if not properly managed,
lead to high fiscal costs. The CBN officials believe that about 20 percent of banks,
accounting for 15 percent of banking sector assets, will probably not meet the new capital
requirement and that about 15-20 banks or groups of banks out of 89 banks will survive.19
The postconsolidation phase will also pose serious challenges to banking supervision,
because bigger banks will be looking for ways to achieve an acceptable return on the
additional capital, possibly leading them to expand into unduly risky activities.

19

The CBN noted that, to encourage strong banks to take over weak banks, it would write off
past overdraft loans (about 0.7 percent of GDP). The extent of the bank consolidation costs
are, however, not known in part because of weak reporting practices.

- 24 -

F. Foreign Exchange Reform
44.
Nigeria’s foreign exchange markets remain segmented and a source of
distortion. 20 The difference between the official DAS rate and other exchange rates gives
rise to a multiple currency practice (MCP) in the absence of a mechanism to ensure that
spreads between the official rate and the other rates do not exceed 2 percent at any given
time. The Dutch multiple price auction also gives rise to an MCP. Staff does not recommend
approval of these MCPs. In addition, Nigeria has certain exchange measures relating to
requirements to provide tax clearance certificates, a ceiling on travel allowances, restrictions
on family maintenance allowance, administrative and documentation requirements, and
import bans. At this time, staff has insufficient information to determine whether these
exchange measures give rise to exchange restrictions subject to approval under Article VIII
of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
45.
The authorities announced in early February 2005 that they would move to a
wholesale auction to unify the current retail DAS and the interbank market for foreign
exchange. The new system will be introduced in the first quarter of 2006, once bank
consolidation has been successfully completed and the conditions for the wholesale auction
are met. In discussions with staff, CBN officials expressed concern that moving faster would
seriously affect bank valuation, because not all banks would be allowed to participate as
authorized dealers and their exclusion could be perceived as a weakness. They were of the
view that it would be best to strengthen prudential regulations and put in place the necessary
information technology infrastructure to allow banking supervisors to monitor open positions
on a daily basis.
46.
Following extensive discussions with market participants, staff concurred with
the authorities that it would be prudent to introduce the wholesale auction system only
after banking consolidation was complete. Furthermore, given that the technical
preconditions for the wholesale auction system could not be met until September 2005, staff
agreed that the benefits of waiting until early 2006 outweighed the risks of introducing the
new framework earlier. MFD assisted the CBN in designing a detailed action plan to ensure
timely implementation of the foreign exchange market reform.
47.
Reducing the size and importance of the parallel market will require additional
reforms. To this end, staff welcomed the trade reform slated for July 2005, and encouraged
the authorities to streamline foreign exchange regulations, particularly by lowering banks’
documentation requirements, and ensuring that regulations were consistent with the new
framework.

20

There are two main markets for foreign exchange—the DAS and the interbank market.
There is also a bureau de change and the parallel market. Funds are not transferable between
the retail DAS and the interbank market.

- 25 -

G. Governance and Transparency Reforms
48.
Staff welcomed the significant progress Nigeria has made in tackling corruption
in the public sector and in advancing its commitment to the EITI. The government has
raised the profile of its anticorruption drive through the arrest and trial of high-level officials.
It is also undertaking public awareness campaigns, signaling that corruption in the public
sector is no longer tolerated. However, the authorities noted that the judicial system needed
to be reformed to enable it to handle high-profile corruption cases effectively. The approach
adopted to advance Nigeria’s commitments under the EITI has been centered on broad-based
stakeholder participation. Passage of an EITI bill, expected before end-2005, will provide the
legal basis for collecting and publishing oil revenue data. Furthermore, an independent
international firm will audit the oil and gas accounts of 1999-2004; the results are expected to
be made public before end-2005.
49.
Staff also welcomed Nigeria’s progress in strengthening its anti–money
laundering (AML) framework. Enforcement has been strengthened with the passage of the
amended AML Act, the establishment of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) within the
Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), and a doubling of the EFCC’s budget.
The CBN and the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation are cooperating in providing
sensitive banking data to the FIU. The authorities are hoping that these reforms will lead to
Nigeria’s removal from the Financial Action Task Force list of non-compliant countries.
H. Privatization
50.
The authorities are committed to accelerating the privatization program and
indicated that they had developed a realistic program for 2005. One aim is to accelerate
the liquidation of the nonviable companies and privatize about 30 companies. For 2005, the
BPE expects to complete the sales of an aluminum smelter company and the Nigeria
Telecom Company. Given the success of the concessioning of the Lagos Apapa Port, BPE
expects to concession the remaining ports more rapidly. Passage of a draft transportation bill
will allow for the emergence of new ports and the establishment of an independent regulatory
agency.
51.
The authorities further outlined their plan to restructure the Nigeria Electric
Power Agency (NEPA). With the power bill signed in early March 2005, the NEPA will be
unbundled into 17 companies (generation, transmission, and distribution), and a regulatory
commission will be established. The BPE also believes one refinery could be privatized in
2005. Staff, however, noted the difficulties of such an operation because of the uncertain
regulatory framework for petroleum product pricing, the refineries’ inefficiencies, and labor
issues.

- 26 -

I. Trade Reforms
52.
A major tariff reform is scheduled to take effect in July, 2005.21 The new tariff
system, which will be based on ECOWAS’ common external tariff (CET) has four tariff
bands (0, 5, 10, and 20 percent). A temporary 50 percent tariff band will be applied to
selected locally produced import-competing goods. Duty concessions will no longer be
granted. Import bans will be phased out by end-2006 and the 50 percent tariff band by end2007, respectively.
53.
The authorities believe that the tariff reform will enhance growth. The average
unweighted tariff will drop to below 20 percent from about 30 percent, the tariff structure
will be simplified, and the medium-term predictability of trade policies enhanced.
Furthermore, the reform will redress the antiexport bias in the current regime and diminish
incentives for smuggling and parallel market foreign exchange transactions.
54.
The authorities have introduced a three-year program to improve customs
administration. Administrative inefficiencies constitute a major trade barrier and have a
negative effect on investors’ perception of Nigeria. Recognizing this problem, the authorities
established a task force on customs reform in June 2004 and replaced management. The
program aims at lowering costs, expediting the movement of goods, and making customs
procedures more predictable and transparent. In addition, a separate revenue-collection plan
has been put in place. Customs restructuring together with port concessioning and the tariff
reform aim to reduce by 2007 the time needed to clear cargo from over 3 weeks to 48 hours.
J. Other Issues
55.
Staff reiterated the importance of improving the reliability and timeliness of
economic and social statistics to support the formulation and monitoring of
macroeconomic policies. Staff expressed concern over the limited progress made in
improving statistics—particularly with regard to government finances, balance of payment,
and national accounts—stressing that accurate, comprehensive and timely data are critical for
policy formulation and monitoring. The key problems are the lack of computerization and
automation, weak technical capacity and poor coordination among the main government
agencies responsible for gathering and disseminating data. As a matter of urgency, staff
called on the authorities to revamp the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) and to implement
the main recommendations of previous Statistics Department technical assistance reports for
strengthening quality and coverage of statistics.

21

The reforms were postponed from mid-2004 to mid-2005 in order to build consensus
within the private sector. Nigeria’s trade system has been among the most restrictive in
Africa (see accompanying selected issues paper).

- 27 -

56.
Staff emphasized that the Fund remains committed to helping build capacity in
Nigeria to support the NEEDS. The primary areas of focus are tax administration and
policy, public expenditure management, banking supervision, liquidity management, foreign
exchange market unification, and statistics. In general, technical assistance will need to
concentrate on those areas where the authorities have demonstrated a commitment to
effective implementation.
57.
The authorities have requested that the Fund support the implementation of
their reform program under a possible non-borrowing instrument if it becomes
operational.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
58.
Nigeria’s overall macroeconomic performance in 2004 under the authorities’
homegrown reform program was commendable and signaled a break from the
imprudent macroeconomic policies of the past. The authorities achieved their objectives,
namely to lower inflation, enhance predictability and transparency of policies, and reduce the
economy’s vulnerability to oil price shocks. Although the pace of privatization was
disappointing, the authorities also made important strides in improving transparency and
fighting corruption as well as in initiating ambitious structural reforms.
59.
Despite this progress, Nigeria continues to face formidable challenges. It suffers
from the legacy of decades of massive economic mismanagement, chronic neglect of social
service delivery and infrastructure, and a disregard for market-based institutions.
Furthermore, the reforms still meet resistance from entrenched interests.
60.
Nevertheless, Nigeria now has an opportunity to carry out difficult reforms that
could considerably enhance its medium-term prospects for more rapid and sustainable
growth. Indeed, its 2004 performance, the improved outlook for its economy, relative
political stability, and the strong reform commitment of the president and his team provide a
unique opportunity to deepen and broaden the reform process and make it difficult to reverse.
61.
Nigeria’s main policy challenge will be to build on the progress it made in 2004
and broaden the reform agenda. Macroeconomic policies will need to be consistent with
the objectives of fiscal prudence and fostering an environment conducive to investment and
sustainable economic growth. The government must continue to deepen fiscal reforms to
ensure more transparent, predictable, and effective use of public resources at all levels of
government. Structural reforms are also required to lower the cost of doing business in
Nigeria and to bolster external competitiveness.
62.
The administration recognizes the substantial risks posed by the 2005
appropriations act. Nevertheless, fiscal policy will remain expansionary and will involve
significant challenges. First, keeping fiscal development in line with the government target
will necessitate a high degree of coordination and careful monitoring. Second, the pressure
on domestic resources from the wider non-oil fiscal deficit will complicate the management

- 28 -

of monetary policy, with the authorities’ inflation target likely to be exceeded and possibly
some crowding out. Third, there is a risk that the increase in public spending will lead to
bottlenecks and spending inefficiencies.
63.
A pressing challenge is to strengthen public expenditure management to ensure
that public spending helps achieve the NEEDS objectives and the MDGs. Recent PEM
reforms have resulted in some improvement in the effectiveness of public spending, but a
great deal more is needed to improve public services. Staff welcomes the creation of the
virtual poverty fund and the cost-benefit analysis unit for large investment projects, but calls
on the authorities to expeditiously introduce budget classification systems that will allow it to
track poverty-alleviating spending. Subnational governments should be encouraged to
undergo similar reforms.
64.
In this context, the Fiscal Responsibility Bill is of critical importance. The bill’s
passage and full implementation would markedly enhance fiscal transparency and
accountability at all levels of government, introduce formal fiscal rules into the budget
process, and lay the foundation for medium-term fiscal sustainability.
65.
In light of the envisaged fiscal expansion, more of the burden of controlling
inflation will fall on the central bank. Given the sharp increase in monetary aggregates in
early 2005, staff calls on the CBN to take prompt action to limit broad money growth. Staff
encourages the CBN to use market-based instruments to sterilize excess liquidity. For
sterilization operations to be effective, short-term interest rates and the exchange rate should
be allowed to adjust as needed to meet the monetary targets. In this context, staff welcomes
the lowering of the statutory limit on the federal government’s overdraft account, notes
progress in relying more on indirect instruments for liquidity management, and encourages
the CBN to consider more far-reaching reforms to enhance the effectiveness of monetary
policy.
66.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to continue with money targeting as the
operational framework for anchoring inflationary expectations. Staff considers that
moving to a narrow exchange rate band is very much a second-best option to continuing with
money targeting as a means of anchoring inflation expectations. By lowering sharply
inflation in 2004, the money targeting regime has acquired credibility as nominal anchor. A
market-based exchange rate regime will allow the CBN flexibility to respond to shocks. Staff
recommends that the CBN move, once conditions are right, to an inflation-targeting regime.
67.
While staff recognizes that bank consolidation is intended to increase the
soundness of the banking system, the CBN’s strategy carries significant risks. As a
matter of urgency, staff calls on the CBN to set up a high-level steering committee, develop a
strategic plan to deal with failing banks, strengthen its legal powers to close failing banks,
and enhance banking supervision. It further calls on the authorities to ensure that sound
accounting standards are applied in valuing banks’ assets and to advance the legal processes
for establishing asset management companies to minimize budgetary costs.

- 29 -

68.
Staff welcomes the CBN’s commitment to introduce a daily wholesale auction
for foreign exchange management in early 2006. It calls on the CBN to state this
commitment publicly and put in place the necessary infrastructure and implementing
regulations, consistent with its action plan. It further urges the authorities to streamline
current foreign exchange regulations and work toward accepting the obligations of
Article VIII.
69.
Staff agrees with the priorities of the authorities’ structural reform agenda. The
agenda is ambitious and is appropriately focused on improving governance and transparency,
enhancing public service delivery, streamlining the role of the government in the economy,
and improving the business environment. Implementation of these reforms should help
stimulate broad-based economic growth and sustained poverty reduction. Staff supports plans
to institutionalize reforms through legislative initiatives. It also welcomes the revamping of
the BPE and agrees with the ambitious agenda for privatization. Staff also agrees with the
authorities’ emphasis on broad-based participation in advancing the country’s commitment to
improve transparency in the oil and gas sector under EITI.
70.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ tariff reforms scheduled to go into effect in July
2005. The reforms should reduce distortions and rent-seeking. While also welcoming the
authorities’ intention to phase out all import bans by end-2006 and fully adopt ECOWAS’
Common External Tariff by end-2007, staff recommends that the authorities consider
accelerating the timetable for the implementation of these two reforms.
71.
Staff calls on the authorities to regularize relations with its external creditors
and pursue options that are mutually agreeable. Regarding the authorities’ strategy for
clearing domestic expenditure arrears, it suggests that high importance be accorded to
verification and equitable burden sharing.
72.
Staff stresses the importance of improving the reliability and timeliness of
economic statistics to support the formulation and monitoring of macroeconomic and
social policies. While progress has been made in some areas, the authorities need to address
ongoing weaknesses. There are serious deficiencies in data availability, reliability, and
coverage. Staff calls on the authorities to revamp the FOS as a matter of urgency and
reiterates that Nigeria needs to provide key economic data monthly for intensified
surveillance.
73.
The staff believes the enhanced policy dialogue and monitoring of policy
implementation under intensified surveillance has served Nigeria well during 2004, and
is ready to continue with a close policy dialogue.

- 30 -

74.
The Fund remains committed to helping build capacity in Nigeria to support the
NEEDS. Key areas of possible future technical assistance are tax administration and policy,
public expenditure management, banking supervision, liquidity management, foreign
exchange market unification, and the quality of statistics.
75.
It is expected that Nigeria’s next Article IV consultation will take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ State and local governments collect their own revenue (such as income tax and property tax).
2/ External debt service is on a commitment basis. Capital spending for 2002 excludes the cash overhang
of N 160 billion accumulated in 2001.
3/ This reflects the drawdown of unspent capital mandates to finance capital expenditure committed in
previous years. Insufficient data prevent the inclusion of actual commitments in 2000-01.
4/ Excluding oil revenue, cash call payments, and interest payments.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Nigeria’s current exchange rate arrangement is classified in the Fund’s Annual Report on
Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions as a managed float with no
preannounced target for the exchange rate of the naira. The inter-bank foreign exchange
market is segmented into two sub-markets. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sells foreign
exchange to legitimate end-users through banks that bid, with requests having to be

APPENDIX I

supported by the required documentation. The open Nigerian inter-bank market (NIFEX) is
the market for foreign exchange obtained from other sources than the CBN, including nonoil exports and personal transfers, and the NIFEX rate is freely negotiable among
commercial banks as well as among customers. On February 20, 2001, the CBN issued a
circular which forbid banks from transferring funds obtained from the CBN to other banks
through the NIFEX, effectively segmenting the two markets. On July 22, 2002, the
authorities adopted the Dutch Auction System (DAS) for selling official foreign exchange
to end-users. The DAS is a sealed-bid multiple price auction system with the marginal rate
being the rate that clears the market. Auctions take place twice a week and the CBN
announces the amount on offer the day before the auction and the auction results the day
after. Funds purchased from the CBN shall be used for eligible transactions only, subject to
stipulated documentation requirements. Such funds are not transferable in the inter-bank
foreign exchange market.
Currently, there are four exchange rates: the DAS auction rate, the NIFEX rate quoted by a
group of commercial banks, the Bureaux de change rate, and the parallel market rate.
The following exchange rates were quoted on April 15, 2005:
IFEM/DAS
US$1 = N132.9.
NIFEX
US$1 = N131.5.
Bureaux de change/parallel market US$1 = N139.0.
The exchange rate for the SDR on April 15, 2005 was N193.5 = SDR 1.
VIII. Article IV Consultation
Nigeria is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The last Article IV
consultation discussions were held in Lagos and Abuja during the period March 23-April 8
and May 12-19, 2004. The staff report (IMF Country Report No. 04/239) was discussed by
the Executive Board and the consultation concluded on July 16, 2004.

APPENDIX II

Nigeria: Relations with the World Bank Group
Partnership for Development
1.
The second administration of President Obasanjo has provided a much improved
environment and framework for development assistance and effectiveness. A homegrown
poverty reduction strategy, The National Economic Empowerment and Development
Strategy (NEEDS) has been prepared and is being implemented at the federal level, in
parallel with State Economic Empowerment and Development Strategies (SEEDS). The
NEEDS/SEEDS framework include a comprehensive program of reforms aimed at the
economic and social transformation of Nigeria.
2.
In June 2004, the Board approved a Second Interim Strategy Progress Report which
endorsed an expanded World Bank engagement in Nigeria and in particular, a move from the
low case lending envelope of $200 million annually to the base case of $500 million on
average per annum. This strategy continued to focus on three main pillars: (i) improving
economic governance (ii) promoting accelerated private sector led growth, particularly in the
non-oil economy, and (iii) empowering communities to take an active role in their own
development.
3.
Presently, work has reached an advanced stage in the development of a joint World
Bank/DFID Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), that will guide the Bank’s and UK DFID’s
assistance to Nigeria for the next four year (FY06 to FY09). This strategy is being prepared
in a participatory manner with the involvement of government, civil society, private sector
and other development partners. It will support selected priorities under the three broad
pillars of the NEEDS/SEEDS framework namely: (i) empowering people through improved
service delivery for human development; (ii) promoting private enterprise through improved
business environment for non-oil growth and improved access to productive infrastructure;
and (iii) changing the way government does its work through improved transparency and
accountability.
4.
The CPS proposes a deepened engagement between the World Bank/DFID and
Nigeria through a larger lending envelope targeted towards accelerating growth and
achieving the MDGs. This proposed deeper engagement is motivated by the good policy
environment and the importance of Nigeria for meeting the MDGs in Africa. The Bank and
DFID will also be more selective, concentrating their assistance on supporting activities at
the Federal level and in a set of lead states, which are showing strong commitment to
economic and governance reforms.
World Bank-IMF relations
5.
The IMF and World Bank staffs maintain a close collaborative relationship on
Nigeria. Both institutions are coordinating their policy advice to the government in several
different areas through collaboration on analytical work, and through joint technical

- 52 -

APPENDIX II

assistance missions. The Bank staff is regularly invited to join IMF macroeconomic missions,
and both are members of a multi-donor thematic group on economic governance that seeks to
coordinate donor advice and work in this area.
6.
In September 2003, at the request of the Nigerian government, the Bank and the IMF
carried out a joint technical assistance mission for the Budget Office. A similar joint mission
to advise government on the proposed Pension Reform Bill was carried out in
November 2003. The Bank and the IMF have recently collaborated on the preparation of a
Debt Sustainability Analysis for Nigeria.
Lending Activities
7.
The World Bank’s portfolio in Nigeria has been on the increase; growing from about
$911 million in FY03 to about $1.2 billion in FY04 and currently (FY05) stands at about
$1.5 billion. As at March 31, 2005 about $247 million has been disbursed out of this total
commitment. The portfolio is being re-structured to ensure that implementation and impact
are improved. This effort includes simplifying Bank processes and providing greater
implementation flexibility.
8.
Currently, the Bank’s lending program in Nigeria comprises sixteen projects covering
activities in various sectors of the economy: Health (18 percent ), Education (7 percent),
Private Sector Development (10 percent), Urban Development (8 percent), Rural Sector
(12 percent); Transport (7 percent) Energy & Mining (8 percent) Social Development/Social
Protection (4 percent), Economic Policy (11 percent), Power (7 percent) and Water Supply &
Sanitation (8 percent). The mainstreaming of cross-cutting issues like environment,
HIV/AIDS, gender and conflict etc. into all Bank projects has remained a priority.
Non-lending Activities
9.
The World Bank has continued to engage in rigorous analytical works and placed
increased emphasis on policy dialogue. These non-lending activities have been very
supportive of the Bank’s lending program. Previous work has focused on public expenditure
management through public expenditure reviews at both federal and state levels, a report on
state finances, and a report on the states’ governance and capacity. Others include pension
reform dialogue, procurement reform, anticorruption and sub-national debt management,
which benefited immensely from the collaboration with the Debt Management Office.
During the CPS period, new work will be started to broaden the knowledge base especially at
the state level, and support the implementation of the huge lending program proposed in the
CPS. Key analytical work includes Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability Report (FY06), Country Economic Memorandum on Competitiveness and
Growth (FY06), Poverty Assessment (FY05/06), Agricultural Sector Review (FY06), EITI
Management/Gas and Oil Sector Policy.

- 53 -

APPENDIX II

International Finance Corporation (IFC) Activities
10.
Nigeria is IFC’s largest country portfolio in Africa with US$289 million committed
with activities in various sectors including finance and insurance; oil, gas and mining; and
private equity funds. IFC continues to encourage and support Small and Medium Enterprises
(SMEs), and invests in private sector development, including the banking industry and
infrastructure.
11.
IFC also seeks to promote projects that will assist Nigeria in diversifying its economy
from the oil sector and removing bottlenecks faced by the non-oil private sector. IFC
activities include:
12.
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs): IFC provides a broad range of financing and
technical support to small businesses in Nigeria. Jointly with UNIDO, support was provided
to NGOs (the FATE Foundation and the Onitsha/Nnewi/Aba Cluster program) through the
Support Training Entrepreneurship Program (STEP), which provides business development
services to micro enterprises. Other initiatives include a financing and capacity-building
facility for small-scale oil service companies in the Niger Delta region. A comprehensive
program with support from the World Bank is also being designed to provide additional
support for small business access to finance, business development services and for help in
improving the SME business environment.
13.
Telecommunications Sector: In FY02 IFC approved an investment of $100 million for
MTN Nigeria, a large mobile telecommunication company, for the expansion of its
nationwide GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) cellular telecommunications
network in Nigeria, and by February 2006, the company expects to have well in excess of
15 million subscribers in accordance with its license requirements. IFC is playing the role of
fostering competition, supporting private sector development, and improving the
telecommunications market and services.
14.
Financial Sector: Since scaling up of IFC operations began in 1999–2000, IFC has
worked with seven commercial banks, extending term facilities totaling over $160 million.
With no long-term funding options available in Nigeria, banks have used the IFC credits to
offer medium-term financing to a range of clients in expanding their businesses. IFC is
expanding this relationship with leading banks to support more small business financing
options, and also to build the nascent corporate bond market.
World Bank Institute activities (WBI)
15.
Nigeria is one of the WBI’s six focus countries in Africa. The number of Nigerian
participants in WBI programs has significantly increased in the last two years (from
280 participants in FY01, to 1,600 in FY04). The sharp increase in the number of participants
was due to the increased use of Distance Learning as a delivery mode and the larger number
of events held locally. The professional groups and communities of practice that took the
fullest advantage of WBI programs were public expenditure managers, individuals involved

- 54 -

APPENDIX II

in social protection/social risk management programs, parliamentarians, and journalists. This
concentration of efforts is in line with the World Bank’s strategy to help Nigeria manage its
public resources and help strengthen the voice of the poor at the community level. However,
irrespective of the well-targeted WBI assistance, it is unlikely to make a lasting impact on
capacity, if the Institute does not adequately leverage its efforts with those of the Africa
Region and other development partners. For this reason, the Institute is taking steps to
increase its involvement in the context of the WBI Country Program Brief endorsed by the
Nigeria Country Team. Thematically, in coming years, the WBI program will be more
focused on developing the capacity of members of the civil society working to make their
voices heard and forge a national consensus. For this reason, the Institute is carrying out a
major effort to identify capacity building needs at the community level through the Capacity
Enhancement Needs Assessment (CENA) methodology. The pursuit of the World Bank’s
strategic objectives has also led to a better integration of WBI staff into the Nigeria Country
Team and IDA project teams.
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
16.
MIGA has continued to increase its involvement in the promotion of foreign direct
investment in Nigeria by offering guarantees against non-commercial risks to foreign
investors, providing technical assistance to the Nigerian Investment Promotion Council
(NIPC) in investment promotions and the provision of investment information services.
MIGA has issued guarantees to investors in different sectors (service, manufacturing and
infrastructure etc.) of the Nigerian economy totaling about $130 million in exposure. The
major stakes of MIGA in Nigeria has been in the telecommunication sector, where it has
issued guarantees worth about $60 million to both Econet Wireless Limited ($10 million) and
MTN International Limited ($50 million) for their investments in the installation, operation
and maintenance of a country-wide mobile telephone network based on GSM technology.

APPENDIX III

Nigeria: External and Public Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
1.
This appendix assesses the sustainability of Nigeria’s external and public debt under
the staff’s baseline scenario and a number of standardized shocks in the low-income country
(LIC) DSA framework. It also examines the implications for debt sustainability of alternative
oil price assumptions.
A. The Baseline Scenario
2.
The baseline scenario for 2005-25 underlying this DSA incorporates the following
assumptions:
•

Growth will average 5 percent reflecting buoyant growth in non-oil GDP of around
5½ percent, as agriculture and light manufacturing respond favorably to the marketoriented reforms, and modest growth of oil GDP of 3½ percent.

•

Monetary policy is geared toward achieving the government’s objective of lowering
inflation to 3 percent by 2010 and remaining at that level thereafter.

•

The CPI-based real effective exchange rate increases significantly in 2005 and remains
constant thereafter.

•

Oil prices average US$49.5 per barrel in 2005, decline gradually to US$35 per barrel in
2019 and remain constant in real terms in the outer years, growing at about 2 percent per
annum in nominal terms.22

•

Fiscal policy leads to a non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) of 41 percent of non-oil GDP in
2005-06, and around 40 percent in 2007-15. Thereafter, the fiscal deficit is gradually
lowered to 31 percent of non-oil GDP by 2025 in order to limit the overall deficit to less
than 5 percent of GDP.

•

With the favorable outlook for oil prices and the assumed fiscal stance, the balance of
payments over the medium-term will remain comfortably in surplus resulting in a
significant build-up of gross international reserves.
B. External Sustainability

3.
With the favorable external outlook and policies implemented along the lines
described above, the nominal external debt burden falls from 50 percent of GDP in 2004 to
below 40 percent in 2005 and to close to 20 percent in 2025 (Table 1).

22

This is consistent with information available on future oil market prices at the time the
discussions with the Nigerian authorities took place.

- 60 -

APPENDIX III

4.
The grant element of Nigeria’s external debt is insignificant as most debt is
contracted on commercial terms. Over the medium term, the share of concessional credits
will increase, but so will arrears and the grant element is not projected to significantly
improve. As such, the NPV-of-debt-to-GDP ratio and the nominal external-debt-to-GDP ratio
do not diverge by much over the medium term. The NPV-of-debt-to-GDP ratio falls from
48 percent in 2004 to 39 percent in 2005, to below 30 percent in 2010, and to below
20 percent by end-2025.
5.
Standard stress tests and alternative scenarios (excluding the country specific oil price
shock scenarios, see below) show that the external debt burden would lessen over the
medium term (Table 2). However, the most severe short-term impact, with external debt
peaking at 50 percent in 2007, would occur if growth in the U.S. dollar GDP deflator in
2006-07 was one standard deviation less than the historical average.
C. External Debt Sustainability Limits
6.
In the World Bank’s preliminary Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)
for 2004, Nigeria is rated a “2.8.” Given this relatively weak policy performance23 the
relevant external debt sustainability thresholds for Nigeria are NPV of debt in percent of
exports, government revenues, and GDP of 100, 200, and 30, respectively, and debt service
ratio thresholds of 15 percent of exports and 25 percent of government revenues. Whereas
Nigeria’s debt and debt service are well below the four exports- and revenue-related
thresholds, the NPV-of-debt-to-GDP ratio at end-2004 was 48 percent and that ratio is not
expected to fall to below 30 percent until towards the end of the decade.
7.
The thresholds, of course, are not rigid ceilings and they should only be seen as
guideposts for informing the DSA; nonetheless the DSA suggests that Nigeria should
approach new borrowing very carefully in the immediate period ahead.
D. Fiscal Sustainability
8.
The baseline scenario assumes that domestic arrears are eliminated in 2006 through
the issuance of N500 billion in domestic securities. In the early part of the projection period,
high oil prices and a stable non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) at around 40 percent of non-oil
GDP up to 2015, allows for a significant accumulation of financial assets at the central bank,
with the deposits of the consolidated government exceeding US$60 billion by end-2015.
These, however, are gradually drawn down as oil prices fall and the overall budget surplus
turns to a deficit by 2021. Notwithstanding, the NPV-of-public-sector-gross-debt burden falls

23

In the LIC DSA framework, countries are considered weak performers if their CPIA rating
is less than or equal to 3.25. The CPIA scale goes from “1: Very weak” over “3: Moderately
weak” to “6: Very strong”. For further details please visit
http://siteresources.worldbank.org/IDA/Resources/CPIA2004questionnaire.pdf.

APPENDIX III

over the medium term, from 63 percent of GDP in 2004 to 48 percent in 2005 and to below
40 percent from 2010 onwards (Table 3).
9.
As is the case with external sustainability, the fiscal sustainability baseline is
relatively robust to the standard stress tests and alternative scenarios (Table 4). In the
baseline, the NPV-of-debt-to-GDP ratio falls gradually from 51 percent in 2005 to 39 percent
in 2010, but it would jump to 72 percent in 2007 if the primary balance was at the historical
average minus one standard deviation in 2006-07.
E. Country-Specific Alternative Scenarios
10.
Past economic experience suggests that Nigeria’s economy is highly vulnerable to
developments in the oil sector. In 2004, oil revenue accounted for 80 percent of the
consolidated government’s revenue base and oil–related export proceeds for over 90 percent
of Nigeria’s total export earnings. In light of the large dependency on oil as well as the high
level of oil prices projected over the medium term relative to the historical average price,
country-specific alternative scenarios were developed to examine the robustness of the DSA
results to an oil price shock. The Nigerian authorities are pursuing discussions for debt relief
from Paris Club creditors, and this section therefore also looks at the sustainability of
Nigeria’s debt under different debt reduction scenarios.
11.
In the baseline projection, high oil prices over the medium term would allow Nigeria
to build considerable reserves that could be used to finance fiscal deficits later on when oil
prices fall back to their historical averages. The sensitivity analysis shows that already with a
negative oil price shock of US$6 per barrel, under unchanged fiscal policies, the reserves
cushion would be exhausted by 2018, and additional financing would be needed to cover
fiscal deficits. Additional borrowing would then quickly lead to Nigeria’s debt becoming
unsustainable.
12.


24

The following assumptions were used:
The baseline projection for oil prices has a mean of US$32 per barrel (in constant 2002
U.S. dollars), or about one standard deviation above the historical average.24 This section
reports on sensitivity analyses with negative oil price shocks of US$6 and US$8 per
barrel. The price reductions in the scenarios are permanent in constant U.S. dollar terms
from 2006 onwards.

Nigeria’s oil is sold at prices that are very close to the Brent marker crude prices in the
international oil market. Since it began trading in 1976, Brent crude traded at an average
price of US$23.6 (in constant 2002 U.S. dollars), the median price was US$20.2, and prices
fell in a range between US$12.7 and US$46.2. The standard deviation was US$8.8.

- 62 -

APPENDIX III



The alternative scenarios differ only in terms of assumptions about oil prices and the
stock of debt at end-2005; other parameters, including fiscal policy, are left unchanged
from the baseline scenario.



Fiscal financing gaps are covered with new concessional loans (IDA conditions).

13.


Under these assumptions, the sensitivity analyses show the following:
A permanent reduction of oil prices by US$6 or US$8 per barrel would lead to quickly
rising debt ratios from 2018 onwards. The debt ratio would increase above the
sustainability threshold (NPV of debt to GDP of 30 percent) by 2022.
F. World Bank MDG-related DSA

14.
The World Bank assessed Nigeria’s debt sustainability in a scenario with additional
spending measures needed for Nigeria to achieve the MDGs. In the Bank’s MDG scenario,
higher spending results in higher growth and real exchange rate appreciation compared to the
Fund's baseline. Financing the spending needed to achieve the MDGs would raise public debt
to the threshold of 60 percent of GDP by 2012. A rapidly rising fiscal gap would emerge
thereafter and its financing would have a net present value well above Nigeria's current debt
stock. Scenarios in which oil price assumptions are weaker than in the baseline would yield
less favorable public debt dynamics. Bank staff viewed the MDG cost estimates as
preliminary and recognized that they needed further refinement.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.
7/ Permanent reduction in oil prices.

APPENDIX IV

Nigeria: Statistical Issues
1.
Nigeria’s statistical base continues to suffer from serious deficiencies that hamper
surveillance, policy design, and monitoring. These deficiencies are across the board, but
particularly affect the national accounts, government finance, money and banking, and the
external accounts, including major inconsistencies between balance of payments and customs
data on trade. Numerous problems prevent the compilation of timely and internally consistent
data, in particular lack of data sharing between data producing and collecting agencies, and
insufficient use of computerization in the compilation of statistics. In addition, the 1957
Statistical Act no longer addresses the requirements of data collection and dissemination
within a federal structure. The authorities recognize these problems, and intend to address
them as part of NEEDS. In April 2003, Nigeria began participation in the Fund’s General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS), and posted its metadata on the Fund’s dissemination
standards bulletin board (DSBB).
National accounts
2.
Annual national accounts statistics are published by the Federal Office of Statistics
(FOS) with about a one-year lag. The national accounts statistics are of poor quality, largely
owing to a deterioration in business and household surveys. Estimates of value added for
agriculture, mining (oil), industry, transportation, and financial and other services are based
on old surveys with extrapolations that use out-of-date ratios and other indicators. Many
sectoral deflators are not soundly based and have a number of inconsistencies. In the past, the
use of the official exchange rate has resulted in a gross understatement of value added in the
oil and export sectors. The expenditure accounts suffer from unreliable external trade and
government budgetary data.
3.
A July 2003 mission to help the authorities implement the GDDS recommendations
in the area of National Accounts and provide guidance on institutional reforms in the
statistical system, found that progress has been made and that the authorities were receiving
significant technical assistance from DfID and others such as the World Bank. Together with
donor help the authorities have developed a master plan. Results of a 2003 household living
standards survey are now available. The base year has been updated to 1990 from 1984 to
better reflects the economic structure of the economy.
Prices
4.
The official monthly consumer price index (CPI) is a composite of urban and rural
price data, and the consumption weights are based on the 1985–86 National Consumer
Survey. Some data on producer prices are collected, but these statistics are not
comprehensive and no producer price index is compiled. As a consequence, some sectoral
GDP deflator indices are based not on producer prices, but on consumer price subindices and
ad hoc assumptions. Expenditure deflators also suffer from methodological shortcomings.
There are short term plans to update the weighting to 1996/97 using a National Consumer
Survey.

- 70 -

APPENDIX IV

Government finance
5.
Fiscal data in Nigeria have historically been opaque and complicated not only by the
federal structure, but also by a multiplicity of off-budget funds and by accounting practices
that underestimate the actual size of public expenditure. The multisector statistics mission
that visited Nigeria during September 6-21, 1999 noted that the most pressing shortcomings
related to inadequate data coverage, the lack of monthly and quarterly compilation, and
timeliness.
6.
A government finance statistics (GFS) mission in early 2001 found that authorities
had implemented few of the recommendations made by the multisector statistics mission that
visited Nigeria in 1999. Following the creation of a National Committee on Government
Finance Statistics (NCGFS), another GFS mission visited Abuja in March 2002 and found no
further progress had been made by the NCGFS, notably owing to insufficiently clear
institutional arrangements and lack of staff. The mission also identified inconsistencies and
difficulties of interpretation across the various source data. The mission conducted a
compilation exercise using data for 2000 that showed substantial room for progress
improvement in the consistency of source data and reconciliation between above- and belowthe-line data. This exercise compiled data for the consolidated central government and
general government, with special effort to capture the numerous special funds and dedicated
accounts that carry out large financial transactions. It The mission used the new Government
Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) framework (but on a cash basis), which has
the advantages of integrating stocks and flows and facilitating the presentation of the
consolidation of fiscal data.
7.
The mission also laid out a detailed 3-stage “action plan” and recommended: 1)
Firstly, for immediate action to: expand the NCGFS and increase GFS unit staffing; improve
the consistency of OAGF and Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) source data; expand CBN
work to reconcile government financing data (available in-house); have the GFS unit
document an inventory of source data. The action plan suggested that a second step f; 2)
focus on improving the coverage of reporting to includeof state and local government
operations, as well asand ensuring ensure adequate GFS dissemination of GFS data; and 3)
focusand that a third step focus on a more complete application of the guidelines contained in
GFSM 2001.
8.
A follow up mission in July 2003 found that the authorities had implemented very
few of the recommendations/work plan that were put forward by the 2002 mission, including
on the proposed strategy for transition to the GFSM 2001. The mission did not reach its full
potential, largely because of limited access to some of the relevant agencies. The authorities
had expected that more time would be devoted to general training. The mission was told that
the work plan proposed by the 2002 mission had been approved, but was unable to confirm
specific progress. The expert was unable to successfully review the issues on source data
raised by the 2002 mission. On the other hand, the mission reported progress in specific
areas, in particular in regard to the work of the CBN.

- 71 -

APPENDIX IV

9.
Annual fiscal data are not reported for inclusion in the GFS Yearbook, but aggregated
annual fiscal data are reported for inclusion in the IFS. No quarterly or monthly data for
inclusion in the IFS are reported.
Monetary accounts
10.
The authorities have taken steps toward implementing the key recommendations of
past STA money and banking technical assistance missions and the 1999 STA multisector
mission. However, a March 2001 follow-up mission found that problems remained, in
particular regarding the consistency of the interbank positions. Large and volatile
discrepancies in interbank positions, both among the commercial banks and between the
CBN and the commercial banks distort monetary aggregates and undermine the usefulness of
monetary statistics for policy analysis and decision making. In addition, central government
deposits at the CBN are currently reported within unclassified liabilities. Moreover, the lags
in publishing monetary data remain considerable, and the presentation of monetary data
makes identification of the net financial position of the government difficult.
Balance of payments
11.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled from the foreign exchange records in the
banking system and from data derived from surveys. However, oil sector data are weakened
by the low response rate to survey requests from oil businesses. In the non-oil sectors, only
enterprises with foreign capital participation are surveyed. The estimates of non-oil imports
of goods and services are based on banking data. Private capital movements are
underrecorded and the trade data reported by the FOS (based on customs data) sharply differ
from those reported by the CBN (based on banking data). Based on comparisons with
counterparty data, the former are likely to significantly under-report informal trade. The 1999
STA multisector mission identified actions to be taken for improving the quality of balance
of payments data. However, a November 2000 follow-up mission found that no progress had
been made by the authorities in implementing the recommendations of the 1999 STA
mission, and the slowness of progress was noted again during a February 2005 STA mission.
After a hiatus of several years, the CBN has recently resumed submitting balance of
payments data to STA; however, the balance of payments contain very large negative errors
of omissions, which probably reflect an underestimation of current account debit
transactions. Except for some methodological changes, the compilation of balance of
payments continues to be severely affected by organizational weaknesses and resource
constraints in the FOS, customs and the CBN. The Nigerian authorities have not yet initiated
compiling international reserves data in line with the Data Template on International
Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity. Moreover, staff has been unable to assess whether
data on official reserve assets is in principle consistent with the template; the data may not be
adequate for monitoring because they may not adequately reflect foreign currency liabilities
or distinguish other foreign currency assets.

- 72 -

APPENDIX IV

External debt
12.
To address problems with the data on external debt, a United Kingdom-financed
technical assistance effort was launched in October 1998. After initial delays, the Debt
Management Office was established in August 2000, and good progress has been made in
verifying individual loan accounts with creditors’ statements and improving the efficiency of
debt management in Nigeria. An audit of Nigeria’s loan portfolio for correctness and
duplication was carried out after the two separate databases of the Federal Ministry of
Finance and the CBN were merged. In September 2000, the process of reconciling Nigeria’s
external obligations to multilateral creditors began. Following the Paris Club agreement of
December 13, 2000, the verification of individual loan accounts with each individual Paris
club creditor was also launched and, by October 2001, was reported to be complete. The
authorities do not collect data on private sector external debt, but over time should work to
extend the coverage of their database to include private sector liabilities.

NIGERIA
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the African Department
Approved by Michael Nowak and Carlo Cottarelli
July 14, 2005
1.
This supplement contains information that has become available since the staff report
for the 2005 Article IV consultation was issued to the Board on June 27, 2005. The thrust of
the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
2.
In late June, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) initiated a number of actions to
contain the increase in broad money. These included open market operations, increased
sales of foreign exchange, the transfer of public deposits from commercial banks to the CBN
(N60 billion in public enterprise deposits equivalent to 8 percent of reserve money at endMarch), and a small increase in reserve requirements. The 12-month consumer price inflation
increased to almost 18 percent in April from 10 percent at end-2004.
3.
The CBN has created a high-level steering committee in line with
recommendations from the Monetary and Financial Systems Department of the Fund
to help guide the bank consolidation process.
4.
Despite the liberalization of the downstream petroleum sector in 2003, the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has not fully passed on crude oil
price increases to consumers of petroleum products. Attempts to adjust pump prices to the
higher international prices have been met with general strikes and civil unrest. This has led to
an implicit subsidy on petroleum products (of about 1 percent of non-oil GDP in the first half
of 2005) and reduced the amount of windfall oil earnings being sterilized. The government
intends to develop a medium-term strategy to reduce the gap between international prices and
domestic prices for petroleum products, and meanwhile give explicit financing to NNPC to
cover its losses out of general government resources.
5.
The authorities have replaced the top management of the Federal Office of
Statistics and merged the office with the National Data Bank to create the National
Bureau of Statistics. The intention is to improve the availability, quality, and timeliness of
statistics.

-2-

6.
Paris Club creditors recently agreed in principle to a phased approach in which
Nigeria would clear its arrears in full, receive a debt write-off up to Naples terms, and
buy back the remainder of its debt. The agreement is conditional on a favorable review of
its macroeconomic and structural policies supported by the Fund under a possible nonborrowing instrument. Paris Club creditors expressed their readiness to invite Nigeria to
negotiate in Paris the elements of the agreement left open—including the overall rate of debt
cancellation, the length of the phasing period, and possible trigger clauses—in the event such
an instrument were in place for Nigeria.
7.
In the meantime, the authorities have requested a continuation of Fund
monitoring of their program under intensified surveillance. In this connection, the
authorities have provided their quarterly fiscal and monetary targets designed in consultation
with staff, as well as an update of their structural reform matrix (see Appendix VII of IMF
Country Report No. 04/239), including their assessment (see last column of the matrix) of the
status of implementation of their program (see attachment). The quarterly profiles are
consistent with the annual targets, reversing the build up in liquidity in the first five months
of the year. As to fiscal policy, with the approval of the budget in April 2005, capital
spending is projected to pick up consistent with the authorities’ overall macroeconomic
framework. The matrix has been updated in several areas, including public expenditure
management, exchange rate system, local government reform, statistics, and liberalization
(NNPC).

This measure was implemented on October 1, 2003 along
with the phase out of government subsidies to NNPC on the
purchase of Domestic Crude implemented on October 22,
2003. As a result of these measures, NNPC pays international
price for domestic crude refined in country and the price of
gas at the pump moved to import parity prices. However,
Labour initiated a serious strike against the fuel price which
had climbed to N50-N52 a litre at the start of the
deregulation. The court issued an injunction requesting the
National Labour Congress (NLC) to halt its strike action and
asked the government and fuel marketers to go back to the
pump price of N38-N40 a litre that obtained at the start of
deregulation on October 1. Since the injunction, the NNPC
has, on a temporary basis, used its accumulated reserves to
subsidize the petrol price to the tune of N350 million a day
July – August as no money has been available from the
government treasury for this purpose. NNPC reserves have
been virtually exhausted. The government is sticking by its
deregulation policy and is working to get the court injunction
lifted. In the meantime the government is also looking at
mechanisms and good practice globally for assisting the poor
and vulnerable population in a more targeted fashion to
weather the impact of high petroleum prices. Note that court
injunction has now been lifted. As at September 25, 2004,
petrol prices at the pump are at import parity levels, N52-N60
per litre depending on location.
Continued high oil prices has triggered a revolt by Labour
Unions and Civil Society leading to N48-N55 per litre
depending on location in the country. This is N10-N16 per
litre above the import parity prices at deregulation in October
2003. NNPC continues to bear a subsidy of N172 million a
day to keep prices from rising beyond this point. Given
difficult international oil price situation, the government has
adopted a policy of providing an explicit subsidy of N2
billion a month for 3 months in the first instance to kerosene,
the fuel used by the poor people for cooking and lighting. The
government is also considering a one-time explicit support to

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 10, 2005

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation
with Nigeria
On July 18, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Nigeria.1
Background
Macroeconomic performance in 2004 was commendable. Preliminary official data suggest that
GDP benefited from the improved macroeconomic environment. Real GDP is estimated to
have increased by about 6 percent, stemming largely from higher growth in the non-oil
economy, in particular agriculture, and some areas within manufacturing and services.
The consolidated government’s fiscal stance was prudent in 2004, despite the large increase
in oil revenue, and the fiscal position strengthened significantly. Oil revenue rose as a result of
higher oil prices and production and the removal of the price subsidy on domestic crude oil
sales to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). All three tiers of government
adhered to a conservative oil price based fiscal rule, thereby achieving fiscal discipline. Public
spending was kept in check and a windfall oil revenue of about US$6 billion was set aside.
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) tightened its monetary policy to achieve the disinflation
objective and the CBN met its monetary policy targets. Monetary tightening and the
strengthening of the naira helped lower inflation. The 12-month inflation rate decelerated to
16 percent in March 2005, from 24 percent at end-2003. Certain reforms helped improve the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2effectiveness of monetary policy, including the CBN’s withdrawal as a buyer from the primary
market for government securities.
Prudent macroeconomic policies also resulted in exchange rate stability, and the spreads
between the Dutch auction official rate, the interbank market, and the parallel market remained
low. The exchange rate appreciated moderately in real terms in 2004. International reserves
rose considerably to US$23 billion at end-May 2005.
The gross external public debt declined in 2004 relative to GDP and exports. However, arrears
continued to accumulate. The government serviced its commercial and multilateral external
debt obligations, but paid US$1 billion (about half of its obligations) to Paris Club creditors,
while maintaining a dialogue with them.
Since the 2004 Article IV consultation, Nigeria has made good progress in implementing its
structural reform agenda. The authorities took measures to tackle public sector corruption,
improve the transparency of public policies, advance the civil service reform and the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), and strengthen budgetary procedures. They have
also largely withstood pressure to reverse the liberalization of the downstream petroleum
sector. The overall pace of privatization was, however, disappointing. To reenergize the
privatization process, the top management of the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) was
replaced in March 2005.
In July 2004, the CBN announced a major bank restructuring reform built around a large
increase in the minimum capital requirement to force bank consolidation. Some banks are in
talks for mergers and acquisition, while others have offered shares to the public in order to
raise sufficient capital. The CBN also announced reforms to address major weaknesses in
bank and non-bank financial institution supervision.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for Nigeria’s strong economic performance in
2004 under the homegrown reform program, as articulated in the National Economic
Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS). A number of key priorities of the program
have been achieved, including enhanced predictability and transparency of policies, growth in
the non-oil economy including the agricultural sector, and reduced vulnerability to oil price
shocks. Moreover, fiscal restraint allowed much of the oil windfall to be saved in 2004,
resulting in lower inflation and a sharp increase in international reserves.
Directors cautioned that, despite the recent progress, Nigeria’s economic transformation
continues to face formidable challenges, owing to weak institutions, administrative and
technical capacity constraints, resistance from entrenched interests, and the legacy of
decades of economic mismanagement. They encouraged the authorities to persevere in their
efforts, building on the progress made in 2004 and broadening the reform agenda.
Directors observed that a prudent fiscal policy in 2004 had contributed importantly to the
macroeconomic stabilization effort. From that perspective, they expressed concern about the
expansionary fiscal policy stance in 2005 and consequent larger non-oil deficit, which could
complicate the management of monetary policy, lead to spending inefficiencies, and crowd out
export activities and private investment. Directors considered that these potential
consequences of the planned loosening of the fiscal stance made it all the more important to

-3strengthen public expenditure management to ensure that public spending helps achieve the
NEEDS objectives and the Millennium Development Goals. In this light, they welcomed the
establishment of a virtual poverty fund to track poverty-reducing spending, and the creation of
a cost-benefit analysis unit in the Ministry of Finance to examine large investment projects.
They called on the authorities to further improve the government’s budget classification
systems to enable adequate monitoring of the pro-poor and growth-supporting aspects of the
budget. Directors welcomed the provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill, which, if passed,
will enhance fiscal transparency and accountability at all levels of government, introduce
formal fiscal rules into the budget process, and lay the foundations for medium-term fiscal
sustainability. They took note of the authorities’ efforts to garner broad support for the Bill in
the National Assembly.
Directors emphasized that, in the light of the fiscal expansion, more of the burden of controlling
inflation would fall on the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Given the sharp increase in monetary
aggregates in early 2005, Directors supported the recent actions of the CBN to limit broad
money growth. They welcomed progress in relying more on indirect instruments of monetary
management, and urged the authorities to allow short-term interest rates and the exchange
rate to adjust as needed to meet the monetary targets. Directors concurred with the authorities’
intention to continue with money targeting as the operational framework for anchoring
inflationary expectations. Several Directors recommended that the authorities consider moving
to an inflation targeting regime in the shortest possible time after appropriate preparations and
contingent upon a strengthening of the financial sector.
Directors regretted the deterioration in the financial condition of some banks in 2004, and
noted that major challenges remain for promoting a healthy and vital financial sector. At the
same time, they welcomed the measures taken by the authorities in this area, including the
capitalization program and the recent establishment of a high-level steering committee to
guide the bank restructuring and consolidation program. They urged the CBN to develop a
strategic plan to deal with banks that will not meet the minimum capital requirement at end2005, strengthen its legal powers to close insolvent banks, and enhance banking supervision.
They called on the authorities to ensure that sound accounting standards are applied in
valuing banks’ assets, and to advance the legal processes for establishing asset management
companies to minimize the budgetary costs associated with liquidation of some banks.
Directors supported the authorities’ request for Fund technical assistance on the banking
reform program. They welcomed the progress made in strengthening the anti-money
laundering framework with the establishment of a Financial Intelligence Unit in the Economic
and Financial Crimes Commission.
Directors called for steps toward reform of Nigeria’s foreign exchange markets, which remain
segmented and a source of distortions. In this vein, they welcomed the CBN’s commitment to
introduce a wholesale auction for foreign exchange in early 2006, which should unify the
exchange system. The CBN should expedite work to put in place the necessary infrastructure
and regulations for the auction. Directors urged the authorities to further streamline current
foreign exchange regulations and to take the steps necessary for accepting the obligations of
Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
Directors considered that the authorities’ ambitious structural reform agenda is focused
appropriately on strengthening governance and transparency, enhancing public service
delivery, streamlining the role of government in the economy, and improving the business

-4environment. They welcomed the revamping of the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) and
encouraged the authorities to expedite the overall pace of privatization, bearing in mind the
need to rally public support for it. They also welcomed the authorities’ emphasis on broadbased participation in advancing the country’s commitment to improve transparency in the oil
and gas sector under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
Directors supported the authorities’ tariff reform program, as lower tariffs will benefit Nigeria’s
international competitiveness. They commended the authorities’ intention to phase out all
import bans by end-2006 and fully adopt the ECOWAS Common External Tariff by end-2007,
but recommended that the timetable for implementing these reforms be accelerated.
Directors were encouraged by the readiness of Nigeria’s external creditors to negotiate a
comprehensive debt relief agreement with the country.
Directors stressed the importance of improving the reliability and timeliness of economic
statistics to better support the formulation and monitoring of macroeconomic and social
policies. To this end, they welcomed the recent merging of the Federal Office of Statistics with
the National Data Bank to create the National Bureau of Statistics.
All Directors welcomed a continuing close dialogue of the Fund with Nigeria on policy
formulation and implementation, in the most appropriate and effective form, including in the
context of a possible non-borrowing relationship.
