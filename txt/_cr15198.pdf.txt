IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Czech Republic

On July 15, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the Czech Republic and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal
without a meeting.2
The Czech economy is growing strongly on account of improving domestic demand and robust
exports. Growth accelerated in the first quarter of this year and high frequency indicators,
including retail sales, production and consumer confidence suggest that the growth momentum
has continued in recent months. The labor market also has been recovering fast and the
unemployment rate declined to the lowest level since 2009. Led by an improving trade balance
due to positive terms-of-trade developments, the current account turned to a surplus. In the face
of a drop in energy and food prices, headline inflation decelerated sharply in 2014 and is
hovering just above zero, while core inflation remains stable.
Following substantial pro-cyclical fiscal tightening in 2011–13, fiscal policy has been supportive
of the economic recovery. Specifically, the general government deficit increased from
1.2 percent of GDP in 2013 to 2.0 percent in 2014, implying about a 1 percentage point easing in
the fiscal stance. The relaxation was mainly due to a negative surprise in excise collections, and
an increase in capital spending.
Monetary policy has remained accommodative. In November 2013, constrained by the zero
lower bound and facing deflationary pressures, the Czech National Bank decided to use the
exchange rate as an additional instrument for inflation targeting and announced its commitment
“to prevent excessive appreciation of the koruna below CZK27 per € by intervening in the

foreign exchange market”. The exchange rate has been hovering above that level without any
official intervention in the foreign exchange market since November 2013.
The banking sector is stable and credit growth shows signs of a recovery. Czech banks are selffinanced with a low system-wide loan-to-deposit ratio and strong capital and liquidity buffers.
Despite a slight increase in the non-performing loan ratio to 5.6 percent last year, the ratio
remains low. Credit growth is slowly recovering driven by demand from the corporate sector and
recent lending surveys point to easing lending standards and gradually rising demand for credit.
Funding costs have declined further.
The outlook is for strong growth and low inflation. Growth is projected to accelerate to 3 percent
in 2015, mainly on account of higher investment and improving household consumption.
Inflation is likely to remain very low in 2015, before rising gradually toward the cenral bank’s
target in 2016, as base effects from the oil price shock fade and declining economic slack starts
to pull inflation up. Over the medium term, output growth is set to stabilize at around
2¼ percent, but a period of faster growth is possible, driven by the strong pipeline of FDI coming
into effect.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2015 Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic, Executive Directors
endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows:
The Czech economy is growing strongly but challenges remain. The economic upturn is driven
by robust exports and improving domestic demand being helped by accommodative
macroeconomic policies. The labor market has been recovering fast with strong employment
gains and real wage growth picking up gradually. But while disinflationary pressures seem to
have abated, inflation is still below the central bank’s target. In addition, potential growth is well
below the level necessary to facilitate fast convergence toward the income levels of other
advanced European countries. Thus, the challenge for the authorities is to create the conditions
for sustainable growth while safeguarding macroeconomic stability.
Fiscal policy and the medium-term fiscal objective need to be anchored in fiscal framework
legislation, and the composition of the budget should be improved. The remaining output gap,
low inflation, and the fact that monetary policy is at the zero lower bound warrant maintaining a
slightly accommodative fiscal stance this year, as planned by the authorities. At the same time,
though, modest and very gradual fiscal consolidation will be necessary beginning next year, in
line with the authorities’ commitment to a medium-term objective of a 1 percent of GDP
structural deficit. Moreover, this objective should be cast in fiscal framework legislation that
would include expenditure ceilings, a debt brake rule, and a fiscal council—thus helping anchor
fiscal policy and guard against pro-cyclical tendencies. Finally, there is scope to improve budget

3
composition, with increased capital spending to address infrastructure needs offset by efficiency
gains in current spending and improved revenue administration.
The central bank should continue to focus on inflation targeting. The exchange rate floor has
proven effective in fending off deflationary pressures, and in combination with recovering
demand conditions, inflation is expected to rise toward the central bank’s target in the second
half of 2016, thus facilitating an exit from the exchange rate floor. The central bank should thus
maintain its focus on inflation targeting in its policymaking and communication, while
continuing to evaluate the conditions that would trigger a normalization of monetary policy and
the mechanics of its implementation. However, given the only gradual closing of the output gap
and asymmetric risks at the zero lower bound, monetary policy will likely need to remain
supportive for some time even after abolishment of the exchange rate floor and return to a
floating exchange rate.
Continued vigilance will be needed to sustain the stability of the financial system. The banking
sector is self-financed with low system-wide loan-to-deposit ratio and strong capital and liquidity
buffers, which make it resilient to shocks. Moreover, bank supervision has been strengthened by
increasing supervisory resources, approving a new law on credit unions, and starting utilizing the
macroprudential toolkit of the Capital Requirements Regulation IV. Nevertheless, proactive
supervision remains necessary along with further gradual improvements in the supervisory
architecture, including the transposition of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive into
domestic law.
An ambitious structural reform agenda is key to lifting Czech Republic’s potential growth.
Sustained progress on wide-ranging reforms to increase labor market participation, enhance
investment in human and physical capital, and improve the business climate is essential for
higher investment and growth. Reforms of the labor market should aim at increasing labor
participation among women with children and low-skilled workers, while greater emphasis
should be placed on mitigating skills mismatches. Priority should also be given to promoting
research and innovation, enhancing apprenticeship programs, simplifying tax compliance and
other administrative procedures, and improving infrastructure.

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy is growing strongly on account of improving domestic demand
and robust exports. Fiscal policy has been supportive of the recovery and the authorities’
medium-term fiscal objective is appropriate, but fiscal framework legislation that would
anchor policy is yet to be approved. The central bank’s use of an exchange rate floor as
an additional instrument to achieve its inflation objective, in the context of the inflationtargeting framework, has helped stem deflationary pressures, but inflation is still well
below target. The financial system is sound and resilient to shocks. The challenge for the
authorities is to safeguard macroeconomic stability and create conditions for strong and
sustainable growth.
Policy recommendations.
 Fiscal policy. Maintain a supportive fiscal stance this year, but embark on a modest
and very gradual fiscal consolidation thereafter, consistent with the medium-term deficit
objective. Embed this objective in a comprehensive framework to enhance its
effectiveness in anchoring fiscal policy. Improve budget composition, with higher capital
spending to address infrastructure needs offset by efficiency gains in current
expenditure and improved revenue administration.
 Monetary policy. Continue to focus on inflation targeting in policymaking and
communication, and maintain supportive monetary conditions until deflation risks
recede and inflation expectations become entrenched around the inflation target.
Consider carefully the timing and mechanics of the eventual normalization of monetary
policy.
 Financial sector. Remain vigilant and be ready to address possible risks to financial
stability.
 Structural reforms. Remove impediments to higher potential growth, including
through policies to increase labor market participation of certain segments of the
population, enhance investment in human and physical capital, and improve the
business climate.

CONTEXT
1.
The Czech economy is growing at a strong pace but challenges remain. With the
support of accommodative macroeconomic policies, output growth rebounded in 2014. A further
acceleration is in train, with both exports and domestic demand performing well. The central bank’s
use of an exchange rate floor as an additional instrument to achieve its inflation objective has
helped stem deflationary pressures, but inflation remains well below target. At the same time, fiscal
framework legislation that would anchor policy is yet to be approved. The challenge for the
authorities is to create conditions for sustainable growth while maintaining macroeconomic stability.
2.
The strong growth performance has helped keep the coalition stable. The
government—a coalition of the Social Democrats, a new center right party (ANO), and the Christian
Democrats—took office in January 2014, roughly simultaneous with the upturn in the business cycle,
following the previous fiscally-conservative and euro-skeptic coalition. Although the new
government is friendlier to the EU policy agenda, it is ideologically diverse. On one hand, its overall
orientation is toward more activist social welfare-enhancing policies, while on the other hand, ANO
has pledged not to increase taxes and to put strong emphasis on improving tax administration.

The Czech economy is growing
strongly. Real GDP expanded by 2 percent in
2014, with both exports and domestic demand,
particularly investment, performing well.
Investment benefitted from public resources,
with local government activity and EU-funded
projects being carried out at a higher-thanexpected pace. Consumption growth was
supported by robust labor income gains and
reached the pre-crisis growth rate in 2014:Q4.
The growth momentum continued this year, with
output growth accelerating markedly to
4.2 percent y-o-y in 2015:Q1. While this
performance was probably influenced by tobacco
excise legislation that increased cigarette restocking early in the year, growth was broadbased and driven by domestic demand.
Moreover, high frequency indicators provide
further evidence of economic growth gaining a
strong footing, with Purchasing Managers’
Indexes showing continued improvements in
output, new orders, and employment.

The labor market has been recovering fast. Employment growth gathered speed in the
second half of 2014 and reached 1.3 percent y-o-y in 2015:Q1, while the unemployment rate has
declined to 5.7 percent, the lowest level since 2009:Q1. Real wage growth also turned positive
in 2014 (2.1 percent), boosted by the improving labor market as well as a 2 percent public wage
adjustment in 2014 and a 6.3 percent increase in the minimum wage effective August 2013. The
minimum wage was further increased by 8.2 percent in 2015.

2014. One-year ahead inflation
expectations, which had been boosted by the introduction of the exchange rate floor, declined in
early 2015, while 3-year ahead expectations remain stable at around the 2 percent inflation target,
reflecting the credibility of the central bank (CNB).
6.
Fiscal policy has been supportive of the recovery. Following substantial pro-cyclical fiscal
tightening in 2011–13, the general government deficit increased from 1.2 percent of GDP in 2013 to
2.0 percent in 2014, implying about a 1 percentage point deterioration in the cyclically-adjusted
fiscal balance. The relaxation was mainly due to an increase in capital spending and a negative
surprise in excise collections1. The headline deficit widened further as a result of statistical changes
to comply with ESA2010 methodology, which entailed, among other issues, the inclusion of the
Deposit Insurance Agency that had a one-off payout in 2014 in the general government.
7.
Monetary conditions remain accomodative. In November 2013, constrained by the zero
lower bound and facing deflationary pressures, the CNB decided to use the exchange rate as an
additional instrument for inflation targeting and announced its commitment “to prevent excessive
appreciation of the koruna below CZK27 per € by intervening in the foreign exchange market.” The
exchange rate floor was considered preferable over purely quantitative easing through purchases of
domestic financial assets given the ample excess liquidity in the banking system, scarcity of private

sector assets to purchase, and shallowness of secondary government bond markets. The exchange
rate has been hovering above the floor without any further intervention in the FX market since the
CNB purchases of euro in November 20132 with some limited volatility around the time of oil price
declines (markets braced for the deflationary impact and possibly a weaker koruna) and ECB’s
quantitative easing. 3

The banking sector is stable, and credit growth shows some signs of a recovery. Czech
banks are self-financed with a low system-wide loan-to-deposit ratio and strong capital and liquidity
buffers. Despite a slight increase in the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio to 5.6 percent last year, due
to an increase in NPLs of the government-owned Export bank, the ratio remains low. Credit growth
accelerated to 3½ percent y-o-y in April, on account of a pickup in corporate-sector demand, while
household credit growth remains robust.
9.
Funding costs remain low. Bond yields have declined to historical lows on expectations of
prolonged monetary policy accomodation earlier in 2015 before starting to rise in line with euro
area trends: the 10-year bond yield recently reached almost 1.2 percent compared with lows of
0.4 percent in April. Czech Republic is rated investment grade with a stable outlook, and five-year
credit default swap rates have been steady at around 50 basis points.
10.
The current account turned to a surplus. Led by an improving trade balance, the current
account registered a 0.6 percent of GDP surplus in 2014 compared with a 0.5 percent deficit in 2013.
The trade balance improvement was driven by favorable terms-of-trade developments,
notwithstanding strong import volume growth that outpaced that of exports. Meanwhile, the
income deficit remained stable at around 6 percent of GDP.

11.
Staff’s assessment is that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
The EBA methodology yields mixed results for the Czech Republic, with current account balancebased approaches pointing to marginal undervaluation and the multilateral REER approach showing
an overvaluation (Box 2). Other considerations also point to the absence of evident imbalances in
the external position, or of significant shortcomings in non-price competitiveness indicators
(Figure 6). Overall, staff assesses the exchange rate to be in broad equilibrium.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
Staff expects growth to accelerate to 3 percent in 2015. Investment, supported by
growing business confidence, higher capacity utilization and greater take-up of EU funds, is
expected to be the main driver of growth. At the same time, the strength of the labor market and
improved consumer confidence would provide a boost to private consumption. On the other hand,
while export growth remains robust, the net export contribution is projected to turn negative, as
strong domestic demand would boost imports. Inflation is likely to remain very low in 2015, before
rising toward the target in 2016, as base effects from the oil price shock fade and declining
economic slack starts to pull inflation up. (These projections assume the exchange rate floor remains
in place through mid-2016, as the authorities have announced.) Over the medium term, output
growth is set to stabilize at around 2¼ percent. Finally, the current account is projected to remain in
surplus, thanks to a lower oil import bill, before moving toward a small deficit on account of
improving investment and in line with fundamentals.

Risks to the outlook—highlighted in the Risk Assessment Matrix—are broadly balanced.
On the upside, the positive effects from lower oil prices, supportive macroeconomic policies, the
ongoing recovery in Czech Republic’s trade partners, and ECB’s quantitative easing could turn out to
be larger than currently forecast. On the downside, if the euro area recovery were to falter, the Czech
economy would be negatively affected through the trade channel. The impact would be larger still if
low growth turned self-reinforcing through low investment. Moreover, escalation of geopolitical
tensions in the region or reemergence of sovereign stress in Europe could affect exports and also
create negative confidence effects. To this end, financial market turbulance

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CZECH REPUBLIC

could generate safe-haven inflows that would contribute to appreciation pressures in the absence of
the floor.

Authorities’ views
14.
The authorities broadly agreed on the near-term outlook, medium-term prospects,
and the balance of risks. Among positive factors affecting the outlook, they emphasized their
stepped-up efforts to boost infrastructure spending, in particular associated with EU-financed
programs. They also saw an upside to medium-term growth on account of a strong pipeline of FDI,
both due to the global investment cycle and gains in Czech Republic’s relative cost position.
Downside risks were, in their view, mostly external, related to the possible intensification of
geopolitical tensions and its negative impact on market sentiment in the region. Finally, they were
somewhat concerned about renewed financial stesss in the euro area, possibly related to
developments in Greece. However, they emphasized that direct spillovers from a prolonged period
of financial market turbulence were quite small, given the very limited exposure of the banking
system to Greece.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on the need for a growth-friendly medium-term fiscal strategy, enshrined in
legislation; structural reforms to encourage investment and enhance productivity; and continued
efforts to achieve the central bank’s inflation target and preserve financial stability.

A. Anchoring Fiscal Policy
15.
The 2015 fiscal stance is supportive of the recovery. The authorities plan to keep
the 2015 fiscal deficit just below 2 percent of GDP, which appears feasible and would imply a fiscal
impulse of 0.6 percentage points. Key expenditure measures include increases in investment
financed by national sources, in addition to EU funds; salaries; and health care and mandatory social
spending. The introduction of a second reduced VAT rate on pharmaceuticals, books and child
nutrition, and tax credits for families with children will weigh on revenues. Although the projected
fiscal stance is somewhat expansionary, given the remaining output gap, low inflation, and the fact
that monetary policy is at the zero lower bound, staff did not advocate a tightening this year, but
instead encouraged the authorities to allow automatic stabilizers to operate in both directions.
16.
The government’s medium-term fiscal objective is appropriate. The Convergence
Program envisages gradual fiscal consolidation over 2016–18 aimed at reaching the medium-term
objective (MTO) of a 1 percent of GDP structural deficit (from the projected 1.5 percent level in
2015). This adjustment relies to a large extent on gains from improvements in revenue
administration, but also includes some savings from rationalization of spending owing to the
introduction of a central purchasing system. Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to the
MTO, which will put the debt ratio on a downward path while allowing adequate space for current
fiscal policy priorities. Reaching this objective would require only modest and very gradual fiscal

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CZECH REPUBLIC

consolidation beginning next year, which accounts for the relative absence of major deficitreduction initiatives.
17.
Staff emphasized that embedding the medium-term objective in a comprehensive
framework would enhance its effectiveness in anchoring fiscal policy. The updated government
proposal of the fiscal framework reform—which includes expenditure ceilings to guide spending, a
debt brake rule starting at 55 percent of GDP to gradually correct deficit overruns, and a fiscal
council to promote transparency—is under consideration by Parliament. Timely adoption of this
proposal would help anchor fiscal policy and guard against pro-cyclical tendencies in policymaking.
18.
Although the overall fiscal position is relatively strong, the budget composition could
be improved, with higher capital spending to address infrastructure needs offset by efficiency
gains in current expenditure and improved revenue administration. Total government spending
is somewhat below the advanced economy average, but spending on social benefits is relatively
high and has been rising (Box 3). Staff thus argued that expansion of means testing and adherence
to the indexation rules for the adjustment of social benefits would help contain spending pressures.
Moreover, health spending is high relative to outcomes, suggesting room for efficiency gains. To
this end, staff welcomed the authorities’ envisaged measures to enhance the transparency of health
insurance companies’ finances, the launching of newly-created standardized diagnostic and
therapeutic algorithms, and improvements in data management and sharing. Conversely, sizeable
infrastructure gaps push transportation costs above the OECD average, pointing to spending needs.
On the revenue side, staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen tax administration
through the introduction of electronic VAT reporting and electronic cash registers. However,
budgeted revenue gains should be conservative to avoid putting pressure on deficit outturns.
Authorities’ views
19.
The authorities re-affirmed their commitment to gradual fiscal consolidation over the
medium term and to the fiscal framework legislation. They considered the expansionary fiscal
stance this year necessary to support the economic recovery and to lean against downside macro
risks, especially given the moderate level of public debt. Nevertheless, they were determined to
proceed with fiscal consolidation starting next year, in line with their medium-term fiscal objective.
In this regard, their priority would be to increase the effectiveness of tax collections, and they were
optimistic that their efforts—also benefitting from experiences of other countries—would bear fruit.
Finally, they were hopeful that the approval of fiscal framework legislation by Parliament would take
place expeditiously.

B. Achieving the Inflation Target
20.
Extreme deflationary risks have declined, and staff projects inflation to gradually rise
toward the central bank’s target in 2016. Although the positive impulse from the exchange rate
floor was counteracted by the slump in energy and other commodity prices, as well as by low core
inflation throughout Europe, Czech core inflation remains stable at around 1 percent. At the same
time, positive dynamics in the real economy and labor markets suggest that a scenario that involves
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

CZECH REPUBLIC

damaging second-round effects of low inflation—such as liquidity hoarding and wage depression—
has become less likely. In fact, retail sales are growing at a healthy pace, and in the key automotive
industry wage agreements have centered on 3–3½ percent wage increases, considerably higher
than last year. Finally, empirical evidence suggests that inflation has been driven by external factors
(accompanying cross-country Selected Issues Paper), while second-round effects have not
contributed measurably to the post-2012 disinflation (Appendix I). Against this backrdrop and based
on current policies remaining in place through 2016:H1 (including the exchange rate floor), inflation
is projected to start rising gradually towards the target in 2016.
21.
Staff encouraged the CNB to maintain its focus on inflation targeting in its policy
making and communication, and to consider carefully the timing and mechanics of the
eventual normalization of monetary policy. The policy rate has been at the zero lower bound
since November 2012, and the authorities have committed to maintain the exchange rate floor
through 2016:H1, thus avoiding an open-ended arrangement. The floor has proven effective in
supporting a return to the inflation target, as inflation expectations on current policies are consistent
with achieving the target. With the current level of the exchange rate assessed to be broadly in line
with fundamentals, and no interventions having taken place since the initial few days of the
introduction of the floor, there is little economic reason to expect large moves in the exchange rate
after the exit. Instead, the floor seems to be playing a supportive role both as a clear and credible
signal of the CNB’s commitment to the inflation target and as a type of insurance policy against the
risk of sustained safe-haven inflows in the event of an external shock that would undermine
achievement of the target. The pre-existence of a consistent monetary policy framework and CNB’s
continued transparent communication strategy—appropriately emphasizing the priority of the
inflation objective and the temporary role of the exchange rate floor as an instrument to achieve it—
should facilitate a smooth exit once justified by fundamentals like higher inflation outturns.
22.
Monetary policy would likely need to remain supportive. In staff’s view, given the only
gradual closing of the output gap and asymmetric risks at the zero lower bound, monetary policy
would likely need to remain supportive for some time even after abolishment of the exchange rate
floor. Moreover, the CNB has sufficient tools to counter any unintended tightening of monetary
conditions after the exit, including through discretionary interventions. To this end, modestly
negative policy interest rates could be considered, but mainly to discourage capital inflows (amidst
negative interest rates in other currencies). However, too deeply negative policy interest rates could
risk cash hoarding and in turn reduce financial intermediation and weaken monetary transmission,
especially if they were viewed as likely to persist for some time. At the same time, potential
transmission from negative interest rates to activity is likely to be very weak. As for purchases of
domestic assets, the scope for such purchases is very limited, given ample liquidity, already very low
levels of domestic yields, and limited availability of domestic assets.4

CZECH REPUBLIC

Authorities’ views
23.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s inflation outlook, while noting that
monetary policy decisions are becoming more data-dependent. They noted that the real
economy has turned the corner, with domestic demand taking over as the engine of growth and
core inflation trending upwards. Accommodative policies, including the exchange rate floor, have
played a useful role in this regard. However, they noted that wages were growing more moderately
than hoped, perhaps due to: second-round effects from low inflation expectations; greater-thanbelieved slack in the job market; and compositional effects that suppress average wage growth.
Coupled with statistical noise from tax-related effects, it was difficult to settle the matter decisively.
The authorities, therefore, leaned towards a wait-and-see attitude and careful observation of
incoming data. They also repeated their commitment to inflation targeting and the floating
exchange rate regime as soon as conditions allow normalization of monetary policy. They saw the
koruna as fairly valued, and together with projected positive inflation differentials with the euro area,
foresaw a smooth exit. The authorities were cautious regarding other unconventional monetary
policies, such as negative policy rates and domestic asset purchases, as they assessed these to be
relatively ineffective and prone to be misinterpreted as negative signals about the economy’s health.
They did not see much scope for euro adoption to be advanced in this government’s term, amidst
domestic unpopularity and ongoing changes in euro area policy frameworks5

C. Safeguarding Financial Stability
24.
The financial system is stable and resilient to shocks. Recent stress tests conducted by
the CNB incorporated a scenario of Europe-wide debt deflation coupled with sharp declines in both
domestic and external demand and a rise in long-term yields. These were found to be manageable
with estimated system-wide capital shortfalls of just 0.4 percent of GDP. The relatively low potential
capital need is mainly due to the high initial capitalization, which averages 18 percent across the
system. Moreover, profitability remains strong by advanced country standards, notwithstanding the
low interest rate environment. Among external risk factors, direct exposures to Russia are limited,
and the recent losses of Export bank appear to be linked to problems with risk management and
due diligence rather than economic developments.6
25.
Although credit growth remains low, it is expected to be boosted by the strong
recovery underway. Corporate credit demand is reportedly limited due to still-low investment
levels, but also because of corporates’ tendency to utilize internal resources for investment and, to a
lesser extent, other financing sources such as corporate bonds, rather than because of problems
with access to bank credit. Household credit growth has been stable at a slightly higher level, mainly
driven by continued demand for mortgages. At the same time, recent lending surveys point to
easing lending standards and gradually rising demand for credit, which along with the healthy

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

CZECH REPUBLIC

balance sheets in the financial and non-financial sectors and signs of a strong recovery suggest that
credit growth will likely rise going forward—a view shared by the banks.
26.
The regulatory and supervisory framework is being improved in the context of local
and global initiatives. The authorities continued to make progress toward implementing the
recommendations of the 2012 FSAP. In addition to the increase in supervisory resources for on-site
inspections, a new law on credit unions brought limits to their size, deposit-interest ratio, borrower
eligibility, and increased contributions to resolution and insurance funds among other provisions
aimed at reducing risks from this small part of the sector. Moreover, the CNB has started
implementing the macroprudential toolkit of the Capital Requirements Regulation IV by requiring
across-the-board “conservation buffers”, supplemented by a “systemic buffer” targeted at the
largest banks. The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and Deposit Guarantee Schemes
Directive are expected to be soon transposed into local law and would help introduce new tools and
harmonize resolution frameworks within the EU. The working group on Banking Union opted for
staying out of the Banking Union for now, but decided to re-visit the issue on an annual basis7.
Authorities’ views
27.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment. They saw financial sector risks as
mainly relating to domestic economic conditions, which have taken a turn for better in the last year,
and reduced risks of a debt deflation. They noted a nascent recovery in lending activity, amidst
higher demand, positive asset quality trends, tightening interest rate margins, and lower
provisioning. The authorities saw the possibility of countercyclical macroprudential measures, if
credit growth turned out to be much faster than foreseen now. As for external risks, they saw a euro
area wide debt deflation as the main worry, but emphasized that direct linkages between the Czech
financial sector and developments in Greece and Russia were limited.

D. Boosting Potential Growth
28.
Raising Czech Republic’s growth prospects remains a key challenge. After averaging
4.5 percent during 2000–07, economic growth fell to 0.9 percent during 2010–14. While this was
mainly due to a slowdown in the euro area, growth performance is unlikely to return to pre-crisis
levels. Potential growth is estimated at 1.4 percent for this year, and, as investment increases, is
projected to increase to 2.2 percent over the medium term—a level insufficient to facilitate fast
convergence towards the income levels of other advanced European economies. This reflects a
number of challenges facing the supply side of the economy. Demographic headwinds are already
evident with the working age population having declined 4.2 percent in the last five years. Moreover,
although important steps have been taken to reduce labor market rigidities, including more flexible
employment arrangements, strengthened public employment services, and affordable high-quality
childcare facilities, labor participation in some segments of the population—women with young
7

membership.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CZECH REPUBLIC

children and low-skilled workers—remains low (Box 4). Finally, skills mismatches and low investment
in research and development (R&D) present headwinds to moving up the value-added chain.
29.
Staff thus called for an ambitious reform agenda to remove impediments to faster
potential growth. Addressing low labor participation—and helping achieve the authorities’ goal of
raising overall participation from 70 percent to 75 percent by 2020—calls for targeted policies,
including further progress in providing affordable childcare, and raising the effectiveness and scope
of job search assistance and training services. Emphasis should also be given on upgrading skills and
addressing skill shortages in high technology sectors, including through education and training for
less-advantaged groups, such as improvement of apprenticeship programs and avoiding selectivity
of the education system—these steps should help human capital accumulation and reduce
structural unemployment. Moreover, the business environment could be further enhanced by
simplifying tax compliance and other administrative procedures, and by implementing priorities
identified in the anti-corruption action plan on financial control, management of state-owned
companies, and access to information. Finally, improving transport infrastructure, and strengthening
R&D, would also support faster growth.

Authorities’ views
30.
The authorities agreed that further progress with structural reforms is needed to lift
Czech Republic’s potential growth. They broadly shared the mission’s assessment regarding
impediments to stronger growth and pointed to a number of actions envisaged in their National
Reform Program. They were confident that recent measures aimed at raising female labor
participation—namely, extension of the availability of childcare facilities for longer time, tax relief for
private childcare expenditures, and establishment of a government fund to support new public
kindergartens—would bear fruit. They emphasized that improving transport infrastructure was
indeed a key priority and referred to stepped up efforts to increase the utilization of EU funds, and
medium-term plans detailed in their Transport Policy. Additionally, a number of programs are being
implemented to strengthen cooperation between business and research organizations, and support
the development of start-ups. Finally, the authorities pointed to progress in reducing the
administrative burden and reiterated their commitment to push forward with a number of targeted
anti-corruption measures included in the government legislative agenda for 2015.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
The Czech economy is growing strongly but challenges remain. The economic upturn is
driven by robust exports and improving domestic demand being helped by accommodative
macroeconomic policies. The labor market has been recovering fast with strong employment gains
and real wage growth picking up gradually. But while disinflationary pressures seem to have abated,
inflation is still below the central bank’s target. In addition, potential growth is well below the level
necessary to facilitate fast convergence toward the income levels of other advanced European
countries. Thus, the challenge for the authorities is to create the conditions for sustainable growth
while safeguarding macroeconomic stability.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

CZECH REPUBLIC

32.
Fiscal policy and the medium-term fiscal objective need to be anchored in fiscal
framework legislation, and the composition of the budget should be improved. The remaining
output gap, low inflation, and the fact that monetary policy is at the zero lower bound warrant
maintaining a slightly accommodative fiscal stance this year, as planned by the authorities. At the
same time, though, modest and very gradual fiscal consolidation will be necessary beginning next
year, in line with the authorities’ commitment to a medium-term objective of a 1 percent of GDP
structural deficit. Moreover, this objective should be cast in fiscal framework legislation that would
include expenditure ceilings, a debt brake rule, and a fiscal council—thus helping anchor fiscal policy
and guard against pro-cyclical tendencies. Finally, there is scope to improve budget composition,
with increased capital spending to address infrastructure needs offset by efficiency gains in current
spending and improved revenue administration.
33.
The central bank should continue to focus on inflation targeting. The exchange rate
floor has proven effective in fending off deflationary pressures, and in combination with recovering
demand conditions, inflation is expected to rise toward the central bank’s target in the second half
of 2016, thus facilitating an exit from the exchange rate floor. The central bank should thus maintain
its focus on inflation targeting in its policymaking and communication, while continuing to evaluate
the conditions that would trigger a normalization of monetary policy and the mechanics of its
implementation. However, given the only gradual closing of the output gap and asymmetric risks at
the zero lower bound, monetary policy will likely need to remain supportive for some time even
after abolishment of the exchange rate floor and return to a floating exchange rate.
34.
Continued vigilance will be needed to sustain the stability of the financial system. The
banking sector is self-financed with low system-wide loan-to-deposit ratio and strong capital and
liquidity buffers, which make it resilient to shocks. Moreover, bank supervision has been
strengthened by increasing supervisory resources, approving a new law on credit unions, and
starting utilizing the macroprudential toolkit of the Capital Requirements Regulation IV.
Nevertheless, proactive supervision remains necessary along with further gradual improvements in
the supervisory architecture, including the transposition of the Bank Recovery and Resolution
Directive into domestic law.
35.
An ambitious structural reform agenda is key to lifting Czech Republic’s potential
growth. Sustained progress on wide-ranging reforms to increase labor market participation,
enhance investment in human and physical capital, and improve the business climate is essential for
higher investment and growth. Reforms of the labor market should aim at increasing labor
participation among women with children and low-skilled workers, while greater emphasis should
be placed on mitigating skills mismatches. Priority should also be given to promoting research and
innovation, enhancing apprenticeship programs, simplifying tax compliance and other
administrative procedures, and improving infrastructure.
36.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic be
held on the standard 12-month cycle.

been enshrined in legislation.

Adopt a fiscal rule which has wide coverage, is
easy to monitor, incorporates a debt brake,
and is monitored by an independent Fiscal
Council.

Not yet implemented. A new proposal by the
government, broadly in line with these
recommendations, is under discussion in parliament.

Continue to focus on inflation targeting and
keep the exchange rate floor in place until
deflation risks recede and inflation
expectations become entrenched around the

Box 2. Competitiveness Assessment

The EBA assessment yields mixed results. Specifically,
the Current Account Balance approach suggests that the
current account balance is stronger than the norm of
1 percent of GDP deficit, indicating a marginal
undervaluation of 3 percent in 2014. Benchmarked against
the 1.9 percent deficit that would stabilize the net foreign
asset position, the 2014 outturn suggests an
undervaluation of 5.4 percent. In contrast, the multilateral
REER approach finds a 10.4 percent overvaluation, as the
real exchange rate remains above what would be predicted
on the basis of selected fundamental determinants. Using
latest REER data and the projected 2015 current account
balance does not change the results.

Current account and international investment positions
reveal no major competitiveness issues. Reflecting the
high FDI stock, Czech Republic traditionally had a large
income deficit that outweighs the trade surplus. The trade
balance has trended higher since 2012, as domestic
demand trailed external demand, and it is likely to stabilize
in the near-term excluding terms-of-trade effects. The
accumulated deficits had led to a moderate negative NIIP
of about 36 percent of GDP. Excluding the net FDI stock of
58 percent at end-2014, the NIIP is comfortably positive.
Market share has also been relatively stable.

The koruna depreciated moderately in recent years, but
remains stronger than historical averages. Following a
long appreciation trend, the post-2011 depreciation was
mainly driven by nominal exchange rates, as markets reevaluated Czech growth prospects in the context of the
euro area turmoil. Since the FX interventions, the currency
has been stable, while in both real and nominal terms it
remains above historical averages. However, the historical
sample is dominated by a period of rapid convergence and
equilibrium appreciation driven by productivity gains.
ULC-based measures suggest that the underlying
competitive position has been more stable and is currently
broadly in line with historical norms.

Compressed capital spending in recent years
has resulted in stagnant public capital stock.
Although the capital stock in advanced
economies has been declining for many years,
yet the current gap with the Czech Republic is
even larger than it was in 2000. Within the
medium-term envelope of a 1 percent of GDP
structural deficit, improvements in efficiency of
social spending can help create space for higher
capital spending.

Health outcomes (measured by life expectancy) are below those of countries with similar level of
public health spending. Efficiency frontier analysis for public health spending indicates a potential for
savings in the range of 2-4 percent of GDP. Input efficiency score based on life expectancy as an output
indicator and real public health spending as input is estimated at 0.32, which is significantly lower than a
score of 1 for an “efficient/frontier” country and suggests that 68 percent of public resources could be saved
to achieve the same outcome. If infant mortality is used as an output indicator, the efficiency score measure
is higher, at 0.7, suggesting savings of 30 percent. Several factors might have contributed to the relatively
low health sector efficiency. Those include a high number of doctor consultations and hospital discharges, a
high share of pharmaceutical expenditure in total spending, and a relatively low share of general physicians.

Box 3. Efficiency of Public Spending (continued)

The education system appears to be efficient in delivering
strong average scores on international standardized tests.
However, there could be medium-term challenges in supplying
appropriately skilled workers for the shifting labor market.
Reforms should thus aim at seeking greater cost recovery in
areas where public spending provides significant private
benefits. For example, there could be room to increase out-ofpocket tuition fees. Additionally, it is important to ensure that
the supply of secondary education in some regions meets the
growing demand for pre-university educational streams, to
avoid a mismatch in the supply and demand for skilled labor.

Efficiency Scores

Increasing health spending efficiency would entail policies aimed at containing both cost pressures
and excess demand for health services. Specifically, there could be room to trim excess bed capacity,
reduce pharmaceutical costs, and introduce means-tested co-payments to contain growing pressure on the
public healthcare system. Introducing soft-gate keeping (e.g.,

Box 4. Gender Gaps in the Labor Market

Increasing FLMP could help shore up long-term
growth. Like many other advanced economies,
population ageing and low fertility rates are
compressing Czech Republic’s active labor force. On
current trends, the labor force will shrink by around
10 percent by 2030. Increasing low FLMP could help
offset these adverse trends and boost long-term
growth. The OECD estimates that full convergence in
participation rates by 2030 can increase Czech annual
per capita growth rates by 0.8 percent, on average.

Convergence in intencity

There seems to be scope for policies to increase female labor participation, especially for lower
education groups. The overall female labor force participation rate (FLFPR) increased by 4.6 percentage
points during 2008–14, to 65.6 percent in 2014. This was largely driven by the increase in the participation
rates of women with secondary education, as well as the decline in the share of women with primary
education only, which have the lowest participation ratio of 27 percent. Moreover, a much larger share of
working-age women now hold tertiary degrees (20 percent vs. 12 percent in 2008), and are exhibiting an
already high level of 78 percent participation. At the

Appendix I. Background Note on Drivers of Disinflation
Trends
Inflation has declined sharply across Europe
starting in 2012. At end-April 2015, the 12-month
inflation is either zero or negative for the euro area
(EA) and across all Central and Eastern European
(CEE) countries outside the euro zone, except
Romania (Figure1). In the Czech Republic, inflation
has been close to zero since December 2014.

continent points to common external causes,
such as developments in shared trade partners or international commodity prices (Figure 2).
The pass-through of external shocks to the overall price level can be broken down into first- and
second-round effects. First-round effects capture: (1) changes in energy and unprocessed food prices
and prices of other imported goods in consumer baskets; and (2) the impact on other prices via the
cost of inputs. Second-round effects reflect the impact (if any) channeled through inflation
expectations via: (1) softening of contemporaneous demand, as economic agents attempt to take
advantage of expected future price cuts; and (2) wage and price-setting behavior, which can embed
the expectation of disinflation in the evolution of future wages and prices. In extreme cases, the
latter channel can trigger a deflationary spiral—a self-feeding, vicious feedback loop between
inflation expectations and prices.

We analyze the main drivers of disinflation in the Czech Republic in two steps:


We first apply the panel coefficients from an updated version of the open-economy, New
Keynesian, Phillips curve for the CEE region in Iossifov and Podpiera (2014) to Czech data. We
re-estimate the regression with quarterly data for ten CEE countries over 2004–14, and consider
separately the effect of forward-looking expectations and the autonomous dynamics of inflation.
This allows a breakdown of the impact of external shocks into first- and second-round effects.



We then estimate regression models of households’ and firms’ inflation expectations in CEE,
using data until the onset of disinflation in 2012. Analysis of the out-of-sample forecasting
performance of the model helps identify the normal (i.e., fitted) reaction of inflation expectations
to oil prices and other external shocks and any overshooting (i.e., abnormally large negative
residuals) that can signal unanchoring of inflation expectations.

Decomposition of inflation variance into contributions by the explanatory variables in the
regression model shows that (Figure 3):








First-round effects of lower commodity prices, as
captured by the combined impact of world food
and energy prices and administered prices1,
account for the largest share of the inflation decline
both in the Czech Republic and across other CEE
inflation targeters;
Disinflation spillovers from the euro area have been
an important factor in the Czech Republic and other
CEE inflation targeters, in light of their close trade
links with the euro area and the high importcontent in domestic demand;
Nominal effective exchange rates have played an
important role in other CEE inflation targeters, but
not in the Czech Republic if we consider the entire
2012–14 period. However, they have contributed
positively since the introduction of the FX-floor
instrument by the Czech National Bank in
November 2013;

Changes in indirect taxes have contributed sizably to the easing of domestic price pressures in
the Czech Republic and to a lesser extent in other CEE inflation targeters. This reflects base

Administered prices are mostly of energy products (electricity, gas, and heating) consumed by households, but also
include healthcare. The inflation target is a medium-term one, and as such short-run deviations from the target are
tolerated particularly when caused by first-round effects of exogenous supply shocks, such as administered price
changes. Monetary policy is, however, concerned about second-round effects of supply shocks.

effects from the significant fiscal consolidation efforts across the region in 2011/12, aimed at
exiting the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure.


The domestic economic cycle— measured by the unemployment gap—has had no measurable
impact in the recent disinflationary episode.



Second-round effects, as measured by the contribution of forward-looking inflation
expectations, have not contributed to the post-2012 disinflation in the Czech Republic and can
account for 12 percent of the observed inflation variance across all CEE inflation targeters over
the period.

Analysis of the out-of-sample forecasting performance of CEE-wide regressions of
households’ and firms’ inflation expectations suggests that these models cannot fully explain
the fall in inflation expectations of both professional forecasters and the general public in the
Czech Republic in 2012–14 (Figure 4). Until mid-2014, the forecasts have eventually reverted back
to the actual realizations. It remains to be seen whether the same will occur in 2015. But, as seen
above, this has not had discernible impact on inflation so far.

(2004-2011) of the two proxies of inflation expectations on their first-lags (interacted by a dummy variable for exchange
rate regime) and the log of the world price of oil in USD, multiplied by the fraction of consumer basket spent on energy.
Consensus forecasts are for the average inflation in the years shown on the horizontal axes, made 12 months prior to the
month, for which actual inflation is shown. Consumer inflationary expectations index reflect survey responses to the
question on price trends over next 12 months. It is calculated as +1* ( "Pecentage thinking it will rise a lot")+ 1/2 *
("Pecentage thinking it will rise moderately"- 1/2 * ("Pecentage thinking it will stay about the same") - 1 * ("Pecentage
thinking it will fall").

Looking forward, consumer inflation expectations—which have historically been a good
predictor of inflation developments—show tentative signs of bottoming out. It remains to be
seen whether this will turn into a sustained trend in the remainder of 2015. However, both measures
of inflation expectations have a long way to go to return to where they were prior to the onset of
disinflation. Furthermore, it should be kept in mind that survey-based indicators can be wrong. For
example, Moghadam, Teja, and Berkmen (2014) point out that long-term inflation expectations had
also been positive on the eve of the three deflationary episodes in Japan.

Appendix II. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt declined to 43 percent of GDP in 2014 despite the fiscal relaxation, due to the favorable
cyclical developments and as the authorities used available treasury liquidity. Provided the fiscal
targets specified in the government’s convergence program are met, public debt is projected to stay
on a downward path, reaching 39 percent of GDP over the medium-term on the back of the
economic recovery and strong revenue collection. Public debt and gross financing needs are
relatively immune to a variety of isolated shocks, including a shock to real GDP growth.
Baseline and Realism of Projections
The baseline scenario assumes a structural relaxation from a deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP in
2014 to 1.5 percent in 2015 with the structural deficit gradually declining to 1 percent of GDP
by 2020. This year’s structural relaxation is mostly due to an increase in capital expenditure, and
higher health and pension spending. Projections assume a recovery of growth underpinned by
strong domestic demand, with real GDP increasing by 3.0 percent in 2015 and 2.8 percent in 2016,
and medium-term growth converging at 2.2 percent. The inflation rate is projected to gradually
move toward the 2 percent target in 2016.
The outlook for the fiscal path is benign under the baseline. Staff projects that the debt-to-GDP
ratio will decline steadily from 43 percent in 2014 to 39 percent in 2020. The ratio would also decline
in 2015 despite the expansionary fiscal stance as the authorities plan to continue relying on available
treasury liquidity. Gross financing needs are projected to stay below 8 percent of GDP throughout
the projection period.
Shock and Stress Tests
A shock to real GDP growth is the main risk over the short term. Assuming that a shock to real
GDP growth occurs with a consequent impact on the primary balance, inflation, and the real interest
rate, public debt would rise to 51 percent of GDP and gross financing needs would increase to
12 percent of GDP by 2017. Thereafter, debt would decline to 50 percent of GDP and gross financing
needs would drop to 9 percent of GDP by 2020.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The currency of the Czech Republic is the Czech koruna, created on February 8, 1993 upon the
dissolution of the currency union with the Slovak Republic, which had used the Czechoslovak koruna
as its currency. From May 3, 1993 to May 27, 1997, the exchange rate was pegged to a basket of two
currencies: the deutsche mark (65 percent) and the U.S. dollar (35 percent). On February 28, 1996,
the Czech National Bank (CNB) widened the exchange rate band from ±0.5 percent to ±7.5 percent
around the central rate. On May 27, 1997, managed floating was introduced. Between 2002
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CZECH REPUBLIC

and 2013, the CNB had not engaged in direct interventions in the foreign exchange market, and the
de facto exchange rate regime was classified as a free float. In November 2013, facing the zero lower
bound for policy rates and a persistent and large undershooting of its inflation target, the CNB
intervened in the market to weaken the currency, and announced its commitment to resist any
appreciation beyond CZK 27 per euro. Since then, the koruna traded between CZK 27.0 and
CZK 28.33 per euro. The de facto exchange rate arrangement was retroactively reclassified from
other managed to a stabilized arrangement, effective November 19, 2013. The de jure exchange rate
arrangement remains floating. On June 10, 2015, the exchange rate stood at CZK 27.27 per euro and
CZK 24.10 per U.S. dollar.
The Czech Republic has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange system
that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions. The Czech Republic maintains exchange restrictions for security reasons, based on
UN Security Council Resolutions and Council of the European Union Regulations that have been
notified to the Fund for approval under the procedures set forth in Executive Board Decision
No. 144-(52/51).
Last Article IV Consultation:
The last Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic was concluded on August 27, 2014. The staff
report and the press release were published on September 2, 2014.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
An FSAP was carried out in late 2000/ early 2001. The Financial System Stability Assessment was
considered by the Executive Board on July 16, 2001, concurrently with the staff report for the
2001 Article IV Consultation. An FSAP update was carried out in 2011. ROSCs on: banking
supervision; data dissemination; fiscal transparency; securities market; and transparency of monetary
and financial policies were published on the Fund’s external website on July 1, 2000.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General:



Data provision is adequate for surveillance.

National Accounts:



National accounts data are subject to certain weaknesses. Value added in the small scale
private sector is likely to be underestimated, as the mechanisms for data collection on this
sector are not yet fully developed and a significant proportion of unrecorded activity stems
from tax evasion. Discrepancies between GDP estimates based on the production method
and the expenditure method are large and are subsumed under change in stocks. Quarterly
estimates of national accounts are derived from quarterly reports of enterprises and surveys.
The estimates are subject to bias because of nonresponse (while annual reporting of
bookkeeping accounts is mandatory for enterprises, quarterly reporting is not) and lumping
of several expenditure categories in particular quarters by respondents. The Czech Republic
adopted the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) in September 2014. The
transition from the ESA 1995 (ESA95) required the revision of national accounts data.

Price Statistics:



The Czech Statistical Office (CSO) compiles and disseminates a monthly consumer price
index (CPI) using a weighting structure based on expenditure data collected during 2012.
Weights are updated biannually. A monthly Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is
disseminated according to European regulations. The producer price index is released
monthly with coverage including manufacturing, construction, agriculture, and select
business services (business to business only). The CSO also compiles and releases monthly
import and export price indexes based on data collected directly from establishments
engaged in export and/or import activities.

Government Finance Statistics:



Annual and quarterly fiscal data are compiled on ESA2010 basis by the Czech Statistical
Office, including non-financial accounts, financial accounts, and financial balance sheets. The
Ministry of Finance uses the ESA methodology for the Convergence Program targets. The
ESA 2010 methodology includes a wider coverage of the general government sector,
different classification of some government transactions, and impacts the calculation of
GDP. Government transactions are recorded on an accrual basis.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CZECH REPUBLIC

Monetary and Financial Statistics:



Monetary survey data provided to the European Department are generally adequate for
policy purposes. However, large variations in the interbank clearing account float, especially
at the end of the year, require caution in interpreting monetary developments. The data
published in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) are based on monetary accounts
derived from the ECB’s framework. The same set of accounts also forms the basis for
monetary statistics published in the CNB’s bulletins and on the website, which are thereby
effectively harmonized with the monetary statistics published in IFS, although the
presentation in IFS differs somewhat from the CNB’s.

Financial sector surveillance:



CNB is reporting Financial Soundness Indicators for Deposit Takers on a quarterly basis.

External sector statistics:



Starting in 2014, external sector statistics are compiled according to the Balance of Payments
and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition (BPM6) and in accordance with
legal requirements of the ECB and Eurostat. Balance of payments financial account
transactions are generally derived from changes in stock data adjusted by exchange rate,
price, and other changes; they are not directly based on the value of current transactions.
Quarterly external debt statistics are reported to the Quarterly External Debt Statistics
(QEDS) database.
