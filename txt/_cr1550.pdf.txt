STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND REQUEST FOR STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context. Serbia is facing a weak economy, serious fiscal imbalances, and protracted
structural challenges. The new government appointed in 2014 has a window of
opportunity to address these issues, with support from a new Fund program.
Fiscal policy. Strong fiscal consolidation over the program period—largely based on
curbing mandatory spending and reducing state aid to state-owned enterprises
(SOEs)—is needed to put public debt on a downward path. These measures will be
supported by strengthening public financial management (PFM).
Monetary and exchange rate policy. The inflation targeting framework is appropriate
and the flexible exchange rate should remain an important shock absorber. Fiscal
consolidation creates room for gradually easing monetary policy.
Financial sector policy. The financial sector has remained broadly resilient, but special
diagnostic studies are necessary to gauge potential capital shortfalls and establish a
consistent baseline for financial sector policies under the program. The high level of
non-performing loans (NPLs) is a major challenge requiring a comprehensive strategy.
Structural reforms. Broad-based structural reforms, notably to improve the business
environment and resolve loss-making SOEs, should foster Serbia’s medium-term growth
potential and reduce fiscal risks.
Program modalities. The proposed program supports the authorities’ medium-term
policy goals to restore fiscal sustainability, bolster growth, and boost financial sector
resilience. The authorities request a precautionary 36-month Stand-By Arrangement
(SBA) with access of SDR 935.4 million (200 percent of quota, or about €1,122 million).
Staff support the request and believe that this program will underpin Serbia’s resilience
against adverse shocks that could give rise to a balance of payments need.

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

CONTEXT
1.
The Serbian economy has been facing protracted structural challenges. Prior to the
2008 global financial crisis, strong growth was achieved at the expense of accumulating internal
and external imbalances (Figure 1). At the same time, the unfinished structural reform agenda
led to mounting competitiveness problems, poor labor market outcomes, large current account
deficits, high and volatile inflation, and periodic exchange rate pressures (Figures 2 and 3). Weak
public institutions and large fiscal imbalances in recent years have led to a rapid buildup of
public debt (Figure 4). In addition, Serbia was hit by exogenous shocks, such as an extreme
winter and drought in 2012, and devastating floods in 2014. As a result, Serbia’s GDP is still
below its pre-crisis level.
2.
Serbia now has a window of opportunity to break from past policies and embark on
stabilization and reform. The new coalition government, appointed in April 2014 and
commanding a parliamentary majority, reaffirmed Serbia’s path of EU accession and committed
to implementing reforms needed to restore macroeconomic stability and achieve sustainable
growth. This commitment has already been underscored by the launch of important structural
reforms and strong steps toward fiscal consolidation (Box 1). To support their reform program,
the authorities have requested a three-year precautionary SBA.
Box 1. Implementation of Past Fund Advice
The implementation of past Article IV recommendations accelerated in 2014. While the authorities
agreed with many of the Fund’s recommendations in past years, policy implementation had been
incomplete. In 2014, important structural reforms were introduced in the summer and fiscal consolidation
started in the fall.
In the fiscal area, the Fund’s past advice focused on: (i) regaining fiscal sustainability through a reduction of
mandatory spending; (ii) improving public financial management; and (iii) raising the efficiency of tax
administration. A fiscal rule and a public debt ceiling (45 percent of GDP) introduced in 2011 to strengthen
fiscal discipline were not followed and the fiscal situation deteriorated subsequently. Despite measures
implemented in the past two years (i.e., VAT and CIT tax rate increases in 2012, lower wage and pension
indexation in 2012–13, and a solidarity tax on high public wages with an attrition rule in the civil service in
early 2014), the consolidation efforts were piecemeal and the size of the adjustment was limited. However,
important fiscal consolidation measures have been introduced since mid-2014, including a parametric
pension reform in line with the Fund’s advice, a 10 percent public sector wage cut, and a progressive
reduction of pensions (MEFP ¶¶6–7). While there have been modest improvements in the PFM area, notably
in arrears monitoring and control, tax administration reform has yet to start.
In the area of monetary and financial sector policies, the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) maintained a tight
monetary policy stance in the presence of loose fiscal policy and uncertain capital flows, in line with the
Fund’s previous advice. However, the NBS tightly managed the exchange rate through foreign exchange
market interventions till mid-2014. Furthermore, the gap between the key policy rate and the average
reverse repo rate, which sends an uncertain signal about the monetary policy stance, has remained. While
weaknesses in several public banks eventually prompted resolutions at the expense of taxpayers, strong
prudential policies were maintained, in line with the Fund’s recommendations. Notable progress has been

made in the area of strengthening the bank resolution framework, in collaboration with the Fund, the World
Bank, and the EBRD.
The related legislative changes have been finalized in early February 2015.
In structural areas, the Fund had previously advised: (i) labor market reforms to foster private sector job
creation and tackle persistently high unemployment; (ii) regulatory reforms to improve Serbia’s rigid
business environment; and (iii) public enterprise reforms to reduce excessive state intervention in public
enterprises. While these reforms had largely stalled in the past years, important legislative reforms were
introduced since mid-2014 in line with the Fund’s advice. Comprehensive amendments to the Labor Law
have provided a legal basis for more efficient labor market functioning, and amendments to the Urban
Planning and Construction Law cleared the way for more timely issuance of construction permits, removing
a key bottleneck for investment. Recent changes to the Bankruptcy Law and a new Privatization Law have
created more effective tools needed to resolve non-viable state and socially-owned enterprises. The
authorities have also offered more than 500 socially-owned enterprises for sale in 2014.

market, and real net earnings remained flat.
Credit to the economy continued to contract due to the challenging economic environment and
NPL overhang.
4.
Inflation fell to record low levels due to contracting domestic demand and low
imported inflation. Headline inflation has been below the inflation tolerance (IT) band due to a
decline in food prices since late 2013 (Figure 6). Core inflation fell subsequently as well,
suggesting broad-based disinflation pressures, similar to trends observed in the region. In
response, the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) reduced the key policy rate by 50 basis points to

revised upward by an average of about 7 percent. This reduces all ratios as a share of GDP compared to

5.
The gradual adjustment of the current account was interrupted by the floods and
weak external demand. The improvement in the current account deficit in 2013, mainly due to
expanding automobile exports, halted in 2014 on account of flood-related net electricity imports
and a slower European market for automobiles, though lower oil prices in the second half of
2014 partly compensated for the expansion of imports (Figure 7).
6.
International reserves remained at comfortable levels despite capital outflows. The
dinar came under pressure in the second half of 2014, as the widening current account deficit
compounded the effects of continued net outflows from the banking sector and debt service by
the public sector. This was further amplified by a weakening of market sentiment toward Serbia
due to delayed fiscal adjustment and uncertainty regarding the policy course. In response, the
NBS increased exchange rate flexibility after almost a year-long period of tight management,
though foreign exchange market interventions continued (Figure 8). Despite a reduction by
€1.3 billion over 12 months, gross international reserves stood at 6¾ months of imports (or at
205 percent of the Fund reserves metric, well above the 100–150 recommended range) at
end-2014.
7.
While the 2014 budget took steps toward fiscal adjustment, the headline deficit
worsened, largely as a result of the floods. The legislated consolidation measures included a
new solidarity tax on public wages and a tax on farmer income, introduction of a 5:1 attrition rule
in public administration, and an increase in the lower VAT rate from 8 to 10 percent.
Nevertheless, the flood-induced recession and the ensuing recovery spending led to the
approval of a supplementary budget in October 2014. As a result, the general government deficit

Required reserves ratios were reduced from 29 to 26 percent for maturities of less than two years and from

increased to an estimated 7½ percent of GDP in 2014, public debt reached about 70 percent of

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
The authorities and staff agreed that the policies of the past are not sustainable.
Failure to address the problems in public finances and delays in structural reforms would result
in persistently high fiscal deficits and rising public debt ratios, with adverse implications for
borrowing costs, market access, and growth.
9.
Macroeconomic stability and balanced growth can be achieved with a rebalanced
macro-policy mix and broad-based structural reforms. The program scenario envisages the
following outcomes:3


GDP would continue to contract in 2015 due to the sizeable, but necessary, fiscal
consolidation, and return to moderate growth in 2016–17. The recovery would strengthen
over the medium term on account of a virtuous circle of positive confidence effects, falling
interest rates, improved competitiveness, and higher foreign direct investment (FDI),
supported by monetary easing and structural reforms (Figures 9, 10, and Tables 1–7). The
authorities pointed out that the growth outlook has upside potential arising from prospective
large foreign-financed investment projects if they materialize, and from faster-than-expected
improvement in confidence.

3

The program scenario and targets agreed with the authorities are based on the IMF’s oil price assumptions as of
November 2014 (the time of the negotiations). Oil price projections have since declined further. This would
reduce the current account deficit in the absence of offsetting volume increases, provide stimulus for economic
activity, and restrain inflation. The macro framework will be updated as needed at the time of the first review in
line with the most recent forecast for commodity prices.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA



The currently very low inflation is expected to return to the center of the NBS tolerance band
(4±1½ percent) by end-2015 due to regulated price increases, recovery of agricultural prices,
past depreciation, and loosening of monetary policy, which will cushion the contraction in
domestic demand.



The current account deficit is projected to narrow to 4¾ percent of GDP in 2015 despite
continued flood-related imports, and to adjust further over the medium term to 3¾ percent
of GDP (Tables 3a and 3b). The exchange rate is seen as broadly in line with fundamentals
(Box 2).
Box 2. External Sustainability Assessment

Serbia’s large current account deficit has partially adjusted since the onset of the global crisis. Yet at
end-2014, the current account deficit was still among the highest in the region with a significant portion
financed through debt. Serbia’s export base is narrow, owing to deep-rooted competitiveness problems,
structural rigidities, and a weak business environment, which have led to a low share of FDI (particularly
greenfield) in tradable sectors. Floods that affected Serbia in 2014 and slow growth in external demand from
the EU have been recently reflected in a significant export slowdown.

adequate reserve buffers, and reduce Serbia’s net indebtedness to the rest of the world. Policies oriented
toward reducing the weight of public expenditure in GDP should contribute significantly to this adjustment,
aided by broad-based structural reforms that would improve competitiveness of Serbia’s economy, and
boost its growth potential. In this scenario, the current account deficit is expected to decrease from about
6 percent of GDP in 2014 to 3¾ percent of GDP in 2020. Macro balance and external sustainability
approaches—based on the IMF’s Consultative Group on Exchange Rate Issues (CGER) methodology—
suggest that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals under the program scenario.

Eastern European countries.
Therefore, the external
sustainability approach applied here uses the average (NFA) of countries in the region (-68 percent of GDP),
rather than Serbia’s existing NFA, to estimate the current account norm of 4 percent of GDP. With the
current account deficit projected to decrease to 3¾ percent of GDP after the programmed policy
adjustment, this implies an exchange rate undervaluation of 1¼ percent, which is well within the error
margin.
The macro balance approach estimates Serbia’s current account norm at 5½ percent of GDP, and an
exchange rate undervaluation of 6½ percent. Serbia’s NFA at -94 percent of GDP is an input into this
calculation which partly explains this high current account norm. Staff’s view is that a current norm of
5½ percent of GDP is likely to be overestimated, as Serbia should lower its debt-related external
vulnerabilities in the medium term, given a conservative outlook for FDI.
____________________
1/ The suggested appropriate range is 100–150 percent. See IMF, “Assessing Reserve Adequacy,” 2011.

10.
The outlook is subject to significant downside risks (Table 8). On the external side, a
protracted period of slow growth among trading partners may reduce Serbia’s growth. Possible
spillovers from evolving regional geopolitical tensions and any related disruptions to Serbia’s
natural gas supply could hurt the economy. Serbia’s financing needs are large and susceptible
to changes in global market sentiment. On the domestic side, the impact of sustained fiscal
consolidation on the already anemic domestic demand could be stronger than expected. The
resolution of large SOEs could add unanticipated pressures on public finances. Finally,
comprehensive reforms—especially fiscal adjustment and SOE restructuring—may face
resistance. The realization of these risks would both compromise medium- to long-term growth
prospects and exacerbate underlying debt sustainability concerns.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: ACHIEVING
MACROECONOMIC STABILITY AND SUSTAINED
GROWTH
Discussions focused on policies over the program period of 2015–17 and beyond aimed at reducing
the fiscal deficits and restoring public debt sustainability, strengthening competitiveness and
growth, and boosting financial sector resilience.

A. Fiscal Policy: Restoring Public Debt Sustainability
Background
11.
Public finances deteriorated in the past several years. The core problems arose from:
(i) declining revenues despite tax rate hikes, (ii) continued rise of already unsustainably high
mandatory spending, especially public wage and pension bills, (iii) expanding state aid to ailing
SOEs, usually in the form of direct subsidies and guarantees for borrowing which often were
called, and (iv) cost of resolving ailing public banks (Figure 4).4 This was partially offset by the
compression of capital spending, in part arising from the inability to execute budgeted projects.
While most of the external public debt is owed to multilateral and bilateral creditors, which has

Policy discussions
13.
The authorities and staff agreed that a strong adjustment program is needed to
stabilize public debt by 2017 and put it firmly on a downward path thereafter. This
requires a reduction of the structural primary fiscal balance by about 3½ percent of GDP during
2015–17. The authorities viewed frontloading of measures as feasible in view of the political
momentum that has been built, and as appropriate to enhance the credibility of reforms. The
2015 budget and supportive legislation approved by the National Assembly in December 2014
reflect these efforts. Over the medium term, the authorities considered the EU’s Stability and
Growth Pact (SGP) as a relevant fiscal anchor and concurred with staff that SGP criteria should
be reached by the time of EU accession.

14.
Despite the large fiscal adjustment, the projected decline in public debt is
susceptible to a number of shocks (Annex I). In particular, the debt sustainability analysis
suggests that a standard shock to real GDP growth would considerably increase the peak level
of the public debt. In addition, the high share of foreign currency debt, which has been
exacerbated by the issuance of eurobonds since 2011, gives rise to a significant vulnerability to
currency depreciations. Furthermore, staff simulations indicate that debt sustainability could be
jeopardized if only half of the envisaged fiscal adjustment is implemented over the program
period (Figure 9). However, the authorities agreed to use potential proceeds from forthcoming
privatizations to reduce the stock of public debt, while also creating room for high-return
investment projects (MEFP ¶30).
15.
To achieve the required consolidation, the authorities will rely primarily on durable
expenditure measures. The package of fiscal consolidation measures, many of which have
already been introduced in late 2014, is expected to yield gross nominal savings of 4¾ percent
of GDP compared to unchanged policies and generate the targeted structural adjustment. The
measures aim to address primarily unsustainable mandatory spending and reduce state aid
(Table 6). In addition, the fiscal frameworks will be strengthened by improving fiscal institutions
and implementing PFM reforms. Given that various tax rates have already been raised in the
past two years, staff emphasized that future efforts should focus primarily on improving the
efficiency of tax collections and broadening the tax base in line with the Fund’s recent technical
assistance, but advised against assuming associated fiscal gains in the macro framework. The
authorities supported this approach and agreed to use any unanticipated revenue gains to
reduce public debt in 2015, and thereafter to split them between reducing debt and supporting
high-priority investments (MEFP ¶10). Contingency measures, such as raising the VAT and
gasoline excise taxes, would be considered in the event of revenue shortfalls (MEFP ¶10).

Tackling unsustainable mandatory spending
16.
The authorities recognized that curbing the sizeable spending on public wages and
pensions is critical for a durable fiscal adjustment. Thus, the program envisages a reduction
of the wage and pension bills to more sustainable levels of 7 and 11 percent of GDP,
respectively, supported by the following measures:

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA



Public wage reduction was the first step taken toward curbing mandatory expenditure
(MEFP ¶6). An across-the-board 10 percent nominal wage cut (while protecting the minimum
monthly wage of 25,000 dinars) was legislated with the 2014 supplementary budget and
became effective as of November 2014. The cut applies to the broader public sector,
including SOEs, which will help reduce the reliance of some SOEs on subsidies. In addition,
legislation adopted in December 2014 suspends nominal indexation of wages until the wage
bill (excluding severance payments) reaches the target level by the end of the program
period (MEFP ¶8).



A comprehensive general government wage system reform will follow the wage cuts, with
the aim to simplify it and make it more manageable and equitable across various general
government entities. It will include aligning base wages, unifying pay grades across
comparable jobs, streamlining the wage coefficients, and integrating other elements of pay
into the wage base. As the reform requires substantial preparation, staff concurred with the
authorities that the transition period to the new system will be determined in the course of
2015 (MEFP ¶8).



Rightsizing general government employment. The authorities have committed to a twostage process. General government employment will be reduced by 5 percent through the
continued application of the attrition rule and targeted separations by mid-2015 (MEFP ¶8).
Subsequently, there will be additional rightsizing based on deeper reform of the general
government employment through organizational and functional restructuring in 2016–17
(MEFP ¶9).



Pension bill reduction. A progressive cut in nominal pensions (22 percent for pensions
between 25,000 and 40,000 dinars and 25 percent for higher pensions) was legislated from
November 2014 to yield an effective 5 percent reduction of the pension bill. The parametric
pension system changes implemented in mid-2014 (a higher statutory retirement age for
women, increased minimum retirement age, and introduction of actuarial penalties for early
retirement) will help maintain the sustainability of the pension system in the longer term
(MEFP ¶7).

Reducing state aid
17.
The authorities aim to reduce subsidies and have launched a reform of inefficient
and loss-making SOEs to curb the need for state aid. The program focuses on the reduction
of subsidies and elimination of liquidity support to the largest SOEs which have been the main
recipients of budget support in past years, particularly in the transportation and energy sectors
(MEFP ¶8). Moreover, the authorities concurred that a comprehensive reform of the largest SOEs
is needed to strengthen their financial positions and contain fiscal risks over time (MEFP ¶31).
These reforms are being designed in cooperation with other international financial institutions
(IFIs) and the EU. In addition, subsidies to agriculture have been reduced from 2015.
Improving fiscal institutions and PFM reform
18.
The authorities are committed to improving the PFM framework. They agreed with
staff that limiting fiscal risks and strengthening institutions will support fiscal consolidation.
Specific measures, in line with IMF technical assistance recommendations, will aim to bolster
fiscal planning by introducing three-year expenditure ceilings, and strengthen the Ministry of
Finance’s capacity to monitor and control fiscal risks. Staff recommended that the authorities
perform fiscal impact analysis of all new legislative initiatives, ensure full assessment of all
proposed public-private partnerships (PPPs), increase fiscal transparency, and reinforce
expenditure control (MEFP ¶11).

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy: Keeping Inflation under Control
Background
19.
Controlling inflation has been a challenge for Serbia’s inflation targeting (IT)
regime. Inflation has been frequently outside the tolerance band since the inception of the
full-fledged IT framework in 2009. The factors contributing to the high inflation volatility were:
(i) sizeable food price shocks that stemmed partly from protection of agricultural markets and
relatively low food imports, (ii) large pass-through from periodic bouts of depreciation, (iii) weak
monetary policy transmission mechanism due to exceptionally high euroization, and
(iv) unpredictable changes in regulated prices.

Tight monetary policy had to compensate for the overly loose fiscal policy. Serbia’s
mounting fiscal imbalances and public debt kept the risk premium (measured by the EMBIG
spread) generally higher than in peer countries. This imposed constraints on monetary policy,
requiring relatively high policy interest rates to ward off exchange rate pressures, led to elevated
interest rates on bank lending, and dampened credit growth.

Policy discussions
21.
The NBS reaffirmed its commitment to inflation targeting and the flexible
exchange rate regime. Staff agreed that the inflation targeting system remains appropriate for
Serbia, despite the challenges in its implementation, as it helps anchor inflation expectations. In
view of the exchange rate’s important role as shock absorber, especially given widespread price
and wage rigidities, staff supported the increasing exchange rate flexibility observed in the

second half of 2014 and cautioned against large-scale or sustained foreign exchange market
interventions. The authorities reaffirmed that interventions are used only for smoothing
excessive volatility (MEFP ¶15). Staff also emphasized the need for better liquidity management
and coordination, and the authorities agreed to reestablish the Liquidity Management
Committee (MEFP ¶11).
22.
The NBS and staff agreed that the fiscal consolidation now underway creates room
for further gradual monetary policy easing. The fiscal adjustment initiated in late 2014—
against a background of declining domestic credit—creates space for the loosening of
monetary policy (MEFP ¶14). This rebalancing of the policy mix will help to reduce real interest
rates and foster credit growth to the economy. However, staff emphasized that the pace of
easing should be cautious and reflect external financing conditions, inflation expectations, and
the progress in fiscal consolidation. Staff therefore recommended that future key policy rate
reductions should take place only in the absence of balance of payments pressures. Staff also
supported the recent reductions in the reserve requirements, which were set at high levels to
stem large capital inflows during the pre-crisis years. There was also agreement that the capital
account liberalization required in the context of EU accession should be gradual, particularly in
removing restrictions on inflows to short-term securities and the ability of residents to open
deposits abroad (MEFP ¶16).

C. Financial Sector: Preserving Stability and Reviving Credit Growth
The program aims to support financial sector stability and resilience, while improving financial
intermediation. The financial sector agenda is built around diagnostics of banks’ balance sheets, an
overhaul of the bank resolution framework, and the development of a comprehensive strategy to
address high levels of distressed debt.

Serbian subsidiaries of foreign banks, arising from low credit demand. As a result, the system’s
loan-to-deposit ratio has improved to about 95 percent. However, the profitability of the
Serbian banking sector has been below the regional average, in part due to the difficult
macroeconomic environment and reduced business volumes (Figure 11 and Table 9).
24.
Nonperforming loans pose a significant challenge for Serbian banks. Since 2008, the
NPL ratio has more than doubled, exceeding those of most regional peers (Figure 11).
Corporate NPLs are particularly high (almost 30 percent of corporate loans in 2014:Q3) and
constitute the bulk of the overall distressed debt. At the same time, high regulatory loan-loss
reserves, which exceed provisioning on the basis of International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) accounting standards, provide a capital cushion against credit losses, and thus help
underpin financial sector stability. However, such regulatory requirements do not result in losses
being recognized in banks’ financial statements.
25.
Mounting vulnerabilities in some state-owned banks led to their failures. Four of
these banks fell into distress and had to be resolved at a significant fiscal cost of 1¾ percent of
GDP over 2012–14. Their resolution also revealed challenges in the application of the existing
bank resolution framework. As a result, the government developed a comprehensive strategy
for state-owned banks in 2014 to enhance their resilience (MEFP ¶23), which is being
implemented. In particular, it aims to bolster institutions that fulfill a strategic function in the
Serbian banking system, while selling or winding down in an orderly fashion other state-owned
institutions, including via asset and liability transfers. The authorities are also committed to
strengthening banks’ corporate governance and risk control frameworks, in accordance with
international best practices.
26.
Credit to the economy has contracted since 2013, putting a drag on the economic
recovery. The authorities believe that this is due to both demand and supply-side constraints,
as weak economic prospects lead to low demand for credit. At the same time, high corporate
indebtedness and perceived credit risk prompt banks to tighten lending standards and reduce
their willingness to extend credit, thereby weakening financial intermediation.

Policy discussions
27.
The authorities and staff agreed that a thorough assessment of the banks’ balance
sheets is necessary to anchor the financial sector policy agenda. These diagnostic studies,
similar to asset quality reviews conducted in EU countries, will help verify the health of the
banking system, dispel uncertainty about banks’ asset quality, and guide regulatory and
supervisory policies (MEFP ¶20). They will shed light on banks’ collateral valuation practices,
assess the adequacy of provisioning, and provide better information for combating
vulnerabilities. In parallel, the authorities will further enhance the supervisory and regulatory
frameworks by leveraging standards and requirements contained in the EU’s Single Rule Book,
international best practices, and the insights drawn from the diagnostic studies (MEFP ¶19).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

28.
The authorities, in collaboration with IFIs, are committed to designing and
implementing a comprehensive strategy for dealing with NPLs. There was broad agreement
that, if left unchecked, high NPLs can adversely affect financial stability, as credit losses sap bank
profitability. The strategy should thus aim to: (i) assess, and—where necessary—enhance banks’
capacity for dealing with NPLs; (ii) promote out-of-court restructuring; (iii) improve in-court
corporate debt-resolution mechanisms; and (iv) remove impediments obstructing the
development of a market for distressed debt (MEFP ¶22). Given the multidimensional nature of
the debt overhang, the implementation of the strategy will require strong commitment and the
collaboration of all stakeholders.
29.
The authorities have taken steps to significantly strengthen the bank resolution
framework, with technical assistance from the Fund. The reform establishes a robust
framework that will facilitate timely resolution of banks while minimizing fiscal risks (MEFP ¶21).
The new framework reflects international best practices and draws, as appropriate for Serbia’s
specific conditions, on the EU’s Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive. The framework is based
on the principle of loss allocation to private sector participants in line with creditor hierarchy. It
expands the menu of resolution powers and tools to allow early and decisive intervention. It
also improves transparency and predictability through legal and procedural clarity and advance
preparation for orderly resolution. Moreover, resolution powers will be centralized at the NBS,
with safeguards to duly separate resolution and supervision functions. In parallel, the
governance and operational capacity of the Deposit Insurance Agency is being strengthened
with technical assistance from the World Bank and the European Bank of Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD).
30.
The authorities will continue to implement measures aimed at increasing
dinarization of the financial system to strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism.
Staff agreed that maintaining macroeconomic stability and keeping inflation within the target
range will help improve confidence and promote demand for dinar-denominated assets. Staff
also supported efforts to lengthen the maturity of dinar-denominated government securities in
the local market and to promote hedging instruments (MEFP ¶24).

environment reduces incentives for investment—the stock of FDI per capita is significantly lower
compared with the New Member States of the EU. This, in turn, hampers private sector growth
and competitiveness, and leads to a narrow export base and wide current account deficits. The
structural and labor market rigidities have also contributed to persistently high unemployment
(particularly among young people), low labor force participation rate, and relatively high
reliance on remittances from abroad (Figures 3 and 7). This poses a key social concern. In
addition, significant resources are trapped in inefficient public enterprises (Box 3).
Box 3. Public Enterprises in Serbia
Public enterprises represent an important share of the Serbian economy. As of end-2014, more than
1,400 public enterprises had over 250,000 employees, accounting for 15–20 percent of total formal
employment. This comprised mainly state and local public enterprises (almost 800), as well as a large number
of socially-owned enterprises (more than 600), of which 512 are in restructuring and privatization processes
in the Privatization Agency (PA) portfolio. In addition, there are also several joint-stock or limited liability
companies operating in competitive industries (such as Telekom). Public enterprises include some of the
largest employers in the country, such as Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS-electricity generation) and Zeleznice
Srbije (Serbia Railways), which employed around 38,000 and 18,000 workers, respectively, as of end-2014.
The fiscal costs associated with the public enterprises have been rising rapidly in recent years. Direct
fiscal costs include subsidies, net lending, and payments of called guarantees. These amounted to more than
2 percent of GDP in 2014, and were concentrated in 7 companies, largely in the transportation and energy
sectors. These costs have risen rapidly in the past few years, mainly due to the worsening performance of the
SOEs, and could rise further if the underlying problems

from tax and social contribution arrears mainly among

include implicit subsidies on borrowing costs due to

Policy discussion
32.
The authorities and staff agreed that structural reforms are essential to boost
Serbia’s growth potential. There are three broad priorities to be implemented over the
medium term: (i) job creation, (ii) improving the business environment and competitiveness, and
(iii) resolution and reform of SOEs:


Job creation. The authorities took a key step in adopting amendments to the Labor Law in
mid-2014 aimed at removing disincentives for hiring and making wage bargaining and
employment procedures more flexible. Specifically, the reform limits severance payments by
linking them to service with the current employer rather than life-time employment, extends
the maximum length of temporary contracts from one year to two years, clarifies and
simplifies separation rules, and tightens the rules for extensions of collective agreements to
all firms in the sector. Staff welcomed these changes and advised that steadfast
implementation of the law is key for labor market efficiency (MEFP ¶27). The authorities
underscored that job creation is a central element of their economic policies. They also
committed to implementing their National Employment Strategy for 2011–20 and the
National Employment Action Plan for 2015, which envisage specific job-supporting
programs. These comprise job matching services, career counseling and training for both
pre-redundancy workers and the unemployed, employer subsidies targeting disadvantaged
job seekers, and self-employment support. Staff also emphasized the importance of
evenhanded application of severance payments across the public sector, in light of the
forthcoming rightsizing of the public administration and resolution of SOEs.



Improving the business environment. The authorities committed to a number of shortand medium-term measures, aimed at removing obstacles to private sector development,
attracting new investments, and fostering job creation (MEFP ¶32). These include, among
others, (i) implementation of the regulatory framework for establishing one-stop shops for
issuing construction permits, and for conversion of land-usage rights into ownership rights,
(ii) adoption and implementation of a new Investment Law to enable efficient coordination of
investment-related permits, and (iii) implementation of a strategy for improving the business
environment for the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) for 2015–20.



Resolution and reform of SOEs. The authorities are committed to wide-ranging SOE
reforms in order to improve their operational viability and limit fiscal risks (MEFP ¶28–31). In
this regard, staff welcomed the recent amendments to the Bankruptcy Law and the new
Privatization Law, which were pre-requisites for a successful implementation of this reform.
Going forward, a significant reduction of state aid to SOEs is a key priority of the program, to
be achieved by: (i) curtailing direct and indirect subsidies, (ii) limiting issuance of new
guarantees, and (iii) enhancing accountability, transparency, and monitoring of these
enterprises. The program includes strategies for two broad categories of state-owned
enterprises. The first group includes over 500 companies in the portfolio of the Privatization
Agency, of which almost 200 have been slated for immediate bankruptcy, over 200 will be
privatized, and resolution for the remainder was put on hold until technical and legal issues

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

are resolved. The second group comprises large SOEs including the electricity, gas, railways
and road companies, where corporate and financial restructuring plans need to be developed
in the course of 2015 and implemented in the coming years (MEFP ¶31). These plans will
determine specific future steps for improving collections, increasing efficiency and cost
savings, and tariff increases: (i) the electricity generation company (EPS) will underpin its
sustainability by financial restructuring, which will include raising regulated electricity prices
and thereby moving household tariffs closer to cost-recovery levels, (ii) Srbijagas will reduce
its reliance on subsidies after an increase in natural gas network fees and resolution of its
biggest debtors, (iii) Railways of Serbia will cut costs in the context of a comprehensive
organizational and financial restructuring, and (iv) the road companies will be merged and
their efficiency boosted by corporate and financial restructuring. The SOE reforms are
drawing on expertise of other IFIs.

PROGRAM MODALITIES AND RISKS
33.
A 36-month precautionary SBA with access of SDR 935.4 million (200 percent of
quota, or about €1,122 million) is proposed. Such long-term engagement is appropriate in
light of the comprehensive medium-term fiscal and structural agenda, and in line with the last
ex-post evaluation (EPE/EPA). Staff expect the public debt-to-GDP ratio to be stabilized and the
growth prospects to improve by the end of the program, thus putting debt firmly on a
downward trajectory thereafter.
34.
The arrangement is expected to be precautionary. The potential balance of payments
need would arise from adverse trade and financial spillovers, such as a delay in the recovery of
euro area economic activity and tighter global liquidity conditions. The high level of foreign
exchange reserves provides the first line of defense against a moderate deterioration of external
conditions. Against this backdrop, staff believe that access of 200 percent of quota
(935.4 million SDRs) should provide adequate insurance against external shocks that could be
triggered by the above-mentioned “normal-sized” risks (Table 11). The phasing of purchases
reflects the front-loaded fiscal and structural conditionality, and elevated external risks
emanating from a potential abrupt surge in global financial market volatility (Table 12).
However, realization of tail risks could require higher access and possibly more adjustment.
35.
The proposed Fund-supported program will be monitored through quarterly
reviews. Given that the key role of the SBA is to act as a commitment device in support of a
comprehensive fiscal and structural reform agenda, the program will be monitored on a
quarterly basis. The proposed quarterly performance criteria and indicative targets, as well as
prior actions for the approval of the arrangement and structural benchmarks under the SBA, are
summarized in Tables 1 and 2 in the MEFP. The prior actions include: (i) parliamentary approval
of the 2015 budget and the accompanying legislation, (ii) parliamentary approval of legislative
changes of the bank resolution framework, (iii) parliamentary approval of amendments to the
Law on the Development Fund, and (iv) elimination of state aid—including budget subsidies,

government guarantees, lending from the budget, or any other forms of public support—to
steel producer Zelezara Smederevo and preventing accumulation of arrears by this company.
36.
In the program scenario, Serbia’s capacity to repay the Fund is projected to remain
strong, although high public and external debt are important risks. On the basis of
outstanding credit, Serbia’s annual repayments to the Fund will be below 2 percent of gross
reserves in 2015 and will decline to 0.1 percent of gross reserves by 2017. Even if the downside
external risks discussed above were to materialize, and full drawings of 200 percent of quota
were made under the new SBA, repayments to the Fund after the end of the proposed SBA
would remain at or below 6½ percent of gross reserves (Table 13). Public sector and external
debt stocks are expected to remain high during the program period, reaching 78 and 87 percent
of GDP, respectively, in 2016. Program implementation would place both of them on a firm
downward path thereafter. An update of the 2011 safeguards assessment of the NBS has been
initiated and is envisaged to be completed by the first review.
37.
Risks to the program are significant. Resistance to deep structural reforms and fiscal
adjustment could undermine program implementation, which is key to reducing the public debt
ratio in the medium term. Delays in SOE resolution and weaknesses in selected public banks
could add unanticipated pressures on public finances. Moreover, sustained anemic domestic
demand in the context of large fiscal consolidation could weaken growth prospects, particularly
given an uncertain regional outlook, including from possible spillovers from evolving geopolitical
tensions. Finally, an uncertain and volatile global outlook could complicate access to financing.
The realization of these risks could compromise the envisaged debt reduction strategy. Thus
there is little room for slippage if public debt is to stabilize by 2017, which highlights the
appropriateness of front-loaded and legislated measures under the program.

STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
The Serbian economy faces serious challenges. Persistent fiscal imbalances led to
sharp accumulation of public debt. Chronic delays of key structural reforms eroded Serbia’s
competitiveness and medium-term growth potential, and contributed to feeble job creation and
very high unemployment. Structural rigidities and the weak economy led to the accumulation of
high NPLs, hampering financial intermediation. Moreover, there are significant risks as the
external environment remains unsettled.
39.
Serbia is now poised to break from past policies and embark on a reform path.
Status quo economic policies are not sustainable. The authorities’ program, supported by the
proposed precautionary SBA, aims to: (i) restore public debt sustainability by rebalancing the
policy mix toward tighter fiscal and easier monetary policy, (ii) enhance financial sector
resilience, and (iii) improve competitiveness and medium-term growth potential. The program is
expected to underpin a robust recovery over the medium term.

40.
Significant fiscal consolidation is needed to regain control of the public sector debt.
A structural fiscal adjustment of 3½ percent of GDP over the program period is needed to reach
the objective of placing public debt firmly on a downward path by 2017. The frontloaded
adjustment package will help stabilize public debt sooner, taking advantage of the reform
momentum that has been built, and signaling credibility of the reforms. The projected decline in
public debt is susceptible to shocks, although potential privatization receipts could mitigate the
risks.
41.
Fiscal adjustment should rely primarily on containing expenditures. Mandatory
spending should be reduced through wage and pension cuts, suspended indexation, rightsizing
of public administration, and the effects of the parametric pension reform. Furthermore, reforms
of SOEs are needed to reduce state aid and fiscal risks. Improvements in tax administration are
essential to provide an upside revenue potential for the fiscal program.
42.
Strengthening the public financial management framework is needed to support
fiscal consolidation. Better fiscal planning with a medium-term focus, strengthened capacity to
monitor and control fiscal risks, increased fiscal transparency, and reinforced expenditure
control are critical to reduce fiscal vulnerabilities.
43.
The inflation targeting system remains appropriate for Serbia, and should be
underpinned by consistent implementation of monetary and exchange rate policies. To
preserve exchange rate flexibility, interventions should be used only for smoothing excessive
volatility. The rebalancing of the policy mix will allow a gradual lowering of the key policy rate
while meeting the inflation target. This, in turn, will help support credit growth and cushion the
effect of the fiscal adjustment on domestic demand.
44.
Financial sector policies should aim to strengthen financial system resilience and
maintain stability. The special diagnostic studies of banks should guide policies to address
financial sector vulnerabilities and strengthen Serbia’s regulatory and supervisory frameworks.
Strong implementation of the recently revamped bank resolution framework is essential for
more effective resolutions of banks while containing costs. A comprehensive strategy is needed
to resolve the high NPLs and promote private sector lending.
45.
The medium-term growth potential critically depends on the implementation of
comprehensive structural reforms. The recent amendments of the Labor Law, parametric
pension reform, streamlining construction permits, and the launch of resolution procedures for
socially-owned enterprises have been important steps which demonstrate the authorities’
commitment to change the status quo. Vigorous implementation of these reforms will be
essential for restoring competitiveness of the economy, stimulating investment, and supporting
growth recovery over the medium term. To the same end, further efforts will also be necessary
to improve the business climate, execute the national anti-corruption strategy, and reform large
SOEs.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

46.
Risks to the program are significant, but are mitigated by the authorities’
commitment to frontloaded fiscal adjustment and structural reforms. Given the size of the
fiscal adjustment and the breadth and depth of the proposed reforms, their implementation
could face resistance. Fiscal slippages or delays in reforming SOEs would jeopardize the key
objective of restoring debt sustainability. Furthermore, the external environment could prove to
be worse than expected, making fiscal adjustment and reform more challenging. These risks are
mitigated by the authorities’ commitment to frontloaded fiscal measures and broad-based
structural reforms. Consistent implementation of reform policies is crucial for achieving the
program’s objectives.
47.
Staff support the authorities’ request for a Stand-By Arrangement. In view of the
policy measures already taken and the authorities’ commitment to implement the reforms, staff
support the request for a Stand-By Arrangement in the amount of SDR 935.4 million
(200 percent of quota).
48.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation will be held in accordance
with Decision No. 14747-(10/96), adopted September 28, 2010, as amended.

Accelerate the pace of
structural reforms to boost
attractiveness of FDI and
investment in Serbia.
Rebalance policy mix
towards tighter fiscal and
looser monetary policy, to

2/ Country name and index of best performers among: Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary,
Latvia, Lithuania, FYR Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovak Republic, and Slovenia.
Country names are not shown for EBRD transition indicators due to the presence of multiple entries.
3/ Distance of Serbia from best performer for each index.
4/ As pointed out in an independent evaluation of the Doing Business survey (see www.worldbank.org/ieg/doingbusiness),
care should be exercised when interpreting these indicators given subjective interpretation, limited coverage of business
constraints, and a small number of informants which tend to overstate the indicators' coverage and explanatory power.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent

Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C., 20431
U.S.A.

Belgrade, February 6, 2015

Dear Ms. Lagarde:
In the past few years, Serbia has accumulated internal and external economic imbalances. The
government appointed in April 2014 has recognized the challenges associated with these
imbalances and is strongly committed to address them. While the global financial crisis seems to
have abated, downside risks to our exports and external funding sources, particularly with regard to
EU countries, remain elevated. To insure against such risks and better anchor our policy framework,
we request that the Fund support our new economic program through a precautionary Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA) for a period of 36 months in the amount of SDR 935.4 million (200 percent of
quota).
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) outlines the economic
policies that the Government of the Republic of Serbia and the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) intend
to implement under the new SBA. Our program has the full support of all coalition partners in the
present government. In view of Serbia's comfortable international reserve position and continued
access to external financing, we aim to treat the arrangement as precautionary. Therefore, we do not
intend to make the purchases under the requested arrangement when they become available upon
its approval and after observance of its performance criteria and completion of its reviews.
The implementation of our program will be monitored through prior actions, quantitative
performance criteria, indicative targets, structural benchmarks, and an inflation consultation clause,
as described in the attached MEFP and Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). There will
be twelve reviews of the arrangement by the Fund, scheduled to be completed on a quarterly basis
to assess progress in implementing the program and reach understandings on any additional
measures that may be needed to achieve its objectives.
We believe that the policies set forth in the attached memorandum are adequate to achieve the
objectives of our economic program, but we will take any further measures that may become
appropriate for this purpose. We will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these measures and
in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund's policies
on such consultations. And we will provide all information requested by the Fund to assess
implementation of the program.

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

We wish to make this letter available to the public, along with the attached MEFP and TMU, as well
as the IMF staff report on the 2014 Article IV consultation and the request for a three-year SBA. We
therefore authorize their publication and posting on the IMF website, subject to Executive Board
approval. These documents will also be posted on the official website of the Serbian government.

Sincerely,

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
1.
This memorandum sets out our economic program for 2015–2017 that will address
short-term as well as medium-term economic challenges that Serbia is facing. The economic
program has three main objectives:


First, address macroeconomic imbalances and vulnerabilities, most notably by placing
public sector debt on a sustainable path.



Second, bolster resilience of the financial sector and improve its intermediation function
necessary to support economic growth.



Third, improve competitiveness and reduce key growth bottlenecks through vigorous
implementation of comprehensive structural and SOE reforms.

These goals are compatible with our aspirations to become an EU member after having started
the accession process in January 2014. Implementing this program would allow Serbia to realize
the significant potential for convergence towards EU income levels.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
2.
We recognize that Serbia’s economy is facing a number of challenges. In 2014, the
economy fell into recession for the third time in six years, partially due to the devastating floods
in May, 2014. Unemployment in excess of 18 percent of working age labor force poses a major
social concern. A combination of falling domestic demand, a good agricultural outcome in 2013
and 2014, and low growth of regulated prices in 2014 have pushed inflation below target. Public
debt has risen sharply and is estimated to have reached about 70 percent of GDP in 2014, while
the fiscal deficit in 2014 was close to 7½ percent of GDP. A scenario without comprehensive
policy changes is untenable, with likely economic stagnation and unsustainable public debt
dynamics.
3.
We will consistently implement policy actions and reforms envisaged under this
economic program. We expect that this will give rise to a virtuous cycle of boosting
confidence, improving growth and private sector vibrancy. We envisage the following
macroeconomic scenario under the program:


Real GDP is expected to contract by ½ percent in 2015 due to sizeable fiscal
consolidation. Growth will gradually accelerate over the medium term on account of
smaller fiscal adjustment, recovering market confidence and credit growth, and positive
effects of structural reforms.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA



Headline CPI inflation is projected to return close to the inflation target of 4 percent by
the end of 2015 and stay within the inflation tolerance band (4 percent±1.5 percent),
supported by the inflation targeting regime.



The current account deficit is expected to adjust to about 4¾ percent of GDP this year
and decrease to close to 3¾ percent of GDP over the medium term. External financing
will rely mostly on FDI, eurobond issuance, and project loans.

4.
The program scenario is subject to downside exogenous risks, but the Serbian
economy has considerable buffers to withstand them. In light of the close trade and
financial links with the EU, a protracted period of slow growth in trading partners would have a
negative impact on Serbia. Continued deleveraging by foreign bank subsidiaries, which
dominate our financial sector, could pose challenges. However, as the first line of defense we
have large foreign exchange reserves and a well-capitalized and liquid banking system. The
Fund arrangement would provide an additional buffer to help us cope with negative shocks, and
we are prepared to further adjust policies as necessary.

ECONOMIC POLICIES
A. Fiscal Policies
5.
We are committed to implementing a set of fiscal consolidation policies that will
reverse the rise in public debt by 2017 and put it firmly on a downward path thereafter.
We believe that a credible three-year adjustment requires significant front-loading. To this end,
we identified gross fiscal measures amounting to 4¾ percent of GDP during 2015–17, of which
over half has already been implemented or will be implemented this year. The measures focus
primarily on containing public expenditures, namely on scaling down public sector wage and
pension bills and reducing state aid to state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
6.
We have already initiated fiscal consolidation with the introduction of expenditure
measures in 2014. In order to contain the growth of the public wage bill, the original 2014
budget imposed a solidarity tax on wages higher than 60,000 dinars in the public sector
(general government and SOEs) and introduced a 5:1 attrition rule for general government
employment. The supplementary 2014 budget approved in October 2014 created additional net
savings by replacing the solidarity tax with an across-the-board 10 percent nominal wage cut,
protecting wages below 25,000 dinars per month and introducing a progressive cut in nominal
pensions (22 percent for pensions between 25,000 and 40,000 dinars per month and 25 percent
for higher pensions).
7.
In order to put the public pension system on a more sustainable footing, we have
introduced a comprehensive parametric pension reform in July 2014. We have legislated a
new Pension Law which includes the following changes: (i) increasing the statutory retirement
age for women from 60 to 65 years by 2032 (6 months per year by 2020, and 2 months per year

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

afterwards); (ii) increasing the minimum retirement age from 58 to 60 years by 2024, and
(iii) introducing actuarial penalties of 4 percent per year for early retirement.
8.
We will continue with fiscal consolidation in 2015. As a prior action, we have adopted
the 2015 budget with the accompanying legislation as indicated below. This introduces
additional fiscal measures that will reduce the augmented deficit of the general government to
about 6 percent of GDP this year (performance criterion):


We will reduce general government employment by 5 percent, through the continued
application of the attrition rule and targeted separations in mid-2015, by preparing wage
bill envelopes for individual public institutions in the 2015 budget. Severance payments
will be determined in line with the current legislation. To support this, we extended the
attrition rule through 2015 by amending the Budget System Law in December 2014.



We will suspend the indexation of public sector wages in years in which the share of
general government salaries (excluding severance payments) is expected to exceed
7 percent of GDP. We will suspend indexation of pensions in years in which the share of
pensions is expected to be above 11 percent of GDP. We have modified the Budget
System Law and Pension Insurance Law accordingly in December 2014.



We have initiated a comprehensive public wage system reform to improve quality and
efficiency by aligning base wages, unifying pay grades across comparable jobs,
streamlining the structure of coefficients, and integrating other elements of pay into base
wages across all general government sector entities. A single Law on Wages of State
Employees will replace a battery of laws setting the key principles and parameters of the
new system for most sectors (but not public enterprises), including the principle of same
pay for generic jobs across all sectors. The new Law will be submitted to the National
Assembly by June 2015. Implementing regulations will be adopted by end-October 2015,
mapping every existing job into a new classification and specifying non-linear wage
adjustment rules that will enable the introduction of new wage grades while respecting
the financial envelope set by this program. The transition period to the new wage system
will be determined in the course of 2015.



We will reduce spending on goods and services by lowering the mark up on procurement
from domestic suppliers from 15 percent to 5 percent in 2015, and eventually eliminating
it by 2018, for which we have amended the Procurement Law in early February 2015. This
will also reduce the cost of capital spending.



We have eliminated agricultural subsidies for land over 20 hectares and for land leased
from the Government of Serbia. We have modified the Law on Agriculture accordingly in
December 2014.



We will reduce state aid to SOEs, including subsidies, net lending, and payments from the
budget for guaranteed and nonguaranteed debt of the SOEs. We have adjusted network

fees on natural gas distributed by Srbijagas to generate €60 million on an annual basis,
effective from February 1, 2015 until the government finds alternative measures with the
same revenue effects, in consultation with the IMF staff. This additional revenue will
enable Srbijagas to pay a part of its debt obligations, and will correspondingly reduce the
payments of its called guarantees from the budget. We will reduce the operating costs of
Serbia Railways, and reduce subsidies accordingly. We will introduce an excise tax on
electricity to reduce inefficiency of consumption.


We will reduce subsidies to public broadcasting companies in 2015 and will eliminate
them in 2016.



To ensure proper protection of the vulnerable segments of the population, the existing
social safety net will be maintained.

9.
We will implement additional fiscal measures during 2016-17. Our primary focus will
be on the continued reduction of mandatory expenditures through the following measures:


We will continue reducing the cost and increasing the efficiency of general government,
through its organizational and functional restructuring, in accordance with the new Public
Administration Reform Strategy, adopted by the government in January 2014. By
end-March 2015, we will conduct an analytical overview of the public administration
system with a view to identifying sectors with the highest potential for efficiency gains
and employment reduction. These will then undergo in depth functional reviews,
producing estimates of additional savings to be attained through restructuring by
end-October 2015, in time for incorporation in the 2016 budget. Throughout 2015 we
will also advance the data and legal infrastructure necessary to accomplish additional
savings in 2016 and 2017 by introducing e-government. We are thus committed to
attaining a further reduction of the general government wage bill and other labor
associated costs budgeted under goods and services by 5 percent in both 2016 and
2017.



We will amend the Local Government Financing Law, which will rationalize transfers and
the revenue sharing mechanism to local governments and provide incentives to raise
their own revenues. This law will be amended by June 2015 (structural benchmark), and
will be implemented as of January 1, 2016.



We will introduce an excise tax on non-alcoholic drinks (excluding water).

10.
We will aim to reduce fiscal risks and will prepare contingency measures. In this
regard, we will not rely on short-term external debt financing (performance criterion), and we
will not accumulate public sector external debt payment arrears (performance criterion). We will
also refrain from accumulating domestic payment arrears (indicative target). Our efforts to
reduce public spending will be monitored through a ceiling on the current augmented primary
expenditure excluding capital spending and interest payments of the Serbian Republican

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

Budget (quantitative performance criterion). If revenues are reduced due to an exogenous
shock, we will consider contingency measures, such as raising the VAT rate and gasoline excise
tax. On the other hand, if the revenue collection exceeds the projected amounts in 2015, the
gains would be used to repay public debt in 2015. If the revenue gains are sustainable, a portion
could be also used, in consultation with the Fund, for high priority infrastructure projects in
future years.

B. Structural Fiscal Policies
11.
To underpin the fiscal consolidation, limit risks and strengthen institutions, we will
pursue the following structural policies in the fiscal area:


To increase fiscal transparency, we classified as “spending above the line” all payments
for guarantees serviced by the government, repayment of debt taken over, payments for
arrears, and costs related to resolution of financial institutions in the 2015 Budget.



We will review and clearly define the coverage of general government to be compatible
with European System of Accounts (ESA) 2010, and will include social security funds with
all health fund indirect beneficiaries, road and corridor funds, and own-source revenue
and expenditures of indirect budget beneficiaries (excluding education and local
governments) within the 2016 budget documentation. We will include education and
local governments in the budget documentation by end-2016. In parallel, we will include
all Indirect Budget Beneficiaries of the central government in the Financial Management
Information System gradually by end-2016, taking into account their technical and
technological capacity.



We are committed to performing a fiscal impact analysis of all new legislative initiatives
under the “pay-as-you-go” rule of Article 48 of the Budget System Law. For this, we will
issue an instruction to line ministries on how to calculate and report the estimated fiscal
impact by end March 2015.



The National Assembly approved in the 2015 Budget Law the overall three-year
expenditure ceilings of the Republican budget (without Indirect Budget Beneficiaries) that
are aligned with the general government expenditures, as specified in the program and
the Fiscal Strategy for 2015-17, which is to be adopted in early February 2015. We will
also improve the planning of the contingency reserve to support the credibility of the
ceilings.



We will strengthen cash management by re-establishing a Liquidity Committee in
February 2015 including, but not limited to, representatives of the Treasury, Tax
Administration, Public Debt Administration, Budget Preparation Department,
Macro-Fiscal and Analysis Department, and the NBS.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA



To strengthen the control of the public sector wage bill, we have made significant
progress in setting up a comprehensive registry of public sector employees. We will
finalize and validate this registry by adopting the legal framework necessary to ensure
full coverage of the public sector employees—all employees at the republican and local
government levels, in public agencies and institutions, and SOEs—by end-June 2015
(structural benchmark). We will amend Article 93 of the Budget System Law to specify the
necessary data submissions and all responsible agencies.



We will ensure that a full assessment of all proposed Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) is
reviewed by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), including the PPPs’ key financing features,
cost-benefit analysis, and risk sharing arrangements with the government. We will also
include a fiscal risk statement on all PPPs from the 2016 budget onwards. In this regard,
we will set up a special fiscal risks management unit at the MOF by March 2015.
Furthermore, to improve control of fiscal implications and risks, we will amend the
existing Law on PPPs by June 2015 to mandate that all PPPs are submitted to the
government for consideration only with prior approval by the MOF.



We will implement recommendations of the World Bank and IMF TA missions on Public
Debt Administration organizational structure and changes in the Law on Public Debt,
including setting up a department for asset management.

12.
To secure savings from the corporate and financial restructuring of major SOEs, we
will introduce a number of public financial management changes.


We will create a strong and stable institutional framework for monitoring SOEs. As a first
step, we will adopt a government decree that will regulate the roles and responsibilities
of the MOF, Ministry of Economy (MOE), and line ministries with respect to monitoring,
supporting best governance practices, financial reporting, and transparency of SOEs, by
March 2015 (structural benchmark). We will ensure quarterly provision of financial
statements of SOEs to both the MOE and MOF from January 2015. We will strengthen the
SOE monitoring unit in the MOE which will focus, in collaboration with the relevant line
ministries, on corporate strategy and governance, and operational efficiency of SOEs. In
agreement with the MOE, the SOE financial monitoring function will be created in the
fiscal risks management unit in the MOF, which will focus on reviewing and compiling the
financial reports and statements of SOEs and evaluate the fiscal implications.



To enhance the payment discipline between public sector entities, we will broaden the
scope of the Law on Payments in Commercial Transactions, to include transactions
between public entities (including SOEs), in consultation with the IMF, by June 2015
(structural benchmark). This law will define monitoring and enforcement mechanisms for
improving payment discipline in the public sector, to be implemented from January 2016.
We will also modify the Decree (see TMU) that regulates the conditions under which
transfers from the budget can be reduced.

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA



We will strictly limit issuance of state guarantees from January 1, 2015. In this regard, we
will not issue any new state guarantees for liquidity support (continuous PC). We have
reflected this in the Budget Law for 2015 and will modify the Public Debt Law accordingly
by June 2015. Furthermore, we will set limits on issuance of new state guarantees for
viable project loans (quarterly PC) in annual budgets, in line with the overarching debt
sustainability objective, and consult the Fund staff before authorizing the issuance of
guarantees. To avoid any misuse of guaranteed project loans, the fiscal risks unit at the
MOF will monitor their implementation.



We changed the Law on Development Fund in January 2015 to remove the article which
stipulates that all guarantees issued by the Development Fund (DF) are backed by the
Republic of Serbia (prior action). We will establish an indicative ceiling on the below-theline lending by the Republican Government. In addition, we will only provide such loans
to public entities with high probability of repayment. We will also proceed with the
diagnostic analysis of the DF, followed by proposals to improve governance and
operational procedures of the DF by end-2015.

13.
In order to raise the efficiency of revenue collection, we are committed to
improving tax administration based on recommendations of the September 2014 IMF
technical assistance mission. We will appoint the Director of Serbia’s Tax Administration with
an appropriate skill set in February 2015 and we will transfer responsibility for investigation of
economic crime cases to a relevant agency by end-March 2015. We will adopt and implement
by end-March 2015 the Tax Administration Transformation Program 2014–19 developed by the
MOF as the official medium-term reform program (structural benchmark). Our priorities are to
(i) strengthen the tax administration’s governance, (ii) streamline organizational structures of
headquarters and field offices, including by reallocating employees to facilitate compliance
efforts, (iii) phase in a modern compliance risk management approach, (iv) strengthen arrears
management, including write off procedures, (v) modernize information technology systems
and business processes, and (vii) improve coordination and information exchange with other
government agencies.

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
14.
We see the current inflation targeting framework as the most viable option for
maintaining stable inflation and protecting the economy against external shocks. We
remain committed to the objective of keeping inflation within the inflation tolerance band
(4±1½ percent). Inflation developments will be monitored via a consultation clause with
consultation bands set symmetrically around the central projection of headline CPI (Table 1). As
the fiscal adjustment takes hold and external financing conditions stabilize, we see room for
rebalancing the policy mix towards looser monetary policy, in line with the inflation outlook and
financial stability. This easing, however, will be gradual and will depend on external financing
conditions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

15.
We will maintain the existing managed float exchange rate regime in line with the
inflation targeting framework. We believe that exchange rate flexibility provides a needed
buffer against external shocks. In light of this, foreign exchange interventions will be limited to
smoothing excessive exchange rate volatility without targeting a specific level or path for the
exchange rate, while considering the implications for financial sector stability and meeting the
inflation target. The current level of gross international reserves is above the levels determined
by most reserve metrics and we will maintain adequate coverage throughout the program,
which will be monitored by a floor on net international reserves (performance criterion).
16.
In order to reduce risks to macroeconomic stability, we will continue capital
account liberalization in a gradual way. Many of the capital account transactions, such as FDI
and long-term flows, have already been liberalized, with the remaining restrictions related
broadly to short-term capital and deposit flows. In order to limit balance of payments pressures
under the program, the capital account liberalization required in the context of EU accession will
be gradual, particularly in removing restrictions on short-term foreign inflows to domestic
securities and the ability of residents to open deposit accounts abroad.
17.
During the period of the SBA we will not, without Fund approval, impose or intensify
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, nor
introduce or modify any multiple currency practices or conclude any bilateral payment
agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement. Moreover,
we will not impose or intensify import restrictions for balance of payments reasons.

D. Financial Sector Policies
18.
Our policies will support financial sector stability and the banking sector’s ability to
cope with shocks, while improving financial intermediation. We will put priority on the
following: (i) further strengthening the supervisory and regulatory framework; (ii) improving the
bank resolution framework and enhancing our crisis preparedness; (iii) stepping up efforts to
address the high stock of non-performing loans (NPLs); and (iv) implementing a strategy for
publicly-owned banks. These policies will follow the ongoing harmonization of the financial
sector legislation with EU standards.
19.
We will enhance the supervisory and regulatory framework. The NBS implemented
the Basel II framework in late 2011 and is planning to introduce the Basel III framework in the
medium term. In preparation, the NBS will benchmark its prudential standards against the EU’s
CRD IV package, with proposals for further reform to be finalized by end-December 2015. In
doing so, the NBS will, inter alia, aim to introduce additional capital requirements for banks
deemed systemically important reflecting the EU’s CRD IV package. Meanwhile, the NBS stands
ready to take necessary measures to ensure that banks maintain sufficient capital and liquidity.
The NBS aims to intensify its supervisory cycle, ensuring that systemically important banks and
institutions with the highest risk rating are subjected to on-site inspections on an annual basis.
Finally, we will enhance our framework for macro prudential policy, leveraging international best
practices.
62

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

20.
In view of the current uncertain economic environment, we are undertaking a
program of special diagnostic studies of banks operating in the Republic of Serbia, in line
with similar initiatives in many EU countries.


The diagnostic studies, to be completed by end-September 2015 (structural benchmark)
with the help of external consultants, will be based on terms of reference that will be
agreed with IMF staff by end-March 2015.



The diagnostic studies will be guided, to the extent possible, by strengthened collateral
valuation standards and minimum requirements for appraisers, to be finalized in
consultation with IMF staff.



The NBS will use the studies to foster conservative implementation of IFRS accounting
standards and disclosure practices. Moreover, it will use the experiences obtained to
strengthen its prudential framework and supervisory approach, in particular the Decision
on the Classification of Bank Balance Sheet Assets and Off-Balance Sheet Items.

21.
We have undertaken several legislative changes to strengthen the bank resolution
and financial safety net frameworks. We legislated comprehensive revisions of the bank
resolution framework—comprising amendments to the Law on Banks, Law on NBS, Law on
Deposit Insurance, Law on Deposit Insurance Agency and Law on Bankruptcy and Liquidation of
Banks and Insurance Companies, as well as abrogation of the Law on the Assumption of Assets
and Liabilities of Banks for the purposes of safeguarding stability of the financial system of the
Republic of Serbia—in early February 2015 (prior action), and the new framework will be
effective from April 1, 2015. Our broad objective is to develop a general, flexible resolution
framework for banks, giving the possibility to calibrate resolution strategies for institutions
whose failure could trigger systemic disruptions. In making these proposals, we have relied on
recent IMF technical assistance. In view of Serbia’s ongoing EU accession process, the new
framework is broadly guided by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). The main
changes are as follows:


Clarifying principles and objectives of resolution in legislation and introducing a single
administrative resolution proceeding;



Expanding NBS’s resolution mandate while separating supervision and resolution
functions within the NBS. The NBS will take on the responsibility for designing resolution
strategy, including for gone concern banks. The mandate of the Deposit Insurance
Agency (DIA) will be refocused on the deposit insurance function;



Broadening the resolution toolkit to allow for the orderly resolution of all banks without
severe systemic disruption and without exposing taxpayers to loss, while enhancing crisis
preparedness. For this, we will develop the recovery and resolution plans for banks whose
failure could trigger systemic disruption;

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

63

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA



Enhancing the safety net framework. We will strengthen the financial and institutional
capacity of the DIA, to enable it to meet its deposit insurance obligations and serve as a
core part of the financial sector safety net. We have increased insurance premiums for
2014-15 to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). In addition, we have obtained a
€145.3 million loan from the World Bank as seed funding for the DIF, and secured a
€200 million credit line from the EBRD. The DIA’s operational capacity will be enhanced
by (i) improving governance, (ii) strengthening the asset recovery process, and
(iii) increasing information sharing between the NBS and the DIA.

22.
We will launch a comprehensive strategy to address the NPL overhang. The high
level of NPLs poses risks to financial stability and constrains financial intermediation. We will
develop a comprehensive strategy for NPL resolution, in collaboration with the IMF, WB, and
EBRD by end-June 2015. The strategy will include the following elements:


Review and strengthen banks’ capacity for dealing with NPLs. The planned diagnostic
studies will provide an initial insight into banks’ policies and procedures for working out
distressed loans. We will issue guidance for banks’ management of NPLs, including the
creation of specialized workout units within banks, the implementation of which will take
into account the findings of the special diagnostic studies.



Remove obstacles to write-offs and asset sales. We will identify and eliminate
impediments to loan write-offs by banks and asset sales to private investors. As
difficulties with collateral valuations hinder NPL market development, we will legislate
valuation standards and minimum criteria governing the activities of collateral appraisers.
We will create the framework for licensing private professional valuators according to
international best practices.



Strengthen the in-court corporate insolvency regime and introduce a personal insolvency
framework. Our objective is to make corporate and household debt resolution more
efficient and timely. We will amend the Law on Corporate Bankruptcy to remove
bottlenecks for in-court corporate debt resolution which need to be identified through
further analysis, and establish a law on personal insolvency.



Promote out-of-court corporate debt restructuring. We established the framework for
voluntary corporate debt restructuring in 2011, yet this mechanism remains
underutilized. We will review the effectiveness of the existing legal framework and will
develop policy measures to address obstacles to effective debt restructuring. In order to
improve out of court foreclosure and better align incentives for debt restructuring, we are
revising the Mortgage Law to allow purchases of collateral property free from lowerranked liens. We will conduct workshops to promote awareness by market participants
and disseminate best practices.

23.
We will strengthen state-owned banks. We will continue to implement the
comprehensive strategy for state-owned banks which was adopted in May 2014. In particular,

64

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

we will bolster institutions that fulfill a strategic function in the Serbian banking system, while
selling or winding down in an orderly fashion other state-owned institutions, including via asset
and liability transfers. Where necessary, we will strengthen banks’ corporate governance and risk
control frameworks, in accordance with international best practices.
24.
We will continue to implement our dinarization strategy. This strategy is based on
three pillars: (i) maintaining overall macroeconomic stability; (ii) creating favorable conditions for
developing the dinar bond market; and (iii) promoting hedging instruments. In this regard, since
November 2013 we have liberalized borrowing in dinars by the IFIs, and further increased
maturity of dinar-denominated securities in the local market by successfully placing a 10-year
dinar denominated T-bond.
25.
We will support credit to SMEs. Given the importance of SMEs for Serbia’s economy
and the limited access to credit by this sector, we will support lending to SMEs through EIB’s
credit lines (“Apex loans”). We will streamline loan approval procedures.

E. Structural Policies
26.
We will implement a comprehensive structural reform agenda to attract
investment, support growth, and rebalance the economy on its path towards EU
integration. We will focus on specific policies that (i) sustain job creation, (ii) reform
state-owned enterprises, and (iii) improve the overall business environment.
27.
Job creation is a central element of our economic policies. In July 2014, we made
legislative changes to support labor market flexibility and job creation. Specifically, we enacted
amendments to the Labor Law that rationalized severance payments by linking them to the
length of current employment, limited the blanket extension of collective bargaining
agreements, increased the duration of short-term contracts from one to two years, and clarified
separation rules. In September 2014, we adopted (as part of the National Employment Strategy
for the period from 2011 to 2020) a comprehensive National Employment Action Plan for 2015
(NEAP 2015), which sets out well-defined priorities to support employment. It includes specific
programs that offer job matching services, career counseling and training for both
pre-redundancy and the unemployed, employer subsidies targeting disadvantaged job seekers,
employee subsidies, self-employment support, public works, active measures for employees
with disabilities and co-financing of active labor market policies. Many of these programs will
continue to be developed in close consultation with the World Bank and EU partners. Going
forward, to support implementation of the Action Plan we will take the following actions:


We will amend the Law on Employment by end-March 2015 to better align the
disbursement of social benefits for the unemployed with specific training programs.



Given that collective agreements are essential for the implementation of the Labor Law,
and that all collective agreements concluded before the amendments of the Labor Law

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

65

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

will expire by end-January, 2015, we have prepared new collective agreements where
appropriate.


Further, with the aim of improving the social dialogue, we will adopt a new Law on Social
Partnership and Collective Bargaining by end-2016.

28.
We are committed to wide-ranging reforms of socially-owned and state-owned
enterprises to improve their operational viability and limit fiscal risks. A clear priority is to
significantly reduce state aid to SOEs through (i) curtailed direct or indirect subsidies, (ii) limited
issuance of new guarantees, and (iii) enhanced accountability, transparency and monitoring of
these enterprises. We will implement strategies for two broad categories of state-owned
companies: (i) companies in the portfolio of the Privatization Agency, some of which are
currently protected under a bankruptcy moratorium; and (ii) other large SOEs including the
electricity, gas, railways, and road companies.
29.
We will ensure the resolution of over 500 enterprises in the portfolio of the
Privatization Agency through either privatization or bankruptcy, in accordance with the
recently revised Privatization Law. Since August 2014, we have collected letters of interest for
these companies, and we have adopted an action plan for bankruptcy procedures for 188
companies in early February 2015. On the basis of agreement with the World Bank, we will
initiate bankruptcy proceedings for companies with weak privatization prospects in early
February 2015, while ensuring a government decision on adequate budgeting of social benefits
in lieu of severance payments as per legislative provisions in the Labor Law.
30.
We aim to privatize or find strategic partners for a number of SOEs and concession
projects. We will use the proceeds primarily for reducing the stock of public debt but possibly
also for funding future financially viable and high return investment projects. The size of
investment funding will be determined in consultation with the Fund staff. To support the
operation of the telecommunication sector on a strictly market basis, we will launch a
privatization tender for Telekom Serbia during the course of 2015. We will eliminate state aid—
including budget subsidies, government guarantees, lending from the budget or any other
forms of public support—to Zelezara Smederevo, a steel producer, and prevent accumulation of
arrears by this company (prior action). At the same time, we will explore long-term concession
partnerships for managing the Belgrade airport and operating Corridor XI.
31.
We are committed to restructuring the large SOEs to contain the additional fiscal
costs that would arise without a change in policies. We will also ensure adequate service
provision. In particular, we will focus on the electricity, gas, railways, and road companies which
are among the largest public enterprises. To anchor the corporate restructuring process and set
the enabling legal framework for reform in the energy sector, the National Assembly approved
in December 2014 a new Energy Law in line with EU Directives. To implement the needed
corporate and financial restructuring in each of these companies over the medium term, we will
take the following steps:

66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA



Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS). On November 27, 2014, we adopted a corporate
restructuring plan that focuses on streamlining the organizational structure and
management and staff rightsizing, to avoid the need for state aid to EPS in the future. We
will also support EPS in preparing a financial restructuring plan based on improved
collections, increased efficiency, costs savings, and tariff increases, to be adopted by the
government by end-March 2015 (structural benchmark). In this regard, we will support
EPS to request an increase of the regulated electricity price for end consumers. This, in
combination with an excise tax, would result in a total price increase of 15 percent as of
April 1, 2015. Additional adjustments will follow in April 2016 if necessary. Following the
restructuring process and financial consolidation, we will seek minority private
investment participation that could further enhance the viability of the company and
ensure its professional management. The restructuring process will be prepared in close
consultation with the World Bank and EBRD. These plans will continue to be
implemented through 2016-2017.



Srbijagas. We adopted corporate restructuring plans for Srbijagas in December 2014,
which include a framework for unbundling of its distribution section. In line with the fiscal
program, we will divest part of Srbijgas’ non-core assets and resolve the companies
which have been a major source of arrears: Zelezara Smederevo in February (see ¶30
above), Azotara and MSK by end-March, and Petrohemija by end-April 2015. We will hire
an independent consultant to develop a financial restructuring plan based on improving
collection and increasing the transit and network fees, and the plan will be adopted by
end-October 2015, in time for incorporation in the 2016 budget (structural benchmark).
The terms of reference for the financial restructuring plan will be prepared with the
assistance of the World Bank and the EBRD. These measures will ensure that Srbijagas’
financial position does not deteriorate further, thus containing the need for additional
state aid in line with the fiscal program.



Railways of Serbia. The government established a Railway Reform Steering Committee,
led by the Deputy Prime Minister and including senior representatives from relevant
Ministries and entities, to provide overall direction of the reforms. The company will be
unbundled according to EU practices into separate passenger, freight, infrastructure, and
a holding company by end-March 2015. To support the corporate and financial
reorganization of the company, we appointed the director and senior management team
in January 2015. The corporate restructuring plan will be centered on asset disposal,
network re-optimization, and staff rationalization. Importantly, the freight section will
receive no further subsidies and will operate on a pure commercial basis from January
2018. To support market competition, an infrastructure usage fee will be introduced by
end-December 2015. We will also continue with the reorganization and improvement of
business plans for the holding company, the state-owned passenger and infrastructure
companies to strictly limit the amount of state aid disbursed over the medium term. We
will cooperate closely with the World Bank, EBRD and EU in determining the optimal
corporate and financial restructuring plans, with the help of independent consultants.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

These plans will be adopted by the government by end-September 2015 (structural
benchmark).


Roads of Serbia. The merger of Roads of Serbia with Corridors of Serbia is expected to
be finalized by March 2015 and will result in a single company tasked with road
construction and maintenance in Serbia. While we expect efficiency gains from the
consolidation of operations, we will also take action on the revenue side by revisiting the
adequacy of toll rates and on the expenditure side by removing rigidities in pricing
maintenance contracts by March 2016. The savings should result in lower budget support
in the future. We will also explore concession options for the construction and
maintenance of Corridor XI. The corporate and financial restructuring plans will be
developed in close consultation with the World Bank.

32.
We will develop a comprehensive program to enhance Serbia’s competiveness and
business environment to support investment, job creation and private sector
development. The program will be developed in close consultation with the World Bank and
EBRD (including through the Investment Climate and Governance Initiative) and will ensure that
growth-supporting policies are well coordinated and targeted. Specific actions will focus on the
following areas:


To foster investment, we adopted the regulatory framework for the establishment of
one-stop shops for issuing construction permits in December 2014, to be operational by
end-June 2015. We will also adopt the framework that regulates the conversion of land
usage into ownership rights by end-December 2015.



To enhance predictability and reduce corruption and the grey economy, we will adopt a
new Law on Inspection Oversight by end-June 2015.



We will adopt a new Investment Law that will replace and broaden the scope of the
Foreign Investment Law to include domestic investments by end-March 2015. In addition,
the new law will regulate the operations of the Quick Response Office for Investment
within the MOE to enable the efficient coordination of investment related permits.



We will develop plans for the rationalization of investment promotion programs, in
particular the Development Fund, and their agencies, including a reform of the two
agencies administering investment incentives and export financing programs (Serbian
Export Credit and Insurance Agency (AOFI) and Serbia Investment and Export Promotion
Agency (SIEPA)), by end-December 2015.



We will implement an action plan to improve the business environment for SMEs based
on the SME strategy for 2015-2020 prepared by the MOE.



We will work to enhance innovation capacity through stepping up the work of the
Innovation Fund and reform the system of financing research institutions.

68

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA



As part of our job creation initiatives, we will improve targeting of Active Labor Market
Policies and implement rationalization and reorganization of the National Employment
Service.

PROGRAM MONITORING
33.
Progress in the implementation of the policies under this program will be monitored
through quarterly quantitative performance criteria (PCs) and indicative targets (ITs)—including
an inflation consultation clause, continuous performance criteria (CPCs) and structural
benchmarks (SBs). These are detailed in Tables 1 and 2, with definitions provided in the attached
Technical Memorandum of Understanding. Quantitative targets are set for end March, June,
September and December 2015.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) sets out the understandings regarding the
definition of indicators used to monitor developments under the program. To that effect, the authorities
will provide the necessary data to the European Department of the IMF as soon as they are available. As
a general principle, all indicators will be monitored on the basis of the methodologies and classifications
of monetary, financial, and fiscal data in place on December 31, 2014, except as noted below.

2.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the NBS are defined as the difference between reserve assets
and reserve liabilities, measured at the end of the quarter.
3.
For purposes of the program, reserve assets are readily available claims on nonresidents
denominated in foreign convertible currencies. They include the NBS holdings of monetary gold, SDRs,
foreign currency cash, foreign currency securities, deposits abroad, and the country’s reserve position at
the Fund. Excluded from reserve assets are any assets that are pledged, collateralized, or otherwise
encumbered (e.g., pledged as collateral for foreign loans or through forward contracts, guarantees and
letters of credit), NBS’ claims on resident banks and nonbanks, as well as subsidiaries or branches of
Serbian commercial banks located abroad, claims in foreign exchange arising from derivatives in foreign
currencies vis-à-vis domestic currency (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options), precious metals
other than monetary gold, domestically acquired gold without international certificates, assets in
nonconvertible currencies, and illiquid assets.
4.
For purposes of the program, reserve liabilities are defined as all foreign exchange liabilities to
residents and nonresidents with a maturity of less than one year, including commitments to sell foreign
exchange arising from derivatives (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options, including any portion
of the NBS gold that is collateralized), and all credit outstanding from the Fund. Excluded from reserve
liabilities are government foreign exchange deposits with NBS, and amounts received under any
SDR allocations received after August 20, 2009.

Adjustors. For program purposes, the NIR target will be adjusted upward by the value of longterm assets and foreign-exchange-denominated claims on resident banks and nonbanks as well as
Serbian commercial banks abroad, recovered by the NBS since December 31, 2014. The NIR floor will be
adjusted upward by the full amount of any eurobond issuance proceeds cumulative since December
31,2014. The NIR floor will also be adjusted upward by the value of domestically acquired gold for which
certification was obtained after December 31, 2014. The NIR floor will also be adjusted upward by any
privatization revenue in foreign exchange received after December 31, 2014. Privatization receipts are
defined in this context as the proceeds from sale, lease, or concession of all or portions of entities and
properties held by the public sector that are deposited in foreign exchange at the NBS either directly or
through the Treasury.

B. Inflation Consultation Mechanism
7.
Inflation is defined as the change over 12 months of the end-of-period consumer price index
(CPI), as measured and published by the Serbian Statistics Office.
8.
Breaching the inflation consultation inner band limits (specified in MEFP, Table 1) at the end of a
quarter would trigger discussions with IMF staff on the reasons for the deviation and the proposed
policy response. Breaching the outer limits would trigger a consultation with the IMF’s Executive Board
on the reasons for the deviation and the proposed policy response before further purchases could be
requested under the SBA.

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

C. Fiscal Conditionality
9.
The general government augmented fiscal balance, on a cash basis, is defined as the
difference between total general government revenue (including grants) and total general government
expenditure (irrespective of the source of financing) including expenditure financed from foreign project
loans, payments of called guarantees, cost of bank resolution and recapitalization, cost of debt takeover
if debt was not previously guaranteed, repayments of debt takeover if debt was previously guaranteed,
and payment of arrears. For program purposes, the consolidated general government comprises the
Serbian Republican government (without indirect budget beneficiaries), local governments, the Pension
Fund, the Health Fund, the Military Health Fund, the National Agency for Employment, the Roads of
Serbia Company (JP Putevi Srbije) and any of its subsidiaries, and the company Corridors of Serbia. Any
new extra budgetary fund or subsidiary established over the duration of the program would be
consolidated into the general government. Privatization receipts are classified as a financial transaction
and are recorded “below the line” in the General Government fiscal accounts. Privatization receipts are
defined in this context as the proceeds from sale, lease, or concession of all or portions of entities and
properties held by the public sector.
10.
Government augmented primary current expenditure of the Republican budget (without
indirect budget beneficiaries) includes wages, subsidies, goods and services, transfers to local
governments and social security funds, social benefits from the budget, other current expenditure, net
lending, payments of called guarantees, cost of bank resolution and recapitalization, cost of debt
takeover if debt was not previously guaranteed, repayments of debt takes over if debt was previously
guaranteed, and payment of arrears. It does not include capital spending and interest payments.
Adjustors:


The quarterly ceilings on the general government augmented fiscal deficit and the augmented
primary current expenditure of the Republican budget will be adjusted upward (downward) to the
extent that cumulative severance payments (including payments from the Transition Fund) exceed
(fall short of) the programmed levels up to the yearly budgeted amount.

Ceiling on the gross issuance of debt guarantees by the Republican Budget for project and
for liquidity support. Guarantees for liquidity support are defined in this context as guarantees related
to loans provided without any pre-specified purpose other than satisfying funding needs of the
company that ensure its normal production and business activities. Guarantees for viable project loans
are defined in this context as guarantees related to loans with high probability of repayment provided
with a pre-specified objective establishing that all funding should be used for well-defined investment or
corporate restructuring projects, confirmed by a reliable feasibility study and/or the investment or
restructuring plan endorsed by the government.
13.
Ceiling on below-the-line lending by the Republican Government. Below-the-line lending is
defined as the lending by the Republican Government which is used to provide financing to entities
outside the General Government coverage. Below-the-line lending by the Republican Government will
only be provided in cases where the probability of repayment is assessed to be high. These entities
include the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA), beneficiaries of the APEX lending program, and EPS, among
others.
14.
Ceiling on borrowing by the Development Fund and the Export Credit and Insurance
Agency (AOFI). Borrowing by the Development Fund and AOFI is defined as gross accumulation of
financial claims on these entities.
15.
The amendments to the Budget System Law will involve a modification specifying the
following wage and pension indexation rule:
Fiscal sustainability rule imposes that the share of general government salaries in GDP do not
exceed 7 percent, and that the share of pensions in GDP do not exceed 11 percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

75

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

After 2014, salaries and/or pensions will not be increased in the years in which the share of general
government salaries in GDP is above 7 percent, and/or share of pensions in GDP is above 11
percent.
In years in which it is expected that the share of general government salaries in GDP will be below
7 percent, indexation will take place twice a year. In April, salaries will be indexed by the previous
6-month CPI inflation and previous year annual real GDP growth above 3 percent, and in October,
salaries will be indexed by the previous 6-month CPI inflation, but taking into account that after
these indexations the share of general government salaries in GDP must be below 7 percent.
In years in which it is expected that general government pension payments will be below 11 percent,
indexation will take place twice a year. In April, pensions will be indexed by the previous 6-month
CPI inflation and previous year annual real GDP growth above 3 percent, and in October, pensions
will be indexed by the previous 6-month CPI inflation, but taking into account that after these
indexations the share of general government pensions in GDP must be below 11 percent.
16.
Domestic arrears. For program purposes, domestic arrears are defined as the belated settlement
of a debtor’s liability which is due under the obligation (contract) for more than 60 days, or the creditor’s
refusal to receive a settlement duly offered by the debtor. The program will include indicative targets on
the change in domestic arrears of (i) all consolidated general government entities as defined in ¶8 above,
except local governments; (ii) the Development Fund, and (iii) AOFI. Arrears to be covered include
outstanding payments on wages and pensions; social security contributions; obligations to banks and
other private companies and suppliers; as well as arrears to other government bodies.

D. Ceilings on External Debt
17.
Definitions. The ceilings on contracting or guaranteeing of short-term external debt (with
maturities up to one year) consolidated general government, the AOFI, and the Development Fund
applies not only to debt as defined in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to
External Debt in Fund Arrangements, Decision No. 6230-(79/140), as amended, but also to commitments
contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. Excluded from this performance
criterion are normal short-term import credits. For program purposes, debt is classified as external when
the residency of the creditor is not Serbian. For new debt to budgetary users, the day the debt is
contracted will be the relevant date for program purposes. For new debt to non-budgetary users, the
day the first guarantee is signed will be the relevant date. Contracting or guaranteeing of new debt will
be converted into euros for program purposes at the program cross exchange rates described in this
TMU.

E. Ceiling on External Debt Service Arrears
18.
Definition. External debt-service arrears are defined as overdue debt service arising in respect of
obligations incurred directly or guaranteed by the consolidated general government, the Export Credit
and Insurance Agency (AOFI), and the Development Fund, except on debt subject to rescheduling or

76

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

restructuring. The program requires that no new external arrears be accumulated at any time under the
arrangement on public sector or public sector guaranteed debts. The authorities are committed to
continuing negotiations with creditors to settle all remaining official external debt-service arrears.
19.
Reporting. The accounting of non-reschedulable external arrears by creditor (if any), with
detailed explanations, will be transmitted on a monthly basis, within two weeks of the end of each
month. Data on other arrears, which can be rescheduled, will be provided separately.

F. Prior Action on Eliminating State Aid to Zelezara Smederevo
20.
Eliminating state aid to Zelezara Smederevo and preventing accumulation of arrears by this
company can be implemented by either (i) signing a Strategic Partnership Investment Agreement with a
private investor for Zelezara Smederevo, or (ii) adopting a Government Decision to resolve Zelezara
Smederevo in a way that eliminates state aid to this company and prevents accumulation of arrears.
Servicing of old government-guaranteed debts (outstanding before the completion of the prior action)
is not considered state aid for program purposes.

G. Reporting
21.
General government revenue data and the Treasury cash position table will be submitted weekly;
updated cash flow projections for the Republican budget for the remainder of the year fourteen
calendar days after the end of each month; and the stock of spending arrears of the Republican budget,
the Road of Serbia, and the social security funds 45 days after the end of each quarter. General
government comprehensive fiscal data (including social security funds) would be submitted by the 25th
of each month.

Annex I. Serbia: Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis1
The Public Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates the existence of significant vulnerabilities of
debt dynamics to various shocks under the program scenario (baseline scenario under the DSA).
This is reflected in the persistently high public debt levels and large gross financing needs over the
projection period, which are further exacerbated in the event of shocks to economic growth, the
exchange rate, primary fiscal balance, interest rate, and the realization of contingent liabilities. The
programmed fiscal adjustment is sizeable, yet it is needed to reverse the upward trend of public
debt by 2017. Future privatization of profitable SOEs and EU integration constitute upside risks for
debt dynamics.
1.
General government debt has increased substantially during the last few years.
Total gross debt reached almost 61½ percent of GDP in 2013—almost doubling from the 2008
level—owing to expansionary fiscal policies and sluggish output growth since the start of the
global financial crisis. The public debt fiscal rule, which sets the public debt ceiling at 45 percent
of GDP, was thus breached. About 8½ percent of Serbia’s public debt consists of government
guarantees to large SOEs and local governments. Unguaranteed local government debt is
negligible (about ½ percent of GDP as of 2013). External public debt accounts for 60 percent of
the total, while more than ¾ of total public debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Most
external debt is owed to multilateral and bilateral creditors (57 percent of total external public
debt), which has helped Serbia keep interest cost relatively low. However, the share of market
debt has been increasing rapidly since the first eurobond issuance in 2011, suggesting that debt
costs will increase further. Domestically-issued debt, dominated by T-bills and T-bonds with
maturities above 12 months, increased as a share of total debt significantly over the last five
years.
2.
The DSA analysis is based on the macroeconomic assumptions under the program
scenario. Real GDP is estimated to have contracted by 2 percent in 2014 reflecting the effects of
the floods, weak domestic demand, and moderate growth in the Euro area. A gradual recovery
is projected in the medium term to about 3½ percent of GDP, partly reflecting confidence
effects of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Inflation is expected to stay within the
tolerance band of the NBS. The fiscal deficit is projected to decline gradually from estimated
7½ percent of GDP in 2014 to about 2¾ percent of GDP by 2020, supported by a multi-year
fiscal consolidation program focused on expenditure restraint, notably through wage and
pension bill rationalization, and reduced state aid to SOEs. The current account deficit is
expected to narrow as Serbia embarks on export-led growth, while import compression due to
fiscal consolidation is partly offset by higher capital imports associated with FDI.

1

The baseline scenario of the DSA reflects the program scenario outlined in the MEFP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

79

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

3.
Serbia faces high risks to debt sustainability despite the significant fiscal
adjustment assumed in the baseline scenario (Figure 1). Serbia’s public debt is estimated to
have reached about 70 percent of GDP in 2014, and will remain above this level during the
projection period, despite the relatively sizeable fiscal adjustment proposed for 2015–17
(3½ percent of GDP on a structural basis). As a result, Serbia’s public debt is highly vulnerable
under all shock scenarios. Specifically, the debt profile is highly susceptible to exchange rate
fluctuations due to the large share of public debt denominated in foreign currencies. Moreover,
limited absorption capacity of domestic banks and high domestic interest rates suggest that
Serbia will increasingly have to rely on external market financing in the future, thereby
embedding significant risks to adverse market sentiment. In the DSA, a significant fraction of
gross external financing is secured through the issuance of eurobonds, reaching about
$1.2 billion a year on average during 2015–20.
4.
The fan charts illustrate the possible public debt dynamics over the medium term,
using a symmetric and asymmetric distribution of risks, with the latter imposing no
positive growth and no primary balance shocks. In this scenario, the asymmetric fan chart
shows the presence of significant risks to the debt outlook, which further indicate the need for
fiscal consolidation.
5.
Financing needs are projected to remain large, and would remain highly vulnerable
to shocks. The gross financing needs are driven by a number of factors: (i) the rapid buildup of
debt during the recent years in a context of large fiscal deficits, entailing large debt repayments
in the years ahead, (ii) the authorities’ strategy to lengthen the maturities of domestic securities
has helped temporarily, and the breathing space it has provided is narrowing, and (iii) repeated
issuance of eurobonds given the low interest rates environment (5 eurobonds were issued in
2011–13 for a total of $5.25 billion or 12¼ percent of 2014 GDP). In fact, two eurobonds
totaling $1.75 billion (almost 4½ percent of 2014 GDP) will mature in 2017–18, representing a
critical market test for Serbia. In the absence of fiscal consolidation, rollover risks and budget
financing will pose major challenges.
6.
Past forecast errors were caused by exogenous shocks, but also weaker fiscal
discipline in the absence of an IMF-supported program (Figure 2). In particular, real GDP
growth was lower than anticipated in 2009 due to a sharp output contraction amid the global
financial crisis, and later in 2012 following severe weather shocks that affected agricultural and
industrial output. However, the unexpected large primary fiscal deficit in 2012 was driven by
significant slippages due to election spending and bank recapitalization and resolution costs.
7.
The projected fiscal adjustment is relatively sizeable, as indicated by the fact that
Serbia is in the top quartile of fiscal adjustments observed during 1990–2011 for
advanced and emerging economies with debt greater than 60 percent of GDP (Figure 2).
Nevertheless, this fiscal effort is the lower bound of the adjustment that Serbia needs to
undertake to stabilize and later reduce the public debt level. Under the DSA baseline (program)
scenario, gross public debt will rise steadily until 2016 peaking at 78½ percent of GDP, after
which it will start declining as the primary balance reaches its debt-stabilizing level (Figure 3).
80

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

Public debt is projected to continue declining throughout the DSA projection horizon, reaching
about 72¼ percent of GDP by 2020.
8.
The projected decline in public debt is susceptible to a number of shocks,
particularly a growth slowdown, a real exchange rate shock, and the realization of contingent
liabilities (Figure 5):
 Growth shock. If projected real GDP growth for 2016–17 is lower by one standard
deviation (3¾ percentage points lower in both years than in the baseline), the debt-to-GDP
ratio would peak at 89¾ percent of GDP by 2017–11¾ percentage points of GDP higher
than under the DSA baseline scenario.
 Primary fiscal balance shock. A shock that leads to a worsening of the primary balance
by about ½ percent of GDP on average during 2016–20, relative to the DSA baseline
scenario, would result in a significant deviation from the medium-term fiscal consolidation
path, implying higher debt levels. Public debt could reach 75 percent of GDP by 2020,
compared to 72¼ percent of GDP under the DSA baseline scenario.
 Interest rate shock. Although interest payments currently account for a relatively small
share of the budget relative to other emerging countries, the shift from concessional to
market financing will impose a significant burden on the budget and worsen debt dynamics.
This scenario simulates a permanent increase in interest rates by 200 basis points starting in
2016, on top of the projected gradual increase in international interest rates envisaged under
the DSA baseline scenario. Higher borrowing costs will worsen the headline fiscal deficit, and
require more borrowing for budget financing. The public debt ratio would be about
2¾ percentage points of GDP higher than in the baseline scenario by 2020.
 Real exchange rate shock. The large share of foreign currency debt gives rise to
significant vulnerabilities to currency depreciations. A 13 percent real depreciation
(comparable to what Serbia experienced in 2005 and 2008) will push public debt to
83¼ percent of GDP in 2016, well above the 78¼ percent of GDP projected under the DSA
baseline scenario, before declining slightly to about 79 percent of GDP by 2020.
 Combined shock. In the extreme case of multiple shocks affecting growth, the primary
fiscal balance, interest rates, and the exchange rate, Serbia’s public debt ratio could reach
98½ percent of GDP by 2020. The associated gross financing needs could peak at about
30 percent of GDP by 2020, about 10 percentage points of GDP higher than under the DSA
baseline scenario.
 Contingent liability shock. This scenario considers a one-time increase in non-interest
expenditures (equivalent to a one-off financial sector bailout of 10 percent of total banking
assets), which combined with the above growth shock, would push public debt to
87¼ percent of GDP in 2016, and around 85½ percent of GDP through 2020. Gross financing

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

81

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

needs would climb to about 22½ percent of GDP in 2017, slightly declining to 25 percent of
GDP in 2020. Other sources of contingent liabilities not modeled under this shock include the
stock of non-guaranteed debt of state- and socially owned enterprises and restitution debt.2
9.
Debt reductions from asset sales and a new concessional loan constitute upside
risks. Current DSA baseline assumptions do not incorporate proceeds from possible
privatization of viable state-owned enterprises, as well as potential disbursement of another
concessional loan from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the amount of $2 billion (4.7 percent
of 2014 GDP), which could be used to retire expensive market debt.3 In addition, the current
DSA baseline scenario does not factor in the potential benefits from EU accession negotiations,
which could strengthen economic governance and boost structural reforms.

2

Restitution debt refers to compensations for nationalization of property after World War II. The 2011 restitution
law capped total financial compensations at EUR2bn (about 6½ percent of 2014 GDP).
3

A disbursement of $1 billion already took place in the second half of 2014.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government and includes public guarantees, defined as Guarantees issued by the central government to State-owned enterprises.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ EMBIG.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes changes in the stock of guarantees, asset changes, and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex II. Serbia: External Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis1
1.
Total external debt has fluctuated around 80 percent of GDP since 2010, as private
sector deleveraging has compensated for rising public sector external borrowing, but a
gradual decrease is projected over the medium-term. Public external debt has been growing
since 2008 and is projected to maintain an

(Percent of GDP)
upward path for a few more years as a
100
result of significant financing needs and
90
favorable international market conditions.
80
70
On the other hand, the private sector has

years of significant net external borrowing)

and is expected to maintain this trend

expected to decrease gradually over the
medium term, reaching 67½ and 16 percent of GDP respectively by 2020.
2.
The main driver of the projected reduction in total external debt is a contraction in
the current account deficit before interest payments, which is expected to drop from
3½ percent of GDP in 2014 to about 1 percent of GDP in 2019, together with a steady real GDP
growth of 3-4 percent over the medium term. This reflects a significant improvement in the
trade balance, partly associated with the fiscal adjustment embedded in the program scenario.
As shown in alternative scenarios, if the current account, growth, interest rates, and real
exchange rate depreciation remain at historical levels, the external debt is expected to remain
on an increasing trajectory throughout the projection period, reaching 94 percent of GDP by
2020.
3.
The external debt path is particularly sensitive to real exchange rate depreciation
shocks. As shown in the shock scenarios, a 30 percent real depreciation would cause external
debt to exceed 130 percent of GDP during the first year and to remain above a 100 percent of
GDP over the projection period. A ½ standard deviation current account shock or a combination
of ¼ standard deviation temporary shocks to exchange rate depreciation, interest rate, and the
current account, would also have a significant impact on the debt level over the medium term.
4.
Finally, a potential increase in interest rates is also a significant source of risk.
Although the implicit interest rates for Serbia have been fairly stable in the past (a ½ standard
deviation shock would only lead to a 40 bps increase in the interest rate, as shown in the shock

The baseline scenario of the DSA reflects the program scenario outlined in the MEFP.

scenarios), potential increases in expected depreciation or an eventual increase in global interest
rates could lead to much larger increases in the interest rates faced by the country with the
corresponding adverse impact on debt dynamics.

Safeguards Assessment: An update of the safeguards assessment of the National Bank of
Serbia (NBS) has been initiated and envisaged to be completed by the first review. The latest
safeguards assessment for the NBS has been completed in December 2011. The assessment
found that the NBS has implemented several recommendations of the 2009 assessment that
have further strengthened its financial safeguards. Multi-year external auditor appointment
has been introduced and an independent external assessment of the internal audit function
has been conducted. Governance has been strengthened with the NBS Council’s new role,
which provides oversight of external and internal audits, financial reporting, and the system of
internal controls. The assessment recommended improvements in external audit procedures,
disclosures in financial statements, and data compilation procedures. Subsequent to the
assessment completion, amendments to the NBS Law, which included inter-alia dismissal of
the Council members, have raised concerns about NBS autonomy, which the authorities took
steps to restore in line with staff’s advice.
Exchange Arrangement: Serbia accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and
4, on May 15, 2002, and maintains a system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for
current international transactions, except with respect to blocked pre-1991 foreign currency
savings deposits (IMF Country Report No. 02/105). The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a
floating system since January 1, 2001. According to the 2009 Monetary Policy Program, the
National Bank of Serbia (NBS) implements a managed floating exchange rate regime.
Last Article IV Consultation: Concluded on July 1, 2013 (IMF Country Report No. 13/206).
FSAP Participation: Serbia participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program in 2005,
and the Executive Board discussed the Financial System Stability Assessment in February 2006
(IMF Country Report No. 06/96). An update under the Financial Sector Assessment Program
was conducted in 2009 and the Executive Board discussed the Financial System Stability
Assessment in March 2010 (IMF Country Report No. 10/147).

WORLD BANK GROUP RELATIONS
Partnership with Serbia’s Development Strategy
The World Bank has been discussing the policy reform agenda with successive governments since 2001,
and has been actively engaged with the new government since winning a mandate and assuming office
in April 2014. Support for the government’s reform efforts and development strategy from the World
Bank and the IMF follow the agreed division of responsibilities between the two institutions.
The Fund takes the lead on macroeconomic policies (fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate) aimed at
maintaining macroeconomic stability and facilitating sustainable growth, while the Bank takes the lead
on structural policies aimed at medium to long-term adjustment. In areas of direct interest to the Fund,
the Bank leads the policy dialogue in: (i) public administration reform; (ii) health and education; (iii) social
safety net reform and the monitoring of the impact of the crisis on the poor; and (iv) reforms with a
bearing on the business environment, with special focus on the performance of publicly owned
enterprises (electricity company EPS and the railways company). The Bank and the Fund have jointly led
the policy dialogue in the financial sector.

The World Bank
Total International Development Association (IDA) credits and grants committed to the Republic of
Serbia (Serbia) by the Bank since 2001 amount to approximately $740 million, with an additional
$1,107.4 million in International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan commitments (as
of December 2014). The Bank has assisted Serbia to make progress against key objectives set out in the
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY12–15: (i) encouraging a more competitive economy, and (ii)
improving the efficiency and outcomes of social spending. In addition, the World Bank provided an
extraordinary support to the government in their effort to overcome devastating impact of floods from
May 2014. The Floods Emergency Recovery Project loan in the amount of $300 million will help Serbia
meet critical needs in the energy and agriculture sectors, repair damaged flood control infrastructure,

and better respond to natural disasters. The government has made progress on these two priorities with
the support of World Bank financial and analytical products and is benefitting from the Emergency
Recovery Loan ($300 million).
The Bank started the work on the new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) by preparing the Systematic
Country Diagnostics (SCD). The draft report has been prepared and discussed with a broad range of
stakeholders. The authorities have requested significant budget support around the structural reform
agenda and discussions on the lending envelope under the new CPF will begin shortly.
As of December 2014, Serbia has a portfolio of 8 Bank-supported projects with a total commitment
value of $1,109.2 million (including IBRD and IDA). The current portfolio has a heavy infrastructure
component, comprising the Corridor X highway project and the Road Rehabilitation Project aiming to
promote regional integration and spur economic growth. In the social sectors the program is focused on
the health sector. In the financial sector the Bank is providing support to strengthening financial sector
safety nets. In the context of the Emergency Recovery Loan, the Bank has also reengaged on energy
sector reform and on flood prevention and disaster risk mitigation. Finally a real estate management
project, focusing on property registration and valuation, is at the final stages of preparation. The Bank is
also preparing policy lending to support the reform of the public enterprise sector, starting with a series
of two budget support operations on the resolution of the public and socially owned enterprises
currently in the portfolio of the Privatization Agency. Finally the Bank will during 2015 prepare two
result-based financing operations, one on public sector wage and employment reform and one on
competitiveness and jobs.
International Finance Corporation (IFC)
Serbia became a shareholder and member of IFC in 2001. Since then, IFC’s investment in Serbia has
totaled $2.2 billion, including $795 million in funds mobilized from partners, in 55 projects across a
variety of sectors. IFC’s committed investment portfolio in Serbia as of June 30, 2014 was $642.5 million.
In FY14, IFC invested $302.4 million in Serbia, including $215 million mobilized from MIGA. So far, in
FY15, IFC provided a $18.78 million mortgage finance loan to Komercijalna Banka Beograd. IFC is
focusing its investments services in Serbia on increasing access to finance by supporting the
development of local financial institutions, especially ones that concentrate on small and medium
enterprises, agribusiness and manufacturing. IFC’s advisory services aim to improve the investment
climate, performance of private sector companies, and to attract private sector participation in
development of infrastructure projects, with a special emphasis on renewable energy. Through
investment and advisory services, IFC will continue to partner with clients in strategic sectors crucial for
Serbia’s long-term sustainable development, with a particular focus on: the financial sector (with a
special emphasis on small and medium enterprises and energy efficiency lending), climate change
(including investments in infrastructure and energy sectors), agribusiness (with an emphasis on food
retail and manufacturing), value-added manufacturing, business infrastructure (with a focus on logistics
and distribution), sub-national finance (with a focus on municipal infrastructure and waste
management). Across all sectors, IFC prioritizes investment in Serbia’s less-developed regions and in
projects that contribute to greater economic diversification and regional integration.

Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
As of October 2014, MIGA’s outstanding portfolio in Serbia consisted of 8 contracts of guarantee with
total gross exposure of $785 million. All projects are in support of foreign banks' operations in Serbia
and are aimed at supporting the lagging recovery in the country’s banking sector and economy. MIGA’s
continuing support to these projects signals the Agency’s efforts to continue to underwrite projects in
Serbia, encourage inward FDI, and add to the World Bank Group’s strategy of encouraging private sector
development in the country.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Economic statistics in Serbia have faced many challenges in recent years, but data provision is broadly
adequate for surveillance. The statistical system has been successfully upgraded in recent years with the
assistance of the IMF2 and other bilateral and multilateral institutions. Although international standards
are not yet fully met, official data for all sectors are sufficiently good to support key economic analysis
and surveillance. In many areas, including monetary, balance of payments, and real sectors,
internationally accepted reporting standards have been introduced. A page for the Republic of Serbia
was introduced in the October 2006 issue of the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Serbia participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and its metadata were posted on
the IMF Data Dissemination Bulletin Board on May 1, 2009. The metadata identify plans for
improvement, which are being used to guide further progress.

A. Real Sector Statistics
The real sector data are compiled by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (SORS). Annual and
quarterly nominal and volume measures of GDP by activity are available from 1996 onwards. Nominal
annual GDP estimates by expenditure are available from 1995. Quarterly GDP estimates by expenditure
both at current prices and in volume measures are available from 1996 onwards.
The national accounts statistics of the Republic of Serbia are based on conceptual framework of the
2008 SNA/ESA 2010. After the introduction of this new system in October 2014, the GDP series were
revised up by an average of around 7 per cent, with variations across years. The increase in level is partly
caused by methodological changes, and partly by statistical changes. Of the methodological changes,
about 1 percent of GDP is a result of the recommendations of the ESA2010 to treat research and
development and military hardware as capital goods in the GDP compilation. An additional two percent
is due to changes according to the ESA95 that are now being included with the current revision. The
statistical changes relate to a better coverage of own-account construction of dwellings (about 0.4
percent), illegal activities (about 0.7 percent) and actual rentals (about 0.5 percent). Methodological
changes were introduced in the compilation of volume measures of GDP with the adoption of chainlinked volume measures, replacing the previous fixed base estimation process. Also the scope of the
estimates were recently extended with the compilation of annual volume measures of GDP by final
expenditures and the compilation of expenditure-based quarterly GDP, both at current prices and in
volume terms. These estimates were disseminated for the first time on March 29, 2013.
Procedures for the compilation of the estimates of annual GDP by production are in line with
internationally recommended practices. Estimates for achieving exhaustiveness in the production

Recent examples of STA technical assistance missions include the SDDS assessment and the national accounts missions
of FY 2011, as well as national accounts missions in FY 2012–2015.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

account estimates are being produced with an adequate methodology and compiled at very detailed
levels.
Sources and method for the compilation of GDP by expenditures are in general, adequate. Weaknesses
in the estimates of gross fixed capital formation are due to the lack of coverage of unincorporated
enterprises in the survey on investments, but starting in 2013 these enterprises are included in the
survey. Separate estimates of changes in inventories are disseminated from 2007.
Reconciliation between the independent annual GDP estimates based on the production and
expenditure approach is being made at aggregate levels, although the original differences are not
significant. The gap between the quarterly estimates of GDP by expenditure and GDP by production is
closed by a residual covering the statistical discrepancy plus changes in inventories and net acquisition
of valuables. There are no reliable independent estimates of changes in inventories on a quarterly basis.
The SORS compiles and disseminates monthly indices for consumer prices, producer prices, industrial
production, as well as unit-value indices for imports and exports. Concepts and methods used to
compile the CPI, as well as other price statistics, attempt to reflect international standards and best
practices.

B. Balance of Payments Statistics
Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the NBS. Starting from April 2014, BOP data are compiled
in accordance with the Sixth Edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position
Manual (BPM6). Currently, historical data according BPM6 are published for 2012 and 2013. During the
transition period, the NBS will continue publishing data for period 1997-2011 compiled using the Fifth
Edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).
The compilation procedures are generally appropriate; however, the source data for compiling various
current account transactions could be further improved. In particular, additional programs should be
developed to collect data to estimate unrecorded trade of goods and services and private transfers
(workers’ remittances in kind).
Serbia reports balance of payments statistics to STA for publication in the IFS and the Balance of
Payments Statistics Yearbook.

C. Government Finance Statistics
Monthly government finance statistics is compiled and published by the Ministry of Finance on a cash
basis following the methodology of the Manual on Government Finance Statistics 1986 (GFSM 86). The
sector coverage of these data is not clearly articulated. Principal data sources are the Republican
Treasury and budgetary execution reports of the spending ministries and first-level budget units. These
data form the basis for the cash-based annual GFS data transmitted to the IMF for the GFS Yearbook
(GFSY) based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

Since 2001, Serbia has made efforts to bring the existing budget reporting system in line with the GFSM
2001 methodology. Full compliance has not yet been achieved as implementation of the new chart of
accounts, generally consistent with the classifications of the GFSM 2001, has not been completed. The
classification of all expenditure of the “National Investment Plan” as capital needs to be brought in line
with international statistical standards. The sector classification of the general government sector needs
to be reviewed and accrual accounting needs to be gradually introduced in the GFS reporting. While the
data on the clearance of arrears are available on a monthly basis, information on the accumulation of
new arrears is not available. The reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data is not conducted on a regular
basis.
The Serbian authorities take steps to harmonize the sectorization of public sector units in line with the
GFSM 2014 requirements in the context of the ongoing technical assistance provided by the Fund. Data
on the general government operations and financial balance sheet based on the revised register of
public units would be available in spring 2016.

D. Monetary and Financial Statistics
Monetary and financial statistics are compiled by the NBS, broadly following the methodology set forth
in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, 2000 (MFSM), and meeting the GDDS recommendations
with respect to periodicity and timeliness for financial sector data. Monetary data are reported to the
Fund using Standardized Report Forms.
Further improvements could be made. The coverage of monetary statistics could be improved by
including banks in liquidation (as their data are not available on a timely or comparable, International
Accounting Standard-specified, basis).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Serbia

On February 23, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Serbia.
The Serbian economy is facing serious challenges. GDP contracted by an estimated 2 percent in
2014 on account of continued falling domestic demand aggravated by floods, and weak
economic activity in trading partners. This, together with the low imported inflation, pushed
Serbia’s inflation rate below the National Bank of Serbia’s inflation tolerance band, allowing
some easing of monetary policy. The very high rate of unemployment remained one of the
largest social concerns, as chronic structural rigidities continued to undermine the overall
competitiveness of the economy.
Public debt continued to rise to an uncomfortably high level, prompting a new policy course
towards stabilization and reform. Partial fiscal consolidation measures implemented in recent
years were insufficient and the fiscal deficit rose to 7½ percent in 2014, due to higher state aid to
loss-making state-owned enterprises and ballooning mandatory spending. Public debt reached
about 70 percent of GDP in 2014. The new government appointed in April 2014 set a course
towards fiscal consolidation and reform by passing difficult but necessary structural reforms and
fiscal consolidation measures in the second half of 2014.
The financial sector has remained broadly resilient in the face of challenging economic
conditions, but pockets of vulnerabilities persist. Overall capitalization appears strong and banks
remain liquid. High levels of NPLs, particularly in the corporate sector, are one of the main
challenges, requiring a comprehensive strategy for their resolution, although regulatory loan-loss
reserves provide cushion against credit losses. Accumulating vulnerabilities in some state owned
banks led to their failures, generating sizeable fiscal costs and exposing challenges in the
application of the bank resolution framework.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

To support their economic policies over 2015–17, the authorities have requested the IMF’s
assistance. The program aims to restore public debt sustainability, strengthen competitiveness
and growth, and boost financial sector resilience. It will be supported by an IMF Stand-by
Arrangement (see Press Release No. 15/67), which is expected to be precautionary.
Executive Board Assessment2
Noting the serious challenges facing the Serbian economy, the directors welcomed the
authorities’ renewed commitment to implement an ambitious reform package to restore
macroeconomic stability, strengthen the financial sector, and boost growth prospects.
Directors agreed that significant budgetary adjustment is needed to address fiscal risks and put
the public debt ratio on a downward path. They supported a consolidation strategy centered on
reducing mandatory spending and aid for state-owned enterprises. Directors commended the
authorities for underpinning the credibility of their fiscal plans with an early implementation of
difficult, but necessary, measures in these areas. Additional fiscal reforms for the period ahead
include strengthening tax administration, policy frameworks, and public financial management.
Directors agreed that the inflation targeting regime remains appropriate for Serbia, despite
challenges in its implementation. Directors noted that, in light of the planned fiscal
consolidation, a gradual monetary easing will be needed to support domestic demand, although
the pace of adjustment should be mindful of external financing conditions and the evolution of
inflation expectations. Directors welcomed the increased exchange rate flexibility and
underscored that foreign exchange interventions should be used only for smoothing excessive
volatility.
Directors agreed that the authorities’ policy package for the financial sector will strengthen its
resilience and maintain stability. They took note of the recent legislative reform of the bank
resolution framework and encouraged an early undertaking of diagnostic studies that would
guide further regulatory and supervisory actions. Directors also called for prompt design and
implementation of a comprehensive strategy for reducing distressed debt.
Directors concurred that deeper structural reforms are essential to restore competitiveness,
stimulate private investment, and support growth over the medium term. They welcomed the
recent amendments of the Labor Law, the additional steps in pension reform, and the
simplification of construction permits. Directors emphasized that further reforms of state-owned

enterprises, including restructuring and privatization, will be critical for improving their
commercial viability and limiting fiscal risks. More broadly, they called for stepped-up efforts to
improve the business environment and to stimulate private sector activity and job creation.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Republic of Serbia
February 23, 2015
This statement provides information that has become available since the issuance of the
staff report. The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
The preliminary 2014 fiscal deficit outturn was better than expected, although the
improvement appears to be largely due to one-off factors. The augmented general
government deficit was 6⅔ percent of GDP— lower than projected in the staff report (Table).
Stronger revenues—both tax and non-tax—accounted for the largest part of the improvement,
mainly because of one-off factors, such as extraordinary VAT payment from the power
company due to higher flood-related electricity imports and unexpected dividends and fees
from public enterprises (which were not related to a fundamental change in their financial
position). In addition, capital expenditure was somewhat lower. As a result, staff assess that
the structural primary fiscal deficit was marginally lower relative to the staff report. At the
same time, public debt reached 72½ percent of GDP, somewhat higher than expected, mostly
on account of exchange rate valuation effects and a smaller drawdown of government
deposits.
The prior action on eliminating state aid to steel producer Zelezara Smederevo (ZS) has
been met. In accordance with their program commitments, the authorities adopted a
government Decision on February 17 to produce a management contract for this company, to
allow operation of the company without state aid or accumulation of arrears.
The authorities have fulfilled a number of program commitments since the issuance of
the staff report. On February 12, they have appointed a new head of Tax Administration. On
February 8, the government adopted a Decision establishing a Working group for monitoring
liquidity of the budget consisting of representatives of Ministry of Finance, the National
Bank of Serbia, Public Debt Administration, the Tax Administration, and the Treasury. The
functions of the Working Group include information exchange, analysis of budget execution
reports, projection of revenues and expenditures and monitoring and analysis of cash flows.

Statement by Daniel Heller, Executive Director for the Republic of Serbia
and Vuk Djokovic, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
February 23, 2015

On behalf of our Serbian authorities, we would like to thank management and staff for
supporting the request for a precautionary Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in the amount of
SDR 935.4 million (200 percent of quota). The arrangement will be instrumental in
underpinning and strengthening macroeconomic management and keeping Serbia’s fiscal
consolidation and structural reforms on track. Our authorities intend to treat the arrangement
as precautionary, given the comfortable international reserves position and continued access
to external financing. The Serbian authorities very much appreciate staff’s strong
engagement as well as the constructive policy dialogue, which has provided an accurate
assessment of the Serbian economy. The report highlights important vulnerabilities in the
context of the current weak external environment, slower global growth and potential adverse
regional spillovers, and highlights the numerous challenges and risks that Serbian
policymakers face. The program builds on the already strong reform momentum, and
envisages the ambitious, yet essential set of policy reforms to be implemented, including
fiscal consolidation and structural fiscal reforms. Moreover, the program design provides a
realistic and achievable path to stabilize public debt, strengthen the financial sector, and
improve competitiveness.
Outlook
The Serbian government, which took office in April 2014 with a broad and stable
parliamentary majority, started its term with a clear aim to (i) stabilize public finances, (ii)
accelerate the implementation of needed structural reforms, (iii) improve competitiveness,
(iv) strengthen regional cooperation, and (v) advance towards the EU membership. The
implementation of this comprehensive reform agenda already started in mid-2014 with the
launch of ambitious labor and pension reforms, followed by important fiscal consolidation
measures—mostly the implementation of wages and pensions cuts—and the passing of the
amendments to the Urban Planning and Construction Law. In the second half of 2014, the
government started discussions with the Fund on a possible program to underpin its
economic policies and reform momentum. The authorities and staff have subsequently agreed
on a 36 month precautionary arrangement to support the implementation of the
aforementioned comprehensive reform agenda and reduce vulnerabilities in the financial
sector. The authorities consider that the successful implementation of the program will be
pivotal in strengthening the credibility of implemented policies and relaunching growth.
The Serbian economy weakened in 2014 and is expected to remain slightly negative in 2015,
while the growth is expected to pick up in 2016. In May 2014, the country was hit by
devastating floods which severely disrupted economic activity. Owing to flood-linked
damages and disruptions in the mining and energy sector and the weak growth of Serbia’s

2
trading partners, the Serbian economy contracted in 2014 by two percentage points. Growth
in 2015 is expected to be slightly negative, as the weakening in domestic demand due to the
significant frontloaded component of consolidation measures, will only be partially offset by
higher net exports. A moderate recovery is expected in 2016, based on the upturn of domestic
demand and further net exports growth.
Fiscal policy
Fiscal adjustment continues to be at the core of the program with the Fund. The authorities
are fully committed to implementing the needed fiscal consolidation within the program
framework, with the aim of achieving fiscal sustainability and stabilizing and reducing public
debt in the medium term. This implies a package of fiscal measures of 4¾ percentage points
over the course of the program. Acknowledging the need to promptly stabilize public
finances, the government has started the consolidation process, well before the program
discussions, by implementing important fiscal measures. In fact, in the second half of 2014,
the authorities have decided to reduce two key expenditure categories, namely wages, both in
the public and state owned enterprises (SOEs) sector, and pensions. The authorities have also
decided to freeze wages and pensions with the objective of reducing their share in GDP over
the medium term from 10 and 13 percent respectively, to 7 and 11 percent. In other words,
nominal wages and pensions will remain unchanged until these ratios are achieved.
The other key building blocks of the fiscal consolidation package are (i) a substantial
reduction in state aid, particularly to SOEs and (ii) a rightsizing of employment in the public
sector. More specifically, on the former (i), the fiscal drag from the loss-making SOE, which
has been on the rise in recent years, will be substantially reduced by lowering direct and
indirect state aid to these SOEs, limiting issuance of new guarantees and, improving their
monitoring, transparency and governance. In cooperation with the World Bank, the
restructuring and divestiture of about 500 socially owned enterprises in the portfolio of the
Privatization Agency will be accelerated. On the latter (ii), public sector employment will be
reduced by five percent annually over the course of the program, through the extension of the
attrition rule and targeted layoffs. These rationalization efforts will be underpinned by the
recently launched centralized employment registry, which effectively monitors public sector
employment and wages.
The Serbian authorities also plan to enact and implement broad civil service reform, with the
objective of increasing the quality of public services and improving the efficiency of the
public sector. In parallel, the authorities will review the transfers to local governments in
order to make the system of intergovernmental transfers increasingly efficient and fair.
Expenditure cuts are going to be paired with the broad and overreaching tax administration
reform, in line with the Fund’s technical assistance (TA) recommendation, to improve tax
collection efficiency and reduce the gray economy. Finally, the containment of pension
expenditures in the medium term will be supported by the pension system reform enacted in

3
mid 2014, which equalizes the retirement age for woman and man to 65 years, increases the
minimum retirement age to 60 years and introduces actuarial penalties for early retirement.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
The Serbian authorities consider that the inflation targeting framework has served well, apart
from some implementation challenges due to a highly euroized economy. Currently, headline
CPI inflation is below the target band due to the fall in energy and food prices, unanticipated
flat regulated prices and weak domestic demand. However, the National Bank of Serbia
(NBS) expects inflation to accelerate in spring 2015, to reach the target band in mid 2015,
and respectively reach the target of 4 percent by the end of 2015. On February 12, the NBS
Executive Board decided to keep the reference rate unchanged at 8 percent. Our authorities
consider that a gradual relaxation of monetary policy will be appropriate once the fiscal
consolidation efforts start delivering their effects, taking also into account external financing
conditions.
The NBS continues to be committed to the managed floating exchange rate regime for the
dinar. Although exchange rate flexibility helped absorbing external shocks, Serbia’s shallow
foreign-exchange market remains prone to excessive volatility. Recent NBS interventions
were geared towards the objective of smoothing such volatility and preserving financial
stability. In moving forward, the NBS interventions will continue to be aimed at smoothing
excess volatility and providing liquidity to the market, without targeting a specific level of
dinar exchange rate. The level of NBS international reserves remains high by standard
metrics.
Financial sector
Serbian banks are well capitalized and liquid due to cautious policies. The weaknesses
identified in some state-owned banks have been promptly addressed, in some cases with
recourse to public money. The capital adequacy ratio for the banking sector stands at almost
20 percent, and all banks have regulatory capital above the minimum of 12 percent. The non
performing loans are relatively high, predominantly within the corporate portfolio; however,
large regulatory loan-loss provisioning provides a sizable cushion to a potential distress.
The Serbian authorities have made progress in strengthening the bank resolution and
financial network framework, in line with the Fund’s TA recommendations. A set of laws
aimed at clarifying roles and actions of different actors in case of bank resolution has been
enacted in January 2015. By the end of the third quarter, the authorities will complete
diagnostic studies to identify possible vulnerabilities in the banking system and accurately
assess possible capital shortfalls. Our authorities consider that the results of this balance sheet
quality review will provide additional insights, help pursue adequate policies and improve
the oversight of the system. They also expect the outcome of the review to be manageable.

4
Business environment
With the support of the World Bank, our authorities are pursuing a broad and comprehensive
structural reform agenda to enhance the business environment. In July 2014, the authorities
have made important adjustments in the labor law to enhance the flexibility of the labor
market and unify severance costs. The Urban Planning and Construction Law, which has
been amended in December 2014, will significantly simplify and speed up the process of
obtaining building permits, including by establishing a one-stop shop. To remove one of the
key bottlenecks, the authorities are also committed to developing, by the end 2015, a
framework that regulates the conversion of building land usage rights to ownership rights.
EU integration
Serbia is making important progress towards EU membership. After granting Serbia the
Candidate status in 2012, the European Council decided in late 2013 to initiate the accession
negotiations with Serbia. These negotiations with the EU started officially with the first
Intergovernmental Conference, which took place in January 2014. Moreover, in 2014 the
screening processes of the several chapters of acqui communautaire were initiated.
Conclusion
The authorities are convinced that the agreed upon policies are adequate for reaching the
objectives defined in the Letter of Intent, and placing the country on a more balanced growth
path after the expiration of the program. The authorities are aware of the surrounding risks
and remaining vulnerabilities, stemming primarily from the volatile external environment
and the elevated financing needs but also from potential fiscal slippages. They remain
committed to prudent macroeconomic policies, focusing their strategy on containing debt,
improving competitiveness, and reducing financial vulnerabilities. If new measures are
needed to achieve the program objectives, the authorities stand ready to take such actions in
consultation with the Fund. In case of significant changes to the main program assumptions,
the authorities are also ready to take, in consultations with the Fund, additional measures to
protect the objectives of the program.
