Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere Department
(In consultation with other Departments)
Approved by David J. Robinson and Aasim Husain
March 1, 2010


2008 Article IV Consultation. The Executive Board welcomed the significant improvements
in Mexico’s fundamentals over the past decade. Directors also praised the authorities for
adopting measured monetary and fiscal policy easing—carefully balancing the objectives of
supporting activity and maintaining credibility—while letting the flexible exchange rate act
as a key shock absorber. To address the medium-term fiscal challenges in the context of a
falling share of oil revenue, further efforts were urged to strengthen revenues and restraints
on current expenditure. Directors welcomed that the financial stability had been maintained,
in part reflecting the strong regulatory framework and domestic funding base for banks.
Advancing structural reforms were viewed as key to boosting growth prospects.



Main Issues for 2010 Consultation. The 2010 consultation centered on near term policies to
navigate out of the recession, and steps needed to support stability and potential growth over
the medium term.



FCL. An arrangement with Mexico under the FCL for 1,000 percent of quota (SDR
31.528 billion) was approved on April 17, 2009. The authorities have indicated their intent to
treat the arrangement as precautionary.



Mission. Discussions for the 2010 Article IV Consultation were conducted in Mexico City
during February 2–12, 2010. The team met with Finance Secretary Cordero, Banxico
Governor Carstens, other senior government officials, representatives from the private sector
and think tanks. The team met with investors in New York during January 14–15, 2010.



Team. This report was prepared by a staff team led by Vikram Haksar, comprising Kornelia
Krajnyák, Ivanna Vladkova-Hollar, M.K. Tang, and Kristin Magnusson (all WHD),
Giancarlo Gasha (MCM), Bikas Joshi (SPR), Geremia Palomba (FAD), and Andrea Medina
(WHD).

I. CONTEXT––THE GLOBAL CRISIS AND MEXICO
Mexico faced the crisis from a strong position. However, the size of the Mexico specific
shocks proved extremely large, including relative to key emerging market peers. Markets
also saw constraints on the room for policy maneuver in Mexico. As such, risk premia rose in
Mexico relative to other emerging markets in the wake of the crisis.
Impact of the crisis
1.
Mexico entered the global crisis with greatly strengthened public and private sector
balance sheets (Figure 1). Debt levels were much reduced with lengthened maturities, and
reduced forex exposure. The banking sector was well capitalized with strong income
generation and a low dependence on external financing. Most corporates had built important
liquidity buffers with low overall and forex leverage. Policy frameworks—anchored by the
balanced budget rule, inflation-targeting regime and a flexible exchange rate—had achieved
high levels of credibility. As such, compared to past crises, economic stability has been
maintained, with the exchange rate and inflation remaining well anchored. While
unemployment increased, it is also noteworthy that formal sector employment held up better
than during previous crises (Box 1).
2.
Nonetheless, the Mexico specific external shock has been substantial, reflecting
strong real and financial linkages with the U.S. economy (Figure 2). With more than ¾ of
exports directed to the U.S. and strong

Box 1. Mexico––Informality and the Labor Market
Labor markets deteriorated during the crisis, with unemployment climbing to its highest level since 2000.
As a consequence, private consumption and retail sales staged large falls. While unemployment peaked at
6.4 percent in September 2009, private consumption was lagging until the third quarter and consumer
confidence remains weak. Growth of real earnings is expected to be weak in 2010 with minimum wages
increasing only slightly faster than forecasted inflation. Moreover, minimum wage increases not only provide a
benchmark for a large share of formal sector wages, but also affect earnings in the informal sector where more
than half of Mexicans are employed.
When Mexico faces economic downturns, the informal sector tends to buffer the blow to the formal
sector. As seen from the left-hand panel of the figure below, the informal sector in Mexico typically increases
its share of employment in recessions, something that is further confirmed by a negative correlation between the
high-frequency variations in informal sector employment and GDP. Although the relative shares of informal
and formal employment have been quite stable over the last two decades, the spike in informality induced by
the 1994–95 recession took over three years to subside. It is noteworthy that informal employment and
unemployment have increased less during the current crisis compared to then despite similar declines in output.
Possible explanations for this positive outcome include the corporate sector’s stronger resilience to shocks, the
authorities’ policy response and to a lesser extent a decline as opposed to an increase in labor force
participation.
Increases in informal sector wages are unlikely to provide a major boost to private consumption as the
recovery proceeds. After the 1994–95 crisis, the fall in the informal sector employment share and the reduction
in the formal-informal sector wage gap were both slow and gradual. From the right-hand panel of the figure
below, it is evident that while unemployment and the formal-informal sector wage gap have tended to move
together, during the recovery from the 1994–95 crisis unemployment fell faster than relative wage differentials
as activity rebounded. This time around, the output gap is projected to close only gradually over the medium
term, such that it will likely take time before labor demand picks up and the formal sector recovers which in
turn can allow informal sector wages to begin increasing in relative terms.

3.
Contracting activity and the sharply deteriorating external environment brought
about an abrupt reassessment of Mexico’s near-term outlook. Large unexpected losses on
corporate derivative exposures and refinancing difficulties for some large high profile
Mexican corporates during November 2008–March 2009 weighed on sentiment. Indeed,
market concerns regarding Mexico in the first quarter of 2009 were very much centered on
the overall balance of payments outlook and availability of liquid foreign currency flows and
buffers to tide over the crisis related financing stress. Sentiment vis-à-vis Mexico was further
exacerbated in early 2009 (Figure 3) by the growing realization of the looming output crunch
first manifested in the collapse of auto production for several weeks in December 2008–
January 2009. The FCL helped support sentiment when approved. Concerns resurfaced in
mid-2009 with the prospect of ratings downgrades on account of concerns over fiscal and
potential growth prospects.2 As discussed in IMF Country Report No. 09/53, the authorities
mounted a broad-based and nimble policy response to contain the crisis-related economic
stress. As such, stability has been maintained and the economy is now gradually emerging
from recession.

This is the first time that a counter-cyclical policy response has been possible in
Mexico, though options were somewhat constrained. Fiscal policy has been eased
substantially in 2009 and it is estimated that

smaller following the 1994–95 crisis, the
aggregate financial impulse delivered through these institutions in Mexico has been small
relative to some other countries, though importantly, quasi-fiscal risks have also been more
contained.

In the event, Fitch and S&P downgraded Mexico one notch to BBB with stable outlook in late 2009. Other
developments in 2009 related to the FCL are discussed in IMF Country Report No. 09/126 and Country Report
No. 09/302.

Reserve levels were viewed as adequate before the crisis, though concerns were
raised in the face of the unprecedented large shock. The authorities intervened substantially
in spot markets (US$31.4 billion in total, with US$11 billion auctioned off in a span of
10 days), in line with other emerging markets (though others engaged in larger non-spot
interventions). However, with increasing market volatility, concerns about rollover prospects
in the private sector, and uncertainty about the size of speculative derivative positions of a
few big corporates, many investors viewed the available level of reserves as modest, noting
that they were lower than in other emerging markets on balance sheet measures.
Establishment of precautionary financing lines—from the U.S. Federal Reserve (swap) and
from the Fund (FCL)—served to assuage these concerns.
6.
The financial sector was generally resilient but some pressure points became
apparent. Aggregate banking sector ratios remain strong. However, two key issues became
evident during the crisis. First, the sizable ownership of the local banking system by global
banks could have increased transmission of external shocks. Credit growth has been
decelerating since before the crisis, reflecting a pre-crisis retrenchment in consumer finance.
Credit supply may have been further constrained by pressures on parent balance sheets in the
case of some global banks. Second, non-bank intermediaries (accounting for at least
3 percent of system assets) have come under significant funding pressure. The authorities
moved quickly to address the situation with the weakest institutions. As of end-June 2009,
nonperforming loans in this sector stood at about 8½ percent of total loans, well above those
of the banking sector.
II. THE LEGACY OF THE CRISIS AND POLICY IMPERATIVES
7.
The crisis triggered an adverse shift in investor sentiment towards Mexico
reflecting vulnerabilities that were given new prominence. While Mexico’s fundamentals
do not appear to have been much worse affected relative to several peers in key dimensions
(Box 2), relative risk perceptions seem to have deteriorated some. Concerns about risks to the
medium-term fiscal outlook were heightened in light of growing uncertainties about the oil
revenue outlook and sources of growth in the context of a weaker external environment.
Indeed, potential growth in the advanced countries––especially the U.S. to which Mexico is
closely linked––is likely to be significantly lower for several years as a result of the crisis.3
Worries about the level of reserves have emerged for the first time during this crisis. While
the authorities have already started to address these concerns––see below––this underscores
imperatives on strengthening the fiscal position, boosting growth, and reviewing reserve
adequacy, which are at the forefront of the near term policy focus.

Mexico continues to be far more dependent than other emerging markets on links to the U.S. (see Sosa,
Sebastián, 2008, “External Shocks and Business Cycle Fluctuations in Mexico: How Important Are U.S.
Factors?” IMF Working Paper 08/100).

Fiscal outlook. The post-crisis fiscal outlook seems
to have deteriorated somewhat more than LAC
peers, but not relative to a broader EM peer group
(and much less than in industrial countries).
Mexico’s debt stock will have risen by some
4 percentage points by 2013, relative to the precrisis projection. The increase has also been
contained by a cautious fiscal policy response,
particularly in 2010.

Relative risk. Despite recent improvements,
Mexico’s relative riskiness has increased post-crisis,
while key fundamentals have not been notably
affected, compared to a set of emerging market
peers.

Note: ratio of 5yr CDS and EMBI-G spreads f or Mexico to average spreads f or

higher relative risk f or Mexico compared to selected peer group.

Growth outlook. The cumulative loss in output for Mexico relative to pre-crisis projections is large
but not in stark contrast to peers. The level of real GDP now projected for 2013 is some 7 percent
lower than the level projected pre-crisis. However, the outlook for potential growth in Mexico remains
weak in comparison: potential growth, at about 3 percent, is the weakest in the group.

The global environment facing Mexico over the medium term is also likely to be
less supportive than in previous years. Risks to external financial conditions facing Mexico
are on the up-side. Stricter regulation of global banks could also push up funding costs and
reduce the scope for financial deepening in Mexico. Greater global volatility and risk
aversion could result in higher risk premia. Combined, these factors raise risks for the cost of
capital facing Mexico going forward. Moreover, base borrowing costs in advanced countries
could rise in the face of increasing public debt.
A. Outlook and Risks
9.
Near-term growth in Mexico is expected to strengthen in line with the global
recovery. Growth rebounded in the second half of 2009, led by a recovery of manufacturing
exports––especially auto production which is back to pre-crisis levels––and aided by a snapback in services activities as the impact of the H1N1 flu dissipated in the third quarter.
Building on the momentum from end-2009, solid growth is expected in the first semester of
2010, gradually accelerating in the second half of the year as investment growth recovers on
better global prospects and then consumer confidence picks up. With growth projected at an
above-potential 4 percent rate in 2010 by staff and the authorities, and further accelerating to
about 4½ percent in 2011, the large output gap (estimated in the 7 to 10 percent range by the
team and the authorities) starts to narrow but is only closed gradually over the medium term.
10.
While headline inflation is expected to rise temporarily above the target range,
underlying inflationary pressures are on a downward path (Figure 4). With inflation
pressures subdued due to the large economic slack, and helped by falling non-core food
prices, headline inflation has been on a declining trend in 2009 despite pass-through from the
peso’s depreciation in late 2008. At 3.6 percent, end-2009 inflation is still somewhat above
Banxico’s 3 percent target. Although the underlying downward trend is projected to continue,
increases in administered prices and tax rates are expected to push-up the price level, and
temporarily raise, inflation to the 4½ to 5½ percent range in 2010.4 However, second round
effects—including on expectations—should be contained in light of considerable spare
capacity, and indeed inflation expectations so far appear to be well-anchored. Inflation is
expected to gradually decelerate towards target by end 2011 as the one-off effects dissipate.

4

The authorities estimate that administered price increases linked to energy prices and the cost of certain local
services will contribute about 1¼ percentage point to inflation in 2010. Tax measures in the 2010 budget are
likely to add another ½ percentage points to inflation in 2010.

After declining in 2009, the current account deficit is expected to widen modestly,
financed by a gradual increase in capital flows. The export decline during 2009 in the face
of the global shock, was more than off-set by a sharp fall in imports on the back of declining
domestic demand (Figure 5). Portfolio inflows picked up in the latter part of the year, though
net FDI remained subdued. Over the medium term, net oil exports are projected to decline,
with export volumes constant and imports growing in line with domestic demand, leading to
some widening of the current account deficit. In line with a recovery in global sentiment, FDI
and other inflows are also projected to resume in the baseline. Net international reserves—
boosted already by SDR allocations and receipts of the oil hedge in late 2009—are expected
to rise steadily, largely reflecting the authorities’ intent to retain the public sector’s foreign
exchange cashflow into reserves. Gross external debt remains manageable, about 18 percent
of GDP over the medium term (see Figure 6 and Table 8).
12.
Near-term risks to growth are somewhat to the up-side, but tilt more to the
downside for 2011. Upsides arise from the possibility of a faster-than-expected growth in
2010 in the US, including from possible
additional stimulus measures. For 2011 though,
the team and authorities saw downside risks
associated with weaker external demand and/or
tighter global financing conditions. Of particular
concern was the possible impact that the large
global sovereign refinancing need could have on
funding availability, especially from the latter
part of 2010 onwards. Moreover, any upsides
from policy stimulus in the U.S. in 2010 would
have payback to growth in 2011. Further, the possibility remains that feedback loops between
the domestic credit cycle and activity may be stronger than currently projected.

Mexico’s potential output growth is likely to have weakened. This is in part a direct
result of the projected slowdown in U.S. trend growth over the next years. But the weakness
in Mexican potential output growth also will
likely reflect the impact of tighter financing
conditions on capital accumulation and
productivity growth (see Chapter I of the SIP),
leading to a sizable cumulative output loss as a
result of the crisis (Text Chart). Medium-term
prospects would of course be boosted were the
lasting global consequences of the crisis milder
than expected, or structural reforms in Mexico
to be advanced quickly. However, difficulties
in building domestic consensus for reform ahead of the 2012 elections would be among the
downside risks to the projected gradual recovery of potential growth. Furthermore, the
security situation could also weigh on growth over the medium term.

B. Exiting the Crisis––Near-Term Policy Requirements
14.
Fiscal policy design in 2010 has had to balance the concern to avoid undue
withdrawal of stimulus, while providing assurances on medium term sustainability. Market
concerns about the long run fiscal position last year––focused by sharply falling oil
production––have circumscribed the authorities’ ability to maintain the stimulus injected in
2009. Moreover, as presaged in last year’s consultation, available room for easing fiscal
policy in 2010 under the current rule is smaller compared to 2009. Exceptional revenues used
in 2009––for example oil hedge operations, and central bank’s profits, totaling about 1½
percent of GDP––will not be available in 2010. Also, the authorities are seeking to maintain
buffers in the oil stabilization funds (amounting to 1 percent of GDP at end-2009) to preserve
room for maneuver against unanticipated shocks.
15.
The authorities have adopted, and the team supported, a two-pronged approach to
mitigate the withdrawal of fiscal support at a time when the recovery is not firmly
entrenched while preserving medium-term fiscal sustainability. First, the 2010 budget
includes an important tax package of about 1 percent of GDP to offset the deterioration in the
structural revenue position linked to the decline in oil production. Moreover, the possibility
of higher than budgeted oil prices creates some scope for additional upside savings. Second,
they have for the first time invoked the exceptional circumstances clause allowing for a
temporary deficit under the rule’s “traditional fiscal balance” definition. The authorities
approved a deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP for 2010 and 0.3 percent for 2011, which, together
with some limited use of the resources from the oil stabilization funds, is in their assessment,
calibrated to cover the cyclical deterioration in tax revenues.
16.
The augmented deficit will fall from 4.7 to 3.4 percent of GDP between 2009 and
2010. This implies a withdrawal of
Fiscal Impulse and Augmented Fiscal Balance
stimulus of about 2 percent of GDP. The
impact on demand is estimated to be
smaller (about 1 percent on output
growth), however, as the budget
achieves consolidation through arguably
lower impact revenue measures, while
higher multiplier social and investment
spending is preserved. The fiscal
tightening will also help stabilize public
debt and set the stage for its gradual
reduction over the next years.

The team noted that still weak demand conditions argued for maintaining
supportive near-term monetary policy settings. In of itself, the absence of signs of a strong
rally in consumption or investment and the large output gap would suggest keeping an
accommodative monetary policy stance until the recovery is firmly under way. But the team
noted that the case for a macro policy mix tilted towards continued support from monetary
policy was reinforced by the fiscal policy consolidation in 2010. The authorities have
signaled their intent to maintain monetary policy support for the time being, noting that the
projected upturn in inflation is due to one-off changes to the price level, and that the large
output gap should contain second round effects. However, there was agreement that it was
hard to predict the likelihood of second-round effects and Banxico is watching closely the
development of expectations.

There continues to be a clear recognition that the flexible exchange rate regime has
served Mexico well. The depreciation of the peso has absorbed some of the impact of the
large external shock to demand and financing conditions. In contrast with previous episodes
of large depreciations, stronger balance sheets and smaller currency mismatches have limited
financial disruptions. However, there was agreement that large derivative-related losses in
the corporate sector during 2008 were a sober reminder that new types of vulnerabilities have
emerged in recent years. To safeguard against such risks, the authorities have acted promptly
to strengthen disclosure requirements on derivatives and have enforced penalties against
some of the affected companies.
19.
The authorities have continued to adhere to transparent rules-based intervention
mechanisms to maintain orderly liquidity conditions during the crisis. Two auction
windows have been used this year, neither aimed at maintaining a particular level of the
exchange rate. In the first, pre-announced volumes of foreign exchange were sold at the spot
price, and in the second, liquidity up to US$400 million was offered at prices linked to the
spot rate. Altogether, Banxico made liquidity equivalent to about US$19 billion available to
the foreign exchange market through these mechanisms at a time when volumes have been
substantially reduced. Since the crisis, peso volatility has undergone a level shift upwards
that has shown no signs of fully reversing (Figure 7). This could be linked in part to
continued lower levels of market liquidity, suggesting a continued role for rules-based
liquidity facilities. The authorities have phased out the first facility, but have thus far
maintained the other mechanism in place.5

The cessation of daily sales since October 2009 and Banxico’s absorption of the public sector net forex
cashflow have allowed net international reserves to be built up to over pre-crisis levels, standing at $94.5 billion
end-February, 2010.

The team viewed the exchange rate as within the fair value range. Analysis based
on the CGER methodologies suggested that the exchange rate had moved towards the strong
side in mid-2008. The 15 percent depreciation of the real exchange rate since the Lehman
bankruptcy has alleviated these concerns. Indeed, the team’s analysis does not suggest a
misalignment of the exchange rate at this time (Box 3). Relative price level based measures
suggest that competitiveness may have been under pressures in the decade of the 2000’s as
China competed increasingly with Mexico in the U.S. market place and became a major
supplier in Mexican markets as well. However, these competitiveness concerns have likewise
been alleviated by the real depreciation. The authorities noted the uncertainty surrounding
equilibrium exchange rate assessments, and stressed that the value of the peso remains
market determined.
C. Beyond the Crisis—Building a Robust Future

The 2010 package increases the standard VAT rate by 1 percentage point to 16 percent, and contains increases
in a variety of excise taxes, important changes in the tax treatment of loss-carry forwards, a temporary increase
in income tax rates and revenue increases from improvements in tax administration. The resulting permanent
revenue increase (about 2/3 of the entire reform or 0.6 percent of GDP) delivers important consolidation.

Box 3. Mexico: Exchange Rate Assessments
The peso’s real effective exchange rate (REER) is considered to be broadly in line with
fundamentals, with a range of estimates across methodologies. The latest semi-annual
multi-country exercise of the IMF (CGER) shows Mexico’s real effective exchange rate at
about par value.1 These estimates reflect

over the longer term—in the absence of structural reforms—would have implications for the
estimated REER.

In terms of assessments of competitiveness, these estimates may be complemented by use

improvement in Mexico’s competitiveness.
However, the export basket’s price relative to trading partners was broadly stable over the
same period, and—as the composition of imports shifted towards low-cost suppliers—the
import basket’s price relative to trading partners continued to increase until 2007. This suggests
a less sanguine view of developments in external competitiveness over the past 10 years,
though concerns have been alleviated by the real depreciation since 2008 (with relative export
and import prices falling back to levels last seen around 2000).

A key uncertainty remains the outlook for oil production, highlighting the
importance of successful implementation of the 2008 PEMEX reform. Oil receipts
currently account for about one-third of
federal revenues. Production seems to have 3400 Mexico--Oil Production Estimates and Actuals, 2004-15

23.
Given uncertainties on the oil production outlook, additional measures are likely to
be needed over the medium term. In the near term, the authorities are focused on cutting
current spending––which has grown very fast in the last years––and continuing with their tax
administration reforms that have yielded strong results.7 Looking ahead, widening the tax
base remains a priority, including reducing the extensive exemptions and zero ratings under
the VAT and simplifying the personal and corporate income taxes. On the expenditure side,
reforming untargeted energy subsidies, (electricity subsidies alone are estimated to cost some
1 percent of GDP) and moving towards a framework of medium-term spending planning are
among the available options to generate savings.8
Options for enhancing the fiscal framework
24.
The current balanced-budget rule has served well to build credibility, but is
procyclical and provides limited scope for saving. The discipline of the rule has contained
fiscal deficits and contributed to reductions in deficits and debt levels. However, rapid
spending increases in the pre-crisis commodity boom years highlight scope for refinement.
Booming oil revenues during 2003–08 underwrote average annual growth in real primary
spending of 7 percent as savings in oil stabilization funds were capped at about 1½ percent of

Keys here will be continuing the work on improving risk-based audits and collection of tax arrears, as well as
introducing electronic invoicing in the immediate period ahead.

22
GDP by end-2008. Moreover, the rule is asymmetric––the deficit can be increased in
exceptional downside circumstances, but there is no mechanism for savings on the upside.
25.
The team noted that a structural rule would reduce spending volatility over the
cycle and could facilitate savings. Various alternatives are discussed in Chapter III of the
SIP. The authorities were open to this idea, not least because it would further strengthen the
credibility of the framework by introducing a symmetric response to output shocks. While in
the near term they had focused their efforts on revenue measures, they had nonetheless
removed caps on accumulation in the oil stabilization funds for 2010 as an initial step to
promote savings. The team welcomed this and noted that as the output gap closes and tax
stabilizers increase, it might be opportune to transition to a new structural rule to reinforce
savings at the top of the cycle and also push debt ratios further down.
26.
A structural rule should be consistent with a steady reduction in debt ratios
which—while manageable––remain above 2007 levels. The gross debt ratio is expected to
peak in 2010 at about 45 percent of GDP, dropping gradually to about 42 percent of GDP by
2015 (net public debt is projected at a lower level of about 38 percent of GDP by 2015).
Moreover, the standard debt sustainability analysis (Figure 8 and Table 7) shows that even if
fiscal policy were not constrained by the rule in the event of shocks, debt levels would still
remain manageable in the medium term. The team noted that in reviewing the fiscal
framework it would also be important to consider medium term debt goals and what this
might mean for the primary adjustment profile.
Financial stability
27.
Like other emerging markets in Latin
America, the core Mexican financial system has
come through the crisis relatively well. Pressure on
capital ratios and profitability has been manageable.
While the system is heavily exposed to cross-border
ownership (see ¶30), the bulk of funding is sourced
from domestic retail sources that has provided a key
source of stability especially in the face of the global
funding shocks affecting systems in advanced
countries and other emerging markets.

However, pressures on bank capital from credit risk could yet arise as NPLs have
drifted up and corporate sector buffers have been reduced. The credit slowdown continues,
and has spread beyond consumer finance.

show that most banks would be well placed to manage a further rise in NPLs, though some
groups could come under greater pressure.
29.
Smaller non-bank intermediaries are at greater risk. The Sofoles/Sofomes sector,
(comprising at least 3 percent of system assets)9 relied heavily on domestic wholesale
financing. With the market disruptions after the Lehman bankruptcy, the sector experienced
severe liquidity pressures in late 2008, leading to liquidity facilities being made available by
the public sector, and to the intervention of some larger intermediaries. Looking ahead, the
sector faces important downsides from credit risk. The authorities are planning to widen the
regulatory perimeter to better monitor these entities (see ¶33) and also intend to gather more
information about the size of these institutions, their financial soundness, and their linkages
to the rest of the financial system.

9

Sofoles and Sofomes are non-bank financial institutions created in the early 1990s with the aim at providing
credit and financing to specific sectors of the economy. Since 2006, their mandate was expanded to allow for
leasing and factoring, and extending credit to multiple sectors of the economy. Discussions during the mission
indicate that the number of active entities is larger than those currently regulated, though many of these could
on average be smaller in size than those in the regulated group. The authorities are stepping up monitoring of
the sector.

25
Rethinking the financial sector framework
30.
Changes to international financial system regulations proposed by the FSB are not
likely to have a large direct impact on banks in Mexico. As discussed in Box 4, capital
requirements and definitions are proposed to be made more stringent, liquidity requirements
enhanced, and the reach of regulators increased. But the direct impact on Mexican banks will
be muted as they already meet the higher standards––capital is good quality, trading and
securitized operations are small, and liquidity is already high. Furthermore, emerging
markets have much to gain from greater cross-border coordination of bank monitoring and
resolution, as highlighted by the current crisis where financial sector shocks emanated from
abroad in many cases.
31.
However, these reforms are likely to increase expenses for global bank parents,
which could in part be passed through to operations in Mexico. In common with other
emerging markets, Mexico has a substantial participation of foreign banks (Text Figure).
Indeed, about 80 percent of
Foreign bank credit (share of GDP)
system assets in Mexico are
owned by systemically
important global banks that
are likely to face higher
capital charges from their
home country regulators as a
result of the changes discussed
above. The authorities shared
the concerns about possible
pass-through of higher capital
charges, but noted that it was
early to say what the full
impact of these changes would
be. Nonetheless, to manage
risks with regards to global banks, the authorities are considering tightening the limit for
exposure of Mexican subsidiaries to their foreign parent banks from 50 percent of equity to
20 percent.

Further developing the framework for supervision of systemic risk will also be
important. Significant strides have been made in strengthening the institutional framework
for financial oversight in Mexico. But the crisis has brought to the fore the importance of
monitoring systemic risk. As a first step, the authorities are considering establishing a
committee comprising the Ministry of Finance, Banxico, the Banking Commission and other
agencies to coordinate actions in cases of systemic importance. In addition, the new
bankruptcy law for financial institutions––with important improvements to the framework––
is awaiting approval in Congress.

26

Box 4. Directions in Global Regulatory Reform––Direct Implications for Mexico
Definition of capital. Given concerns over the quality of especially Tier-1 capital, stricter international
standards are being developed which will require global banks to raise common equity and loss-absorbing
Tier-2 capital. However Mexican banks have high capital ratios, mostly comprising Tier-1 capital, which
in turn is mostly common equity.1 Proposals to introduce a minimum capital charge on banks’ trading
books should also have limited impact in Mexico given the relatively small proprietary position of most
banks. However, potential revisions to Tier 2 capital standards could require capital to be raised by some
banks.
Systemic Risk Requirements. Specific capital charges on large banks related to TBTF concerns would
likely raise capital requirements on some banks in Mexico and in Latin America, given that banking
systems in the region are relatively concentrated.
Liquidity Requirements. Many Latin American countries, including Mexico,2 have liquidity
requirements that are higher than in most advanced countries. As such, the adoption of tighter standards
being proposed—such as a “liquidity coverage ratio” for a 30-day horizon, or a “net stable funding ratio”
with a medium term perspective—would likely have a moderate impact in most countries in the region,
including Mexico. Countries where wholesale funding is important may be more adversely affected.
Dynamic provisions. Mexican banks, in common with most others in Latin America, have provisions in
excess of non-performing loans (the ratio is 150 percent as of June 2009). As such, were systems of
dynamic provisions to be introduced going forward, these would not materially affect banks in the near
term, but would moderate balance sheet expansion during cyclical upswings.
Dynamic capital. Proposals here aim at smoothing the impact of economic fluctuations on bank capital.
This could be done by introducing a countercyclical scaling factor to capital ratios, which would be linked
to the long-term behavior of, for example, GDP. The objective would be to build buffers in good times and
avoid excessive deleveraging in bad times. This would likely not have much near term impact, but would
require capital bases to be built up faster as the recovery takes hold.
Regulatory perimeter. Proposals here seek to broaden the regulatory net, especially given the experience
with risk hidden off bank’s balance sheets in advanced countries. Mexico, in common with others in the
region, already has in place a broad perimeter. But there are still systemic institutions in some countries
that are arguably insufficiently regulated and supervised, including cooperatives, insurance companies and
offshore financial institutions. In Mexico, the authorities are considering regulating more closely the nonbank sector (Sofoles/Sofomes).
Cross-Border Issues. Key issues under consideration include the introduction of “living wills”, and
arrangements for potential loss sharing. Given the strong international links of financial systems in Mexico
and much of Latin America, existing MOU’s with home regulators of global banks may require steps to
further clarify the responsibilities of each party in case of failure of subsidiaries or parent bank. Mexican
authorities are also considering reducing the limit of exposure of subsidiaries of foreign banks with parent
institutions from 50 percent of equity to 20 percent.

The authorities are planning to tighten regulation of non-banks that could
represent significant risk, while preserving the current lighter regulation for other smaller
intermediaries that has been successful in deepening the financial system.10 The team advised
broadening the criteria for being subject to regulation11 and requiring full information
disclosure by all non-banks which represent material risks.12 The Sofoles strategy ought also
to focus on diversifying the funding base, improving origination standards, addressing
governance issues, and reducing conflicts of interest with developers. The authorities are
mindful of striking a balance between containing systemic risk and allowing development of
this sector which provides intermediation services to under-financed groups. But there was
agreement on the importance of collecting more information on the sector.
Reinvigorating medium-term growth

TFP growth (%, per year)

34.
A wide range of factors, including low investment and productivity rates, have
constrained growth in Mexico. As documented extensively in Chiquiar and Ramos Francia
(2009), the concerns range from rigid and

capita GDP over the next two decades. An
obstacle to higher private investment is enforcement of contract rights. Mexico lags its peers
with respect to the cost of enforcing contracts, which are over 1½ the OECD median,
exceeding those in most emerging markets. The authorities noted that they had launched an
initiative to significantly streamline regulations which should gradually lead to improvements
in cost of doing business indicators.

10

A draft law presented at the Mexican Senate will now also regulate Sofoles/Sofomes that have equity links to
some other types of non-banks, or that seek funding in capital markets. Fit and proper tests will also be
tightened, while the CNBV will be given greater enforcement powers.
11

In line with international practices, the authorities are considering subjecting to regulation and supervision
non-bank institutions of significant size.

12

For example, providing financial statements, financial soundness indicators, at least quarterly, and
establishing “subsidiary” supervision for the universe of Sofoles/Sofomes that remains “unregulated” (for
example, reporting financial information to the industry association (Amfe)).

Labor Productivity Growth (In
pecent)

35.
Boosting competition is key to achieving higher productivity growth. The team’s
analysis of firm-level data from Mexico’s manufacturing sector shows that as concentration
increases (measured by a rising Lerner

especially in key network sectors such as

reforms in the energy sector could be an important step here in supporting productivity
growth going forward.15
36.
Another symptom of structural impediments holding back flexibility and growth in
Mexico is the high level of labor market informality (see Chapter II of the SIPs). Sixty
percent of the labor force is employed in the informal sector. Moreover, wages in the formal
sector are about 15 percent higher than in the informal sector after controlling for observable
differences in worker characteristics such as
age and educational level. Using this “wage
gap” as a proxy for productivity and the
historical average size of the informal sector,
an illustrative calculation suggests that
informality could be costing the Mexican
economy as much as 9 percent of GDP.16
Moreover, while more productive sectors (as
proxied by having a higher wage-gap) are
relatively more formal, reducing their still
high levels of informality could yield

14

OECD (2009) reports that the cost of Mexican regulations in these sectors is four times the OECD median.

15

The authorities have restructured Mexico’s largest power distribution utility, responsible for most major
urban/industrial centers to allow convergence to the higher levels of efficiency seen in the rest of the public
sector.

This figure is likely an upper bound. Details of the computation and associated caveats are presented in
Chapter II of the SIP.

29
substantial growth dividends. The authorities have been developing a social consensus on
labor reforms that should lead to some increases in flexibility. However, further steps to
better align incentives, including with respect to social insurance, will likely be needed to
have a substantial impact on informality.
International reserve levels

and Box 5, Mexico’s reserve ratios against
balance sheet indicators (such as investment
positions of non-residents and financial depth) were well below those in other emerging
markets. In this context, insurance against tail risks associated with the external outlook was
provided by the swap line with the Fed and the FCL from the Fund (amounting to about
US$80 billion in total).

38.
Looking forward, the authorities indicated that they intended to increase the level
of reserves over the coming years. They would accomplish this by a combination of
retaining public sector foreign exchange receipts and rules-based intervention mechanisms
consistent with maintaining the freely floating exchange rate regime.17 The team agreed that
there was a case for higher external insurance (see Box 5 for a further discussion of related
considerations), but noted that the authorities’ strategy should leave open possibilities for
multilateral insurance. The authorities noted that were the Fund to develop suitable
alternative insurance mechanisms for members with strong fundamentals, that this would be
a serious option for countries to consider. As such, they noted that forthcoming reforms of
Fund facilities could play a role in their decision regarding options for increasing external
insurance in the period ahead.
17

Subsequent to the mission, the authorities have implemented a mechanism that had previously been in place during 19962001. Under this mechanism, each month Banxico sells a preannounced amount of put options to financial intermediaries,
who have the right to exercise the options—selling dollars to Banxico for pesos—at a price determined by the market,
subject to a pre-agreed knock-in condition. The condition, specifying that the intermediaries could sell dollars to Banxico
only if the peso was more appreciated than the 20-day moving average, has helped reduce the volatility of the exercise price.
For a more detailed discussion of the mechanism, see Sidaoui, 2003, “Policies for international reserve accumulation under a
floating exchange rate regime: the experience of Mexico (1995–2003),” http://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap23r.pdf , pp.
220-1.

Box 5. Mexico: Reserve Adequacy
Market concerns arose regarding the level of reserves in Mexico during the global crisis. Ahead of the
crisis, Mexico’s reserves were seen as adequate for “normal times,” conforming to various rules of thumb on
flow variables––indeed, this remains the case––including with respect to coverage of maturing debt (see Text
Box). However reserve cover relative to various balance sheet indicators is lower, including relative to broad
money, a proxy for possible capital flight,

The remainder of this box considers approaches to thinking about the appropriate level of reserves.
Empirical analysis for reserve demand provides a wide range of estimates.


Much of the literature has analyzed reserve adequacy based on a variant of the “buffer-stock model,”
whereby reserves are seen as resources to smooth consumption to mitigate the impact (if not the
incidence) of sudden stops of foreign exchange. Early efforts—Edwards (1983) and Flood and
Marion (2002), for instance—found support for the hypothesis that adjustment costs and opportunity

with the increase in the perceived



Aizenman and Lee (2002) and Obstfeld et al. (2009) are among those that attempt to explain the
post-crisis behavior. The studies find that insurance against capital account vulnerabilities explains
much of the buildup in recent years. Obstfeld et al. (2009) posit a role for “financial depth” (broad
money to GDP ratio) representing the probability of deposit outflows by residents. Using such
specifications controlling for balance sheet factors, and additional external vulnerability indicators,
suggest larger differences of fitted versus actual reserve holdings at end-2009 (see Text Figure).



However, it is also worth noting that these regressions do not imply “optimality,” focusing instead
on deviations from conditioned means across the sample. Nonetheless, changing relevant parameters
in models of “optimal” levels of reserves—such as that developed by Jeanne and Rancière (2007)—
also yields intuitive results: relatively small increases in parameters such as risk aversion (a likely
outcome following a global crisis) or an increase in the probability of a sudden stop can lead to
substantial increases in the optimal level of reserves.

III. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Mexico’s strong balance sheets and very strong policy frameworks have cushioned
the blow from the global crisis. The investments of the last decade in lowering public debt
and introducing rules-based policy frameworks have paid dividends by preserving stability
and enabling a counter-cyclical policy response for the first time in many years. Moreover,
the lower leverage and stronger liquidity and income positions of banks and corporates have
allowed the private sector to absorb the initial shock without substantially weakening balance
sheets.
40.
Despite a very strong and effective policy response, the Mexican economy has
experienced a sizable shock and risk perceptions have weakened somewhat during the
crisis. In part, this reflected renewed concerns about medium term growth and fiscal
prospects––reflecting rapid declines in oil production––as well as investors’ perception that
Mexico’s reserves were below those in emerging market peers. Thus, a key challenge—on
which the authorities have already taken important steps––is to address these medium to long
term concerns.
41.
The near term growth outlook is favorable though risks are to the downside in
2011. A cyclical recovery is already in train, and the team expects growth of about 4 percent
in 2010. With the output gap still large, growth is expected to be above potential for the next
several years. An important concern going forward are the continued uncertainties regarding
the global economic and financial outlook which create downside risks in 2011. Spillovers
from these will require continued close monitoring and add to the imperatives to rebuild
buffers.
42.
The tax reform included in the 2010 budget is a welcome step in assuring fiscal
sustainability. It is a testament to the authorities’ commitment to sound policies that they
were able to build consensus for these measures in the midst of a sharp slowdown. The
budget has been carefully calibrated to smooth as much as feasible the withdrawal of
stimulus while maintaining funding for crucial social and investment programs.
43.
Currently supportive monetary policy settings are appropriate. With fiscal policy
turning contractionary at a time when output remains well below potential, the burden of
supporting demand shifts to monetary policy. With inflation expectations remaining wellbehaved so far, Banxico has some room for maneuver. Indeed, Banxico has effectively
communicated the one-off nature and estimated size of the impact of changes in tax rates and
administered prices on inflation. Nevertheless, risks of second round effects naturally remain
a concern to be watched.
44.
The flexible exchange rate has also played an important role in the adjustment
process. The crisis has seen a substantial depreciation of the peso, which has facilitated
adjustment in goods and asset markets. The exchange rate appears broadly fair-valued at the
current juncture based on the array of methodologies applied by the team. The authorities’

32
intervention in foreign exchange markets has focused on maintaining orderly liquidity
conditions, and the rules based mechanisms used have preserved the most essential aspects of
the flexible exchange rate system.
45.
Reforms over the last three years have strengthened the fiscal position, although
with the share of oil revenues expected to gradually decline and current spending
pressures likely to mount, additional measures will be needed over the medium term. The
authorities’ near-term focus on finding expenditure savings and improving tax administration
is commendable. Effective implementation of the oil sector reform will also be key, and
progress should be reviewed at an early date. Looking forward, additional steps to address
structural weaknesses in the tax system, especially the narrowness of the tax base, will be
important. Introducing a medium term expenditure planning framework would also help.
46.
The balanced budget rule has been a key anchor, but there is a case for moving
towards a structural rule over time. The current rule has built up the credibility of the fiscal
framework. But moving to a structural rule would lower procyclicality and reduce the
asymmetry inherent in the current framework. Such a rule should also be designed to be
consistent with a continued reduction in debt levels to pre-crisis levels. The elimination of
the caps on savings in stabilization funds for this year is a welcome step––it would be useful
to consider making this permanent.
47.
The financial stability outlook is favorable, though some risks remain. Still falling
credit combined with reduced corporate buffers and possible downside risks to growth could
yet lead to a further weakening in credit quality. However, most banks are well capitalized
and are well placed to absorb additional shocks. The nonbank sector has been hit harder by
the crisis and it will be important to step up monitoring of these institutions to get a better
picture of risks that might arise. While financial system regulation and supervision are
already very strong, the authorities’ proposals to broaden the regulatory perimeter, set up a
committee for assessing systemic risks, and reform the resolution framework for the financial
system are appropriate.
48.
Global banks could be a conduit for tighter financing conditions arising from
proposed international regulatory reforms. At this time, it is not expected that the regulatory
proposals put forward by the FSB would have significant direct impact on Mexican banks.
However, other steps to place restrictions on the operations of banks in advanced countries
could lead to disintermediation in emerging markets such as Mexico. Moreover, to the extent
that global banks may face higher capital charges going forward, some transmission of higher
costs to emerging markets such as Mexico is possible. In this context, the authorities’
proposals to strengthen regulations against liquidity drains from domestic banks and
strengthen coordination with home country supervisors of global banks are reasonable.
Planned steps to develop further capital markets to create alternate sources of funding beyond
the largely foreign-owned banking system are also welcome.

33
49.
A central challenge is to boost potential growth and advancing on structural
reforms to boost competition and flexibility. Substantial increases in investment and
productivity will be needed to substantially speed up growth. The recent important steps to
improve productivity in the electricity sector will lower costs and support growth and
employment. The authorities’ intent to further bolster the competition framework in Mexico
is timely, and rapid action on high profile cases in key network industries would send
positive signals. Meanwhile, labor market reforms being discussed go in the right direction,
but more action will be needed to increase flexibility.
50.
An increase in reserves is desirable, but it will be important to keep open the option
of using multilateral insurance mechanisms. Risk perceptions have changed in the wake of
the crisis. Attention has especially been drawn to Mexico’s lower coverage compared to
peers on measures related to balance sheet exposures. In this context, the authorities’
indication that they would be prepared to consider multilateral insurance mechanisms to
achieve their goals, should suitably strong instruments emerge from the current review of
Fund facilities, is welcome.
51.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Mexico occur on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Public sector includes federal government, Pemex, and other public compaies, development banks, Pidiregas, IPAB, debtors' program, and Farac.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

ANNEX II. MEXICO—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
Mexico has had a longstanding partnership with the World Bank Group encompassing the
delivery of the full menu of financial, knowledge, and coordination and convening services.
Beginning in mid-2008, Mexico faced a deteriorating global environment and the parallel
negative impacts of the food crisis and the influenza pandemic, as well as other internal
issues related to organized crime. The IBRD was able to quickly respond to the need for
increased financing by the federal government, while continuing to deliver on a broad
knowledge agenda.
Crisis support has included higher levels of financing and Bank knowledge support. In
responding to the crisis the program has evolved to include a few large DPLs and several
quick-disbursing investment loans targeted to the poor. The program of support includes a
major effort to alleviate the expected human consequences of the economic downturn, as
well as efforts to promote the basis for gradual reactivation of the economy by strengthening
the financial sector and supporting investment in infrastructure. At the same time, the Bank
program responding as Mexico moves aggressively to mainstream climate change
considerations in its infrastructure and social programs and to become a model and global
champion for the climate change agenda. Going forward, strong demand for financing is
likely to continue at least through calendar year 2010. Beyond 2010, a continuation of a
strong knowledge and innovation-focused partnership is likely, but with a higher level of
base financing as compared to pre-global crisis expectations.
As of January 31, 2010, Mexico was the Bank’s second largest borrower with US$ 10.5
billion debt outstanding, representing 9.2 percent of the IBRD’s total portfolio. As of this
date, Mexico had the seventh largest portfolio under supervision in terms of net IBRD
commitments with US$3,947 million of which US$957 million remained undisbursed. The
active portfolio comprised 15 projects. In the first half of FY10, the Bank approved three
projects for a total amount of approximately US$3.5 billion. FY10 total new lending is
envisaged at US$6.7 billion. The Progress Report for the FY08-13 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) which was discussed in April 2008, will be circulated to the Board on March
25, 2010.

ANNEX III. MEXICO—STATISTICAL ISSUES
The overall quality of Mexican statistics is good. A data ROSC for Mexico was completed on
May 23, 2003 and was subsequently published as IMF Country Report No. 03/150. A data
ROSC update was conducted in February 2010 and the draft report is being reviewed by the
authorities. There are various areas where improvements could be made. The authorities are
aware of this situation and are continuing work in this regard. Mexico observes the Special
Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). In a number of cases, the periodicity and timeliness of
disseminated data exceed SDDS requirements.
Although some items of the balance of payments statistics conform to the fifth edition of
the Balance of Payments Manual, a full transition has not yet been completed. Several
measures to improve external debt statistics have been carried out, including the
compilation of data on external liabilities of the private sector and publicly traded companies
registered with the Mexican stock exchange (external debt outstanding, annual amortization
schedule for the next four years broken down by maturity, and type of instrument).
International reserves data are compiled according to the Operational Guidelines for the
Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity of the IMF (2001).
The national accounts statistics generally follow the recommendations of the System of
National Accounts, 1993 (1993 SNA). Source data and statistical techniques are sound and
most statistical outputs sufficiently portray reality. A broad range of source data are
available, with economic censuses every five years and a vast program of monthly and
annual surveys. For most surveys, scientific sampling techniques are used. Nonetheless, most
samples exclude a random sample of small enterprises. Changes in inventories are obtained
as residuals, so there is no independent verification between the production and expenditure
measures of GDP. Some statistical techniques need enhancement. For example taxes and
subsidies on products at constant prices are estimated by applying the GDP growth rate; a
deviation from best practice.
The concepts and definitions for both the CPI and PPI meet international standards. The PPI
is only compiled by product and not by economic activity.1 Source data for the CPI and PPI
are comprehensive and meet the needs for both indices.. Price and product specification data
collected for the fortnightly price survey, as well as expenditure data collected for the
ENIGH, are processed and audited according to procedures established as part of the total
quality management system ISO 9001.
The authorities compile fiscal statistics following national concepts, definitions, and
classifications that make international comparison difficult. The statistics are comprehensive
and timely, except for states and municipalities. The new government accounting law
mandates accounting standards that follow international standards for all levels of
1

The BANXICO has virtually completed an update of both the CPI and PPI in preparation for the transfer of
the compilation of these series to INEGI. The new index series will not be officially published until July 2010.

government, and that take into account the information needs of international organizations
and national accounts.
The methodological foundations of monetary statistics are generally sound. However, the
recording of financial derivative and, to a lesser extent, repurchase agreements transactions
are overstating the aggregated other depository corporations (ODC) balance sheet and
survey. The accuracy and reliability of the monetary statistics are supported by
comprehensive source data. The coverage of nonbank ODC is complete, but time delays in
the submission of such data and the processing of the reports impedes timely dissemination
of the ODC survey. Availability of quarterly data on other financial intermediaries such as
insurance companies and pension funds allow for the construction of a financial corporations
survey with full coverage of the Mexican financial system, which is published at the BM
website on a regular basis.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation
with Mexico
On March 10, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Mexico.1
Background
Mexico had significantly strengthened policy credibility and public and private sector
balance sheets before the onset of the crisis. Strong economic performance, with growth
averaging over 3.5 percent in 2003-07, was underpinned by robust macro policy
frameworks along with the flexible exchange rate regime. Considerable progress was made
in improving debt profiles, and the strong regulatory framework gave rise to a sound
banking sector.
Nevertheless, Mexico’s resilience was severely tested during the global crisis. The surge in
risk aversion following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 triggered a
sharp retrenchment of financial flows from emerging markets, including Mexico, resulting in
liquidity strains and marked currency depreciation. Meanwhile, reflecting close U.S.
linkages, Mexico experienced a rapid decline in manufacturing exports in the first half of
2009. Unanticipated large losses on corporate foreign exchange derivate positions
disclosed in late 2008 further weighed on confidence, while the H1N1 virus outbreak in mid1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2009 put an additional drag on activity. Against this background, output contracted by 6½
percent in 2009, while the peso fell 25 percent against the dollar in the nine months to mid2009.
Prompt and effective policy measures were adopted in response to the crisis.
Macroeconomic policies were eased significantly, providing a fiscal impulse of 2.5 percent
of GDP in 2009 and reducing policy rates by a total of 375 bps, to 4.5 percent, since mid2008. Targeted assistance was also extended to financial intermediaries to address funding
shortages. At the same time, Mexico’s Central Bank (Banxico) made substantial
interventions (US$31.4 billion in total) to maintain orderly liquidity conditions in the foreign
exchange market, and secured contingent financing through the Federal Reserve swap line
($30bn, expired in February 2010) and the Fund Flexible Credit Line ($47bn, effective till
mid-April 2010) to further support confidence. On the back of these strong policy measures,
growth has resumed since mid-2009, the peso exchange rate has rebounded, while
domestic financial stability has been maintained.
Building on the recent momentum, activity is expected to accelerate in the near term,
leading to projected growth of 4 percent for 2010. Inflation was pushed up to 4½ percent in
January 2010 by one-off increases in taxes and administered prices, but is expected to
return to the 3 percent target by end-2011 reflecting the considerable economic slack. With
domestic demand gradually strengthening, the current account deficit is projected to widen
slightly to 1½ percent of GDP in 2010.
The authorities have also undertaken a series of measures to further bolster fundamentals
and rebuild buffers. The FY2010 budget included a substantive tax reform, designed to
offset the revenue losses from lower oil production, while allowing for a temporary easing of
the balanced budget rule in response to the cyclical downturn. Requirements on corporate
disclosure of derivative exposures has been tightened, while structural reforms to enhance
growth potential—most recently reforms of the electricity sector—are being advanced. In
addition, the authorities have announced plans to increase foreign exchange reserves
gradually through a combination of retaining public sector foreign exchange cash flows and
the use of an options-based mechanism.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their sound policy frameworks and
progress in strengthening public and private sector balance sheets, which had enabled an
effective counter-cyclical policy response and helped preserve stability during the crisis.
Their swift action to secure contingency credit lines—from the U.S. Federal Reserve and
the Fund—has also helped maintain external confidence. The economy is starting to
recover, following the deep output contraction in the first half of 2009. However, the
uncertain global outlook could pose downside risks, underscoring the need to increase

3
room for policy maneuver and strengthen efforts to address medium-term fiscal and growth
challenges.
Directors considered that the 2010 budget is appropriate. The tax package represents an
important step toward achieving medium-term fiscal sustainability, while the temporary
easing of the balanced budget, in accordance with the exceptional clause of the fiscal rule,
would help cushion the impact of the withdrawal of fiscal support. Directors welcomed the
progress in fiscal reforms over the past three years. Given the expected structural declines
in oil revenues and rising current spending pressures, they welcomed plans to seek
expenditure savings and further strengthen tax administration. Further efforts would be
needed to advance on oil sector reforms, broaden the tax base, and simplify the tax system.
Moving to a structural budget rule would help reduce procyclicality and spending volatility,
further strengthening policy credibility. Directors saw the removal of the caps on savings in
the oil stabilization funds as a step in the right direction.
In light of the still weak demand conditions, Directors agreed that monetary policy should
remain supportive until the recovery is firmly established. The central bank’s effective
communication has helped limit the effects on inflation of the recent changes in taxes and
administered prices. Nevertheless, second-round effects would need to be carefully
monitored.
Directors agreed that the flexible exchange rate has played an important role in the
adjustment process, and welcomed the transparent, rules-based intervention mechanisms.
Noting persistent market concerns about Mexico’s low reserve coverage relative to balance
sheet indicators, many Directors saw merit in the authorities’ plan to explore options for
further strengthening foreign exchange buffers. A number of other Directors pointed to the
need to take due account of the costs and externalities of reserve accumulation.
Directors noted that the financial system remains resilient, underpinned by strong regulation
and supervision. They welcomed the authorities’ prompt action to address emerging issues
in some small nonbank institutions, and encouraged continued close monitoring of
developments in this sector. Directors supported the intentions to broaden the regulatory
perimeter, set up a committee for assessing systemic risks, and reform the financial sector
resolution framework.
Directors emphasized that the challenge of reinvigorating growth has gained new urgency in
a weak global environment. They encouraged the authorities to expedite structural reforms
to boost growth, building on recent important steps to improve productivity in the electricity
sector. Key priorities include advancing on strengthening the competition framework,
streamlining the regulatory framework, and enhancing labor market flexibility.
