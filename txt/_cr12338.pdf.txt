STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 31, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: The economy has slowed, driven by weakening domestic demand, but growth
is expected to remain positive and more balanced this year. The current account deficit
has adjusted at a significant pace and inflation has decelerated, although it remains
above the central bank’s target. Despite the reduction in imbalances and generally
sound balance sheets in the economy, Turkey remains vulnerable to capital flow reversal
due to its large external financing needs; should this occur, it could lead to a hard
landing.
Challenges: In the short term, the priority is to reduce imbalances further and build
buffers against possible adverse external developments. In the medium term, raising the
economy’s potential and breaking its boom-bust cycle requires enhanced coordination
of macroeconomic policies, higher savings, and improved competitiveness.
Policy recommendations:


The current fiscal stance is too loose, driven by rapid growth in primary expenditures.
The 2013 budget envisages a tightening, which is appropriate.



The medium-term fiscal plan should aim at a sizeable increase in the primary surplus.
The back-loaded adjustment should be delivered through restraint in current
spending.



The central bank should normalize the monetary policy framework and focus more
decisively on achieving its inflation target, which requires a positive real policy
interest rate and improved communication with the markets.



In the medium term, higher public savings should contribute to an increase in
national savings, while broad structural reforms should be geared to improving
competitiveness.

CONTEXT
1.
Strong buffers and a prompt policy response to the 2008 global financial crisis helped
Turkey recover quickly. Prior to the crisis, the Turkish authorities revamped the policy framework
and gained policy space, used at the outset of the crisis. The policy response, the normalization of
global financial conditions, and Turkey’s fundamentals—low public sector debt, single-digit inflation,
the banks’ healthy balance sheets, and favorable medium-term prospects—resulted in a strong
recovery, attracting sizeable capital inflows.
2.
However, weak coordination of macroeconomic policies resulted in a slow reversal of
the stimulus when the recovery materialized. The delay in implementing coordinated
counter-cyclical policies allowed for a credit-fueled domestic demand boom to take hold. This
pushed inflation to double digits and widened the current account deficit to 10 percent of GDP
(the second largest in the world in dollar terms) in 2011, exposing Turkey to the risks of capital flow
reversal at a time of continued global uncertainty.
3.
After two years of rapid growth, the economy has slowed and imbalances are
unwinding. Domestic demand started to decelerate decisively on the back of tighter
macroeconomic policy from the summer of 2011 onwards, coinciding with the deterioration of the
external environment. Exports have held up better than expected, with robust trade with the MENA
region offsetting weak demand in the EU. The economic slowdown has allowed for a narrowing of
the positive output gap and an improvement in the current account deficit and inflation.


The immediate challenge is to further reduce the risks presented by the external imbalance. External
financing needs will hover above 25 percent of GDP and continue to pose a significant vulnerability; in
particular, due to the dependence of banks on short-term foreign borrowing, which in the face of an abrupt
disruption to capital inflows could lead to a credit contraction and economic hard landing. At the same
time, low interest rates in advanced economies could lead to strong capital inflows and the re-emergence
of a domestic demand boom that would reverse the unwinding of imbalances. Such an environment
requires navigating a very narrow policy path: maintaining the flexibility to respond in case domestic
demand weakens further, while giving priority to reducing the current account deficit and inflation.



In the medium term, Turkey must address its low savings in order to reduce dependence on external
financing. Tackling the competitiveness gap and improving the policy mix to mitigate real cycles will be
crucial toward this end. With a current account deficit norm of around 3 percent and the actual deficit
2–4 percentage points of GDP above what can be explained by fundamentals and desired policy settings,
the real exchange rate appears overvalued by some 10–20 percent. The low savings rate, around 14 percent
of GDP, results in a sharp pro-cyclicality of investment linked to the availability of external financing, with
major consequences for the volatility of output. Better integrating monetary, fiscal, and macro-prudential
frameworks would help smooth the cycles through future episodes of capital inflows and maintain financial
stability.

4.
The Justice and Development (AK) Party continues to dominate the political landscape.
It holds a comfortable majority in parliament, helpful in enabling the government to proceed with its
legislative agenda. The adoption of a new constitution, possibly to include a strengthened

presidential system, is one of the major ongoing institutional issues. Foreign policy concerns loom
large, notably the conflict in neighboring Syria. Turkey will enter an extended electoral period
in 2013, with municipal elections expected in late 2013, a Presidential election in 2014, and
parliamentary in 2015.

9 percent, a ten-year low.
6.
The deceleration is the result of both policy tightening and exogenous factors.
Provisioning requirements and risk weights on general purpose loans were increased in June 2011,
while the authorities used moral suasion to guide banks towards an implicit nominal credit growth
target of 25 percent for end-year.2 In the last quarter of 2011, euro area related turbulence and
uncertainties over the domestic policy framework led to a reversal of capital flows, forcing the CBRT
to tighten monetary policy considerably, increasing short-term market rates by 5 percentage points
and selling 15 percent of its FX reserves to defend the lira. Tighter monetary policy and credit
standards more than outweighed still-rapid public spending growth, seeding the deceleration in
consumption and investment, with annual credit growth declining from 35 percent in 2011H1 to
about 15 percent in early 2012.
7.
The improvement in the current account deficit is mainly the result of demand
compression.3 The 12-month rolling current account deficit has narrowed by 2 percentage points of
GDP after peaking at 10.2 percent of GDP in October 2011. Imports have played the main role, falling

The share of exports to MENA region rose to 31 percent in 2012H1 from 25 percent in 2011 while that of EU-27
declined to below 40 percent from 46 percent in 2011. Iran and Iraq became Turkey’s second and third export
destinations after Germany, although exports to Iran largely reflect exceptional gold exports.

by 2 percent year-on-year through July. Exports have remained buoyant, increasing by 14 percent
year-on-year, although non-gold exports grew more modestly by 5 percent.4 The financing structure
of the current account deficit has improved with the share of non-debt creating flows and long-term
borrowing increasing to 45 percent of CAD in 2012H1, compared to 38 percent last year, and net FDI
in line with last year. Finally, gross international reserves of the CBRT have risen to about $110 billion
(about 75 percent of short-term external debt on a remaining maturity basis), as banks are using FX
and gold to meet their lira reserve requirement obligations, but net reserves remain at around
$50 billion.5

Easing domestic demand pressures have helped reduce inflation, although it remains
high. After peaking at 11.1 percent in April, inflation was 9.2 percent in September. Food prices,
which represent just over a quarter of the CPI basket, have been benign, and the stable exchange
rate has helped durable goods inflation. Despite these gains, core inflation, although declining,

Overall, financial sector indicators remain robust and Turkish financial assets have
performed well. Turkish banks, including subsidiaries of European banks, have maintained adequate
capital buffers, with the CAR at 16.3 percent (above peer countries) even after moving to Basel II and
II.5 in July 2012. Banking sector leverage remains comfortable at around 8 percent (Basel III
definition) and external roll-over rates have been maintained above 100 percent despite global
financial tensions. Profitability, although declining, remains high (return on equity at 16 percent),
non-performing loans are at 2.8 percent of total assets, and provisioning remains comfortable at
80 percent. Capital inflows have helped lower the government benchmark yield to around
7.5 percent from 11.5 percent in early January, and contributed to the 30 percent increase in equity
prices since the beginning of the year. The country’s EMBIG spread is just above 200 basis points.
Finally, in June Turkey received a one notch credit upgrade from Moody’s to Ba1, just below
investment grade.6

More recently, monetary policy has been eased. The CBRT, which allowed the effective
interest rate7 to increase to around 8 percent on average during the first half of 2012, has eased it by
around 200 bps since July 2012, while cutting the overnight lending rate by 200 bps. Moreover,
allowing banks to hold their Lira reserve requirements in foreign currency and in gold8 has released
lira liquidity and lowered banks’ funding costs.
11.
The authorities announced the medium-term fiscal plan (MTP) for 2013–15. Under the
authorities’ assumptions (Box 1), they aim to increase the primary surplus by 0.3 percent of GDP in
2013. The draft 2013 budget is consistent with the MTP target and hence, results in a tightening of
the fiscal stance compared with 2012. However, the targeted primary surplus path to 2015 is lower
than that specified in last year’s MTP.

B. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
In staff’s baseline scenario, growth will be below potential in 2012, rising gradually as
domestic demand strengthens. High-frequency indicators, such as industrial production and credit,
point to continued growth in 2012Q3, although at a slower pace than in 2012Q2. The conditions for
a recovery in domestic demand appear to be in place, with record low unemployment, positive real
wage growth, healthy private sector balance sheets, and low interest rates. Barring new external
shocks, staff expects consumption to increase by an annualized 3¾ percent in the second half and
investment to remain firm, growing by 4½ percent, altogether leading to real growth of around
3 percent in 2012. In 2013, real GDP and domestic demand are expected to increase by 3½ percent,
with the contribution from net exports falling to zero as imports accelerate. In the medium term,

The effective interest rate is the weighted average interest rate at which the CBRT provides liquidity to the market
through its various open-market instruments on any given day.

8

The CBRT allows up to 60 percent of lira-denominated reserves to be held in FX and up to 30 percent in gold, with a
varying mark-up (Reserve Option Coefficient, ROC).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

Box 1. Medium-Term Program, 2013–15
9

The macroeconomic assumptions underlying the medium-term plan (MTP) are more optimistic than
staff’s, notably: (i) the economy is assumed to grow by 5 percent in 201415 versus 4–4¼ percent in
the staff’s scenario, possibly reflecting the effect of yet to be announced structural reforms; inflation is
projected to fall rapidly over 2013 and converge close to the central bank’s 5 percent target, whereas staff
expect a significant deviation from the target next year, although expected to remain within the band (iii) the
authorities see the current account deficit adjusting by some ¾ percentage point of GDP over the MTP
horizon despite an acceleration in domestic demand, whereas staff expect the deficit to widen gradually.
Taken individually, these gaps are within the margin of forecast error, but cumulatively the differences are
non-trivial.
The new MTP envisages a less ambitious path for the public sector primary surplus than its
predecessor. Relative to last year’s MTP, the 0.8 percentage points (ppts) of GDP deterioration in the central
government’s surplus in 2012 (from 1.0 to 0.2 percent of GDP) is largely explained by spending overruns.
This deterioration is fully carried over to the outer years despite higher revenues projected for 2013 and
beyond—mainly due to recently introduced tax policy measures—driven by continued pressures on current
spending, 1.3 ppts of GDP higher in the medium term relative to the previous MTP, despite assumptions of
a compression in personnel spending from 2014 onwards. To compensate for this, the authorities envisage
reducing capital spending in 2013 and beyond.
Staff project a less favorable medium-term fiscal outlook. While the authorities expect the central
government’s primary surplus to reach 0.7 percent of GDP by 2015, staff forecast a primary deficit of
0.1 percent of GDP. Discrepancies between staff’s projections and the new MTP are centered on the
spending side, with revenues relatively similar. In particular, staff assumes that current spending will not
decline as a share of GDP, and sees risks to the assumed compression in capital spending.

Turkey’s favorable population dynamics, robust private sector, and increasing economic openness
are supportive of GDP growth of close to 4¼ percent.
13.
The staff considers that the output gap was large and positive in 2011 (Box 2), but it is
projected to close following two years of below-potential growth. Together with weaker energy
prices and positive base effects after last year’s indirect tax hikes, this should bring inflation to
7.5 percent at end-2012 and 6.2 percent at end-2013, albeit still above the central bank’s target.
However, the current account deficit will continue to loom large: narrowing to 7½ percent of GDP
in 2012 due to domestic demand compression and decreasing oil prices, but then widening back
towards 8 percent in the medium term as growth again becomes domestic demand-led and the real
exchange rate appreciates due to still high inflation.
14.
Despite recent progress, the outlook is clouded by an uncertain external environment,
with developments in Europe and global financial markets representing the main downside
risk (Box 3). Turkey remains exposed to a sudden stop in capital inflows, as the 2011Q4 episode
showed. Although it has so far not encountered significant difficulties securing external financing,
Turkey’s annual gross external financing needs are projected to exceed 25 percent of GDP in the
years to come. The structure of bank liabilities has worsened with the loan-to-deposit ratio now at
about 100 percent and the share of external funding (largely short-term) in banks’ overall liabilities at
15 percent. The short FX position of the non-bank corporate sector has grown to $126 billion
(although only $9 billion is short-term). Thus, were global liquidity to dry up or risk appetite for
Turkey to turn sour, the economy would be forced into a sharp adjustment.
15.
The risks could be exacerbated if the authorities try to stimulate the economy by
relaxing macroeconomic policies at this time. If domestic demand were to accelerate significantly
more than projected under the staff’s base line scenario, the output gap would reopen thus reversing
disinflation and resulting again in a widening of the current account deficit. This, in turn, would
further raise the gross external financing needs, and increase the dangers posed by capital flow
reversal.
16.
The authorities have a more benign view of the cyclical position of the economy and
the outlook. They believe that the output gap was close to zero in 2011 and that the acceleration in
inflation and widening of the current account were driven mostly by one-off and exogenous factors.
Inflation deviated from target due to excise tax increases, adverse developments in unprocessed
food prices, and pass-through from the lira depreciation. The authorities point to moderate core and
services inflation as evidence of no underlying price pressures. In their view, the current account was
negatively impacted by the large deterioration in the terms of trade and a one-off adjustment to the
economy’s capital stock. Thus, they see the exchange rate as being close to equilibrium. Hence,
relative to staff, they view imbalances to be smaller, vulnerabilities to be lower, and buffers to be
larger, with the economy able to grow sustainably at close to 5 percent from 2013 onwards.

Box 3. Linkages Between Turkey and The Euro Area
Developments in the Euro area impact Turkish economy by affecting trade, FDI flows and availability of
funding for local banks, with the latter presenting the main risk in a sudden capital flow reversal.
According to BIS data, out of $218 billion of consolidated foreign claims (including equity ownership
parents) of reporting banks on Turkey, $164 billion came from the European banks, with the main creditors
being from the UK, Greece, Netherlands, Germany, and Spain. While about 18 percent of the banking sector
has ownership links to Euro area banks under stress,

11

direct parent funding is low. Hence, an abrupt

deleveraging of foreign parent banks presents less of a risk to their Turkish subsidiaries than via foreign
banks’ FX loans to Turkish banks and corporates. Also, as of January 2012, the BRSA applied amended
minimum capital requirements for banks with foreign strategic shareholders.
The impact on trade is direct (via dampened price and volume of Turkish exports) and indirect (via decline
in profits stemming from a weakening euro, in which a large share of exports is priced, against the US dollar,
in which inputs are priced). So far in 2012H1, Turkish exports have been resilient (registering 15 percent
increase), and profits do not show signs of weakening. Turkey’s proximity to MENA and Asia proves a natural
advantage in finding replacements for the European markets—especially for primary products such as
apparel, textiles, and food—while maintaining relatively low shipment costs. Prior to the 2008 crisis, more
than half of Turkish exports were destined for EU-27, with Germany leading the pack, but since then the
share has declined to below 40 percent in 2012H1, while the share of MENA countries increased from less
than 15 percent to 31 percent. Exports of gold, food, and building materials to Iran and Iraq have been
particularly strong. Nevertheless, two thirds of Turkish exports to the EU-27 are those with medium to high
technology components (motor vehicles, electrical equipment, and metals), which may prove harder to
diversify. Given this sizeable share of European markets in absorbing the relatively more sophisticated
Turkish exports, the impact can be non-trivial. In addition, Europe holds a dominant role in providing
tourism and services receipts.
The EU represents around 72 percent of FDI. In 2007–11, FDI from the EU countries averaged US$9 billion
per year, representing around 72 percent of total FDI flows to Turkey. Out of the FDI stock of
US$134.5 billion at end-2011, EU investors account for 78 percent with the top three sources being
Netherlands, Germany, and Austria (21 percent, 9 percent, and 8 percent respectively). FDI flows are in
general more stable than other forms of flows and their concentration in the non-tradable sector (25 percent
went into financial and insurance services, 21 percent into information and communication services, and
8 percent into wholesale and retail trade) serves as a stabilizing factor, since they rely more on Turkey’s own
fundamentals, such as growth potential and population dynamics, and thus, are less susceptible to external
developments.

11

This includes majority ownerships of Finansbank by the National Bank of Greece, TEB by BNP Paribas, non-majority
ownerships of foreign banks, such as Spanish BBVA in Garanti and Italian UniCredit in Yapi Kredi, as well as foreign
banks HSBC and ING. Denizbank, formerly of Franco-Belgian Dexia, has been sold to Russia’s Sberbank.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The Short-Term Challenge: Ensuring Prudent Policies
17.
There has been some improvement in macroeconomic policies along the lines
recommended in recent Article IV consultations. While in 2010–11, both monetary and fiscal
policies were loose, contributing to the overheating of the economy and deterioration in the current
account, the authorities tightened the stance starting in the middle of 2011 on. Initially,
macro-prudential measures, such as increases in risk weights and provisioning were implemented in
June 2011. Subsequently, the CBRT delivered much needed policy tightening in late 2011-early 2012,
although this was not implemented within a normalized monetary framework as recommended.
However, fiscal policy remained expansionary throughout 2012, but the authorities are aiming to
tighten the stance for 2013–1513 as there is a shared view on the need to reduce imbalances.
Fiscal Policy
18.
In staff’s view, the 2012 fiscal stance is pro-cyclical, when a neutral stance would have
been appropriate. Fiscal performance has weakened in 2012, due to overruns in primary
expenditures, the impact of lower growth on revenues, and fewer one-off proceeds from the tax
restructuring implemented last year. While primary expenditures slowed in the second half of 2011,
they reaccelerated in 2012, driven by wage increases granted in May that were above budget
provisions and a rapid increase in public employment, mainly because of the recent education
reform.14 These have brought into doubt the budget spending ceilings. Additionally, overruns in
health spending and higher than expected costs of the equalization schemes of public sector salaries
could weigh on final outcomes. Thus, staff’s current projections suggest that the authorities’ primary
surplus target of 1.1 percent of GDP could be missed by 1 percent of GDP, despite the introduction
in September of a revenue package based on increases in fuel, alcohol, and automobile excises,
worth 0.7 percent on an annual basis.
19.
Staff support the authorities’ fiscal objective for 2013 as it errs on the tighter side,
given that the output gap will be closed next year. In particular, the draft budget target of a 0.5
percent of GDP primary surplus is appropriate as it contributes to the continued reduction of
imbalances. However, staff recommended that the budget should aim to keep current spending
unchanged as a share of GDP rather than increasing taxes yet again. Moreover, there are risks to the
budget spending ceilings as they envision a significant compression in capital expenditure, which
may be difficult to achieve. With debt-to-GDP having returned to pre-2008 levels, should the
revenue outturns prove weaker than budgeted due to slower than expected growth, there would be
room to allow for the operation of the automatic stabilizers.

13

Based on staff’s baseline projections, the fiscal impulse in 2012, measured as the change in the structural primary
balance excluding one-off operations, is 0.5 percent of GDP.

14

Among other objectives, the recent education reform aims to have children start school at 5 years of age rather
than 6.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

20.
Staff underlined the importance of turning around the weakening trend in the primary
balance. Despite the strong recovery since 2009, the primary surplus has declined as primary spending
has continued to grow rapidly as share of GDP. In particular, the wage bill, pensions, and health
spending, all difficult to reverse, have grown above the economy’s potential and the pace of
improvements in tax administration. Given these trends, staff pointed out that at unchanged policies the
primary balance would be close to zero for much of the forecast period, bringing to an end a decade of
significant declines in the debt-to-GDP ratio, a cornerstone of Turkey’s success. Furthermore, the
growing share of current spending in the budget has increased its rigidity and could come at the
expense of much needed infrastructure investment. It also reduces the scope for fiscal policy to
contribute to a more balanced macroeconomic policy mix as adjustments in current spending are slow
to take place.
21.
The authorities agreed that there is a need to maintain a sound fiscal stance. However, they
believe fiscal policy in 2012 to be appropriate given the downside risks to growth, and argued that the
package of fiscal measures implemented in September would make up for the expansion in current
spending. The authorities concurred with staff that the 2013 budget should aim at controlling
expenditure growth, while recognizing that this could be challenging given the projected growth of
wages and pensions.
22.
In addition, the authorities believe the deterioration in the budget performance is
temporary and not structural. They argued that public debt has fallen to a comfortable level, allowing
for lower primary surpluses than in the past. While acknowledging the fast growth of current spending,
they pointed to the need to increase the provision of education and health services in order to raise the
economy’s potential. Moreover, their efforts to broaden the tax base, fight informality, and improve tax
administration will in their view increase revenues in the medium term. Finally, they agreed that a better
budgeting process would partly help contain spending overruns, such as through a more synchronized
public sector wage bargaining process.
Monetary Policy
23.
Staff underscored that despite recent declines, inflation remains high. The inflation outlook
has improved somewhat, but there are clear risks to bringing inflation within the target band15 by the
end of 2013. Inflation expectations remain elevated relative to the target, wage increases outpace
productivity gains, backward indexation of wages—notably in the public sector—leads to inflation
inertia, and volatile food prices pose risks. The monetary easing since July may have been premature
and, on balance, staff felt that the CBRT should be more forward-looking and cautious in light of the
impact that the resumption in domestic demand-led growth may have on inflation and wage formation.
24.
The CBRT’s unconventional monetary framework attempts to achieve both price and
financial stability in a difficult global environment. The mission is conscious that the CBRT faces a
challenging environment of volatile capital flows and low interest rates in advanced economies. In

15

TURKEY

response to these challenges, the central bank has, over time, introduced multiple new instruments
aiming at gaining additional degrees of freedom in setting domestic interest rates, achieving a less
volatile exchange rate, and safeguarding financial stability (Box 4). However, it is the ability to achieve
the inflation target and anchor expectations that ultimately determines the success of monetary
policy, and so far inflation has remained well above the target.
25.
Staff argued that the CBRT would better serve its objectives within the context of a
more standard inflation-targeting framework. Staff cautioned that while the new instruments may
each seem appealing, as a whole, they are blurring policy signals and may be weakening the
monetary transmission mechanism. With less traction, larger policy adjustments are needed to guide
lending rates. Staff pointed to this year’s slow and limited reaction of lending interest rates despite
significant declines in the CBRT’s effective rate since July and the cut in the overnight lending rate by
200 basis points. In addition, inflation expectations, which previously reacted to developments in
inflation and the changes to the CBRT’s target, have been broadly unchanged since October 2010,
suggesting that the capacity to influence expectations has been weakened. Thus, staff recommended
a normalization of the framework by returning to the use of the one-week repo rate as the main tool
to manage the monetary stance. Given current inflation trends, this rate should be increased to
positive levels in real terms. Should this stimulate capital inflows, staff advocated sterilized
interventions for rebuilding net reserves, low by international standards, complemented by a more
pro-active use of macro-prudential measures.
26.
Staff encouraged the CBRT to strengthen its communication policy. The complicated
framework, with its multiple tools and objectives—even though openly stated in the inflation
reports—blurs the policy signaling, often giving the impression that other objectives take priority
over inflation. The plethora of tools has proven challenging for market participants to understand.
Clearer communication could help avoid the impression that objectives and tools are at times in
conflict, and thus reduce costly uncertainty; in turn, this could help repair the monetary transmission
channels.
27.
The CBRT believes that its framework has been successful in dealing with multiple
objectives. In their view, a standard inflation targeting framework cannot ensure financial stability in
a world of volatile capital flows. They point to the declining inflation and current account deficit as
proof that, by driving a wedge between domestic interest rates and the rates faced by speculative
money, the framework can deliver lower inflation, more sustainable credit growth, and a less volatile
exchange rate. The central bank agreed that there are upside risks to inflation, but argued that it has
the capacity to adjust policy, seeing no evidence of a weakened transmission mechanism. The central
bank concurred with staff that macro-prudential policies may be best suited to deal with some of the
financial stability issues, but that in Turkey’s case the CBRT is well positioned to deal with the
financial risks. Finally, they agreed with staff that their framework of multiple instruments requires
very careful communication, but felt they have made significant progress in this regard.

Box 4. The Conduct of Monetary Policy in Turkey16
Since late 2010, the CBRT has been implementing monetary policy in a manner referred to as
unconventional, in response to a challenging external environment dominated by volatile capital
flows. Instead of relying on one interest rate like inflation-targeting central banks generally do, the CBRT
has resorted to utilizing a wide variety of instruments—such as reserve requirement (RR) ratios and a mix of
various repo facilities—rather infrequently used by “traditional” central banks. In late 2010, the CBRT’s view
was that the exchange rate was overvalued, and the framework was supposed to bring about a correction
via nominal depreciation while improving the structure of external financing by substituting debt with equity
and short-term flows with long-term ones.
The new framework has, in fact, been implemented in two different ways. First, the CBRT changed the
required reserve (RR) ratios, differentiating them by currency and maturity; purchased FX via regular daily
auctions, changing the amounts in line with the perceived strength of capital inflows; and generated a lot of
volatility in the interbank rates by varying the amount of liquidity it was providing to the market via quantity
repo auctions. Altogether these operations led to a significant increase in liquidity, sharp nominal
depreciation, and a surge in inflation. In late 2011-early 2012 the CBRT stopped changing the RR ratios,
stopped intervening in the FX market, and started to vary daily the cost of liquidity it provides to the markets
by changing the extent of using its price and quantity repo facilities. Since March it has allowed banks to
hold their RR on lira-denominated liabilities in FX and gold, however, applying increasing penalties.
While it is difficult to assess empirically the success of this framework given the rather short time-span
of its implementation, the following observations help form a view:



It emerges that until the inception of the new framework, inflationary expectations were well
approximated by an average of the inflation target and the latest inflation observation. Under the new
framework, one-year ahead expectations have remained broadly flat at around 7 percent, suggesting
that the link has been broken and survey participants simply report the numbers around the top of the
target band.



It also emerges that the new framework introduced a non-trivial spread between the cost of the
CBRT-provided liquidity and the interbank rates. This spread seems to be affected by markets’
perceptions of the strength of capital inflows.



Market participants perceive the monetary policy as leaning towards stimulating growth, as long as
the nominal exchange rate is not under pressure.



The role the framework played in reducing external imbalances is still unclear. As nominal
depreciation fed into inflation, attempts to turn things around led to a significant loss of reserves in
the end of 2011. The 12-month current account deficit and its financing structure continued to
deteriorate until early 2012. Whether the subsequent improvement is due to the way the monetary
policy is conducted or a result of a slowdown in domestic demand—brought about by a range of factors
including interest rate tightening per se—remains to be seen.

While headline inflation has started to decrease, the core measures and inflationary expectations remain
above the target and the CBRT’s net reserves are low. Were the risk appetite for Turkey to reverse, the
ability of monetary policy to jump-start the economy or to defend the exchange rate will be constrained.

Financial Sector Policies
28.
Staff noted the progress in implementing the 2011 FSAP update recommendations. The
mission found that the BRSA has advanced in closing some of the supervisory and regulatory gaps,
has expanded the coverage of consolidated supervision for banking groups, and has tightened the
rules on asset classification and provisioning requirements. By successfully introducing Basel II in
July 2012, some of the FSAP update recommendations in areas such as capital adequacy, risk
management processes, and different types of bank risks were addressed as well. Based on results of
the Basel Quantitative Impact Studies (QIS), banks seem well positioned for the introduction of Basel
III by 2015, and thus, an accelerated time table could be considered. Staff underscored the
instrumental role of the Financial Stability Committee (FSC) in coordinating the work of the involved
institutions, as financial stability challenges and concerns will continue emerging.
29.
Staff recommended expanding the macro-prudential tool-kit and applying it more
proactively (Box 5). The authorities’ prudent dividend payout rules have been very constructive in
buttressing banks’ balance sheets, but further efforts may be required to conserve existing capital
buffers in times of rapid credit growth. Moreover, there is room to develop measures, within a
well-articulated framework, to manage key risks. In particular, staff suggested the following macro
and micro-prudential measures: (i) formalizing a consumer debt-to-income limit (DTI), already
applied by banks for their internal risk management and credit scoring; (ii) phasing in Basel III
liquidity ratios to help address the banks’ structural maturity and currency mismatches; and
(iii) applying targeted increases in FX required reserves at shorter maturities to slow down banks’
short-term external borrowing. The BRSA draft regulation on credit risk management should be
finalized, as it could improve banks’ risk management and help supervisory examination of banks’ FX
lending practices. This in turn would allow tighter conditions on FX borrowing for non-FX earning
corporates.
30.
The authorities highlighted the strength of the financial system and regulatory
framework, but concurred that continued vigilance is needed to maintain financial stability.
They consider that the financial performance of the banking system has remained very strong, with
sufficient buffers and no difficulty in accessing external funding. They believe that the banking
system is in a good position to transition to Basel III sooner than 2015. The BRSA plans to finish
drafts of the Basel III regulation by end-2012, and with over 90 percent of regulatory capital
constituting core tier 1 capital, it believes a long phase-in period won’t be needed. Moreover, the
authorities are of the view that they have already implemented a number of important
macro-prudential measures such as loan-to-value limits, minimum payment levels for credit cards, as
well as increases in risk weights and provisioning for consumer loans, the latter resulting in a
significant decline in credit growth. Thus, they think it would be premature to consider new measures
at the current juncture, but see room to examine possible new macro-prudential tools should
particular areas in the banking system become a policy concern in the future.

Box 5. Macro-Prudential Policies in Turkey17
Turkey faces the typical emerging market challenge of maintaining financial stability while dealing
with capital flows and the economic cycle. The 2007/8 crisis underscored the need for countries to
develop a strong MPP framework as well as enhanced prudential regulation and supervision. Also, in Turkey,
macro-prudential measures (MPP) could help relieve some pressures from the central bank in dealing with
financial stability issues.
At the outset of the 2008–09 crises, the authorities implemented a number of MPP measures to
safeguard the domestic financial sector. These measures were successful in mitigating the impact of the
downturn in the banking sector. Additional steps were taken, albeit belated, in the summer of 2011 to deal
with the credit boom: increased risk weights and provisioning requirements on consumer loans contributed
to the significant slowdown in credit growth.
Turkey made progress on the organizational aspects of its MPP framework. The Financial Stability
Committee (FSC) was created in June 2011 to improve coordinating of all the agencies involved in
safeguarding financial stability while maintaining operational autonomy of the participating agencies. The
2011 FSAP Update also recommended an increased emphasis on communication, an enhanced interagency
coordination, as well as a leading role of the CBRT on the macroprudential committee to harness the central
bank’s expertise in risk assessment.
The macro-prudential tool kit could be expanded, but sequencing and calibration of new measures will
be important. New measures could be considered in the following areas:


Prevent household overleveraging. Household debt, although lower than in many peer countries, has
increased to around 50 percent of disposable income during the recent boom phase. Setting a
consumer debt-to-income limit (DTI) across the banking system could help maintain household
balances’ resilience. Banks already apply such DTI requirements for their internal risk management and
credit scoring.



Contain short-term FX borrowing by banks. Turkish banks, partly due to improved external sentiment
and limited local funding (loan-to-deposit ratio at 103 percent), make extensive use of this source of
funding. Introducing a minimum FX liquidity ratio at the 3-month and longer horizons and phasing in
Basel III liquidity ratios could help address banks’ structural maturity and currency mismatch. As in the
existing liquidity regulation framework in Turkey, the Basel III liquidity rules could be differentiated by
currencies. Finally, the application of FX RR increases at shorter maturities could also be considered to
slow down banks’ short-term external borrowing.



Limit nonfinancial corporate FX exposure. FX corporate loans comprise 26 percent of banks’ total
loan portfolio and 40 percent of corporate loans. The BRSA draft regulation on credit risk management
should be finalized to improve banks’ risk management and help supervisory examination of banks’ FX
lending practices. But there is scant information on corporate FX hedging, and filling this data gap
would be important. It would be also possible to tighten the conditions by which non-FX earning
corporates could borrow FX in Turkey. Also, higher risk weights and provisioning on unhedged FX
lending to corporates could be introduced if growth in this lending segment would become excessive.
Data availability would be an important prior condition for such a measure.

31.
The mission and authorities agreed on the importance of addressing the AML/CFT
deficiencies identified by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Since June 2011, Turkey has
been included on a list of jurisdictions with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies that have not made
sufficient progress in addressing them. Moreover, on October 19 the FATF decided to suspend
Turkey’s membership by February 2013, unless the country adopts legislation to address identified
AML/CFT deficiencies by then. This development could lead to heightened due diligence from
foreign financial institutions regarding transactions with Turkey. The authorities have submitted draft
legislation to parliament which has not been enacted yet, but which they expect to meet the
standards necessary to deal with the identified deficiencies.
Overall Short-Term Policy Mix
32.
Staff argued that policies need to become tighter. Given the external vulnerabilities, high
inflation, and buffers smaller than at the start of the 2008 crisis, policies should remain geared
towards reducing imbalances. Thus, staff believes that fast growing public spending together with
the monetary easing could have been premature. The tightening of the fiscal stance proposed in the
draft 2013 budget is therefore appropriate, as further policy loosening to achieve higher growth
rates could end disinflation and leave Turkey with a high and growing current account deficit.
Accordingly, a period of below potential growth is needed. Staff also suggested that there is much
to be gained through better coordination to assure a more balanced overall stance.
33.
The authorities agreed that additional reductions in imbalances should be the priority.
However, given their assessment of the policy stance, which differs from that of staff in some key
areas, they believe that achieving disinflation and a further reduction in the current account deficit
does not require growth below 4 percent, as they see potential growth closer to 5 percent.
Moreover, they point to the slowdown in domestic demand as an indication that the overall policy
mix was sufficiently tight and consistent with their objective of reducing vulnerabilities. However, the
authorities agreed with staff that, should the unwinding of imbalances start to reverse, some policy
tightening would be required, noting that it would be more appropriate to be done via monetary
policy.
Medium-Term Challenge: Rebalancing the Policy Framework and Reducing Dependence on
External Funding
34.
Staff pointed out that, due to its low savings, Turkey remains prone to boom-bust
cycles driven by capital flows. The national saving rate has fallen dramatically over the last fifteen
years, reflecting in part improved macroeconomic conditions that reduced the need for
precautionary savings, and a cleaned-up banking system able to rapidly expand credit (Box 6).
However, the savings rate of around 15 percent of GDP is too low, leaving the country highly
dependent on volatile foreign capital and resulting in boom-bust cycles in investment and output. In
addition, full realization of the potential offered by the country’s young population and strategic
location requires higher investment rates than at present, which could not be sustained given
current savings levels.
35.
Staff argued that fiscal policy had a role to play in raising national savings and
mitigating the economy’s excessive cyclical swings. The decline in national savings over the
20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

recent decade happened despite increases in public savings. However, this need not reflect
Ricardian equivalence, and indeed, estimates find only a partial Ricardian offset.18 Moreover, since
there is no single item that could increase private sector savings quickly and significantly, the public
sector would have to lead the way. Increasing the primary balance to its pre-crisis levels (around 2
percent of GDP) could have two important effects. First, it would help boost national savings,
perhaps by 1 percentage point of GDP. Second, it would relieve pressure on monetary policy,
allowing for a more depreciated real exchange (REER overvaluation—see Box 7—has been an
important factor in the savings decline).
36.
Staff recommended that the fiscal medium-term plan should anchor the broad
guidelines of the adjustment in public savings. The new 2013–15 Medium-Term Program should
have targeted a sizable increase in the structural primary surplus, although the adjustment path
could be back-loaded. To achieve this, the mission recommended a structure of adjustment that
could have helped reduce the budget rigidities. Specifically, staff advocated containing real primary
spending growth below the potential growth rate of 4 percent in the next three years and changing
the public pension system; in particular, by increasing contribution rates without raising benefits
commensurately. Also, public spending on health programs, which has grown significantly in recent
years, could be reexamined; and the tax base should be broadened by eliminating tax exemptions
and improving tax administration.
37.
Staff commended the authorities for their efforts to boost private savings. The mission
welcomed the authorities’ recent reform of private pensions, which replaced previous tax incentives
with direct government contributions. The new system has wider coverage, including people who
are not on formal payrolls, and tilts incentives towards poorer contributors. The reform should help
boost private pension contributions, which have much room to grow.
38.
Staff also argued that boosting competitiveness more broadly would support
domestic savings and rebalancing. The recently introduced Commercial Code helps improve
corporate governance and encourages FDI. The recent package of investment incentives could, if
properly administered, help stimulate investment in advanced technology sectors and lower the
import content of production. Yet, staff pointed out that past experience with similar schemes,
depending on tax exemptions, showed mixed results. Thus, expectations should be modest and
higher priority should be given to maintaining broad VAT and income tax bases. Staff also asserted
that reforms should advance in other key areas:


Efforts to address the large informal sector, which have had some success in recent years, need to
be sustained.19 There is much evidence that firms in the informal sector are more liquidity constrained,
invest less, are less profitable, and grow more slowly. Informal workers also save less than their
counterparts in the formal sector.

18

See Selected Issues Paper “Boosting Savings in Turkey.”
The informal sector in Turkey is quite large—according to the World Bank, more than 40 percent of the labor force
works in the informal sector.
19



The labor market needs to become more competitive via greater use of part-time and temporary labor,
reform of the severance pay system, and slowing the growth of the high minimum wage, while ensuring an
adequate safety net. Turkey needs to continue improving the quality of its workforce by bolstering the
education system and training programs. Lastly, measures should be targeted at boosting the female
participation rate, which at about 30 percent remains well below that of most middle-income countries.



Regulatory constraints in some product and service markets are obstacles in what is otherwise a
generally vibrant domestic market. Tax policy and administration are complicated and costly for business,
routinely cited in surveys as key weaknesses in Turkey’s business climate.



Despite impressive efforts to improve infrastructure and reduce energy dependence, more is
needed. Efforts to relieve transport sector bottlenecks, important to reducing costs in the economy, are
underway. Steps to raise domestic energy production are welcome, but should be paired with further
efforts to improve efficiency in energy production and distribution, notably by continued involvement of
the private sector.

39.
The authorities concurred with the need to increase national savings as the key
medium-term goal. They pointed to the steps taken earlier in the year, such as the private pension
reform, as likely to deliver significant gains in savings. Moreover, they agreed that public policies
have a role to play in boosting savings, but mainly by improving the targeting of some social
programs to reduce disincentives to private sector savings. Finally, they outlined policies in the
medium-term fiscal plan that would promote higher savings, but felt that a primary surplus of 1
percent on average over the cycle was adequate given the low and still declining debt. In addition
they argued that returning the primary surplus to the pre-crises level would be difficult to achieve
given current spending needs.
40.
The authorities believe that they are undertaking substantial efforts to promote
competitiveness. They highlighted the importance of the new package of investment incentives,
which, by promoting investment in high technology and lowering labor costs, should boost export
potential as well as increase local content, reducing the import dependence of domestic production.
Through their significant efforts in improving tax administration—and in time, changes to tax
policy—they expect further reductions in informality, which hampers the competitiveness of the
formal sector by keeping labor taxes high. Finally, they believe that their education reform will
increase educational attainment over the medium term, and produce a better alignment of
educational training with the needs of the economy.

Box 6. Raising Savings In Turkey
Turkey’s national saving rate has fallen dramatically over the last 15 years, from some 25 percent of
GDP in the late 1990s to less than 15 percent of GDP now. This decline has been larger than in any G-20
country over this period and stands in stark contrast to the experience in peer emerging economies, even if
some of these have enjoyed better terms of trade than Turkey. On the positive side, the national savings rate
has increased over the last two years, but these modest gains have yet to fully make up for the loss in
savings in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.

as well as to the rapid expansion in credit via a cleaned-up banking sector. Other factors, such as
demographics and appreciation of the real exchange rate, also seem to have played a role. As for the
striking public-private offset, it stemmed from a combination of partial Ricardian equivalence (with estimates
of the Ricardian offset in the 0.4–0.8 range) and exogenous factors that affected public and private savings
simultaneously but in opposite directions, such as the global recovery and normalization of financial
conditions post-2008.
National savings are too low, and this has been a key reason behind Turkey’s boom-and-bust cycles.
At some 15 percent of GDP for much of the last decade, the national saving rate has been well below the
investment rate, leaving the economy highly dependent on volatile foreign savings to fill the gap.

High inflation complicates the disaggregation of total savings between public and private savings before 2003.

impossible to sustain at current savings rates.
Increasing savings is thus a key objective. The government has recently replaced tax incentives for private
pensions with direct government contributions, widening the coverage of the system to the many who are
not on payroll, and making it more progressive. The vesting period in the system was also lengthened. These
changes go in the right direction and are in line with World Bank recommendations; with private pension
assets accounting for only 1½ percent of GDP at present, the gains could be non-trivial. Still, the savings gap
is too wide to be bridged through these measures alone, hence other avenues should be considered:







Raising the structural primary fiscal balance back to pre-crisis levels: given only partial Ricardian
equivalence, fiscal policy can play a role in raising national savings. Tighter fiscal policy would also
relieve pressure from the central bank and allow, ceteris paribus, for a more depreciated real exchange
rate.
Increasing mandatory savings through the pay-as-you-go pension system: this could be achieved by
increasing current contribution rates with no increase in benefits. The difficulty of such a reform is
political, given that the last decade has already seen major changes to the pension system.
Tackling informality: efforts to address the large informal sector, which accounts for about 40 percent of
the labor force, need to be sustained. There is much evidence that informal workers save less than their
counterparts in the formal labor market, after controlling for other variables.

Still, difficulties in raising national savings should not be underestimated. The fact that the national
saving rate has been relatively stable over the last ten years despite large underlying changes in public and
private savings should caution about the difficulty of the task at hand.

21

Strong consumption (including of durables) contributed to the large deterioration in private savings over the last three years, and
in this sense it contributed to the widening of the current account deficit. However, higher public savings compensated for the
decline in private savings over this period, so viewed from an S-I perspective the rise in investment fully explains the deterioration in
the current account.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

Box 7. Turkey’s External Competitiveness
Turkey still faces a competitiveness gap despite the ongoing reduction of the current account deficit.
Rising unit labor costs and inflation differentials with trading partners in 2012 have erased almost half of
Turkey’s gain in external competitiveness derived from the large nominal depreciation in 2010–11.
Real effective exchange rates, based on consumer and producer prices, rose by around 10 percent in 2012
on the back of inflation differentials, clawing back almost half of the real depreciation accumulated between
October 2010 and August 2011. Rising by a similar amount but starting from a higher base, the ULC-based
REER remains elevated as real wages increased, labor productivity growth weakened with the increasing
participation of low-skilled labor force, and unit labor costs grew with inflation. As a result, some REER
indicators are now comparable to the levels prevailing during the crisis, and higher than the levels of the
early-2000s.
The US dollar-euro exchange rate is also an important determinant of the competitiveness of Turkey’s
exports, especially in view of the high import content—and hence relatively low domestic valued added—of
Turkish production. Many raw materials and intermediate inputs are priced in US dollars or currencies that
move closely with the US dollar, while many of Turkey’s final products are sold in Europe and priced in euros.
Thus, a continued depreciation of euro would further strain the bottom line of exporting industries and the
overall current account adjustment process.
Export diversification to the MENA region has allowed Turkish exports to grow despite weak demand in
the EU, its main traditional trading partner. Exports to MENA countries following the crisis have increased by
around 10 percentage points to 31 percent of total exports in 2012H1, compensating for the loss of market
share to the EU. Moreover, in recent months non-monetary gold exports to Iran have picked up significantly.
However, penetration by Turkish exporters of emerging and fuel exporters’ markets has declined since the
onset of the global crisis, reversing in part the significant market-share gains of earlier years, suggesting that
competitiveness remains an issue to be addressed.
The EBA assessments show the current account deficit is 2–4 percentage points of GDP larger than the
level that can be explained by fundamentals and desired policy settings, and that the real exchange rate is
10–20 percent higher. This is a similar assessment to the one contained in the 2011 Article IV Consulation
Staff Report. It should be noted that these current account assessments rely in part on end-2011 data: since
then, the current account has adjusted significantly, leading staff to project a fall in the deficit of some
2½ percentage points of GDP in 2012. However, even if some of this adjustment is structural, the residual
current account deficit continues to point to a siginificant competitiveness gap.
In the context of still large capital inflows, however, standard REER assessments may overstate the extent
of overvaluation. There is little evidence that industry’s share in GDP is falling (a good proxy for the tradable
sector) and investment in industry has grown strongly in the past 5 years (something that is difficult to
square with a very uncompetitive exchange rate). Moreover, the recent surge of capital inflows to Turkey has
not only financed the current account deficit in an accounting sense but may have also caused it in a
behavioral sense, at least partially: by relaxing consumers’ budget constraints to facilitate import demand.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

TURKEY

Box 7. Turkey’s External Competitiveness (Continued)
When the inflows abate, as they are beginning to, both the near- and medium-term current account
projections would improve which, in turn, would imply smaller misalignment. This is consistent with the
notion of “capital account dominance” in Emerging Markets. Alternatively, if the flows—though mostly of a
short-term duration—turn out to be more persistent, then the equilibrium exchange rate itself would
appreciate accordingly reflecting the changed fundamentals, and hence leading to a smaller estimated
misalignment, other things being equal.22
It is essential for Turkey to close the competitiveness gap so as to attract more FDI flows into the
tradable sector. That would help to get more closely integrated into the global supply chain and move up
the value-added ladder. However, at around 2.0 percent of GDP, FDI inflows are still below the G–20 EM
average of around 2.5 percent of GDP, with flows tilted toward non-tradable sectors such as banking and
real estate. The government has recently launched an investment incentive scheme aimed at tackling the
current account deficit by lowering the import content of production. However, significant barriers remain
in the efficiency of the labor market and the general business environment.

It is very difficult, if not impossible, to tell in practice whether a surge in inflows is temporary or portends a persistent trend. A rule
of thumb, offered by Ostry et al. (2010), is that flows that push the real exchange rate toward equilibrium are more likely to be
persistent than flows that contribute to overshooting since flows would presumably be subject to reversal in the future as
overshooting eventually unwinds. This suggests that current inflows into Turkey are more likely to be temporary.

STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
After two years of rapid growth, the economy has slowed significantly, unwinding
imbalances. The tighter macroeconomic policies have started to deliver disinflation and a reduction
in the current account deficit, while maintaining a more measured pace of growth. The conditions
for continued growth this year are in place. Beyond 2012 the economy is in a good position to
return to its long-term growth rate of around 4 percent.
42.
The Turkish financial system remains sound. Banks’ profitability is high by international
standards, while leverage and the level of non-performing loans are low. Introduction of Basel II and
II.5 standards has resulted in only marginal reductions in the system’s still-high capital adequacy
ratio. Tighter macro-prudential measures have eased concerns over excessive credit growth, and the
rising dependence of the system on external financing observed over the last few years appears to
be leveling off.
43.
However, Turkey continues to face considerable risks given the large current account
deficit and uncertain external environment. Priority should be given to fully achieving the orderly
rebalancing of the economy. Macroeconomic policies helped engineer the soft landing of the
economy, but the authorities must stand ready to adjust their stance if the trends in disinflation and
the external deficit reduction start to unwind. In the absence of further efforts, annual gross external
financing needs will remain high and the unstable global financial environment will remain a major
risk, with a possible reversal in capital flows forcing the economy into a sharp adjustment.
44.
Staff support the authorities’ fiscal objective for 2013 as it errs on the tighter side.
The 2012 budget deficit target will be missed, mainly as a result of primary expenditure overruns,
leading to a pro-cyclical fiscal stance at a time when a neutral stance would have been more
appropriate. The 2013 budget should aim to ensure current expenditure does not grow as share of
GDP rather than rely on tax measures to meet the target.
45.
The medium-term fiscal plan for 2013–15 is a step in the right direction, but a more
ambitious effort is needed to set the basis for increasing budget flexibility and resilience to
the cycle. Turkey’s budget has structural weaknesses: excessive dependence of revenues on
buoyant domestic demand and increasingly rigid expenditures. The public sector wage bill and
pensions have grown faster than the economy’s potential and the pace of improvements in tax
administration. This could come at the expense of much needed infrastructure investment and
reduces the scope for fiscal policy to help establish a more balanced macroeconomic policy mix and
respond to shocks. In addition to ongoing efforts to broaden the tax base and improve tax
administration, reforms on the spending side—significantly restraining growth in real current
expenditure—are needed as well. The authorities’ broad guidelines for the MTP would need to be
fleshed out with concrete expenditure proposals and it would be important that more effort be
placed in reducing current spending than envisaged now.
46.
The monetary policy stance needs to be tighter given upside risks to inflation, and the
impact that the resumption in domestic demand-led growth may have on inflation expectations and
wage formation. Turkey’s growth outlook, still-high inflation, and a history of deviations from the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

TURKEY

target call for a positive real policy interest rate. Were capital inflows to accelerate, the CBRT should
rebuild net reserves for precautionary reasons through sterilized interventions.
47.
The merits of the CBRT’s policy framework have not been fully established. The new
framework, relying on a battery of novel instruments to gain degrees of freedom in segmenting
domestic and international interest rates, has not yet proved its superiority. A return to a more
conventional framework is warranted, and even more so should the inflation target remain elusive or
inflation expectations stay high. In the meantime, the CBRT should strengthen its communications,
which have at times been confusing to market participants.
48.
In the medium term, it is essential to improve the macroeconomic policy mix. Tighter
fiscal policy would relieve pressure on monetary policy to achieve its inflation target and deliver an
environment less prone to real exchange rate appreciation. This would help deal with Turkey’s
competitiveness challenges and support efforts to reorient the economy from import dependence
toward export growth. Moreover, it would allow for lower nominal interest rates, reducing exposure
to volatile and destabilizing short-term capital inflows.
49.
There has been progress in financial sector supervision and regulation, and there is
scope to expand the macro-prudential tool kit. Some of the gaps in the regulatory and
supervisory framework have been closed; and banks seem well positioned for the introduction of
Basel III by 2015. Despite this, the macro-prudential tool kit needs to be used in a more targeted
and active manner to ensure financial stability. There is room to expand the macro-prudential
measures, within a well articulated framework, to manage key risks.
50.
Turkey needs to address its low domestic savings which make it heavily dependent on
capital inflows. High investment needs and the current low level of savings leave the Turkish
economy exposed to volatile capital inflows. The authorities have correctly identified increasing
savings as the key medium-term priority and have recently undertaken several reforms in this area.
However, further efforts by the public sector are needed. In particular, the authorities should aim to
deliver a sizeable increase in the primary surplus, which would boost national savings. The
forthcoming medium-term fiscal plan, based on prudent macroeconomic assumptions, should
anchor the broad guidelines of the adjustment, complementing policies to improve the structure of
the budget.
51.
Boosting competitiveness requires a broad, multi-pronged approach. The new
Commercial Code should improve corporate governance and encourage FDI. The package of
investment incentives could stimulate investment in advanced technology sectors and lower the
import content of production; however, such schemes tend to deliver mixed results and only in the
long run. Thus, additional efforts should be considered to improve the functioning of the labor
market, reduce informality, increase labor market participation, eliminate red-tape in product and
service markets, and improve the capacity and efficiency of the domestic energy sector.
52.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation with Turkey be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Public Debt
Under staff’s baseline scenario public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to continue declining,
although marginally. The nonfinancial public sector primary surplus is expected to deteriorate
to 0.1 percent of GDP in 2012 and be broadly balanced in the outer years. As a result, both the
general government debt (EU definition) and nonfinancial public sector net debt ratio fall slightly
over the projection period to 35 and 30 percent of GDP respectively (Table A1).
However, public sector sustainability could deteriorate under alternative scenarios in the
absence of fiscal consolidation. Different policy path or growth scenarios would significantly
affect debt outcomes (Figure A1). In particular, medium term public debt dynamics are highly
sensitive to different growth scenarios. If medium-term growth rates are persistently lower than
anticipated, stabilizing the debt ratio would require further fiscal consolidation. Assuming
expenditure plans remain unchanged, the debt-to-GDP ratio could reach 45 percent of GDP
by 2017 should growth be 2.2 percentage points (½ a standard deviation) lower each year than
in the baseline scenario. To a lesser extent, public debt ratios remain sensitive to large and
permanent exchange rate, contingency liabilities, and interest rate shocks despite the increasing
share of debt denominated in domestic currency and fixed interest rate. Under a one-off
30 percent real depreciation of the exchange rate, the public debt ratio would increase by about
7 percentage points above the baseline projections. Similarly, a contingent liability shock of
10 percent of GDP would increase public debt by a similar amount over the medium-term.

External Debt
Under the baseline, gross external debt, while sustainable, is increasing and vulnerable to a
large exchange rate shock (Table A2). External debt is expected to rise to 48 percent of GDP
by 2017 on account of still large current account deficit, slower GDP growth than prior to the
crisis, and an increase in debt-creating inflows. In 2011, the significant drawdown of assets held
abroad and the high growth helped keep external debt in check despite the double digit current
account deficit. Going forward, the buffer will be much smaller and external debt as a percent of
GDP could be much higher, were it not for favorable GDP deflators. The external debt is robust to
the standardized growth and current account shocks (one-half standard deviation) and a
customized interest rate shock to the level seen in 2008. External debt will remain below
60 percent of GDP under individual shocks or a combination of the three standardized shocks.
However, an additional real depreciation of 30 percent in 2012 would cause gross external debt
to rise to over 70 percent of GDP (Figure A2). Nevertheless, a real exchange rate shock of this size
would likely further precipitate adjustment in the current account and other second-round
effects that would mitigate the impact on external debt, but which are not captured in a static
debt sustainability exercise.

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

The more prominent risk to external debt sustainability in both the near and the medium
term, however, is liquidity and roll-over risk. Annual gross external financing needs, after a
small drop in 2012, are forecast to revert back to above 25 percent and remain elevated in the
medium term. The still-high current account deficit and the heavy reliance of short term
borrowing in its financing are the main factors behind the persistently large external financing
need. Were the global risk appetite to reverse, Turkey would be subject again to financing
difficulties as seen in end-2011 and early 2012, which were only relived following the ECB’s LTRO
operation. Given the relatively low FX reserve coverage by international standards, Turkey’s debt
sustainability remains susceptible to international investors’ shifting risk appetite as the latter
could trigger a simultaneous rise in both borrowing cost and exchange rate pressure.
Turkey’s decreasing exposure to the Fund and moderate external debt levels should ensure
adequate capacity to repay the Fund. Under the baseline scenario, the exposure to Turkey
would decline from SDR 1.9 billion at end-2011 to only SDR 0.6 billion at end-2012 (39 percent
of Turkey’s quota, 0.1 percent of GDP, or 1 percent of reserves). The outstanding exposure will be
all repurchased by 2013Q2.

2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms, g = real
GNP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period. Differs slightly from external financing requirement in Staff Report
because includes official transfers and IMF repurchases but excludes increase in portfolio and other investment assets.
6/ The key variables include real GNP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GNP.
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their
levels of the last projection year.

TURKEY

WORLD BANK RELATIONS
1.
Turkey and the World Bank Group have a strong partnership, which continuously
deepened over the last twelve years. Country Partnership Strategies (CPSs) form the basis of the
partnership between Turkey and the World Bank. In the implementation of the CPS for FY08-11, IBRD
provided financing of US$7.6 billion, IFC financing was US$ 2.0 billion, and MIGA’s gross exposure grew
by 42 percent. The new Country Partnership Strategy FY12-15 envisages financing levels of up to US$
4.45 billion; the increased provision of analytical and advisory services as well as new services and
instruments – including fee-based services. The CPS has three main strategic objectives and pillars: (i)
enhanced competitiveness and employment; (ii) improved equity and public services; and, (iii) deepened
sustainable development. Turkey’s development success and a number of its economic and social
reforms have attracted international interest and recognition. Together, Turkey and the World Bank are
exploring avenues to collaborate in sharing Turkey’s experiences abroad.
2.
Turkey is IBRD’s third largest borrower in terms of debt outstanding. The active portfolio of
investment projects with World Bank financing includes 14 projects with total net commitments of
US$5.566 billion (as of March 2012). The investment portfolio supports financial and private sector
development (38 percent), urban development (23 percent), the energy sector (33 percent), transport (3
percent) and health and education (3 percent).
3.
IFC’s own-account investment program in Turkey is expected to remain in the range of
USD425-500 million/year, or USD 1.7-2.0 billion for the CPS FY12-15 period. Although IFC’s
investment volume is not expected to increase, its strategy is flexible and constituent with the WBG’s
approach to MIC’s. IFC aims to adjust its areas of intervention, products and instruments to the country’s
needs. IFC expects to target under-served sectors of the economy, providing financing in areas including
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises; energy efficiency and renewable energy; municipalities; and,
poorer regions in the country. IFC intends to continue promoting South-South investments and
supporting Turkish companies to invest in the region and further abroad.
4.
The World Bank Group is engaged in Turkey with its full range of financing as well as
analytic, knowledge, and advisory services. Recent analytic, knowledge, and advisory activities have
included assessments of the economic and social impact of the crisis and policies and programs to
mitigate it and promote growth recovery, Country Economic Memorandum on savings and sustainable
growth, a roadmap for the development of a corporate bond market, a Transport Public Expenditure
Review, studies on female labor force participation, the inequality of opportunities, the quality of
education, early childhood development, an investment climate assessment, and technical assistance on
food safety, sustainable development, watershed management and promoting gender equity in the
private sector and entrepreneurship. Much analytic and advisory work is carried out together with the
Turkish authorities, the private sector, academia, or civil society stakeholders. The World Bank Group
engages with civil society in the preparation and implementation of projects and collaborates closely with
other development partners such as the IMF, EU, United Nations organizations, and key bilateral partners.

TURKEY

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, despite
certain shortcomings. Turkey subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
Real Sector Statistics
2.
Data on producer and consumer prices are published monthly, with a short lag.
Monthly data on industrial production are published with a lag of five to six weeks. The CPI
and the PPI generally conform to international standards. The methodology of the CPI was improved
with the introduction of a 2003-based index, and this new CPI was effective as of 2005. The
methodology of the CPI was further improved in 2009 regarding the collection of
telecommunication services prices. The new CPI does not cover owner-occupied housing,
commodities produced by households for own consumption, and expenditures on commodities
obtained through in-kind payments. The PPI is compiled only by product (and not by economic
activity).
3.
Quarterly national accounts are published with a 2-3 month lag. The Turkish Statistical
Institute (Turkstat) publishes national accounts in current and constant prices for the production and
expenditure approaches to gross domestic product (GDP) and in current prices for the income
approach. Only quarterly GDP data are presented on a seasonally adjusted basis.
4.
In March 2008, revised annual and quarterly estimates were released for 1998 onwards
following the introduction of ESA 1995 in Turkish National Accounts. However, GDP time series
have not been constructed for years prior to 1998. Work is underway aiming at incorporation of
data from annual collections, the development of independent estimates of household
consumption, and further enhancement of estimates for the non-observed economy. A project
recently initiated aims at extending the scope of the accounts to a full sequence of accounts for the
total economy, annual supply and use tables, and institutional sector accounts.
5.
There is a wide range of data on labor market developments, with the biannual
Household Labor Force Survey (HLFS) replaced with a monthly survey at the beginning
of 2000. These new data are published quarterly with a three month lag. Coverage of wage
developments in the private sector has improved through the use of quarterly surveys of the
manufacturing sector.
Government Finance Statistics
6.
Budgetary data are published monthly, with a lag of some 2−3 weeks. Coverage of the
budget is incomplete, with some fiscal operations conducted through extra budgetary funds, for
which data are available only with long lags. Fiscal analysis is further complicated by the omission of
certain transactions from the fiscal accounts, some quasi-fiscal operations carried out by state banks,
state economic enterprises (SEEs), and other public entities; and technical problems associated with

TURKEY

consolidating the cash-based accounts of governmental entities with the accrual-based accounting
of SEEs. It is difficult to reconcile fiscal data with monetary and BOP data, especially in the
accounting of external debt flows and central government deposits.
7.
Turkey reports fiscal data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook. The latest data available are for 2010 and cover the general government sector and its
subsectors. Monthly data are reported on an irregular basis for publication in International Financial
Statistics, starting from September 2009.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
8.
Data on the central bank balance sheet, and provisional data on the main monetary
aggregates and total domestic credit, are published weekly, with a one- and two-week lag,
respectively. Data on the monetary survey and deposit interest rates are published monthly, with a
one month lag, except for year-end data, where the lag is two months. The CBRT reports to STA the

Public data on banks’ external funding could be improved. The CBRT reports data on
banks foreign assets and liabilities, however, this includes data on transactions with banks’ branches
abroad that are classified as non-residents from the BOP perspective. The BRSA maintains data on
the consolidated banking sector with more accurate information on the true foreign assets and
liabilities; however, this data is not currently disseminated in a public report.
External Sector Statistics

The central bank reports quarterly BOP data to STA with about two months lag; in
May 2012, it started reporting quarterly IIP data from 2006 onwards. The CBRT participates in
the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and Coordinated Direct investment Survey
(CDIS). External sector statistics are compiled in broad conformity with the conceptual framework of
the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Turkey
On November 16, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Turkey.1
Background
After growing well above trend in 2010 and 2011, the Turkish economy has slowed to a more
sustainable 3 percent growth rate this year. Growth has also become more balanced,
as domestic demand and imports decelerated on the back of tighter monetary and macroprudential policies implemented in 2011, while exports continue to perform well thanks to
successful diversification towards new markets. In November, Turkey was upgraded to
investment grade by one credit rating agency.
Slower and more balanced growth is helping to unwind imbalances. The current account deficit
has shrunk significantly, by 33 percent year-on-year in the year to August. Inflation, both
headline and core, is also coming down from its peak in early 2012, though recent increases in
indirect taxes and administered prices have boosted it temporarily and could further undermine
competitiveness.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The primary budget surplus so far in 2012 has fallen significantly relative to the same period last
year. The budget target for the year is expected to be missed, notably because of spending
overruns in the areas of personnel, health, and capital spending. The banking system remains
well capitalized, with capital ratios at more than 16 percent and well above regulatory minima,
and not materially impacted by the introduction of Basel II and II.5. Profitability is strong, and
Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) remain near historic lows despite a minor uptick in recent
months.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Turkish authorities for setting the stage for more
sustainable and balanced growth in 2012, accompanied by declines in the current account
deficit and inflation. Directors noted that the outlook is clouded by external uncertainties, and
that Turkey remains vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment, given the country’s still large
external financing needs. Policy priorities thus need to remain geared toward a continued
unwinding of imbalances. Raising domestic savings and enhancing the economy’s potential are
important objectives over the medium term.
Directors welcomed the tighter fiscal policy stance proposed in the 2013 budget, turning around
the pro-cyclical stance of this year and contributing to a more balanced policy mix. They
underlined the importance of containing growth in current spending, including the wage bill,
while protecting priority infrastructure investment. Directors welcomed ongoing measures to
broaden the tax base, enhance tax administration, and improve budget flexibility. Further efforts,
particularly on spending reforms, would be needed to achieve the desirable level of the primary
surplus. Directors viewed the medium-term fiscal program for 2013-15 as a welcome step in the
right direction.
Noting that inflation remains above the target band and inflation expectations stay elevated,
Directors recommended that the central bank adopt a more forward-looking monetary policy
stance and closely monitor developments in domestic demand, wages, and capital flows. They
recognized the challenging environment in which the monetary policy framework operates, with
its objectives of both price and financial stability. Many Directors saw merit in returning to a
positive real policy rate under a conventional inflation-targeting framework, supported by a
strengthened communication policy. A number of Directors considered that, in the current
environment of volatile capital flows, the more flexible policy framework has served the Turkish
economy well. In order to manage risks from excessive short-term capital inflows, many
Directors saw scope for greater use of sterilized intervention, given the relatively low level of
international reserves, complemented with macro-prudential measures.
Directors commended the authorities for progress in improving the health of the financial system
and the supervisory and regulatory framework, along the lines of the 2011 FSAP Update. They

3
noted that banks appear well-positioned for the introduction of Basel III, ahead of schedule.
Directors encouraged continued vigilance and a broadening of macro-prudential tools to
mitigate risks to banks’ balance sheets. They looked forward to swift action to address
deficiencies in the AML/CFT legal framework.
Directors observed that the savings rate had fallen significantly over the past decade. While
welcoming the recent reform of private pensions, they noted that fiscal policy also has an
important role to play. Most Directors were of the view that a significant increase in the primary
surplus could raise national savings, thus reducing the country’s vulnerabilities to volatile capital
flows and boom-bust cycles.
Directors emphasized the need to improve competitiveness and the business climate. Efforts
should continue to reduce the large informal sector, improve the functioning of the labor market,
and streamline regulations in the product and service markets. Directors also encouraged steps
to diversify energy sources and improve efficiency in energy production and distribution.

Statement by Mr. Prader and Mr. Yalvac on Turkey - 2012 Article IV Consultation
November 16, 2012
We thank staff for the comprehensive set of papers. Our authorities appreciate the dialogue
with staff.
After the strong growth performance in 2010 and 2011, the authorities targeted a rebalancing
of the economy in 2012. With prudent monetary, fiscal and macro prudential policies, Turkey
has managed to slow down the economy and reduce imbalances without risking the favorable
medium term outlook. In addition to the positive reaction in the equity markets, CDS levels
and spreads, the latest rating upgrade by Fitch to investment grade reflects the authorities’
success in rebalancing the economy.
As an important policy anchor, the Medium-Term Program (MTP) for the period 2013—
2015 was announced on October 9, 2012. The program was prepared under a gloomy global
economic and financial outlook despite all the commendable measures taken by the major
key players in the world economy. The authorities have continued their cautious stance for
this program period, taking the downside risks for the global economy into consideration.
The MTP aims at gradually converging to potential output growth, further reducing the
current account deficit, achieving inflation targets, maintaining a strong fiscal balance, and
strengthening financial stability. In addition to the favorable fiscal position, a strong financial
sector, household and corporate sector balance sheets will be critical to achieve the targets
put forward in the MTP.
Growth Outlook
Following the high growth of 9.2 percent in 2010 and 8.5 percent in 2011, the authorities
decided on a policy induced economic slowdown to contain the imbalances which could
jeopardize macroeconomic and financial stability. Since strong private sector consumption
and the appreciation of the Turkish Lira (TL) were the underlying reasons for imbalances, the
authorities designed a framework that would curb private credit growth and reverse the real
appreciation trend of the TL. However, the weaker than expected global growth outlook and
higher than forecasted energy prices have negatively affected the planned growth path. The
Turkish economy is expected to grow by 3.2 percent in 2012. Towards the end of the MTP
period, the economy is expected to gradually reach the medium-term growth target of
5 percent, which is higher than staff’s estimates.
The economy has adequate resources to reach the targeted growth levels. Since 2009,
4.2 million jobs have been created and the unemployment rate has declined to its lowest level
in the last decade. The young population with positive employment prospects and a strong
banking sector will be critical for achieving sustainable growth targets in the medium term.
Additionally, a favorable fiscal stance in terms of a low debt-to-GDP ratio and budget deficit
is important to eliminate the bottlenecks in infrastructure, human capital and public
administration.

2

Monetary Policy
Faced with excessive cross-border capital inflows, rapid credit growth, and a deterioration in
the current account deficit in the second half of 2010, the Central Bank has enhanced the
conventional inflation targeting regime. They adopted financial stability as a complementary
objective and added a set of policy instruments with a particular emphasis on credit growth.
Accordingly, since the end of 2010, the Central Bank has been implementing a new
framework supported by a mix of credit, liquidity and interest rate policies.
The new framework has supported a healthier outlook in the composition of growth as well
as improvements in the current account balance. The annual rate of credit growth has
declined from 35 percent to around 14 percent. The current account deficit to GDP ratio is
expected to come down from 10 percent in 2011 to 7.3 percent at the end of 2012. More
importantly, this adjustment has been achieved without a contraction in the aggregate
demand, thanks to a marked improvement in the contribution of net exports. Despite the
slower growth in the Euro area, exports have increased with the support of a successful
market and product diversification.
Although the adjustments in energy prices in September have led to a revision of headline
inflation forecasts for end-2012 from 6.2 percent to 7.4 percent, inflation has recently been
on a declining trend. Core inflation has been easing since the beginning of the year and is
expected at around 6 percent at the end of the year. The risks are on the downside due to the
favorable outlook of unprocessed food prices. Moreover, existing output gap and the
tapering-off of last year’s exchange rate pass- through effects are expected to bring inflation
down to the target of around 5 percent at the end of 2013.
So far, the new policy framework has been successful in rebalancing the economy without
hampering the price stability objective. Moreover, exchange rate volatility in Turkey has
been lower than in peer emerging economies with current account deficits. Overall, the last
two years have illustrated well the importance of establishing a flexible policy framework
with a broad range of instruments in order to cope with the variety of shocks arising from
global factors. The asymmetric interest rate corridor and the reserve option mechanism,
which are important tools developed by the Central Bank, are likely to support the flexibility
of the policy framework going ahead. Should the new framework continue to function well,
it could be a good alternative to the standard inflation-targeting framework with sterilized
interventions under a floating exchange rate regime. Nevertheless, the authorities are
thankful for staff’s valuable contribution to the policy discussion and they will closely follow
the developments under the new framework.

3
Fiscal Policy
The fiscal outlook remains strong. The ratio of public debt to GDP in 2012 is expected to
decline from 39.2 percent in 2011 to 36.5 percent in 2012. The central government budget
deficit is forecast to be around 2.3 percent, which is higher than last year’s target of
1.5 percent. As is well illustrated in the staff paper, the difference derives from primary
expenditure overruns in 2012. The two main factors for the increase in primary expenditure
are public spending which should improve the economy’s growth capacity, as well as
uncertainties in the global and domestic growth outlook.
The latest episode of strong growth, which resulted in the high level of the current account
deficit, has once again highlighted the need for measures to eliminate the bottlenecks in the
economy and to improve the economic growth capacity. In this vein, the government has
increased the resources for education, infrastructure, research and development, and better
public administration. According to the latest budget figures, investment expenditures in
education as well as in infrastructure, including energy and transportation, were significantly
increased.
The uncertainties in the global and domestic economy have also resulted in a cautious stance
in tightening the fiscal targets. The latest policy framework for curbing credit growth and
limiting an appreciation of the TL has initiated a successful soft landing in private domestic
demand, which has been the driving force of growth. Therefore, the authorities’ fiscal stance
has been cautious, to avoid a hard landing in a highly uncertain global environment.
Having said that, the authorities are aware of the delicate balance between public expenditure
needs and fiscal stability for long-term sustainable growth. In order to achieve the budget
targets, in September 2012, the authorities announced a package of fiscal measures, including
tax increases and adjustments in energy prices. The latest measures have been a strong signal
of commitment to fiscal discipline.
On the other hand, the authorities are also attentive to the need for changing the tax structure
from indirect to direct taxes and broadening the tax base. The size of the informal economy is
seen to be the most important obstacle. Therefore, the authorities have been working on the
“Strategy of Action to Fight the Informal Economy”. Part of this strategy is for example to
increase the number of social security inspectors from 700 to 1500 by the end of 2012.
Financial and Corporate Sectors
The strength of the financial sector has supported strong growth during the global financial
crisis. Although the banking sector has started to implement the Basel II and II.5 standards,
the capital adequacy ratio has broadly preserved its already high level. The NPL ratio has
also maintained its low levels. According to the Basel Quantitative Impact Studies, banks
also seem to be well-positioned for the introduction of Basel III.
The authorities are closely following best practices in supervision in line with the FSAP
recommendations. The Banking Regulation and Supervision Authority signed a

4
“consolidated supervision protocol” with the Undersecretariat of Treasury, Capital Markets
Board, Savings Deposit Insurance Fund, and the Central Bank to expand the coverage of
consolidated supervision for banking groups. The authorities are keen on strengthening the
financial stability with the support of macro-prudential tools. The developments in
household, corporate and bank balance sheets have been closely evaluated in the Financial
Sector Committee.
Regarding the corporate sector, the authorities closely follow the short FX position of the
non-bank corporate sector, which has reached USD 126 billion. However, there are two
comforting aspects; the short-term portion of the liabilities is very small (only USD 9 billion)
and the rollover ratios are very strong. As it is well depicted in the graph on the rollover rates
(page 6), the non-bank financial sector has been able to rollover over 100 percent during
times of high financial stress. This reminds of the fact that most of these loans could be used
against cash collateral. The authorities are working to obtain more data to understand the
risks stemming from this.
The authorities are aware of the importance of improvements in AML/CFT. The draft
legislation, which is expected to improve the framework, is submitted to parliament.
Structural Policies
The authorities agree that one of the most crucial structural policies is improving the savings
to GDP ratio. The past episodes have shown that public savings did not automatically
improve national savings. Therefore, more efforts will be directed to improving private
savings. The private pension system has been revised to increase the number of the
participants and the amount of funds under these schemes.
A simple and predictable tax policy is key to enhancing the competitiveness of the economy
and reducing the informal sector. The authorities will continue to take steps to increase tax
compliance and broaden the tax base.
Turkey’s dependence on energy imports necessitates more efforts in diversifying energy
sources and improving energy efficiency. The authorities have been allocating more
resources to decrease Turkey’s energy bill.
