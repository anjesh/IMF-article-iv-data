INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF POLAND
Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2011 Consultation with the
Republic of Poland
Approved by Anne-Marie Gulde and Aasim Husain
June 14, 2011
Overview: Poland returned to solid growth in 2010, building on timely and forceful
countercyclical policy responses to the global crisis. These responses were permitted by
limited macroeconomic imbalances prior to the crisis and access to the Flexible Credit
Line (FCL) arrangement with the IMF. With the economy gaining momentum, it is time to
normalize macroeconomic policies, further strengthen banking system resilience, and
deepen structural reforms.
Key policy recommendations:


The current substantial fiscal consolidation is welcome. Additional measures will
be needed to put government debt firmly on a downward path over the medium
term. With capacity constraints tightening, this additional adjustment should begin
sooner rather than later, with significant front-loading.



Revisions to balance of payments data are expected to raise the reported current
account deficit, which would indicate that net national saving is lower than
previously thought and thus strengthen the case for additional fiscal saving.



Recent increases in the policy interest rate have been appropriate. Some further
gradual increases will be necessary to bring inflation back to target.



Indicators of banking system soundness are generally sound, though some
challenges remain. Financial sector surveillance policies have been effective, but
efforts to further strengthen financial sector resilience need to continue.



Further raising labor participation would boost potential growth.

The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment of the economic situation and the key
policy recommendations. They considered that existing plans for fiscal consolidation are
sufficiently ambitious for now.

I. CONTEXT
1.
A solid recovery is underway, driven by domestic demand. As capacity constraints
tighten, inflationary pressures and the current account deficit are expected to rise. The fiscal
deficit in 2010 was large and the government debt-to-GDP ratio rose. Indicators of banking
system soundness are generally stable, though some challenges remain. The FCL arrangement
continues to play an important role in providing insurance against tail risks.
2.

Against this background, the mission focused on the following key policy issues:1



How would an upward revision to the current account deficit affect external
vulnerability?



How quickly should fiscal policy tighten, given the need to ensure counter-cyclicality
and fiscal sustainability?



What considerations should determine the pace of monetary policy tightening?



What can be done to further strengthen financial sector policies?



How should policies respond if capital inflows were to increase sharply?



How can structural reforms boost potential growth?

3.
Parliamentary elections are expected in October 2011. The center-right Civic
Platform (PO) has governed in a coalition with the agrarian Polish People’s Party (PSL)
since 2007. Poland will take up the rotating presidency of the EU Council in July 2011.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The economic recovery gained momentum in 2010 (Figure 1 and Table 1). Real GDP
growth picked up to 3.8 percent, driven primarily by private consumption—in turn helped by a
rebound in employment and wage growth during the second half of the year—and strong
inventory accumulation. Fixed investment contracted, as robust EU-financed public investment
was more than offset by weak private investment, as firms remained cautious about the outlook.
Strengthening domestic demand reduced the contribution to growth from net exports. Highfrequency indicators point to continued momentum in the early months of 2011, with strong
retail sales and industrial production.
5.
Labor market conditions have strengthened (Figure 2). Private-sector employment
growth increased, largely driven by the service sector. The labor force participation rate also
rose, reflecting both improved employment prospects and tighter eligibility requirements for
early retirement. The LFS-based unemployment rate declined to 9.3 percent at end-2010.
1

A mission comprising Mr. Morsink (head), Mr. Epstein, Ms. Lu (all EUR), Mr. Llaudes (SPR), Ms. Nedelescu
(MCM), and Mr. Van Wersch (STA) visited Warsaw during May 4–12, 2011. Messrs. Allen and Sierhej (Warsaw
Regional Office) supported the work of the mission. Ms. Zajdel-Kurowska (Alternate Executive Director) joined
the discussions. Poland is an Article VIII country (Informational Annex, Appendix I). Data provision is adequate
for surveillance (Informational Annex, Appendix II).

5
6.
Inflation rose, mostly reflecting higher commodity prices, a VAT hike, but also
some increase in core inflation (Figure 3). CPI inflation increased to 4.5 percent in April 2011,
mostly driven by food and energy prices as well as the one-off effects of the recent hike in VAT
rates. At the same time, rising capacity utilization, a closing output gap, and increasing private
sector nonfarm wage growth put some upward pressure on core inflation.
7.
The current account deficit widened in 2010, reflecting stronger domestic demand
(Figure 4, Table 2). The current account deficit increased to 3.4 percent of GDP, as a rebound in
export growth due to improving conditions in Poland’s main trading partners was more than
offset by an acceleration of imports. The current account deficit was almost fully financed by
capital transfers from the EU and net FDI inflows. The decline in FDI reflected a specific
foreign disinvestment in the insurance sector. Financial market turbulence in Europe in May
and November 2010 temporarily increased Poland’s CDS and government bond spreads (Figure
5). The real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 1).
8.
The banking sector remained profitable and well capitalized in 2010, but credit
quality deteriorated (Figure 6, Table 5). Improving net interest margins boosted profitability
and the average capital adequacy ratio rose to around 14 percent, with Tier 1 capital
representing 90 percent of total capital. The nonperforming loan ratio increased to about
9 percent, but now appears to have stabilized. Stress tests by the central bank, reported in the
December 2010 Financial Stability Report, show that most banks are resilient to adverse
shocks. Preliminary analysis by the authorities indicates that banks generally meet the new
Basel III requirements. Private sector credit grew by about 9 percent, with mortgage lending
remaining strong, consumer lending falling, and corporate lending picking up (Figures 7 and 8).
III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Real GDP growth is expected to remain at about 3¾–4 percent in 2011–12,
underpinned by domestic demand (text table, Table 4). Private consumption is projected to
continue to grow steadily, supported by stronger labor market conditions that more than offset
headwinds from the VAT rate hike and higher energy prices. EU-funded public investment is
set to peak in 2011 and then slow in 2012. Private fixed investment should accelerate, given
higher profitability and increasing capacity utilization. Inventory accumulation is projected to
slow down from a year ago. Employment growth should remain solid, leading to a further fall in
the unemployment rate. The full relaxation of German labor market restrictions on Polish
workers is not expected to have a major impact on the Polish labor market. CPI inflation is
expected to rise through mid-2011 and then gradually decline toward its 2½ target by end-2012.
10.
Based on existing data, the current account deficit is projected to widen to
4.1 percent of GDP in 2012. While foreign demand should support exports, strengthening
domestic demand and high commodity prices will boost imports. Following the temporary

The CPI-based real exchange rate is slightly above its historical average, but Poland’s
cumulative real exchange rate appreciation since 2000 remains below that of regional
peers. ULC-based measures of the REER have picked up over the last year as improving
cyclical conditions have contributed to a pick-up in wage pressures.

slowdown in 2010, net FDI flows are expected to increase in 2011 and then remain stable.
Portfolio inflows should decline gradually in line with lower government financing needs.
Reserve accumulation is expected to continue, although at a slower pace than in recent years.
11.
Improvements to the BOP compilation system may lower large errors and
omissions, but increase the reported current account deficit and external vulnerability.
The authorities are scrutinizing the nonfinancial private sector’s external assets, banks’
off-balance sheet operations, and various current account items (especially trade in goods and
services, and private transfers). The authorities have indicated that imports of used cars may
have been under-recorded, and net private sector transfers over-stated. As a result, the
forthcoming BOP data release may revise up the 2010 current account deficit by 1–2 percentage
points of GDP to 4½–5½ percent of GDP. Revisions to E&O may change the structure of GDP,
but are unlikely to change overall growth as any upward revisions to imports are expected to be
offset by higher consumption and investment. A higher current account deficit would indicate
that net national saving is lower and that vulnerability to external financing shocks is higher
than previously thought. Furthermore, it would affect the assessment of the exchange rate and
could imply a higher projected path for external debt (Appendix I).
12.
Risks to the growth outlook are balanced, with external risks mainly on the
downside and domestic risks mainly on the upside. While direct exposure to Europe’s
periphery via trade and financial channels is limited, sovereign financing concerns in the region
could spill over to funding pressures in core Europe and in turn increase financing costs for
Poland. In addition, Poland is closely integrated into Europe’s banking system, making it
potentially vulnerable to contagion from financial strains. Poland’s FCL arrangement provides
insurance against these risks. A sustained rise in global oil prices would represent a risk to GDP
growth. On the upside, increased investor appetite for Polish assets could lead to a surge in
capital flows. Also, given improved corporate profitability and tightening capacity constraints,
private fixed investment could recover more rapidly than currently envisaged.

8
Authorities’ views
13.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s views on the outlook and risks. The central
bank’s GDP growth projections for 2012–13 are slightly lower than staff’s, reflecting the view
that fiscal consolidation will have a more negative impact on domestic demand.
14.
The authorities were more sanguine than staff about the implications of a higher
current account deficit for external vulnerability, emphasizing that the past widening of the
current account deficit was gradual and fully financed.
IV. THE POLICY AGENDA
A. Narrowing the Fiscal Deficit
15.
The fiscal deficit widened in 2010 (Figure 9, Table 3). Given initial uncertainty about
the strength of the recovery, the 2010 budget envisaged a roughly neutral policy stance. In the
event, the fiscal deficit widened to 7.9 percent of GDP, mainly reflecting the lagged effects of
the 2009 economic slowdown on corporate income tax revenues, as firms continued to deduct
earlier losses. Financing needs were comfortably met in financial markets (with nonresident
purchases of government bonds reaching an all-time high) and through privatization receipts.
With government debt not far from an important threshold under the Public Finance Act, the
authorities specified additional corrective actions triggered by the debt threshold.2
16.
Substantial fiscal consolidation is under way (text table). Consolidation measures
amounting to 1½–1¾ percent of GDP each year are being implemented in 2011–12, notably
tightened eligibility for early retirement, a ceiling of CPI+1 on the growth of discretionary
expenditure (which includes a wage bill freeze in 2011), a VAT increase of 1 percentage point,
and increases in excise taxes. In addition, some pension contributions are being shifted from the
private to the public system and the government intends to further restrain local government
deficits. Based on announced policies and tax buoyancy, staff expects the fiscal deficit to fall to
5.6 percent of GDP in 2011 and 3.6 percent of GDP in 2012.
17.
To put government debt firmly on a downward path, additional fiscal consolidation
will be needed (text figures). On staff’s baseline projections, the fiscal deficit would fall over
the medium term to 2 percent of GDP and government debt would decline slowly to 53 percent
of GDP (ESA95 basis). To reduce debt firmly over time, the fiscal deficit should be cut to no
more than 1 percent of GDP over the medium term, which is also Poland’s medium-term
objective (MTO). The MTO ensures long-term sustainability taking into account projected
increases in age-related spending. This would require additional permanent measures of a little
more than 1 percent of GDP. With such measures, the debt-to-GDP ratio would fall to about
40 percent of GDP by 2021. Given that statutory spending represents about ¾ of total

2

The Public Finance Act establishes debt thresholds that apply to the national definition of debt (excluding debts of
the National Road Fund that are included in the ESA95 definition). The 50 percent of GDP threshold serves mainly
as a signal. The 55 percent of GDP threshold requires the implementation of measures to curb the increase in debt,
including a nominal wage freeze, a limit on pension indexation, and a VAT rate increase. The Constitution limits
debt to 60 percent of GDP.

expenditures, the authorities could continue their reforms of entitlement programs to attain a
durable expenditure reduction. Specific measures that could be considered include tightening
pension indexation, aligning disability benefits with the pension formula, improving the
targeting of other benefits, increasing the flexibility of the floor on defense spending,
streamlining public administration employment, limiting tax reliefs and exemptions, and
enhancing VAT yields. Staff suggested that, given the tightening of capacity constraints and
increased vulnerabilities associated with an upward revision to the current account deficit, it
would be good to front-load this additional adjustment.

18.
The authorities are planning to adopt a permanent fiscal rule. They are aiming for a
fiscal rule that would allow for countercyclical policy responses, be expenditure-based to help
constrain the size of government, and be simple to design, implement, and present to the public.
Specifically, they are considering a ceiling on nominal expenditure growth equal to historical
nominal GDP growth minus 1 percent. Given the importance ensuring fiscal sustainability, staff
suggested that the spending rule be anchored by Poland’s MTO, so that spending growth would
be reduced if the deficit consistently exceeds the MTO (a “debt brake”). Such a rule would be
effective in restraining debt while allowing for some counter-cyclicality. Staff also highlighted
that the rule should be complemented by strengthening the implementation of the ongoing
multi-year budgeting reforms, including through annual spending reviews, moving toward topdown budgeting, and preparing multi-year fiscal forecasts at the general government level.
19.
The shift of some pension contributions from the private to the public system will
improve government debt dynamics, but should not be allowed to facilitate higher
spending or tax reductions that could weaken fiscal sustainability. The comprehensive
pension reform of the late 1990s improved long-run fiscal sustainability (Appendix II).
However, the funding of future pension liabilities in the private second pillar led to higher fiscal
deficits and debt than would have otherwise been the case. The recently-implemented shift of
some pension contributions from the private to the public pension will reduce the fiscal deficit
and projected debt. However, if the shift contributes to delays in structural fiscal reforms, then it
could weaken fiscal sustainability. Moreover, given the projected long-term decline in
replacement ratios, staff suggested raising national saving once fiscal space allows (i.e. once the
MTO is achieved), either by strengthening the fiscal balance target or increasing contributions
to the second pillar. Also, a funded second pillar is potentially beneficial from international
risk-diversification and capital-market development perspectives. At the same time, the
regulation of private pension funds should be improved.
Authorities’ views
20.
The authorities agreed that additional fiscal measures will be needed over the
medium term, but differed on timing. The authorities are confident that the outlined measures
will be sufficient to meet the 2012 target. Nevertheless, they stand ready to adopt additional
measures, if necessary.
21.
The authorities saw scope for anchoring the envisaged permanent fiscal rule in the
MTO. They added that the rule would be accompanied by a strengthening of budgetary
processes and be governed by either a new Fiscal Responsibility Law or an amendment to the
Public Finance Act.
22.
The authorities agreed on the need to increase retirement saving over the long
term, but preferred to improve incentives for voluntary private saving (third pillar). While
they did not exclude a more ambitious fiscal target to create additional fiscal space, they
opposed using this space to enhance mandatory private saving under the second pillar.

11
B. Tightening Monetary Policy
23.
After keeping the policy interest rate unchanged during 2010, the central bank
began to raise the rate in January 2011. As financial conditions normalized, exceptional
liquidity facilities were gradually withdrawn 7
during 2010. The central bank has hiked the
Policy Rate
(Percent)
policy rate since January by a cumulative
6
1 percentage point to 4½ percent. This puts
the policy rate broadly in the neutral range
(based on an estimated equilibrium real rate
5
of 2¼ percent plus the 2½ percent inflation
target).

to boost core inflation. Headline inflation
should peak at around 4¾ percent in 2011Q3 before starting to fall, as commodity price
increases moderate.

25.
Given inflationary pressures, some further increases in the policy rate will be
needed. The appropriate magnitude and pace of tightening will depend on the evidence on
capacity constraints, as well as developments in inflation expectations, labor markets, the
exchange rate, and possible second-round effects from higher food and fuel prices. In staff’s
model-based forecast, which incorporates an endogenous interest rate path, further gradual
hikes in the policy rate by about a cumulative ½ percentage point over the next 12 months
would bring inflation back to the 2½ percent target over the policy horizon (Appendix III).
Financial markets are pricing in a similar pace of policy tightening.
26.
Monetary policy communication has been strengthened. In particular, recent postMPC meeting communiqués have contained more discussion of the MPC’s view of the inflation
outlook. There is scope for further elaboration, for example regarding the MPC’s views of the
balance of risks or the short- versus medium-term dynamics.
27.
The recent decision to convert some EU funds on the foreign exchange market (FX)
will lower reserve accumulation. Hitherto, most EU funds have been exchanged at the central
bank; the authorities now plan to convert some EU funds on the foreign exchange market,
which—in their view—would limit excess liquidity in the banking system. Market conversion
implies a slower buildup of foreign exchange reserves by the central bank, which will contain
sterilization costs. Reserves exceed several measures of reserve adequacy, but fall short of
short-term debt at remaining maturity plus the current account deficit, suggesting that some
additional reserve accumulation would be desirable (Appendix IV). Staff suggested that official
sales of foreign exchange ought to be done in a transparent and non-discretionary way, so as to
minimize potential exchange rate volatility.

12
Authorities’ views
28.
There was agreement on the need for some further gradual rate hikes, but the
authorities took slightly different views on reserve accumulation and FX sales. The central
bank noted that reserves are more than adequate on most measures and thus saw little need for
further reserve accumulation. On FX sales, the authorities noted that market reactions are
difficult to anticipate, but emphasized that the policy intention is not to influence the exchange
rate.
C. Strengthening Financial System Resilience
29.
Financial sector policies have been effective, but there is room to further
strengthen resilience. In early 2010, the Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) introduced
Recommendation T, imposing tighter standards on lending to households, including by capping
the debt-service-to-income ratio under stressed scenarios at 50 percent (65 percent for aboveaverage earners). More recently, the KNF reinforced the previously-issued Recommendation
S—which strengthened standards on mortgage lending to households—by capping the debtservice-to-income ratio for FX loans at 42 percent, with banks having until end-2011 to adjust.
KNF recommendations appear to have helped reduce the share of FX mortgages in new
mortgage lending since mid-2010, but FX mortgage loans still account for over 60 percent of
the stock of total mortgage loans. Depending on the impact of these recommendations, further
tightening of the existing prudential requirements or the introduction of other supervisory
measures (e.g., increasing capital requirements under a Pillar II approach) could be considered.
Staff pointed to the desirability of funding mortgage lending on a longer-term basis and further
developing the market for covered bonds (presently issued by a limited number of specialized
mortgage banks). Staff noted the importance of remaining alert to the risk of increased lending
by non-regulated or less regulated entities, following the recent tightening of banks’ lending
standards.
30.
Financial supervision should be strengthened further. Regarding micro-prudential
supervision, the preliminary conclusions of the recent Basel Core Principles assessment suggest
that more frequent on-site inspections and better coordination between on- and off-site
supervision are essential for monitoring compliance with prudential requirements and for a
timely identification and containment of risks. Also, to support the enforcement of financial
oversight policies, the KNF’s independence could be increased, including by enhancing
governance arrangements and the legal protection of staff (Appendix V). Regarding macroprudential supervision, it would be helpful to develop a framework for coordinating policy
responses to systemic risks, building on the central bank’s analytical framework for identifying
systemic risks, the KNF’s experience with designing and implementing prudential
requirements, and the effective forum for discussion provided by the Financial Stability
Committee (which consists of the central bank, the KNF, and the Ministry of Finance). In
addition, the bank resolution framework could be strengthened by adopting a broader range of
instruments and by increasing the role of the Bank Guarantee Fund.
31.
The introduction of a financial stability contribution is being considered. The
contribution would build a fund that could facilitate the resolution of weak credit institutions.
The base for the contribution would be bank liabilities excluding Tier 1 capital and insured

13
deposits. Operational modalities (notably the tax treatment and the relationship of the new fund
with the existing Bank Guarantee Fund) are still being clarified. Over time, the contribution
could be refined to reflect the riskiness of different institutions.
Authorities’ views
32.
The authorities generally agreed with staff’s recommendations, but expressed
reservations regarding the need to increase the KNF’s independence. The authorities are
committed to closely monitor the implementation of recent prudential requirements and to
tighten prudential requirements in the area of liquidity management to ensure that banks build
adequate long term funding. The authorities expressed concern about the often-limited powers
of host supervisors in the context of the EU supervisory architecture, especially with regard to
the oversight of branches. The authorities also agreed on the need to improve the coordination
of policy responses to systemic risks and to enhance the resolution framework. However, the
authorities considered that the independence of KNF is adequate. Finally, the authorities
indicated that they would request an FSAP Update in 2012.
D. Policy Options if Capital Inflows were to Surge
33.
Poland was one of the main recipients of capital flows among emerging economies
in 2010. The primary destination for inflows was government securities, reflecting in part the
government’s increased financing need. Despite these inflows, the appreciation of the exchange
rate was limited. Going forward, gross FDI inflows are projected to rise gradually in line with
the upturn in investment, other investment inflows should remain steady, while portfolio
inflows are expected to fall gradually given the government’s declining financing need. There is
a risk that increased investor appetite for Polish assets could lead to a surge in capital flows.
34.
If capital inflows were to increase sharply, monetary policy could be tightened
more gradually and fiscal consolidation could be accelerated. As the exchange rate is not
overvalued, some appreciation would be acceptable. This would dampen inflationary pressures,
thus reducing the need for increases in the policy interest rate. However, if a surge in capital
inflows were to put excessive pressure on the exchange rate, then the pace of reserve
accumulation could increase, within the NBP’s prevailing monetary policy guidelines, and the
already-envisaged fiscal adjustment could be accelerated, which would also reduce the need for
interest rate hikes. In addition, targeted macro-prudential measures, such as measures to tighten
bank lending standards, could complement the macroeconomic policy response.
Authorities’ views
35.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s recommendations, but did not see a
need for additional reserve accumulation. The authorities concurred that some gradual
exchange rate appreciation would be acceptable and that the already-envisaged fiscal
adjustment could be accelerated.

14
E. Enhancing Growth and Flexibility
36.
Despite recent reforms, structural rigidities continue to hamper potential growth.
Poland’s labor force participation rate has increased since 2007, due in part to measures that
lowered the tax wedge and tightened early retirement entitlements (Figures 10). However, the
participation rate is still low compared to the EU average. The government has also tackled
administrative and product market rigidities by introducing computerized land registers, onestop-shop regulations, and e-invoicing of VAT; streamlining documentation and licensing
requirements; and stepping up the privatization agenda in 2010–11. Poland’s score on the
World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index is relatively high, but it lags its peers
on the World Bank’s ease of doing business index, and a recent OECD study notes weak
product market regulations and large state involvement in network sectors such as transport,
energy, and communication (Figure 11).
37.

Possible further structural reforms include the following (Appendix V):



Labor market: Labor force participation could be increased by adopting labor-supply
enhancing measures with a complementary long-term fiscal effect, such equalizing and
increasing the retirement age and merging special pension schemes, including the
farmer’s scheme, within the general system. With limited resources for spending on
active labor market policies, the efficiency and targeting of existing measures could be
reviewed. Finally, existing (but temporary) flexible employment provisions could be
extended beyond 2011.



Product markets: Administrative barriers to business could be further reduced,
including by simplifying building permit requirements, improving one-stop-shop
regulations, eliminating tax reliefs and exemptions, and further streamlining
documentation and licensing. Efforts could continue to deregulate network sectors such
as energy and transportation and decrease the share of state ownership in the economy
through privatization.

Authorities’ views
38.
The authorities recognize the importance of structural reforms and remain
committed to proceed with the reform agenda. Improving labor participation remains the
authorities’ main priority: the goal is to raise the employment rate from 65 percent in 2010 to
71 percent by 2020. To this end, discussions on reforming police pensions are under way, while
changes to other special pension schemes, increasing statutory retirement age, or equalizing the
age for men and women are under consideration. The authorities are determined to pursue the
privatization agenda, with the ultimate goal of reducing state companies’ contribution to GDP
from 20 percent to 10 percent, implying that only strategic firms, mainly in key infrastructure
like power grid or railroads, would remain state-owned.

15
F. Euro Adoption
39.
Euro adoption remains an important long-term objective. The authorities are
pursuing an appropriate strategy, aiming to achieve sufficient progress toward convergence and
fulfilling the entry criteria, especially on the fiscal deficit, before announcing a specific target
date. In the meantime, they are working on required changes to the Constitution to permit entry
into the euro area.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
Poland returned to solid growth in 2010, building on timely and forceful
countercyclical policy responses to the global crisis. These responses were permitted by
limited macroeconomic imbalances prior to the crisis and access to an FCL arrangement with
the Fund, both of which reflected a track record of very strong policies.
41.
With the economy gaining momentum, capacity constraints are tightening,
inflationary pressures are rising, and the current account deficit is widening. Risks to the
short-term growth outlook are balanced, with external risks mainly on the downside and
domestic risks mainly on the upside. The FCL arrangement provides insurance against external
financial risks.
42.
Revisions to BOP data are expected to increase the current account deficit. A
higher current account deficit would indicate that net national saving is lower and that
vulnerability to external financing shocks is higher than previously thought, though the impact
on the projected path of external debt and the assessment of the exchange rate (which is
currently seen as broadly in line with fundamentals) would likely be modest. Given that errors
and omissions were not at an acceptable level, the authorities’ much-needed efforts to improve
BOP data are welcome and should continue.
43.
Given the large fiscal deficit in 2010, the substantial fiscal consolidation already
under way is welcome, but additional fiscal consolidation will be needed. To reduce debt
firmly over time, additional permanent measures of a little more than 1 percent of GDP will be
needed over the medium term. Given the tightening of capacity constraints and increased
external vulnerabilities associated with an upward revision to the current account deficit, it
would be good for this additional adjustment to begin sooner rather than later, with significant
front-loading.
44.
The recent increases in the policy interest rate are welcome and some further
gradual hikes in the policy rate will be needed to bring inflation back to target. The
appropriate magnitude and pace of monetary tightening will depend on developments in
aggregate demand pressures and inflation expectations. The increased discussion of the inflation
outlook in the post-MPC meeting communiqué is welcome and further elaboration would be
desirable. While international reserves are more than adequate on several measures, on balance
some additional reserve accumulation would be desirable.
45.
Financial sector surveillance policies in Poland have been effective, but efforts to
further strengthen financial sector resilience need to continue. Depending on the impact of

16
recent prudential recommendations, further steps could be considered. While financial
supervision is already strong, there are areas where it could be further improved, including
through more frequent on-site inspections. The independence of the Financial Supervision
Authority (KNF) could be increased and it could be given broader authority to issue binding
regulations. Regarding macro-prudential issues, a framework for coordinating policy responses
to systemic risks, in line with evolving international thinking, could be developed. Finally, to
strengthen the bank resolution framework, a broader range of tools is needed.
46.
Further raising labor participation would boost potential growth. Labor-supply
enhancing measures with a complementary long-term fiscal effect, such as raising the
retirement age and equalizing it between men and women, and merging special pension
schemes within the general system, would be desirable.
47.

It is recommended that the Article IV consultation remain on a 12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Implications of Potential BOP Data Revisions for External Vulnerability1
Background. In their ongoing effort to reduce the large errors and omissions in the balance of
payments, the Polish authorities have indicated that some of these errors may stem from items in
the current account. In particular, preliminary analysis suggests the likelihood of large errors from
two sources: under-reported imports of used cars, and over-stated private sector transfers.
Revisions to these items could increase the reported current account deficit in 2010 by about 1–
2 percentage points of GDP and by similar amounts in previous years. As a result, the current
account deficit in 2010 could rise from 3.4 percent of GDP to about 4½–5½ percent of GDP, while
errors and omission could decline by a corresponding amount. These revisions may occur as soon
as the June 2011 BOP release.2
Implications for the medium-term BOP projections. Two alternative scenarios are developed to
illustrate the impact of potential BOP data revisions on the BOP projections. These illustrative
scenarios assume a 2 percentage point of GDP revision to the 2010 current account deficit, at the
high end of the expected range:
Scenario 1: Adjustment factors are applied to the current account deficit and the errors and
omissions item so that the current account deficit is 2 percentage points of GDP higher in 2010 and
the errors and omissions are lower by the same amount on that year. Equal nominal adjustment
factors are applied over the projection horizon.
Implications: The 2016 current account deficit is revised up from 4.2 percent of GDP in the
baseline to 5.5 percent of GDP. Given that the nominal change in the current account is exactly
offset by the change in errors and omissions, the overall balance in the BOP remains the same.
Scenario 2: In this scenario, imports in 2010 are revised up so that the current account deficit
increases by 1 percentage point of GDP; for 2011 and beyond, imports are assumed to grow as in
the baseline scenario. Net current transfers in 2010 are revised down by 1 percentage point of GDP
and by equal nominal amounts over the projection horizon. Errors and omissions are revised down
by 2 percentage points of GDP in 2010 and kept at the new nominal level in the projection years.
Implications: The medium-term current account deficit is revised up from 4.2 percent of GDP in
the baseline to 6 percent. The higher current account deficit (compared to Scenario 1) is due to the
impact of applying growth rates to a higher stock of imports in 2010. The higher current account
deficit (as a percent of GDP) combined with the revised flat profile for errors and omissions (in
nominal terms) would imply a smaller overall balance in the BOP. To maintain the same overall
balance in the BOP as in the baseline, additional portfolio and other flows are assumed.

Prepared by Ricardo Llaudes.
A recent STA technical assistance mission found that the methodology underlying the intended BOP revisions is
based on appropriate compilation techniques and will improve Poland’s BOP data (Informational Annex,
Appendix II). The mission identified a few areas where research may prove useful in further improving BOP data.

Implications for the exchange rate assessment. A higher current account deficit in the medium
term affects the exchange rate assessment under the macro-balance (MB) and external stability
(ES) approaches, but not under the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach. Trade
elasticities suggest that,

upward revision to the
current account deficit in the medium term discussed above would have only a modest impact on
the exchange rate assessment. Specifically, the zloty would go from being slightly on the
undervalued side to being slightly on the overvalued side. Uncertainty about the trade elasticities
implies that the impact of a higher current account deficit on the exchange rate assessment could be
larger.
Implications for external debt sustainability. If the revised BOP projections imply a need for
additional external financing (as under Scenario 2), the external debt projections will rise.
Specifically, under Scenario 2, external
debt would peak at around 68 percent of

(from 66.5 percent in 2010). Thus, the

will be greater by an equivalent amount.
An increase in the current account
deficit by 2 percentage points of GDP would bring gross external financing needs from an average
of around 110 percent of reserves over 2011–12 to around 120 percent of reserves over the same
period.

39
Appendix II. Pension Reform and Options for the Future1
Poland undertook a comprehensive pension reform in 1999 that resulted in the
implementation of a multi-pillar pension system. The system is comprised of a first pillar payas-you-go notional defined-contribution public system; a private, mandatory, defined contribution,
fully-funded second pillar system; and a voluntary private third pillar system. The overall social
security contribution rate was unchanged, with more than half going to the public system, and the
remainder directed to the second pillar. The reforms aimed to improve long-run sustainability, lead
to better risk diversification, promote higher labor force participation and saving rates, and help
with capital market development.
However, pre-funding entails large fiscal costs. Pre-funding of the private pension system
resulted in a yearly deficit of about 2 percent of GDP in the public pension system. In the absence
of fiscal consolidation, this deficit was financed by debt issuance, leading to an increase in debt of
about 15 percentage points of GDP between 1999 and 2010. With continued debt financing of
pension gaps, these costs would likely persist and add an estimated 60 percent of GDP to public
debt during 2011–60.
Against this background, the government decided to shift about two-thirds of the
contributions going to the private pension system back to the public system. The contributions
to the private pension system would remain permanently lower (about half of their original size).
These changes were motivated in part by the deterioration of public finances during the recent
economic downturn, which, in Poland’s case, contributed to the fiscal deficit exceeding the
Maastricht limit and government debt (on the national definition) approaching the 55 percent of
GDP debt threshold under the Public Finance Act.
To the extent that the pension shift improves government debt dynamics over the medium
term, this may weaken the incentive to undertake needed fiscal adjustment. Also, if the second
pillar system is significantly diminished, the

40
Consequently, preserving the second pillar and supporting it with appropriate policies
remain desirable. To realize the long-run benefits of a multi-pillar pension system, the second
pillar should be preserved and complemented with policies that improve its efficiency:


Pre-funding future liabilities will need to shift from full debt financing to a combination of
fiscal consolidation measures and debt issuance, with the share of the two depending on
available fiscal space. This will be essential to contain reform costs going forward, achieve
inter-generational burden sharing of reform costs, and facilitate an eventual increase in the
national saving rate.



Pension fund regulations and supervision need to be strengthened to ensure that fees and
administrative costs are contained, while investments can be diversified and life-cycle
portfolios developed. Moreover, solutions should be developed for the decumulation phase
and for improving risk sharing arrangements for longevity and inflation risk.

41
Appendix III. Inflation Forecasting in Poland: A GPM Application1
Small projection models have become important in inflation forecasting and policy analysis in
central banks in both advanced and emerging economies. Small models are relatively easy to
implement and comprehensible to policy makers. The Fund’s Global Projection Model (GPM) is
one such model. Two key advantages of the GPM are that it produces an endogenous path for the
policy interest rate and that it has a multi-country structure, which makes it well-suited to the
analysis of global shocks.
Under the central model-based scenario, the policy interest rate in Poland is projected to
increase by about ½ percentage point over the next four quarters. Inflation is projected to
continue rise through 2011Q3 and then decline back toward the target next year. The output gap is
expected to remain positive over the policy horizon.
If external demand from Poland’s trading partners were to surprise on the downside,
inflationary pressures in Poland would ease and the need for increases in the policy rate
would diminish. Specifically, a negative 1 percent shock to the global output gap would lead to in
a decline in Poland’s output gap. As a result, inflation would fall more quickly and the policy rate
could fall slightly from the current level.

Appendix IV. Reserve Adequacy1
Using a variety of approaches to assessing reserve adequacy, staff considers that the balance of the
evidence suggests that some additional reserve accumulation would be desirable. Indeed, reserves
are projected to continue to increase.
Poland’s international reserve assets increased from about $40 billion in 2004 to about
$100 billion in 2010. Reserves have been on a steady upward path, except for the decline in
reserves experienced during 2008–09. Stron
g inflows in the financial and capital accounts have contributed to the increase in reserves: (i) FDI
inflows averaged about 5 percent of GDP during the 2004–07 period versus 3 percent in the
preceding eight years; (ii) portfolio inflows have surged since the global crisis; and (iii) sustained
and robust EU-related capital transfers now average about 1½ percent of GDP versus ½ percent of
GDP in the years immediately after EU accession. During the peak of the global crisis, the decline
in reserves in Poland (measured by the change in reserves as percent of GDP during 2008Q42009Q1) was about 2 percentage points of GDP, compared to an average of 1 percent of GDP in
other emerging economies in Europe with flexible exchange rate regimes.

Poland meets some but not all of the benchmarks of reserve adequacy. At end-2010, reserves
in Poland stood at about 20 percent of GDP, in line with the median for emerging economies.
Traditional metrics: Reserves amounted to about six month of imports and about 40 percent of
broad money. However, reserves fell a little short of 100 percent of short-term external debt (the
“Greenspan-Guidotti” rule), reflecting Poland’s higher level of short-term debt compared to other
emerging economies. Looking forward, reserves are projected to increase to 100 percent of shortterm debt by end-2011.

Model-based approach: The most widely-used model to assess reserve adequacy was developed by
Jeanne and Ranciere (2006). In this model, reserves are assumed to cushion the fall in output when
a sudden stop in capital inflows occurs. The optimal reserves level is determined by the size and
probability of a sudden stop, the potential loss in output and consumption, the opportunity cost of
holding reserves, and the degree of risk aversion. On this basis, Poland’s reserves fell short of their
optimal level by around 8 percent of GDP or about $35 billion as of end-2009.
New methodology developed by Fund staff: This new framework determines optimal reserve
holdings on the basis of the capital outflows typically observed during periods of exchange market
pressure and each country’s vulnerabilities based on (i) their current export earnings (representing
potential losses from a drop in external demand), (ii) stocks of external liabilities, and (iii) broad
money (for capital flight risk). On this basis, Poland’s reserves exceeded their optimal level by
around 7 percent of GDP or around $33 billion.
Other considerations also suggest the need for additional reserve accumulation. Poland has
strong trade links with the euro area and is also closely integrated into Europe’s banking system.
According to the BIS consolidated debt data, the euro area banking system holds about 75 percent
of total external claims on Polish banks, with 25 percent of the total coming from Europe
periphery’s banks. Given this exposure to Europe’s core and periphery, Poland’s financial sector is
vulnerable to contagion from financial strains and sudden changes in market sentiment. In this
context, Poland’s reserves cover around 30 percent of the country’s liabilities with foreign banks.
This is at the low end in relation to regional peers. Another source of potential vulnerability stems
from the fact that Poland’s relatively deep financial markets allow global investors to take a
regional view by buying or selling Polish securities. The level of nonresident portfolio exposures
has substantially increased over the past two years. Non-resident holdings of government debt are
now at an all-time high of around 26 percent of the outstanding stock. This ratio is considerably
larger than that in other countries that have also experienced a surge in capital inflows following
the crisis, such as Brazil, Korea, or Thailand. In light of these potential risks and vulnerabilities, the
Polish authorities have availed themselves of a Flexible Credit Line (FCL) with the IMF, an
insurance-like arrangement that provides an additional line of defense should external pressures
develop.

Appendix V. Improving the Banking Supervision Framework1
The Polish Financial Supervision Authority (the KNF) took over in January 2008 the banking
supervision responsibilities from the Commission for Banking Supervision which functioned under
the auspices of the National Bank of Poland. The KNF played an important role in preserving the
banking system’s stability through the financial crisis by persuading banks to retain 2009 profits
and pro-actively issuing recommendations, including on tightening lending standards for consumer
credits in 2010 and for FX mortgage lending in 2011. Nevertheless, the preliminary conclusions of
the recent Basel Core Principles assessment suggest that the supervisory framework should be
improved:


Strengthening the supervisory approach through more frequent on-site inspections and a
closer coordination between on-site and off-site supervision. KNF should perform annual onsite inspections in the largest banks as well as in other banks where particularly risky areas are
identified. Also, KNF should improve the involvement of on-site supervisors in following up
with post-examination recommendations and enhance supervisory methodologies to enable
forward-looking bank interventions.



Improving the communication with supervisory board members, external and internal
auditors, and home supervisors. Frequent interaction with the banks’ supervisory boards, as
well as regular individual meetings with the internal and external auditors would provide KNF
with additional insights into the changing risk profiles of banks between regular inspections
and serve as a validation of supervisory findings. Taking part in supervisory colleges would
need to be supplemented by more active participation in joint inspections and integration of
home supervisory findings and risk assessments in the supervisory plan.



Improving the Polish legislation to provide a formal foundation for sound and consistent
requirements in a number of areas, including corporate governance (i.e. by introducing fit and
proper criteria for members of the bank’s supervisory board), major acquisitions by domestic
banks, banks’ holdings in nonfinancial entities, and bank resolution.



Increasing the KNF’s independence and enhancing its supervisory resources. Moving to a
system with full-time, remunerated external commissioners, appointed for cascading fixed
terms, would improve the KNF’s governance, which has seen high turnover since inception.
Also, it is necessary to enhance the legal protection of supervisors, and broaden the power of
KNF to issue binding resolutions. Finally, the KNF supervisory resources need to be enhanced
to cope with additional pressures stemming from enlarging the scope of the oversight (i.e.,
bringing credit unions under the KNF’s supervision, advancing consolidated supervision,
putting in place Basel III); increasing the frequency of on-site inspections, and the
implementation of more sophisticated supervisory methods (i.e. the new risk-based SREP
process for off-site bank supervision).

Appendix VI. Structural Reforms in Poland1
A. Product Markets
Potential growth could be boosted with product market reforms and continued privatization.
Despite some recent progress, Poland lags regional peers in the World Bank’s Doing Business
index, with obstacles to construction permits, paying taxes, and starting a business looking
particularly cumbersome (Figure 11). Similarly, the OECD’s recent study of structural barriers to
growth points to the detrimental impact of weak product market regulations, including large state
involvement in network sectors like transport, energy, or communication.2 Quantitative estimates
by the OECD suggest that productivity gains from product market reforms would be the highest in
Poland among OECD countries.
Key product market reforms include the following:


State ownership: Privatization was accelerated in 2010, with receipts more than tripling on
2009. However, in a number of cases (e.g. energy and financial firms), the government
retained control after selling minority stakes. The authorities also intend to reduce public
control in the transport sector by selling the cargo part of railways and the national air
carrier (see below).



Real estate: The introduction of computerized land registers eased property registration, but
building permits remain a bottleneck. The law replacing permits with notifications was
enacted in 2009, but it was questioned by the Constitutional Tribunal and needs to be
modified.



Starting a business: One-stop-shop regulations did not accelerate business starts; plans to
improve the regulations are not clear.



Tax payments: The scope for electronic settlements has been significantly expanded,
including e-invoicing of VAT starting in January 2011. At the same time, a recent MOF
report on tax expenditures suggests that the tax system remains plagued with exemptions
and reliefs, with a substantial room for improvement.



Ease of doing business: The government has submitted to parliament a “de-regulation
package” to ease business activity and lower its cost by, inter alia, limiting documentation
and licensing requirements. However, the authorities recognize that further changes are
necessary, and the Ministry of Economy is working on a second de-regulation package.

Privatization in Poland
Early privatization efforts were significant, but tapered off subsequently. After an initial push
in the 1990s—when over 70 percent of state-owned enterprises were fully or partially privatized in
the process of transition to a market economy—the momentum slowed. Privatization remained
limited during 2001–08, except for a few transactions in the financial sector, including a public
issue of shares of PKO BP, the country's largest state-owned bank. As a result, Poland has been
5
lagging its peers on privatization, according to the
EBRD's Large-Scale Privatization Index, 2009
4.5
EBRD. A new and ambitious four-year privatization
4
plan, envisaging the privatization of about 800 state
3.5
3
companies from several business sectors, was adopted
2.5
by the Council of Ministers in mid-2008. However,
2
the start of the global crisis in late 2008 slowed
1.5
1
implementation. Consequently, only modest revenues
0.5
amounting to PLN 2.37bn and PLN 6.6bn were
0
achieved in 2008 and 2009, respectively.
The government has recently revived its
privatization agenda. Last year, privatization receipts amounted to PLN 22bn (1.6 percent of
GDP), comprising almost 90 percent of the PLN 25bn target. In addition, the sale of an 84 percent
stake in power group Energa to the state-controlled PGE (PLN 7.5bn expected revenues) was
completed but did not receive approval from the competition regulator, though PGE appealed the
decision. While about ½ of privatization receipts flow to special state funds—including the
Demographic Reserve Fund—the rest goes directly to the budget. The privatization target set for
2011 is PLN 15bn.

Privatization is expected to help reduce the government’s borrowing needs in the short run,
with efficiency gains expected to be limited. The broad goal of privatization of state-owned
enterprises generally is to increase economic efficiency through increased competition, which, over
time, leads to lower prices, improved quality, more choices, less corruption, and less red tape. It is
also expected to attract FDI, and, with it, useful technology and know-how. In Poland’s recent case,
however, this motivation appears more limited, given that the state has continued to retain
significant shares in the privatized enterprises and, in some cases, privatization entailed the
purchase of shares in one state enterprise by another state enterprise (such as the pending Energa
sale), which may result in a larger state monopoly. In this context, the recent acceleration of the
privatization agenda has been partly associated with the government’s general strategy to reduce its
growing borrowing needs. While using privatization proceeds to finance the deficit is appropriate,
the authorities should aim for reducing the share of state ownership in the economy in order to
achieve full efficiency gains and improve its long-run potential growth.

47
B. Labor Markets
Despite recent improvement, low labor participation remains an obstacle to growth. The labor
participation rate has increased since 2007, but remains below the level in neighboring countries.
Several measures have been implemented in recent years to boost labor participation:


Tax wedge: Disability contributions were reduced from 13 percent to 6 percent of wages in
2007–08, followed by PIT rate cut in 2009. This lowered the tax wedge, but it still remains
relatively high for low-income groups (Figure 10A).



Early retirement: Overly generous early retirement provisions were reformed in 2009
(Figure 10B). First, the reform curtailed occupational privileges, with number of people
eligible for early retirement declining by ¾ (to about 250,000). Second, the reform closed
the window that allowed retiring five years before the statutory age (at 55 for women and
60 for men). Labor participation rates have already increased, especially among women.



Flexibility of employment: While Poland’s regulations on temporary employment appear
restrictive compared to regional peers, the share of short-term job contracts is high
(Figure 10B). In response to the crisis, the authorities further increased flexibility of
temporary employment. The anti-crisis package, approved in 2009, allows unlimited
number of temporary contracts if their total duration does not exceed 2 years. Available
data suggest that it may have had positive impact on the labor market, although seasonal
effects may have also played a role. This provision is set to expire at end-2011.



Unemployment benefits: In 2010, the authorities introduced degressive unemployment
benefits, which are higher in the first months and lower afterward. This measure is aimed to
encourage more active job-seeking.

Looking forward, the policy challenge is to extend labor market gains without imposing a
large burden on public finances. Such a strategy could be pursued on several fronts:


Deepening pension reforms: A number of professions remain eligible for generous early
retirement, including miners, military, police, and judiciary. They should be gradually
brought into the regular pension system, which would not only improve activity rates, but
also generate fiscal savings. Given the increasing life expectancy, the authorities could
consider increasing the statutory retirement age, especially for women which retire at
60 (compared to 65 for men). Finally, agricultural employment in Poland is large (15
percent of the total at end-2009), with productivity in this sector being very low. Reforms
of the special pension system for farmers should be tailored in a way that would encourage
them to move to more productive sectors of the economy.



Active labor market measures: As a part of fiscal consolidation, the government has
reduced spending on active labor market measures from PLN7 billion in 2010 to
PLN3 billion in 2011. The need for fiscal consolidation underlines the importance of
reviewing the efficiency of various measures and improving their targeting.



Flexible employment regulations: Finally, the authorities could also consider extending
provisions of the anti-crisis package beyond 2011.

VIII.

Article IV Consultation:
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on May 7, 2010. In concluding the
consultation, Directors commended the authorities for their swift and timely response to
the global crisis. Directors considered that policy interest rates should not be raised at this
stage, in view of the contained outlook for inflation and the excess capacity in the
economy. On fiscal policy, Directors stressed the need to gradually start withdrawing the
fiscal stimulus while carefully balancing short-term cyclical priorities and longer-term
objectives. Directors recommended introducing a permanent fiscal rule with a deficit or
debt anchor consistent with the authorities’ medium-term targets. Directors considered
that, although the financial sector has been well buffered, continued vigilance is
necessary. Directors stressed that despite Poland’s strong fundamentals, raising its
exceptionally low labor participation rate remains critical to boosting long-term growth.
They encouraged labor supply-enhancing reforms with complementary measures such as
equalizing and gradually increasing the retirement age and merging special pension
schemes with the general scheme.

APPENDIX II. POLAND—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of June 14, 2011
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: The Central Statistical Office (GUS) compiles and disseminates annual and quarterly GDP
at current and constant prices following 1993 SNA and ESA 1995. Moreover, a full set of accounts, including
financial accounts by institutional sectors are compiled too. There are inconsistencies between annual and
higher frequency data reflecting differences in weights and in coverage. Electronic retrieval of the data is
challenging. The sub-annual data are collected on a cumulative rather than on a discrete basis, and plans to
introduce proper benchmarking have been delayed. Seasonal adjustment on relatively short interval leads to
frequent and large backward revisions.
Price Statistics: The CPI does not cover the imputed rents of owner-occupied dwellings. The scope of the
index covers all resident households, except those in some rural areas. The PPI does not include any estimation
for missing prices or quality and seasonal adjustments.
Government Finance Statistics: General government data are released on a quarterly basis, and compiled on
the same basis as the annual general government data, i.e. derived from detailed ESA accounts
(ESA = European System of Accounts). Revenue and expense are available according to the full economic
classification and, in addition, expense is also available according to COFOG (Classification of the Functions of
Government).
Further significant enhancements to government sources of data are necessary to comply with the accrual basis
of reporting, and to compile full information on financial and nonfinancial asset stock data for general
government.
Monetary Statistics: Beginning with data for January 2004, the NBP compiles monetary accounts in
accordance with the ECB’s framework for monetary statistics using the national residency approach. An earlier
ROSC mission recommended that the NBP, in cooperation with the MoF, reconcile monetary and government
finance statistics and carry out a reconciliation exercise on a regular basis.
Balance of Payments: Largely to improve data accuracy, the NBP reduced its reliance on International
Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) data and increased its reliance on survey-based source data, starting in
the first quarter of 2010; however, the size of errors and omissions remained unacceptably high. In 2009 and
2010, errors and omissions were larger than the current account deficit. STA undertook an evaluation mission to
Poland in July 2009 (prior to the implementation of the new compilation system) to examine possible causes of
the large and growing net errors and omissions. Among those potential sources were financial account
transactions (by banks and nonbanks), goods imports, and weaknesses in data capture through the ITRS.
During the 2011 IMF Spring Meetings, the NBP informed of data improvements work that the NBP and GUS
had undertaken, and revisions that it anticipated incorporating in the external sector accounts at end-June 2011.
A STA mission followed up on these issues during June 6-10, 2011. The mission concluded that the intended
revisions to the Polish data are based on appropriate compilation techniques. The revisions would affect the
estimates from 2004 forward.
Poland has conducted much research into trade in used cars (imports of used cars from Germany may have been
missed); remittances (incoming private transfers may be overstated and outgoing private transfers may be
understated); repurchase agreements (a limited amount of double counting of financial transactions in repos
may have occurred); and overseas assets of non-financial corporations (these may be misreported or missed).
Further, the NBP’s new survey-based compilation system has had an overall positive impact on data quality.
The mission also advised that research may usefully be conducted into the valuation of exports and imports of
goods and the coverage of derivatives transactions.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Poland
On July 1, 2011 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Poland.1
Background
The economic recovery gained momentum in 2010. Real GDP growth picked up to
3.8 percent, driven primarily by private consumption—in turn helped by a rebound in
employment and wage growth during the second half of the year—and strong inventory
accumulation. Fixed investment contracted, as robust EU-financed public investment was
more than offset by weak private investment, as firms remained cautious about the outlook.
Strengthening domestic demand reduced the contribution to growth from net exports, while the
current account deficit increased to 3.4 percent of GDP. Recent improvements to the Balance
of Payments compilation system lowered large errors and omissions, but increased the
reported current account deficit.
The fiscal deficit widened to 7.9 percent of GDP, mainly reflecting the lagged effects of the
economic slowdown on corporate income tax revenues, as firms continued to deduct earlier

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

losses. Government’s financing needs were comfortably met in financial markets (with
nonresident purchases of government bonds reaching an all-time high) and through
privatization receipts. Substantial fiscal consolidation is under way, with consolidation
measures amounting to 1½–1¾ percent of GDP per year planned for 2011–12.
CPI inflation increased to 5 percent in May-2011, well above the National Bank of Poland’s
(NBP) 2½ percent target. Inflation has been driven primarily by higher commodity prices,
though core inflation (excluding food and energy) has been rising in recent months. In
response to inflationary pressures, the NBP has hiked the policy rate since January-2011 by a
cumulative 1 percentage point to 4½ percent. This puts the policy rate broadly in the neutral
range (based on an estimated equilibrium real rate of 2¼ percent plus the 2½ percent inflation
target).
The banking sector remained profitable and well capitalized in 2010, but credit quality
deteriorated. Improving net interest margins boosted profitability and the average capital
adequacy ratio rose to around 14 percent. Private sector credit grew by about 9 percent, with
mortgage lending remaining strong, consumer lending falling, and corporate lending picking
up. The nonperforming loan ratio rose to about 9 percent, but now appears to have stabilized.
Recent stress tests by the NBP show that most banks are resilient to adverse shocks.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the return of Poland’s economy to solid growth in 2010,
supported by timely and forceful countercyclical policy responses to the global crisis. Directors
observed that, with the economy gaining momentum, capacity constraints are emerging,
inflationary pressures are rising, and the current account deficit is widening. At the same time,
Poland remains vulnerable to contagion from regional financial strains. In this context, while
agreeing that the Flexible Credit Line arrangement with the Fund continues to provide
insurance against external financial risks, Directors highlighted the importance of maintaining
disciplined macroeconomic policies and advancing growth-enhancing structural reforms.
Directors welcomed the substantial fiscal consolidation that is already under way. Given the
narrowing output gap and increased external vulnerabilities associated with the upward
revision to the current account deficit, they considered that additional front-loaded measures
will be necessary to lessen the burden of monetary policy and put debt firmly on a downward
path over the medium term. Directors supported the authorities’ plan to adopt an expenditurebased fiscal rule, complemented by efforts to strengthen budgetary processes, tighten
entitlement programs, and streamline the public administration.
Directors welcomed the recent increases in the policy interest rate. They noted that some
further gradual hikes in the policy rate are warranted to bring inflation back to target, while
efforts should continue to improve monetary policy communication. Directors encouraged the

3
authorities to remain vigilant to developments in aggregate demand pressures and inflation
expectations. A gradual exchange rate appreciation could be considered as part of the policy
mix to deal with a potential surge in capital inflows. With international reserves still below
short-term debt at remaining maturity plus the current account deficit, most Directors
considered that some additional reserve accumulation would be desirable.
Directors commended the Polish authorities for the steps already taken to improve the
effectiveness of financial sector surveillance policies. They encouraged further efforts to
strengthen the resilience of the financial sector, including by further improving bank
supervision, increasing the independence of the Financial Supervision Authority, developing a
framework for coordinating policy responses to systemic risks, and strengthening the bank
resolution framework. Directors looked forward to a Financial Sector Assessment Program
update planned for next year.
Directors underscored that a further increase in labor participation and a reduction in product
market rigidities are key to boosting potential growth. They recommended measures to
improve labor supply with a complementary long-term fiscal effect, such as raising the
retirement age and merging special pension schemes within the general system. Improving the
business climate and advancing the privatization agenda remain priorities.
Directors welcomed recent improvements to the balance of payments compilation system,
which have reduced errors and omissions. They encouraged the authorities to continue to
build on this progress.

Statement by Katarzyna Zajdel-Kurowska, Alternate Executive Director for the
Republic of Poland and Beata Jajko, Advisor to the Executive Director
July 1, 2011
On behalf of the Polish authorities, we would like to thank staff for the constructive
consultations held in Warsaw and the comprehensive set of papers. Our authorities
broadly agree with the staff assessment and policy recommendations.
Economic Outlook
The economic recovery is gaining momentum, mainly due to robust domestic demand.
Since mid-2010, the GDP growth rates (year-on-year) have been exceeding 4 percent,
outpacing both market and authorities expectations. The main drivers of the economy
remain private consumption stimulated by positive developments in the labor market, and
EU-financed public investments. The external sector is benefiting from a rebound in
Poland’s main trading partners. The situation in the financial sector continues to be sound
and investor confidence remains strong, attributable in part to the Flexible Credit Line
arrangement with the Fund.
Fiscal Policy
Reducing fiscal imbalance and ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability remain the key
priorities for the Polish authorities. The authorities are determined to reduce the general
government deficit in line with the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) by 2012 and
committed to narrow the structural deficit towards meeting the medium-term objective,
which would put the public debt firmly on the downward trend.
To this end, an ambitious fiscal consolidation package, which is mainly expendituredriven, is being implemented aiming at reducing the structural deficit and enhancing the
efficiency and structure of public spending. The fiscal measures for 2011–2012 amount
to a total of 4.6 percent of GDP, of which 0.8 percent of GDP accounts to changes on the
revenue side. The pace of consolidation and range of measures were designed to
minimize possible adverse effects on economic growth.
The main measures under the fiscal consolidation package cover an implementation
(effective since 2010) of an expenditure rule limiting the real annual growth rate of
discretionary expenditure and new statutory expenditure to 1 percent. This temporary
measure, in force until the EDP procedure is abrogated, will be replaced by a permanent
expenditure-based rule allowing for counter-cyclical policy responses. The new rule will
be at the core of changes in the fiscal framework, which also include strengthening the
budgetary processes. Moreover, the already implemented amendments to the fiscal law
have strengthened fiscal discipline in local governments and enhanced central
government liquidity management. In addition, a portion of the pension contributions was

2
shifted (effective May 2011) from the private to the public pillar of the pension system.
Savings resulting from this shift should contribute to improvements in the general
government balance by 0.6 percent of GDP in 2011 and an additional 0.5 percent in 2012.
The implemented changes in the pension system will not cause delays in structural fiscal
reforms which remain the priority of the authorities. These measures were supported by a
reduction in a public wage bill; i.e. a freeze in public wages (except local governments)
and a reduction of employment in the public administration.
Fiscal consolidation is at the core of the draft Budget Act for 2012 that was already
adopted by the government in May 2011. The Polish authorities are strongly convinced
that the implementation of the ambitious fiscal consolidation package will not only
ensure long-term fiscal sustainability but also benefit the quality of public finances in
Poland.
Monetary Policy
Recent CPI developments in Poland have been mainly influenced by external factors such
as higher food and commodity prices but also one-offs, like the increase in VAT rate
(January 2011) and statistical changes1. In May, headline CPI inflation reached 5 percent
year-on-year, while the core inflation increased to 2.4 percent year-on-year.
In order to contain inflationary pressure and limit second-round effects, the Monetary
Policy Council (MPC) has increased the reference rate by a cumulative 1 percentage
point to 4.5 percent since the beginning of 2011. The MPC considers that the significant
tightening of the monetary policy should bring the CPI inflation rate back to the target of
2.5 percent over the medium-term. The NBP forecasts indicate that the inflation rate
would stay above the upper bound of the MPC target until the end of this year and move
close to the target in 2012. The MPC continues to vigilantly monitor the economic and
price developments and stands ready to act accordingly.
Balance of Payment
Significant progress has been made to address the long-standing problem of large errors
and omission (E&O) in the balance of payments (BoP) statistics. An introduction of a
new BoP reporting system and comprehensive work on possible sources of the E&O
(supported by the Fund’s TA mission) revealed that part of the E&O should in fact be
reflected in the current account and financial account. The revised BoP data will be
published on June 29, 2011. The major corrections would comprise an upward revision of
the imports of used cars and a downward revision of private transfers (remittances and

compensation of employees). Although the revisions are unlikely to have any substantial
impact on the GDP growth, they may influence the GDP structure.
Financial Market
The banking sector remains stable and profitable. Economic recovery and adequately
enforced liquidity and capital standards, helped strengthen the capital base and stabilize
the pace of deterioration in the quality of loans. The short-term liquidity position remains
favorable; however, it is diversified among individual banks. The top-down stress-tests
performed by the National Bank of Poland (NBP) and a bottom-up test by the Polish
Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) proved that banks hold sufficient capital to
absorb potential losses. Adequate capitalization and liquidity position, as well as efficient
regulatory and supervision framework provide the financial sector with sufficient buffers
against the sovereign debt crisis.
Further strengthening of financial stability is underway. In 2010 and 2011, the KNF
tightened the regulations regarding both FX and domestic currency lending for
households. Recently endorsed measures include among others a 50 percent limit for the
share of exposures open to FX risk in a bank’s portfolio of retail credit exposures to real
estate; and a limit on the borrower’s exposure to FX risk by ensuring conformity of the
currency of exposure with the currency of income.
Prudential regulations imposed by the KNF contributed to a shift in the currency structure
of mortgage lending. The share of domestic currency loans in new mortgage lending has
increased substantially from about 20 percent in mid-2008 to about 80 percent end-2010.
Preliminary data confirm that this upward trend continues in 2011.
The ROSCs of the Basil Core Principles and IAIS Insurance Core Principles took place in
March 2011 and the FSAP update is planned for 2012. The authorities broadly agreed
with the main findings of the draft ROSCs but at the same time expressed their
reservations with regard to some of the conclusions and recommendations.
