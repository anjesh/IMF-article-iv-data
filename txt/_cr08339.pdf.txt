EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Article IV discussions focused on the policy agenda of the new grand coalition government.
In light of the disruptions that followed the December 2007 elections, the discussions centered
around policies to strengthen growth and address some of the social issues that emerged from the
crisis, while preserving macroeconomic stability. There was broad agreement on key, but not all,
policy issues and on economic prospects:
•

Economic prospects: after a contraction in the first quarter of 2008, an economic rebound is
underway. Notwithstanding considerable risks, staff expected that GDP growth would exceed
7 percent in 2008/09 (July/June); the authorities were somewhat more optimistic than staff that
this rapid growth would continue over the medium term.

•

External stability: the real exchange rate has appreciated considerably and the external current
account widened. However, there was broad agreement that this seemed to reflect foremost
fundamental factors, and exports, capital inflows, and foreign reserves remain robust.

•

Fiscal policy: fiscal policy in 2008/09 needs to provide adequate resources for infrastructure and
social objectives while preserving macroeconomic stability. With this in mind, staff saw merit in
reducing the fiscal deficit to around 4½ percent of GDP—not least in light of expected high
growth and inflationary pressures. The authorities’ budget envisaged a higher deficit of about
5⅓ percent of GDP, and they emphasized infrastructure needs. The authorities were considering
staff’s proposal to move to a fiscal anchor of total public debt (including domestic and external),
in light of increased external borrowing opportunities. Concerning a planned sovereign bond
issue, the authorities agreed that its size, costs, and maturity profile needed to be carefully
evaluated in order to mitigate potential risks.

•

Monetary policy: recent measures to tighten monetary policy were in the right direction in the
face of high money growth and inflationary pressures—and more steps are urgently needed to
prevent second-round effects of higher food and fuel prices.

•

Structural reforms and Vision 2030: the government’s Vision 2030 aims for Kenya to reach
middle-income status by 2030. There was agreement that for the private sector to play its
envisaged lead role, substantial infrastructure investment as well as structural reforms would be
required, including in the financial sector and on public financial management, governance, and
trade policy.

The authorities agreed with the main findings of the Ex-Post Assessment and suggested several steps
for a more effective and balanced partnership in the future.

I. POLITICAL CONTEXT
1.
A political crisis followed the December 2007 elections, resulting in major economic
disruptions. During the crisis, over 1,000 people were killed and more than 350,000 (about 1 percent
of the population) displaced. The disruptions affected also neighboring countries dependent on
transport links through Kenya.
2.
Following an internationally intermediated power-sharing agreement, a grand coalition
government assumed office in April 2008. Under the agreement, President Kibaki remained in
office and Mr. Raila Odinga assumed the newly-created position of Prime Minister. Constitutional
and land reforms are among the challenging political tasks of the new government. On the economic
front, the government submitted the 2008/09 budget and launched Vision 2030, a long-term vision
for Kenya. However, there have also been challenges, and the Minister of Finance stepped aside in
July to allow investigation of alleged misconduct related to a property sale, with allegations also
leveled against the Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).
II. ECONOMIC CONTEXT
After a long period of stagnation, growth
rebounded strongly over the 5-year period
preceding the recent crisis. Important, if uneven,
progress in addressing long-standing weaknesses—
including in the areas of financial management,
governance, and the business climate—underpinned
the gains in recent years, combined with strong
global growth. Kenya’s GDP growth of 7 percent in
2007 was its highest in over two decades and caught
up with growth in the rest of the East African
Community (EAC).

Political instability took a toll on economic
activity and exacerbated inflationary pressures in
early 2008. First quarter GDP contracted by
1.3 percent (year-on-year), with tourist arrivals down
by over 50 percent and most sectors hampered by
disruptions to supply chains and displacement of
productive resources. The resulting shortages
compounded inflation pressures arising from an
earlier accommodative monetary policy as well as
from rising international fuel and food prices.

To provide a rough sense of the magnitude of the bias, staff
applied one of the recommended methodologies (the socalled Jevons index). The results suggest that the overall CPI
was overestimated over the past 1½ years by a factor of
about 2. In line with the recommendations of a recent STA
mission, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics plans to
switch to a formula consistent with international best
practices later in 2008, together with a rebasing and
reweighing of the CPI basket.

Illustration of Upward Bias in the Carli Index

F eb-07

Kenya’s official CPI imparts an upward bias to “true”
inflation. This mainly reflects the chain-linked Carli index
used to aggregate individual prices. The Carli index is not
“transitive” (if a price increase in one period is reversed in
the next, the index would still show an overall increase) and,
especially in its chain-linked form, it creates a substantial
upward bias, particularly when prices are volatile. For this
reason, the International Labor Organization’s CPI Manual
(2004) strongly advises against using it for compiling the
CPI.

The external current account deficit almost
doubled in 2007/08 to 4½ percent of GDP. The
widening deficit largely reflected the impact of higher
oil prices, while exports held up well despite a strong
shilling (see below). Strong capital inflows resumed
after the crisis—partly driven by a heavily
oversubscribed initial public offering (IPO) of
Safaricom—and gross reserves increased.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. External Stability
7.
Indicators of external performance provide
mixed signals. The shilling appreciated by almost
32 percent in real effective terms since end 2004
(based on a corrected CPI series), a period over which
the terms of trade deteriorated markedly and the
current account deficit increased. However, export
values have expanded somewhat faster than global
exports, financial and FDI inflows have increased,
external debt has declined and is fairly low, and
reserves are at historically high levels.

8.
Overall, the authorities agreed with staff
that the exchange rate level appeared broadly
appropriate (Box 2). The shilling’s real appreciation
since 2005 was likely driven by improving
fundamentals, including rising tea and coffee prices, a
strengthening net foreign asset position, and
improved productivity—all of which helped attract
large private financial inflows. Even so, there was
agreement that the widening current account deficit
entailed risks, and that developments in
competitiveness and financial flows needed to be
monitored carefully.

9.
The authorities considered that the managed float exchange rate system had served
Kenya well. Interventions in the foreign exchange market have been largely limited to meeting
foreign reserve and monetary targets and reducing exchange rate volatility, with the de facto and de
jure exchange rate regimes classified as a managed float. The authorities noted that further structural
reforms would be important to keep the current account deficit at a sustainable level. The projected

further weakening of the terms of trade highlights the urgency to step up such reforms and address
infrastructure bottlenecks, which impede trade.

The staff employed several methodologies to assess external stability (see the background study

than its estimated “norm” (although the gap has
narrowed in recent years and these estimates are subject to considerable margins of uncertainty). Finally,
results based on the level of the current account deficit that would stabilize external debt suggest that the
present deficit was higher than the level stabilizing Kenya’s relatively low external debt.
Taken together, the different methodologies do not indicate major risks to external stability. However,
data and methodological weaknesses suggest caution in interpreting the results.

B. Growth Prospects
10.
The authorities and business leaders were confident that a robust economic recovery
was already underway. Although the political crisis took a heavy human toll, its damage to
productive capacity appears limited, mainly the dislocation of residents and localized destruction of
infrastructure. While tourism and agriculture will take some time to regain their strength, various
indicators—including for revenues, traffic volumes, and capital inflows—suggest that a recovery has
begun. Earlier repercussions on neighboring countries (notably Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda) have
also dissipated.
11.
Against this background, staff expects GDP
growth to rebound strongly, from 3.9 percent in 2007/08
to 7.2 percent in 2008/09. Much of the acceleration reflects
the gradual return to trend growth, following the disruptions
in the first part of 2008 (which affected fiscal year 2007/08).
At the time of the mission, the authorities forecast slower
GDP growth for 2008/09 (5.8–6.6 percent), but this did not
yet incorporate the larger-than-anticipated output decline in
the first quarter of 2008 nor the correspondingly stronger
bounce-back from the weaker base assumed in the staff’s
projections for 2008/09.

12.
Over the medium term, the authorities
and staff expect a fairly steady return to trend
growth levels. The Budget Strategy Paper (BSP)
projects GDP growth to average about 7 percent
over the medium term, with staff expecting
somewhat lower growth (6½ percent) on current
policies. The V-shaped recovery would be broadly
in line with previous election-related disruptions in
Kenya and elsewhere (such as in Madagascar in
2001-02), where growth tended to rebound quickly,
but it took time—often some 4–5 years—for GDP
levels to approach the pre-crisis trajectory.

13.
The projections are subject to considerable risks. Projected annual growth rates, while
close to those before the crisis, are well above the average rate recorded over the past decade—and it
was agreed that continued structural and governance reforms were needed to secure these rates. The
authorities shared staff’s concerns over downside risks, including those arising from the stability of
the power sharing arrangement, challenges for the coalition government to implement much-needed
reforms, further increases in global oil and food prices as well as world interest rates, and a more
pronounced weakening of the global economy. However, they also emphasized the upside risks—for
example, a faster-than-projected rebound in confidence, tourism, and donor support. The staff also
noted longer-term constraints on growth, particularly infrastructure bottlenecks as well as relatively
low levels of private saving and investment.
C. Fiscal Policy
Fiscal anchor—moving to a public debt target?
14.
The authorities recognized that evolving economic circumstances warranted a fresh look
at the appropriate fiscal anchor. In the past, a focus on net domestic debt (relative to GDP) had
served Kenya well: it helped bring down domestic debt and provided room for private sector credit
growth. However, plans for commercial external borrowing could potentially lead to large year-toyear fluctuations in spending for a given amount of domestic financing. The authorities’ agreed that
this would be an undesirable outcome.
15.
The authorities are considering staff’s proposal of anchoring fiscal policy around a
target for total public debt (both domestic and external). The target would ideally also include
contingent liabilities and other debts for which the government could ultimately be liable. Crosscountry evidence suggests that a public debt-to-GDP ratio of about 35 percent would be an
appropriate target for Kenya. 1 With the debt ratio currently close to 40 percent, staff supported

9
aiming for a moderate decline over the medium term, particularly given the potential realization of
contingent liabilities in the parastatal sector. Year-to-year fluctuations around such a target path
could be accommodated if warranted by specific circumstances—for example, large privatization
receipts, which should typically be spent gradually over time and result in faster debt reduction,
whereas drought-related emergencies or weak output growth could entail a smaller adjustment in a
given year. The authorities saw merit in this approach, including its potential flexibility, but stressed
also that sufficient room was needed to address urgent spending priorities.
Fiscal policy for 2008/09—supporting growth while preserving macroeconomic stability
16.
The 2008/09 budget envisages a deficit of 5.3 percent of GDP and a rebalancing of
spending toward public investment. While revenues (in relation to GDP) are expected to fall back
from their exceptionally high level in 2007/08, spending is considerably higher than the authorities
had envisaged in their 2007 Budget Strategy Paper—resulting also in higher deficits. They saw this
as warranted on two accounts: first, higher spending needs, notably to address infrastructure
bottlenecks and new policy initiatives (for example, free secondary education) emerging out of the
political tensions in early 2008; and, second, better financing opportunities than envisaged earlier,
including access to commercial foreign financing (see below).
17.
Staff supported the emphasis on public investment, but saw merit in having a lowerthan-budgeted deficit (of about 4½ percent of GDP). This would be consistent with the mediumterm debt objective outlined above and allow for fiscal policy to play its part in preserving
macroeconomic stability, in a context of strong economic growth and high inflation. Staff noted that
this deficit was indeed achievable in the context of the authorities’ budget plans, provided foreignfinanced investment spending was executed in line with rates of the recent past (rather than the
100 percent execution rate assumed in the budget). This would still allow for real spending growth of
some 2 percent (versus 5 percent in the budget). The authorities recognized that their plan for
foreign-financed spending was ambitious, but were not convinced of the need to aim for a lower
deficit target in light of post-crisis spending needs.

The authorities outlined plans for financing some infrastructure spending from the
proceeds of a sovereign bond. Discussions were still at an early stage, with an envisaged amount of
around US$ 500 million. While staff emphasized that concessional funds remained the first-best
source of funding, there was agreement that if commercial funds were to be used, market conditions,
funding costs, maturity, and the repayment profile needed to be carefully evaluated to maximize the
benefits of the bond. Moreover, the size of the issue should not exceed what can effectively be
absorbed in high-return projects ready for execution. The authorities indicated that they would cut
back on domestically financed development spending, if the bond issuance were delayed. The staff
also stressed the need for a comprehensive medium-term debt management strategy and encouraged
steps to improve statistics on external financial flows.
19.
The authorities took several measures to mitigate the impact of rising world food prices.
These measures, which entailed very limited fiscal costs, included the zero-rating of VAT on bread
and rice, reductions in customs duties for wheat, and steps to make fertilizer available at
internationally competitive prices. The discussions covered also targeted support to the most
vulnerable segments of the population—for example, an expansion of school feeding programs—but
steps in these areas remain contingent on future price and supply developments.
Medium-term fiscal stance—agreement on gradual adjustment and on priority spending
20.
On unchanged policies, little progress would be made in reducing the public debt ratio.
The authorities recognized the limited fiscal consolidation embedded in an unchanged policy
scenario—a scenario that assumes no major policy initiatives beyond those already in place
(Table 2)—and stressed their commitment to adjustment over the medium-term.
21.
The 2008 Budget Strategy Paper envisaged a
gradual reduction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio
toward 35 percent over the medium-term—an objective
that staff supported. The authorities underscored that
while overall spending (relative to GDP) would decline
over the medium-term, the composition would shift toward
development spending, in particular to address urgent
infrastructure needs. The specific measures to secure this
adjustment still needed to be identified, however, in future
budgets.

D. Monetary and Financial Sector Policy
22.
Monetary policy was fairly accommodative
over much of the past three years. During this
period, monetary targets were frequently missed, and
real interest rates on treasury bills (even if based on
corrected inflation estimates) were often negative. In
2008, the CBK accommodated crisis-related liquidity
needs in the early part of the year, but monetary

conditions tightened considerably thereafter. In early June, the Central Bank Rate (CBR) was raised
by ¼ percentage point to 9 percent in response to continued inflationary pressures.
23.
Notwithstanding the recent monetary tightening, the CBK agreed that further steps
would be required if inflationary pressures did not abate soon. The authorities explained that the
June increase in the CBR had signaled their intention to let market rates rise. Staff stressed the need
to employ decisively all available instruments—including, as appropriate, term-deposit auctions and
FX reserve sales—to slow reserve money growth to a rate consistent with preventing the secondround effects of higher food and fuel prices; in this regard, the planned introduction of the CBK’s
own bills could provide a further useful instrument. However, reserve money growth (19 percent,
year-on-year, in July) has remained above the level that the CBK and staff had considered consistent
with the envisaged decline in inflation during 2008/09.
24.
The discussions covered also alternatives to the money-based monetary framework,
including moving to inflation targeting over the medium term. While monetary policy would
benefit from a strong and credible focus on a low inflation target, it was agreed that more work was
needed before initiating steps toward alternative frameworks, including possibly inflation targeting.
In particular, this would require the resolution of the methodological issues related to the CPI, but
also a better understanding of the monetary transmission mechanism and alternative institutional
arrangements for monetary policy—areas where the CBK planned further analytical work.
25.
Most indicators suggest a relatively healthy banking system, but the CBK had to help
address liquidity shortfalls in a few smaller banks in the first half of 2008. Market participants
expected that the fallout from the economic downturn in the first quarter could somewhat weaken
financial soundness indicators (Table 5) in the period ahead. The CBK had provided support to a few
banks when interbank liquidity dried up in the context of the heavily oversubscribed Safaricom
IPO—when the interbank market did not recycle IPO-related payments from receiving banks to some
smaller banks in need of liquidity.
E. Vision 2030 and Structural Reforms
26.
The government’s structural reform agenda is centered around its Vision 2030
program. A key economic target of Vision 2030 is to accelerate annual GDP growth to 10 percent
per year by 2012 and sustain this growth thereafter, making Kenya a middle-income country by 2030.
A medium term plan that would guide the new poverty reduction strategy was recently derived from
Vision 2030. Against this background, discussions focused on selective structural reforms in the
Fund’s core areas.
27.
The authorities considered a vibrant financial sector as critical for dynamic, broadbased growth. To this end, they intended to finalize soon a Financial Sector Strategy. They also
planned to move forward with a comprehensive revision of the Central Bank and the Banking Acts,
including with steps that would bring mandatory and prompt corrective actions in line with
international best practices. Moreover, the CBK expected improved efficiency in the money market
following the recent dematerialization of treasury bill transactions and the adoption of the Master
Repurchase Agreement governing horizontal repurchase agreements. An anti-money laundering bill

12
is before parliament—although its passage remained uncertain—and the privatization of the National
Bank of Kenya is on the agenda.
28.
Concerning structural reforms in the fiscal area, discussions focused on public financial
management and the role of public private partnerships (PPPs).
•

The authorities concurred with the need to reinvigorate their five-year public financial
management reform program. Plans included: (i) adoption and subsequent implementation
of the Public Finance Administration Bill; (ii) expansion of the Integrated Financial
Management Information System (IFMIS) to the few remaining ministries and all districts;
(iii) introduction of a single treasury account; and (iv) adoption of program budgeting, where
a pilot phase is presently underway. There was agreement that if plans to devolve more
spending to subnational levels were proceeding, mechanisms needed to be put in place first
that would ensure effective coordination with fiscal policy at the central level and strengthen
budget reporting and control.

•

PPPs are to raise some of the funding for implementing Vision 2030. Plans were
advancing to finalize a solid framework for PPPs. The authorities recognized that PPPs could
play a useful role in infrastructure development, but could also entail fiscal and
implementation risks. They were considering staff’s suggestion to start with smaller projects
until more experience is gained, and agreed on the need to transparently record all PPPs and
potential public liabilities.

29.
The authorities intend to update the Governance Action Plan. The Plan for 2006/07 had
provided a useful framework, and the authorities intended to publish outcomes for the actions
envisaged under the Plan. This would show important progress in several areas, including on public
procurement and business regulations, where improvements placed Kenya among the world’s top 10
reformers in the World Bank’s 2008 doing business report. The authorities recognized, however, that
other objectives were not met. These included public access to the wealth declarations of senior
public officials and ongoing verification of wealth declarations by the Kenya Anti-Corruption
Commission—areas where staff encouraged progress under the next action program.

integration, and took note of staff’s
suggestion to work with their partners to lower the common external tariff and remove nontariff
barriers. These were expected to be covered in an EAC common market agreement, to be signed by

13
July 2009. Discussions on a full Economic Partnership Agreement with the EU were also to be
finalized by mid-2009.
F. Ex Post Assessment
31.
The authorities welcomed the opportunity to draw lessons from the longer-term
program engagement with the Fund and broadly agreed with most of the EPA conclusions.
They appreciated that the EPA highlighted Kenya’s track record of relatively prudent
macroeconomic management and its improved performance over the past five years. They also
concurred that an earlier re-evaluation of the focus of the Fund’s involvement in the governance area
would have been helpful. Moreover, they considered that some conditionality, particularly in the
governance area, had not reflected realistic timetables or the constraints of Kenya’s legal and political
systems, and an emphasis on legal and institutional governance reforms should have come earlier.
Several non-governmental representatives, but also some among the authorities, expressed concern
that the relationship between Kenya and the Fund had often been an unequal one, with the Fund
taking advantage of difficult economic circumstances to push for adjustments, with negative
consequences for growth and poverty reduction.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Following the political crisis of early 2008, the new government has taken initial steps
that, if sustained, could facilitate a relatively quick return to strong economic growth. The postelection violence interrupted a remarkable five-year rebound, in which economic growth finally
caught up with the region. The initial steps by the grand coalition government—including measures
to safeguard fiscal stability in 2007/08 while addressing urgent spending needs—provide a good
basis for advancing growth- and stability-oriented reforms. Improving political stability and security
have already sparked a quick economic rebound and prospects are favorable, if supported by strong
policies and provided the world economy does not weaken beyond current forecasts.
33.
While the external current account deficit has increased, there appear to be no major
risks to external stability. The appreciation of the real exchange rate seems broadly in line with
economic fundamentals, with strong capital inflows financing the current account deficit and foreign
reserves increasing. Under these circumstances, exchange market interventions should remain limited
to smoothing excessive short-term volatility and meeting the foreign reserve target.
34.
While the tightening of monetary policy in mid-2008 was welcome, more steps are
urgently needed to prevent second-round effects of food and fuel price increases. This requires
employing decisively the available instruments to limit monetary growth to rates consistent with the
inflation objectives. Moreover, the methodological issues of the current consumer price index should
be resolved quickly to allow an accurate inflation assessment. Over the medium term, broader
reforms of the monetary framework could be considered, including moving to explicit inflation
targeting, and planned analytical work on the issues is welcome.
35.
Fiscal policy needs to balance spending in support of growth and poverty reduction with
preserving macroeconomic stability. In this context, the 2008/09 budget rightly realigns spending

14
priorities toward infrastructure and several social objectives, such as free secondary education. More
spending may also be needed eventually to provide targeted support to those most vulnerable to the
increases in food and fuel prices. However, these spending priorities could be accommodated within
an overall smaller-than-budgeted spending envelope. Indeed, in the face of strong growth and
inflation pressures, it would seem appropriate to target some reduction in the fiscal deficit, to around
4½ percent of GDP—somewhat below the budget proposal. Importantly, this would also allow a
reduction in the public debt-to-GDP ratio.
36.
Consideration could be given to making the public debt-to-GDP ratio a medium-term
anchor for fiscal policy. It would cover not only domestic but also external debt—an increasingly
important consideration amid prospects of external commercial borrowing. A sovereign bond could
help finance some high-return infrastructure projects, in cases where concessional resources—the
first-best option—are not available. Size, timing, and modalities of the issuance are also important
considerations to maximize the benefits of a sovereign bond.
37.
Vision 2030 provides appropriately ambitious targets for Kenya—and it is now
imperative to advance the structural reforms needed for realizing this vision. If the private
sector is to play its envisaged lead role, further improvements in the investment climate are required.
Accelerating financial sector reforms will be key, also to secure the needed increase in domestic
resource mobilization. In addition, PPPs could play an important role, but smaller projects should
precede larger ones to gain experience in limiting potential fiscal and implementation risks. The
public sector also had its part to play in addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, and an important
growth impulse could come from further trade reforms.
38.
Continued progress on governance and transparency would be important to achieve the
Vision 2030 objectives. Important progress was made in implementing the 2007/08 governance
action plan, such as in public procurement and business regulation. The planned update of the plan
should include steps in areas where the original objectives were not met, including for wealth
declarations and verifications for senior public officials. Further improving public financial
management will also be important to advance transparency, including with measures to expand
IFMIS and ensure the efficient use of devolved public resources.
39.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month
cycle.

1/ The foreign travel credit is comprised of two components, recorded tourism inflows and an estimate of additional under-reported tourism receipts.
2/ Includes 2008/09 sovereign bond issuance, which would be used for infrastructure and to clear arrears on suppliers' credits for securityrelated and other contracts.
3/ This entry is believed to include unrecorded capital flows and remittances from Kenyans working abroad not captured above.
4/ Beginning in 2006/07, the table does not show accumulation of arrears on disputed security-related and other contracts, consistent with
the government's budget presentation. Arrears clearance amount in 2008/09 reflects estimate from Kenyan authorities based on an audit
of security-related and other contracts.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
KENYA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank
Approved by Saul Lizondo and Anthony R. Boote (IMF)
and Sudarshan Gooptu and John Panzer (World Bank)
August 20, 2008

The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) was prepared jointly by Bank and Fund staffs in
accordance with the standardized methodology for low-income countries. It is based on the
general framework approved by the Executive Boards of the Fund and the World Bank in
April 2005 and subsequently modified, including combining the external and public debt
templates in a single file. 1 The DSA has also benefited from consultation with African
Development Bank staff. As in the previous DSA, the findings indicate the risk of
external debt distress is low. Risks are somewhat greater for public debt,
particularly in the event of lower growth.
A. Methodology
1.
Debt sustainability is assessed in relation to policy-dependent debt burden
thresholds. Kenya is classified as a medium performer in terms of the quality of its policies
and institutions as measured by a three-year average of Kenya’s score on the World Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index. 2 , 3

http://go.worldbank.org/AXO6I14PK0

For a medium performer, the indicative thresholds for external debt sustainability are an NPV of debt-to-GDP
ratio of 40 percent, an NPV of debt-to-exports ratio of 150 percent, an NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio of
250 percent, a debt service-to-exports ratio of 20 percent, and a debt service-to-revenue ratio of 30 percent.

2
2.
The DSA is based on: updated data provided by the authorities, available data
on private sector borrowing, and estimates by the staffs. The DSA uses non-reconciled
debt data and a single discount rate.
3.
This DSA consists of two parts—external and fiscal. The external DSA covers
borrowing by the central government (including parastatal borrowing with a government
guarantee) and the central bank, and also includes estimates for private sector borrowing
based on available information. The fiscal DSA aims at assessing the sustainability of total
debt—external and domestic—incurred or guaranteed by the central government. 4
4.
Key assumptions underlying the DSA are consistent with the 2008 Article IV
Staff Report:
•

Average annual real GDP growth of 6.2 percent for 2008 through 2013, which is
somewhat below the 7.0 percent growth recorded in 2007, followed by 6.0 percent
growth from 2014 through 2028. Although the assumed growth level is below that
achieved in 2007, it is well above the recent historical average for Kenya. There is a
risk that constraints to growth—including infrastructure bottlenecks and the need for
further improvements in the business environment—will prove binding in the
medium-term. Accordingly, an additional scenario that assumes real growth for 20092013 is one standard deviation lower than in the baseline scenario is included
(average real growth for 2009-2013 in this scenario would be 4.4 percent).

•

Average inflation of about 5.6 percent for 2008-2013 as measured by a GDP deflator,
which falls to 4.9 percent for the 2014-2028 period.

•

A constant real exchange rate through 2013, followed by some real appreciation for
the remainder of the forecast period, which would be consistent with sustained high
growth. WEO exchange rate projections are used.

•

Annual goods and services export growth in U.S. dollar terms of about 12-13 percent
such that goods and services exports as a share of GDP rise from about 25 percent to
31 percent over the forecast period. The non-interest external current account deficit
rises to about 6.3 percent of GDP in 2008 before falling to an average of 3.3 percent
of GDP over the 2014-2028 period.

•

Fiscal projections are in line with those of the Article IV staff report, which are based
on an unchanged policies scenario. Under this assumption, revenues remain constant
as a share of GDP at 21.6 percent; expenditure developments are characterized by
constant domestically financed development spending of 4.5 percent of GDP, which
is slightly below the 2008/09 budgeted level which includes special one-off projects;

4

Public domestic debt includes central government debt. External public debt includes public and publicly
guaranteed central government and central bank debt. In this analysis, total public debt refers to the sum of
public domestic and public external debt, but does not cover the entire public sector (e.g., parastatal borrowing
without a government guarantee is not covered).

3
a constant wage bill of 6.6 percent of GDP, and a gradual decline in other recurrent
spending from 7.2 percent of GDP to 7.0 percent of GDP over the medium-term in
line with ongoing improvements in procurement. The primary fiscal deficit is
2.5 percent of GDP in 2008 and narrows to a deficit of 1.5 percent by 2013 and
remains near that level through the forecast period. Interest on short-term public
domestic debt is assumed at 8 percent, whereas medium- and long-term debt carry an
assumed interest rate of about 10.5 percent.
•

New external borrowing increases (including nonconcessional borrowing described
below) from about 2 percent of GDP in 2007 to 3.2 percent in 2009 followed by a
decline to just under 2 percent of GDP by the end of the forecast period. The NPV of
domestic debt is assumed to be equal to its face value.

•

New external borrowing assumptions include the issuance of an initial sovereign
bond of $500 million in 2009 and $200 million in annual sovereign bond issuance
from 2010 through 2013, which is consistent with the authorities’ medium-term
budget framework. Annual external sovereign bond issuance would then rise
gradually beginning in 2014 to about $500 million by 2028. Assumptions on terms
include an 8 percent interest rate and a bullet amortization in year ten (implying a
nine year grace period on principal payments).

•

The only debt relief assumed under the DSA is an existing swap agreement with Italy,
which would cancel about Euro 44 million in external obligations.

•

Continued eligibility for concessional borrowing from IDA is assumed although
achievement of assumed growth rates could imply graduation during the forecast
period.
B. Recent Developments

5.
At end-2007, the face value of public external debt is estimated at $6.2 billion
(25 percent of GDP). 5 About 60 percent of this debt is to multilateral creditors (including
47 percent owed to the World Bank). About 39 percent of the debt is owed to bilateral
creditors (largely Paris Club), and a small share (2 percent) is owed to commercial
creditors, some of which is for disputed security-related contracts and in arrears (see below).
6.
Kenya has managed its debt burden relatively well and has regularly met its
obligations to most creditors. Limited external borrowing has left Kenya with more
manageable debt ratios than many of its low-income country peers. Kenya's income level led
it to be considered in the context of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, but due to a sustainable
level of debt, Kenya did not qualify to receive HIPC relief. Apart from disputed commercial
arrears, described in greater detail below, Kenya has regularly serviced its debts.
5

The face value of public external debt as a share of GDP is significantly lower than for end-2005, which was
the base year for the last DSA. This reflects better data—the 2005 stock figure overstated Kenya’s debt—as
well as very strong growth and significant exchange rate appreciation against the U.S. dollar in 2006 and 2007.

4
7.
Kenya has benefited from Paris Club reschedulings. In addition to rescheduling
agreements in 1994 and 2000, Kenya received a rescheduling on Houston terms in 2004
covering US$353 million falling due from 2004 through 2006. Bilateral agreements with
Paris Club creditors were finalized for all three phases of the 2004 treatment, although
agreement on amounts to be covered in 2006 (roughly US$100 million) entered into force
somewhat late due to delays in the completion of Kenya’s second review under the PRGF
arrangement.
8.
Kenya’s end-2007 external arrears of about $91 million were to commercial
creditors and are under dispute. The arrears stem from non-payment on commercial
credits for security-related contracts, many of which have been found by Kenya’s Controller
and Auditor-General to be fraudulent or deeply flawed (these projects are often referred to as
the “Anglo-Leasing” scandal). The authorities are disputing the validity of the claims based
on the contracts not being fulfilled, have obtained an external audit to determine the value of
the goods and services provided, and intend to renegotiate the amounts owed based on the
audit results. Once agreement on the amounts to be paid is reached, it is expected that Kenya
will refinance these payments through issuance of new nonconcessional external debt—
potentially commercial bank loans initially, although the proceeds of planned sovereign bond
issuance described above could ultimately be used to finance arrears clearance.
9.
Kenya’s net domestic debt declined to 18.5 percent of GDP at end-June 2008.
Since end-June 2003, domestic debt has gradually declined as a percent of GDP thanks to
strong economic growth, prudent fiscal policies, and lower interest rates, despite primary
surpluses below historical averages and the realization of some one-off contingent liabilities
in the last two years. 6 However, Kenya’s relatively low reported domestic debt-to-GDP ratio
masks vulnerabilities from further realization of contingent liabilities. In response, the
government has launched a study of contingent liabilities in 24 parastatals and the National
Social Security Fund. Results from this study will be incorporated into future debt
sustainability analyses. In addition, the government’s current pay-as-you-go pension scheme
for civil servants has accumulated claims that were estimated at Ksh 271 billion (11.4 percent
of 2008/09 GDP) in an August 2005 actuarial study. About 70 percent of Kenya’s domestic
debt is longer-term borrowing with maturities extending up to 20 years. Fiscal data, which
are based on a July-June fiscal year, are converted to calendar year data for the purposes of
the DSA. 7
C. External Debt Sustainability
10.
Under the baseline scenario, Kenya’s external debt indicators show a low risk of
debt distress. Kenya’s initial debt ratios are well below all of the indicative thresholds for a
medium performer and decline somewhat through the forecast period (see Figure 1 and
6

In 2006/07, the National Bank of Kenya was recapitalized and in 2007/08 contingent liabilities from Kenya
Telkom were realized.

7

Averaging fiscal year data into calendar year data explains differences with Tables 2a and 2b in the staff
report.

5
Table 1a). Although external borrowing is projected to rise sharply in 2009 to 3.2 percent of
GDP, new obligations would fall gradually as a share of GDP thereafter. In addition to
reasonably contained borrowing (although on less concessional terms than in the past as
shown in panel a of Figure 1), the improvement in the baseline scenario reflects favorable
real output and export growth projections in comparison to longer-term historical
performance. Growth has accelerated significantly since 2003, and the authorities are
undertaking substantial infrastructure investments (financed partly through an assumed
increase in external assistance) and structural reforms intended to support export and overall
growth. It should be noted that the authorities’ Kenya Vision 2030 targets much faster growth
than assumed in the DSA. Although Kenya would remain well below its indicative thresholds
in the baseline scenario, panels e and f of Figure 1 show how issuance of a sovereign bond
with a bullet amortization structure could create a spike in debt service. An amortizing bond
or a means for saving in advance of the amortization could lessen budgetary pressures and
rollover risks.
11.
The alternative scenarios and stress tests indicate that Kenya’s external debt
situation is generally resilient although shocks would lead to a sharp initial worsening
in debt stock indicators (see Table 1b). Kenya would remain under its indicative debt stock
and debt service thresholds under all alternative scenarios and stress tests. The most extreme
stress tests are shown in Figure 1 and described here. A shock combining lower GDP growth,
weaker exports, a lower GDP deflator, and a fall in non-debt creating flows would push the
NPV of public external debt as a share of GDP from 14 to 28 percent, the NPV of debt-toexports from 55 to 105 percent, and the NPV of debt-to-revenue from 64 to 126 percent.
Despite an immediate worsening, the three debt stock measures would then improve with
ratios only somewhat worse than under the baseline scenario by the end of the projection
period. The combined shock described above would also raise the debt service-to-exports and
debt-service-to-revenue ratios, but would not push the debt service burden particularly high.
The scenario of lower growth for 2009-13 shows external debt indicators only marginally
above those in the baseline scenario. Perhaps surprisingly, a “historical” scenario, which uses
the recent performance of key economic variables instead of the baseline assumptions, yields
debt ratios that are better than in the baseline scenario. While growth is much lower under the
historical scenario and foreign direct investment is also lower, the historical current account
deficit is much lower than the deficit in the baseline. The latter factor reduces the borrowing
need and thus leads to lower debt ratios than under the baseline scenario.

D. Public Debt Sustainability
12.
Under the baseline scenario, the inclusion of domestic debt substantially
increases the NPV of public debt-to-GDP, even though all debt indicators remain within
comfortable levels (see Figure 2 and Table 2a). The NPV of total public debt-to-GDP, at
34 percent in 2008, remains broadly stable at that level up to 2028 as the gradual decline of
NPV of external debt is offset by a small increase in the domestic debt-to-GDP ratio.
Throughout the projection period, the NPV of total public debt remains below 40 percent
under the baseline scenario. Given Kenya’s relatively strong revenue performance, the NPV
of debt-to-revenue ratio remains well below 250 percent, and is broadly unchanged during
the period 2008-2028 at below 150 percent. The debt service-to-revenue ratio, which takes
into account debt service on longer-term domestic and external debt, is 25 percent in 2008,
and gradually declines after that.
13.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests indicate that Kenya’s debt indicators are
particularly vulnerable to slower growth, while being broadly resilient under other
alternative assumptions (see Figure 2 and Table 2b). A two-year growth shock leads to a
rise in the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio to 57 percent by 2028, an NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio
just below 250 percent by 2028, and a rise in the debt service-to-revenue ratio to over
30 percent by 2012, indicating some risk of debt distress under this scenario. Permanently
lower growth would also increase the NPV of debt-to-GDP beyond 40 percent, and would
raise the debt service-to-revenue ratio to about 30 percent, even though the NPV of debt-torevenue ratio would remain below 250 percent. The NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio also breaches
the 40 percent level under a scenario with primary balances unchanged from 2008, and a
combination of a two year growth and primary balance shock. The scenario of lower growth
for 2009-2013 results in debt indicators that are somewhat higher than the baseline in the
medium-term and a good deal higher in the long-term (e.g., by the end of the forecast period,
the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio would be 52 percent versus 34 percent in the baseline
scenario). This result reinforces the importance of expanding productive capacity in the
medium term, in addition to a prudent borrowing approach, to avoid a rising debt burden.

7
E. Conclusions
14.
Reflecting relatively limited reliance on external borrowing and an expected
improvement in macroeconomic performance, Kenya faces a low risk of external debt
distress. All external public debt indicators remain below the relevant country-specific debt
burden thresholds. Standard stress tests reveal an initial upward trend for the debt indicators
but do not result in a breach of the thresholds during the projection period.
15.
Taking all public debt into account, however, the DSA shows greater risk of
unfavorable debt developments, especially under a shock to GDP growth. Even
temporarily lower GDP growth would set the NPV of public debt-to-GDP, the NPV of debtto-revenue, and the ratio of debt service-to-revenue on a sharply increasing trend as shown in
Figure 2. Considering that the nominal value of public debt would be near, and in some years
above the 40 percent of GDP that staff has recommended as an anchor for fiscal policy,
unchanged policies would indeed imply some risk of debt distress. Potentially large but
unreported contingent liabilities also pose additional risks to the sustainability of public debt.
16.
The sustainability of Kenya’s debt depends on macroeconomic performance and
a prudent borrowing strategy. Achieving the ambitious growth and export figures in the
baseline scenario depends on: policies to sustain macroeconomic stability, substantial
investment in infrastructure, and regulatory and governance reforms to improve the
investment climate. Additionally, Kenya’s success in avoiding unsustainable debt to date
reflects good management, but also limited willingness on the part of creditors to provide
financing, at times due to governance concerns. As Kenya is likely to have greater access to
external financing, it will be important to avoid excessive borrowing and to limit
nonconcessional borrowing.
17.
The staffs encourage Kenya to use tools such as the joint Fund-Bank DSA
template to develop a prudent borrowing strategy to maintain both external and fiscal
debt sustainability. Efforts to use the DSA template and to develop a debt management
strategy, including through a workshop in 2007, are welcome. Such a strategy should
consider the total concessionality and interest costs of Kenya’s borrowing, the return on
individual projects and overall growth impact, and steps that would help guard against
volatility, whether due to shocks such as droughts or to fluctuations in external assistance.
Strategies to guard against shocks could include some further build-up in international
reserves. A better understanding of holdings of shilling-denominated debt by non-residents
would also help guide efforts to assess and potentially reduce vulnerabilities.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Includes only program grants.
Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Defined as grants (program and project), concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

The last three-year PRGF arrangement was approved on November 21, 2003, in the amount
of SDR 175 million. Access was augmented to SDR 225 million at the time of the first
review on December 20, 2004, to address the impact of a drought and higher oil prices. In
light of a balance of payments improvement and at the request of the authorities, access was
reduced to SDR 150 million at the time of the second review. The arrangement expired on
November 20, 2007.

Safeguards Assessments

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) was
subject to a safeguards assessment with respect to the augmentation of access under the
existing PRGF Arrangement approved on December 20, 2004. The assessment, completed on
September 8, 2005, noted that the CBK has taken steps to implement the recommendations of
the earlier safeguards assessments and proposed measures to address the remaining
vulnerabilities. There was one outstanding issue from previous recommendations to modify
the CBK act to state that the Bank will follow IFRS in its financial reporting framework, this
is to be part of the audit program for follow up with CBK.
X.

Exchange Arrangements

The currency of Kenya is the Kenyan shilling. Kenya has adopted a unitary exchange rate
structure in which the exchange rate is determined in the interbank market. The official
exchange rate, which is set at the previous day’s average market rate, applies only to
government and government-guaranteed external debt-service payments and to government
imports for which there is a specific budget allocation. The exchange rate regime is a
managed float, in which the U.S. dollar is the principal intervention currency. Kenya
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and

4
transfers for international current transactions. On August 18, 2008, the exchange rate was
Kshs 67.42 =US$1.00.
XI.

Article IV Consultations

Upon expiration of the PRGF program in November 2007, Kenya has now reverted back to a
standard 12-month cycle for Article IV consultations. The last Article IV consultation was
concluded on April 11, 2007.
XII.

FSAP Participation

The joint IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) missions took
place in Nairobi in July and October, 2003. The staff report on the Financial Sector Stability
Assessment (FSSA) was issued on November 29, 2004.

III. KENYA: KEY STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance and
program monitoring. Weaknesses in macroeconomic statistics reflect organizational and skill
shortcomings, and inadequate resources. In line with the new Statistics Law, the government
established the autonomous Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) in 2007 to replace
the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS).
2.
The Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes—Data Module (IMF Country
Report No. 05/388) published on October 31, 2005 stated that methodological soundness is
uneven across datasets and significant improvement is required in government finance
statistics and national accounts. Accuracy and reliability do not receive adequate attention in
any of the datasets, while accessibility of the disseminated macroeconomic statistics are
adequate, except for the balance of payments statistics.
3.
Kenya participates in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and the
GDDS project for Anglophone Africa. Metadata and detailed plans for improving the data
over the short and medium term are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board (DSBB). Kenya has received Fund technical assistance. Further assessment of capacity
building requirements has been undertaken by the AFRITAC East Statistical Advisor.
4.
Monetary, exchange rate, and some external data are published on a monthly and
biannual basis by the KNBS in its Monthly Economic Review. Core financial data are also
made available to the Fund on a regular basis. A detailed account of various sectoral activities
and the corresponding statistical data are published annually by the KNBS in its Economic
Survey.
National accounts
5.
Data quality has deteriorated significantly because of budgetary and staff constraints at
the KNBS. GDP is believed to be significantly underestimated, as important and increasing
parts of the economy, such as the informal sector, nonagriculture subsistence, horticulture,
and self-employed professionals are not properly covered. An STA peripatetic advisor
assisted the authorities in rebasing the national accounts estimates at constant 2001 prices and
compiling institutional accounts for the general government sector. As a result, national
accounts estimates for the years 1996–2005 in current and constant (2001) prices) have been
published. Quarterly national accounts are being developed with the assistance of the
AFRITAC East. Quarterly GDP estimates are now published.

9
Prices and production
6.
In early 2002, the KNBS (then CBS) began publication of a new national CPI
(covering 13 urban towns), with 1997 as reference year and outdated weights and basket of
items derived from the 1993-94 Household Budget Survey (HBS). Indices are produced for
lower and middle/upper income groups in Nairobi and other cities. The index is compiled
and published on a timely basis. No producer, export, or import price indices are produced.
In March 2008, a TA mission assisted the authorities in identifying the methodological issues
relating to the measurement of inflation. The current methodology of aggregating prices at
the elementary level was found to impart a substantial upward bias on CPI measurement. In
line with STA recommendations, the KNBS plans to switch to a formula consistent with
international best practices later in 2008, together with a rebasing and reweighing of the CPI
basket.
Government finance statistics (GFS)
7.
The data ROSC mission emphasized a number of key areas in GFS compilation that
should be improved, including: (i) migration to the GFSM 2001 methodology;
(ii) broadening the coverage to include extrabudgetary and social security funds and report
on a general government level; (iii) reconciliation of fiscal statistics from various sources to
limit discrepancies; (iv) improve information on external financing, particularly on
expenditure directly financed from abroad; (v) compilation and dissemination of monthly and
quarterly budget execution data; and (vi) training of Ministry of Finance (MOF) staff in the
GFS methodology.
8.
Since the beginning of FY 2005/06, Kenya has followed a new economic
classification of the budget based on GFSM 2001 (with assistance from the AFRITAC-East).
However, serious delays have emerged in reporting, reflecting difficulties in establishing
budget execution and accounting systems consistent with the new classification. To ensure
timely reconciliation and monitoring of budget execution, the existing systems would need to
be promptly upgraded and made operational. Progress has been made toward moving to the
IFMIS. There are still important gaps in ensuring proper reconciliation of fiscal data from
different sources, including from various units within the MOF. The discrepancies in budget
outturn data (between deficit/surplus and financing) remain significant, and the recording of
external financing and expenditure directly financed from abroad is still an important area for
improvement. The government has taken some steps to initiate a project to
rationalize/eliminate extrabudgetary funds, but the progress in compiling consolidated fiscal
statistics has remained limited.
9.
The country reports data to STA for the budgetary central government for inclusion in
the GFS Yearbook, albeit with a significant lag—the last data reported were for the year
ending June 2005. The KNBS compiles the aggregate annual GFS revenue and expenditure
data for the budgetary central government based on detailed data in the reports of the

10
Controller and Auditor General. The data submitted for publication in the 2007 GFS
Yearbook was reported in GFSM 2001 format, using bridge tables developed by the technical
assistance missions. The recent steps taken in the migration to GFSM 2001 may help reduce
the significant differences between KNBS data and the data compiled by the MOF and
reported to AFR for surveillance and program monitoring purposes. Monthly and quarterly
data are regularly reported for inclusion in the IFS.
Monetary statistics
10.
Progress has been shown in the implementation of the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual (MFSM)and development of the standardized report forms (SRFs). The
authorities submitted SRF test data; however, there has not been further progress. In March
2007, a STA mission established the standardized report form for the data on the central bank;
reviewed and revised the reporting form and compilation notes for the other depository
corporations (ODCs) in line with MFSM data requirements; and identified the coverage of the
ODC subsector. The mission found misclassification of a number of central government
deposits as private sector deposits. A major issue for future work relates to the expansion of
the coverage of the ODCs to include the Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOS). As of
end-March, 2007, there were 3,800 SACCOs, accounting for about 30 percent of the total
deposits of the banking system. When implemented, a new bill providing for increased
supervision over SACCOs would generate data as part of the supervisory function. A followup mission in June 2007 conducted a workshop for officials of ODCs and established a
system for reporting Form 1SR to the IMF. The new Standardized Reporting System for
reporting ODCs’ data to the central bank was also finalized.
External sector statistics
11.
The KNBS compiles annual balance of payments statistics in Kenya shillings that are
regularly reported to STA, although with considerable delay. In addition, the Central Bank of
Kenya (CBK) compiles a complete set of annual balance of payments statistics in U.S.
dollars, which are reported to AFR and used for programming and surveillance purposes. The
two datasets are not entirely consistent, and Fund staff has strongly encouraged the
authorities to reconcile them. More recently, the CBK also started to compile and publish
quarterly balance of payments estimates.
12.
Although the overall quality of trade data may be reasonably good, data for other
current account and many financial account transactions are rather weak. Following the
liberalization of the exchange system in 1993–94, gaps emerged in coverage. The compilation
system (other than that used for compiling customs statistics), used since 1994, relies on
reports from domestic banks and may result in a substantial under-recording of current
earnings, including tourism receipts; investment flows of the private sector; as well as
transactions that are settled via accounts held abroad.

11
13.
Present estimates of direct and portfolio investment are believed to be substantially
understated. The large positive errors and omissions in the central bank data that have
emerged in the balance of payments since 1994 give rise to uncertainties as to the potential
size of external obligations. The MOF compiles data covering public and publicly guaranteed
external debt obligations to official and commercial creditors. This database does not take into
account nonresident purchases of the government’s domestic currency-denominated debt
securities. In developing the loan-by-loan debt sustainability analysis (DSA) in 2002, Fund
and World Bank staff identified several significant debt data problems that have been
addressed by the authorities. Nevertheless, significant debt data management problems
remain, along with more general issues in the area of external debt management and its
integration in the budget formulation and expenditure management systems.
14.
To help address these issues, in 2006 a technical assistance mission recommended
introducing a foreign investment survey, enhancing the foreign exchange statistics survey, and
using a common methodology, including for estimations, in the use of available data in the
KNBS and CBK. In 2007, a DFID funded enterprise survey failed to materialize. There are
plans to conduct a foreign investment survey in 2008, which planned DFID-funded and STA
external sector missions will support.

Kenya does not report international investment position statistics to STA.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 1, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Kenya
On September 10, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Kenya.1
Background
Kenya’s macroeconomic performance continued to improve until violence erupted in the
aftermath of the general elections of December 2007. GDP growth reached 7.0 percent in
2007, the highest in more than two decades. Economic activity weakened, however, in the
wake of the political instability in early 2008 and real GDP is expected to have slowed to about
4 percent in 2007/08 (July/June). Inflation increased sharply in recent months, in part related to
developments in global food and fuel prices.
The fiscal deficit (including grants) for 2007/08 is estimated at 4.8 percent of GDP. This was
below the original budget target, reflecting foremost a strong revenue performance. For
2008/09, the budget envisages a deficit of 5.3 percent of GDP, with spending shifting toward
infrastructure and other priority areas.
Monetary policy was tightened in June 2008 to address rising inflationary pressures. For much
of 2007/08, reserve money growth had exceeded the authorities’ target and private sector
credit growth had also remained robust.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

The external current account deficit almost doubled in 2007/08 to 4.6 percent of GDP, due
largely to higher oil import prices. Sizable capital inflows contributed to an appreciation of the
Shilling against most major currencies and a strengthening of the overall balance of payments
position, with gross international reserve increasing to the equivalent of 3.1 months of imports.
An Ex Post Assessment of IMF’s longer-term program engagement with Kenya found that
macroeconomic policy during 1993-2007 was generally appropriately designed with sound
implementation. The assessment also found, however, that the approach to governance
reform was overly reactive and programs were overloaded—even though governance issues
deserved the attention. The authorities considered the draft report to be balanced and
objective, and noted that conditionality, particularly in the governance area, did not reflect
realistic timetables or the constraints of Kenya’s legal system and political environment.
Looking forward, the authorities suggested that both sides needed to learn lessons from the
past and to aim for a “partnership” rather than a “supervisory” relationship.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Kenyan authorities for maintaining economic stability in
the wake of post-election turmoil in early 2008, and for their sound macroeconomic policies
and progress with economic reform in recent years, which have contributed to strong
economic growth and poverty reduction. Directors regretted the interruption of economic
activity that resulted from the post-election turmoil, but were encouraged that a recovery
seems to be underway following the return to political stability.
Directors noted, however, that downside risks remain, particularly from rising food and fuel
prices and weakening global demand. They underscored that sound policies and continued
structural and governance reforms are essential to maintain macroeconomic stability, restore
strong growth, and advance toward the Millennium Development Goals.
Directors supported the focus of the 2008/09 budget on removing growth bottlenecks and
improving social cohesion. At the same time, they stressed the importance of fiscal restraint in
light of the strong recovery and inflationary pressures, and urged the authorities to
accommodate spending priorities within a smaller-than-budgeted deficit. Directors encouraged
the authorities to adopt a fiscal anchor based on the ratio of total public debt to GDP in light of
the planned sovereign bond issue. They advised that the size, timing, and modalities of the
planned international sovereign bond issue be carefully considered to safeguard debt
sustainability, and that the proceeds be used for high-return infrastructure projects. In this
context, Directors stressed the importance of establishing a comprehensive debt management
strategy, and advised the authorities to continue to seek concessional financing as the best
source for public investment.
Directors welcomed the recent tightening of monetary policy and the authorities’ readiness to
tighten further to prevent the second-round effect of rising food and fuel prices. They urged the
authorities to take more decisive steps to reduce monetary growth to rates consistent with their

3
inflation objective. They called for quick action to address the upward methodological bias in
the compilation of the consumer price index. Directors supported the authorities’ plans to
reform the monetary operations framework, including through the introduction of inflation
targeting. However, they stressed that more analytical work is needed and institutional and
statistical pre-conditions should be put in place before inflation targeting is adopted.
Directors observed that the managed float exchange rate regime has served Kenya well. They
considered that the appreciation of the real exchange rate is broadly consistent with Kenya’s
improving economic fundamentals, which have helped to attract financial inflows.
Nevertheless, Directors stressed the importance of monitoring developments in
competitiveness in view of the widening external current account deficit.
Directors agreed that far-reaching structural reforms and infrastructure improvements will be
required to achieve the authorities’ Vision 2030 growth objectives. Priority reforms should
include those in the financial sector, public financial management, and the regulatory and trade
regimes. Directors believed that public-private partnerships can play a useful role in building
Kenya’s infrastructure, provided the contractual arrangements are transparent and the
contingent liabilities are fully assessed.
Directors stressed the importance of continued progress on governance and transparency
reforms. They welcomed the authorities’ intention to update the 2006/07 Governance Action
Plan, under which advances had been made in important areas, including public procurement
and business regulation. Directors encouraged more progress in areas where original
objectives have not been met, including for wealth declarations and verifications for senior
public officials. Further improvements in public financial management would also be important.
Directors broadly concurred with the findings and recommendations of the Ex Post
Assessment of Kenya’s long-term program engagement with the Fund. They agreed that
macroeconomic policy design under past programs was broadly appropriate and that
implementation was generally sound. However, they noted that aspects of the past
engagement were disappointing—in particular, the protracted focus on governance issues.
Directors were concerned that program conditions on governance were not always macrocritical, did not take into consideration constraints of Kenya’s legal and political systems, or
paid sufficient attention to program ownership. Directors welcomed the improved ownership
and performance in recent years and believed that the Fund should continue to play a key role
in helping the authorities design and implement sound policies. In this regard, they welcomed
the consideration being given by the authorities to modalities for future engagement with the
Fund, possibly in the context of a Policy Support Instrument.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to publish all reports, including the reports for the
2008 Article IV consultation and Ex Post Assessment of Kenya’s longer-term program
engagement with the Fund.

Statement by Mr. Peter Gakunu, Executive Director,
and Mrs. Rachel Gesami, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director for Kenya
September 10, 2008
My authorities express their appreciation to the Fund for continuous engagement and support
for their ambitious macroeconomic and structural reform agenda. They particularly wish to
thank management and the staff for valuable consultations, constructive dialogue, and
comprehensive and informative assessment on Kenya’s economic achievements, challenges
and prospects. They broadly agree with the thrust of the useful analyses, advice and
recommendations in the staff reports.
Macroeconomic performance
The authorities’ strong commitment to sustaining macroeconomic stability and implementing
structural reforms, as well as Fund TA support, has underpinned the county’s recent
achievements, including robust growth, reduction and substantial reserves accumulation. Real
GDP grew by 7 percent in 2007, the highest rate in over two decades. This owed much to
sound macroeconomic policies and progress on structural reforms, coupled with a favorable
external environment. The strong growth momentum was interrupted, however, by the postelection turbulence of early 2008. This inflicted a huge loss of life and severe human
suffering, with economic effects evident not only in Kenya, where tourism, agriculture, and
transport were particularly adversely affected, but also in the region as transport links were
interrupted.
With the formation of the grand coalition government in February 2008, the economy is
regaining its footing. While a full recovery in some sectors is likely to take time, especially
tourism, the economy as a whole is rebounding. Overall real GDP is expected to grow by 4
percent in 2007/08—significantly better than had been envisaged, given the events of the first
quarter—and rebound to 7.2 percent in 2008/09, which is also consistent with the authorities’
Vision 2030.
On external stability, the real exchange rate has appreciated considerably and the external
current account widened. However, the authorities are aware and agree that this seems to
reflect foremost economic fundamentals, as exports, capital inflows, and foreign reserves
remain robust. In addition, inflation increased sharply at the beginning of the year mostly due
to post election political turmoil and the impact of high food prices as well as rising fuel
prices. The authorities have taken steps to expeditiously implement policies that would bring
the CPI-compilation in line with international best practice and measures needed to deal with
the second –round effects of food and fuel prices.
Fiscal policy
The country's fiscal stance continues to be prudent. The fiscal deficit (after grants) reached.
4.8 percent of GDP in 2007/08, below the original budget target but more than twice the

2

deficit of the previous year. The lower-than-budgeted deficit reflected mainly a shortfall in
foreign-financed development spending. Strong revenue performance benefited from
continued improvements in tax administration, a buoyant economy that boosted income tax
collections, and one-off transfer of collected road fees. As privatization receipts increased
sharply to almost 4 percent of GDP, domestic financing declined and public debt fell below
40 percent of GDP.
On the expenditure side, the authorities plan to shift spending in support of growth and
poverty reduction, while preserving macroeconomic stability. In this context, the 2008/09
budget rightly realigns spending priorities toward infrastructure and several social objectives,
such as free secondary education. More spending will also be needed to provide targeted
support to those most vulnerable to the increases in food and fuel prices. The authorities plan
to accommodate spending priorities within an overall smaller-than-budgeted spending
envelope. In that connection, and in the face of strong growth and inflation pressures, they
intend to target some reduction in the fiscal deficit to around 4½ percent of GDP—somewhat
below the budget proposal. Importantly, this would also allow a further reduction in the public
debt-to-GDP ratio.
Consistent with the objectives of vision 2030, my authorities continued to reinvigorate their
five-year public financial management reform program to promote transparency and
accountability. Devolution of more spending to subnational levels would require mechanisms
that would ensure effective coordination with fiscal policy at the central level and strengthen
budget reporting and control.
In the medium term, the government is considering making the public debt-to-GDP ratio a
medium-term anchor for fiscal policy. This would cover not only domestic but also external
debt—an increasingly important consideration amid prospects of external commercial
borrowing. A sovereign bond could help finance some high-return infrastructure projects, in
cases where concessional resources—the first-best option—are not available. Size, timing,
and modalities of the issuance are also important considerations that the authorities are
grappling with to maximize the benefits of a sovereign bond. The authorities have also
prepared a comprehensive Debt Management Framework to help preserve gains made
recently in debt sustainability. The DSF is providing guidance on the borrowing strategy,
procedures, and acceptance terms and conditions of loans, their disposition and servicing.
Monetary and financial sector policy
The monetary policy of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) is geared towards the containment
of inflationary pressures arising mostly from the impact of food as well as rising fuel prices. It
is worthwhile to note that the policy has recently been accommodative including crisis-related
liquidity needs in the early part of the year. However, monetary conditions tightened
considerably thereafter. The Central Bank Rate (CBR) was raised by ¼ percentage point to 9
percent in response to continued inflationary pressures. While the tightening of monetary
policy in mid-2008 was important, the authorities have come up with more steps needed to
deal with the second-round effects of food and fuel price increases.

3

Looking forward, monetary policy during 2008/09 will continue to focus on the primary objective
of price stability. The authorities plan to achieve this through employing more decisively the
available instruments to limit monetary growth to rates consistent with the inflation objectives.
Moreover, the methodological issues of the current consumer price index will be resolved to allow
an accurate inflation assessment. Over the medium-term, the authorities are considering broader
reforms of the monetary framework, including planned analytical work on the issues. At the same
time, coordination between fiscal and monetary policies will be strengthened to avoid undue
volatility in the market. The CBK will seek to attain an appropriate mix of its available monetary
instruments to ensure orderly developments in the markets.

On the financial reform, the authorities consider a vibrant financial sector as critical for
dynamic, broad-based growth. To this end, they plan to finalize soon a Financial Sector
Strategy. They also plan to move forward with a comprehensive revision of the Central Bank
and the Banking Acts, including steps that would bring mandatory and prompt corrective
actions in line with international best practices.
Structural reforms and Vision 2030
The government’s structural reform agenda is centered around its Vision 2030 program which
aims to accelerate annual GDP growth to 10 percent per year by 2012 and sustain this growth
thereafter, making Kenya a middle-income country by 2030. The authorities recently derived
a medium- term plan that would guide the new poverty reduction strategy from Vision 2030.
They rightly believe that for the private sector to play its envisaged lead role, substantial
infrastructure investment as well as structural reforms are required, including in the financial
sector and on public financial management, governance, and trade policy. Their vision
therefore, provides appropriately ambitious targets to advance the structural reforms needed
for achieving the goals of Vision 2030. The envisaged acceleration in financial sector reforms
mentioned earlier will be key also to secure the needed increase in domestic resource
mobilization.
The authorities recognize the need for continued progress on governance and transparency. In
this connection, they have made important progress in implementing the 2007/08 governance
action plan, particularly in the areas of public procurement and business regulation. Further
improving public financial management will also be important to advance transparency,
including with measures to expand IFMIS and ensure the efficient use of devolved public
resources.
Trade reforms
The authorities recognize that regional cooperation will continue to play an important role
towards sustaining sound macroeconomic policies and enhancing strong growth. The
government continues to participate actively in efforts to strengthen the existing regional
trading arrangements, especially within the East African Community (EAC). The government
recognizes that the EAC will continue to be the primary vehicle in its efforts to strengthen
regional cooperation. The authorities will work closely with other EAC partner states to
formulate a coordinated approach to investment and trade liberalization. Meanwhile, efforts

4

will continue to be made to address the issue of lowering the common external tariff and the
removal of nontariff barriers. These were expected to be covered in an EAC common market
agreement to be signed by July 2009, after which discussions on a full Economic Partnership
Agreement with the EU would also be scheduled to be finalized.
Debt sustainability analysis
The authorities are satisfied that the DSA has reflected the country’s relatively limited
reliance on external borrowing and the expected improvement in macroeconomic
performance. Kenya, in this regard, faces a low risk of external debt distress as all external
public debt indicators remain below the relevant country-specific debt burden thresholds.
Ex post assessment
The authorities welcomed the opportunity to draw lessons from the longer-term program
engagement with the Fund and broadly agreed with most of the EPA conclusions. They
appreciated that the EPA highlighted Kenya’s track record of relatively prudent
macroeconomic management and its improved performance over the past five years. They
also concurred that an earlier re-evaluation of the focus of the Fund’s involvement in the
governance area would have been helpful. They considered that some conditionality,
particularly in the governance area, had not reflected realistic timetables or the constraints of
Kenya’s legal and political systems, and an emphasis on legal and institutional governance
reforms should have come earlier. Several non-governmental representatives, and also my
authorities, expressed concern that the relationship between Kenya and the Fund had often
been an unequal one, with the Fund taking advantage of difficult economic circumstances to
push for adjustments, with negative consequences for growth and poverty reduction. It is
therefore imperative to ensure program ownership and to always consider the macro criticality
of conditionality when designing programs with countries.
Conclusion
The authorities remain committed to the continued implementation of prudent policies and
deepening of the reform agenda. This will be achieved through effective implementation of
the policies spelt out in the Vision 2030, which seeks to attain macroeconomic stability,
enhance public resource mobilization and efficiency in spending, and strengthen the
contribution of the financial sector to overall growth to make Kenya a middle-income country
by 2030. The authorities will continue to take measures to improve the business environment.
Consistent with the Vision 2030, the government will, in particular, continue to limit domestic
financing to reduce inflation, and facilitate expansion in private sector credit for productive
purposes. Our authorities are grateful for the support they continue to enjoy from the Fund
and the international community as a whole and count on their continued support.
