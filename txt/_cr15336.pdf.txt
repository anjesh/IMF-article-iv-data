IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Republic of Estonia
On December 14, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Estonia, and considered and
endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting.2
Following the rebound from the deep recession in 2009, economic growth has slowed. Although
Estonia’s economic and institutional fundamentals are among the strongest in the region, the
economy is expected to expand by only a modest 1.6 percent this year. Growth is primarily
driven by private consumption, which benefits from strong wage growth as labor market slack
diminishes for demographic reasons. Exports are subdued because of weak economic activity in
key trading partners. Nonetheless, prices will likely be flat this year and the current account is
expected to record a moderate surplus.
The economy should gather speed going forward. Growth is projected at 2.5 percent for 2016
and should average around 3 percent over the next few years. It is set to benefit from
stabilization in the external environment through better exports and higher investment, while
support from private consumption growth is likely to continue. But risks are tilted to the
downside. Inflation will rise in line with price developments in the euro area, with excise tax
increases providing an additional one-time boost to price levels for the next years. In the long
run, the current account is projected to move into moderate deficit as investment reverts to its
full historical strength.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that a proposal can
be considered without convening formal discussions.

Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2015 Article IV consultation with the Republic of Estonia, Executive Directors
endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows:
The economy has been holding up reasonably well in the face of difficult and uncertain external
conditions. Growth is likely to decelerate to 1.6 percent this year, reflecting recession in Russia
and stagnation in Finland, two important destinations for Estonian exporters. It should pick up to
2.5 percent in 2016 as the external drag diminishes and private consumption remains robust on
the back of strong wage growth. Risks are mainly to the downside and relate to the external
environment.
Yet, sluggish growth in recent years likely also reflects a decline in potential growth. Since 1995,
Estonia has achieved the highest average growth in Central and Eastern Europe, but potential
growth is estimated to have averaged only 2.25 percent a year during 2011–14. Going forward,
worsening demographics, diminishing options for “easy” productivity gains, and reduced scope
for capital accumulation will be additional headwinds. As a result, convergence with living
standards in Western Europe could slow markedly.
This makes policies to lift potential growth the primary economic policy imperative. While
Estonia clearly faces headwinds, it also has many assets: macroeconomic and institutional
fundamentals are very strong; the business climate is amongst the most favorable in the region;
educational standards are high; technology and science are being promoted; and Estonia is a
leader in e-government. A range of further commendable reforms is under preparation in the
context of the new programming period for EU funds, including revamped enterprise support
with more emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship, a new life-long learning strategy, a
“work capacity reform” seeking to put more disability pensioners to work, and reforms to
streamline local and central governments.
Additional growth-promoting measures could be considered. In the short-run, the focus should
be on getting the planned new initiatives off the ground. It will also be critical to now start
strengthening the operational policy focus on fostering productivity growth. To that effect, a
strong productivity unit in the Prime Minister’s office could be established to oversee
implementation, evaluate and adjust programs, and keep track of government spending on
productivity promotion. Over time, existing programs should be scaled up—active labor market
programs, life-long learning, enterprise support, and apprenticeship programs are still rather
limited in size. Supporting the upgrading of traditional industries as a second leg of innovation
policies should also be considered as these industries account for the bulk of employment and
value creation in the economy.
Estonia’s public finances are exceptionally strong and fiscal space could be used to support
productivity-enhancing programs. With no net public debt and structural fiscal surpluses since

3
2009, there is room for additional spending to promote productivity growth rather than
accumulate more fiscal reserves. But it will be important to ensure that these fiscal resources are
truly used for their intended purpose by keeping close tabs on them, for instance in the
productivity unit in the Prime Minister’s office. Once in place, fiscal space could be accessed
while remaining in compliance with Estonia’s stringent fiscal rule by producing budgets that are
on average in structural balance rather than systematically in surplus. In the longer run, the rule
itself could be made more flexible and allow modest structural deficits in line with European
requirements while preserving overall prudent fiscal policy.
Estonia’s external position is solid, but wage growth far in excess of productivity growth is
starting to cloud the outlook for the tradable sector. Company profits have lately been falling and
export market share gains have begun to peter out. This further underscores the centrality of
raising productivity, but wage growth also needs to come down to a more sustainable pace. In
this context, the more moderate wage increases envisaged in the central government’s 2016 draft
budget send a prudent message. The government should also make clear to social partners that
the steep minimum wage increases since 2013 risk becoming counterproductive and cannot set
the pace for general wage developments.
Impressive soundness indicators and further upgrades to oversight frameworks underpin
financial sector stability. The return to moderate private sector credit growth is a positive
development. Risks reside mainly abroad. They could be transmitted to Estonia through the
cross-border banks that dominate Estonia’s financial system and through trade channels, but
domestic and foreign lines of defense are also strong. Nonetheless, close cooperation with homecountry authorities remains important and existing Nordic Baltic platforms should be revitalized.
Cooperation could also help strengthen the traction of macroprudential instruments should they
need to be deployed in the next upswing in the financial cycle.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 30, 2015
Estonia’s economic fundaments and institutions are strong, but growth has been
sluggish in recent years. While this partly reflects unfavorable external conditions, it has
also led to concerns about medium-term prospects for income convergence with
Western Europe. Growth should pick up from 1.6 percent in 2015 to 2.5 percent next
year as the external drag fades and private consumption remains robust.

KEY ISSUES
 Boosting Estonia’s growth potential has emerged as the primary economic policy
challenge. Important supportive policies are already in place and many new initiatives
are under preparation. They should secure potential growth of some 3 percent per year
during 2016–20, despite adverse demographics and diminishing scope for “easy”
productivity gains. But convergence could be spurred by strengthening the policy focus
on raising productivity, scaling-up existing or planned programs, and putting more
emphasis on the upgrading of Estonia’s traditional industries as a second leg of
innovation policies.
 Competitiveness could come under pressure from wage growth, which has outstripped
productivity gains in recent years. Alongside policies to boost productivity, there also is a
need to cool wage growth, including through moderation in public sector wage policy
and ensuring that unsustainably rapid minimum wage growth does not set the pace for
general wage developments.
 Public finances are already the strongest in the EU in terms of debt and deficits, and are
set to improve further under Estonia’s stringent fiscal rule. Rather than overperform
relative to that rule through persistent surpluses, resources may be better used at the
margin to foster pro-growth policies while aiming instead at overall balance. In the
longer term, the fiscal rule could be made more flexible while preserving fiscal prudence.
 Estonia’s largely Nordic-owned financial sector boasts impressive soundness indicators
and a comprehensive macroprudential toolkit is in place. Nonetheless, close cooperation
with home-country authorities remains essential to deal with potential spillovers.

CONTEXT AND OUTLOOK
A. Context and Recent Developments
1.
Estonia has been pursuing market-oriented and disciplined economic policies under
stable political conditions. A three-party coalition government took office in April 2015 headed by
the free-market oriented Reform Party and also comprising the center-left Social Democrats and the
center-right Union of Fatherland and Res Publica. Its program seeks to strengthen national security,
increase support to families with children, lower labor taxes, reform state and local administrations,
and increase support for low-income earners. Increasing labor productivity to 80 percent of the EU
average and raising R&D expenditure to 3 percent of GDP are central planks of Estonia’s
competitiveness strategy, “Estonia 2020.”

Estonia’s economic and institutional fundamentals
are strong. The macroeconomic imbalances of Estonia’s creditdriven boom-bust cycle are a thing of the past and unlikely to
re-emerge amid credit aversion and strengthened
macroprudential tools. The current account has been broadly
in balance in recent years and unemployment is nearing its
structural level. The business environment and government
effectiveness earn high marks, the financial system boasts
enviable soundness indicators, public finances are the
strongest in the EU in terms of debt and deficits, and Estonia is
a leader in e-government. In 2014, per-capita income reached
74 percent of the EU average in purchasing-power parity terms.

Sources: Statistics Estonia; and Eurostat.

3.
Yet, economic growth has been sluggish in recent years and income convergence has
slowed. Following a setback due to the 2008/09 crisis, income convergence has restarted, but at a
slower pace. Since mid-2012 the economy has expanded at a moderate annual rate of only
2 percent, a little slower than the Central and Eastern European (CEE) average of 2½ percent over
that period and leaving real GDP still slightly below its peak in 2007:Q3. Adverse external conditions
are partly responsible, with Estonia being particularly affected because of large exposure to the
poorly performing economies of Finland and Russia.
4.
Growth came to 2.9 percent last year and 1¼ percent in the first 9 months of 2015.
Private consumption was the main driver, as real wages continued to rise at a robust 5 percent and
unemployment declined by 2.2 ppts over the past 18 months, falling to 6½ percent. Exports are
barely growing and investment, especially for machinery and equipment, is contracting amid weak
and uncertain external conditions. Inflation is hovering around zero, but low inflation is unlikely to
become entrenched because of brisk wage growth and forthcoming excise tax hikes. The output gap
is likely still slightly negative.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

5.
Estonia’s external position has improved and is solid. In 2014 and 2015:H1, the current
account started recording surpluses of 1.0 and 1.4 percent of annual GDP, respectively, reflecting low
import growth related to weak investment and inventory drawdowns. Over the past two decades,
export market shares have generally been on a rising trend, though gains seem to be flattening out
more recently. The net international investment position has improved from -80 to -40 percent of
GDP since 2009, reflecting capital account surpluses and the GDP rebound, and is now stronger than
in most of the region. Gross external debt is still quite high, but often owed to parent companies, net
external debt is negative, and net inward FDI explains the net international investment position two
times over. The real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 1).
6.
Public debt is close to zero in net terms, and the budget has recorded structural
surpluses for several years. Gross public debt is around 10 percent of GDP and is broadly matched
by general government liquid financial assets. In addition, second-pillar pension funds have set aside
over 10 percent of GDP in assets. The budget has been in structural surplus since 2009. In 2014,
public finances overperformed, recording a surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP compared to a budgeted
deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP as tax administration improved and public investment fell short with the
transition between the 2007–13 and 2014–20 Multiannual Financial Frameworks for EU funds.
7.
Indicators of financial soundness are exceptionally strong in Estonia, especially in the
large Nordic-owned banks that account for the bulk of the banking system. The capital
adequacy ratio averages 27 percent, the liquidity coverage ratio stands at 250 percent, and the nonperforming loan ratio has declined to below 2 percent. Strong deposit growth has reduced loan-todeposit ratios to just below 100 percent and parent bank funding to a historically low 16 percent of
bank liabilities. The three banks covered by the ECB’s comprehensive assessment and EBA’s stress
tests passed comfortably.
8.
Estonia is continuing to emerge from the bottom of the financial cycle. Credit growth
firmly moved into positive territory in mid-2014 and loans of credit institutions to non-financial
companies and households are now expanding at a rate of 3¾ percent annually. This reflects
improved balance sheets of banks, non-financial companies, and households, along with the lowinterest environment and recovering house prices. Following a drop by over 50 percent, they are
currently growing by 10 percent and are closing in on the 2008 peak in nominal terms, but in real
terms or relative to wages they remain 30 and 40 percent lower, respectively.

B. Outlook and Risks
9.
Growth should reach 1.6 percent in 2015, pick up to 2.5 percent in 2016, and average
2.8 percent during 2015–20. Robust consumption growth should continue, residential construction
is already picking up in response to rising house prices, and investment should benefit from
strengthening credit growth and increased availability of EU funds. Russia’s export demand should
bottom out after declining sharply, thereby reducing the drag on growth. Medium-term prospects
are predicated on potential growth being lifted by the implementation of the government’s progrowth policies. Inflation should rise with euro-area wide inflation, retain a small premium typical of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

catching-up economies, and be boosted by between ½ and 1 ppt each year during 2016–19 on
account of excise tax hikes. The current account is likely to move into moderate deficit as investment
recovers and unusually low imports in 2015:H1 dissipate.
10.
Risks to the outlook are predominantly to the downside. A slower recovery in the euro
area or unanticipated further declines in the Russian economy would both pose risks to Estonia’s
exports. Direct effects from global financial turmoil would likely be limited considering the absence
of marketable public debt, Estonia’s small financial markets, and euro area membership. But potential
spillovers through the Nordic banks that account for much of Estonia’s financial sector could curtail
credit supply. On the domestic front, strongly rising wages could dent competitiveness. If the
government’s pro-growth policies are not fully implemented or fail to have the expected effects,
medium-term growth could be lower and undermine income convergence.
11.
The authorities broadly agreed with the outlook and saw risks mainly in external
conditions and strong wage growth. Macroeconomic growth projections by the Ministry of
Finance for budget purposes are close to those of staff, while the summer forecast of the Bank of
Estonia was somewhat more optimistic. There was agreement that private consumption would
remain the main engine of growth and that the external drag would diminish. The external
environment remains a risk and export diversification to offset losses in Russia will take time. The
authorities saw wage growth in excess of productivity as a risk to competitiveness if it were to
continue for much longer. However, the authorities underscored that wage developments were
largely outside the government’s control and were also influenced by the much higher pay in
Finland, which is only a short commute away. They were not overly concerned about direct financial
spillovers through Nordic banks, but stressed that a house price or financial shock to the Nordic
economies would simultaneously hit Estonian exporters and their financial standing. Developments
in the domestic housing market are also on the authorities’ radar screen.

Box 1. Estonia: External Stability Assessment
The EBA-lite methodology concludes that Estonia should normally run a current account deficit rather
than the surplus that is projected for this year. However, the gap between the actual current account
balance and its norm can be largely explained by a number of special and transitory factors. The special
factors make the gap appear larger than it really is. Temporary factors should automatically wash out over
time and diminish the gap without significant exchange rate adjustment.



Policies contribute little to the gap, though there is some room to relax fiscal policy.



Three main factors overstate the strength of the actual current account:

 As a specific feature of Estonia related to the corporate income tax regime, profit remittance of
foreign firms often takes the form of discrete “superdividend” payments every few years. This year,
they amounted to 2 percent of GDP. Unlike regular profit remittances, they are classified as negative
FDI rather than a debit in the current account. Its balance hence appears better than it really is.

 The current account balance in 2015 likely benefitted from a drawdown of inventories that satisfied
buoyant private consumption in lieu of imports. This is not sustainable and therefore improves the
current account balance only temporarily.

 Eventually, EU funds will decline and support the current account by less. Estonia receives about
2¼ percent of GDP in EU funds in the 2014–20 programming period per year on average, but the
available amount could be significantly smaller under the next Multiannual Financial Framework.



Two main factors understate the cyclically-adjusted current account norm:

 Important legacies of Estonia’s boom-bust cycle are not picked up by the cyclical correction in the
EBA-lite exercise. Very high investment in the boom phase is offset by unusually low investment
currently —the investment ratio in 2015 is some 4½ percent of GDP below its historical average.
With domestic absorption and imports of machinery and equipment lower, the current account
balance is better until these legacies run their course.

 In the case of Estonia, the EBA-lite current account norm may not accurately capture demographic
effects. High dependency ratios are usually associated with low savings, but in former transition
economies the old may not have much savings to draw on. And low future replacement rates under
Estonia’s public pension system may induce higher savings by the currently young than elsewhere.
Limited dissaving by the old and high saving by the young imply a better current account than in
other countries with similar demographics. An alternative approach to reflecting demographics in the
current account norm would raise it by 1.6 percent of GDP to -2.2 percent of GDP.*

Exchange rate assessments based on different methodologies also conclude that the real effective
exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. Models based on medium-term equilibrium
current account balance point to a small undervaluation, while direct assessment of the equilibrium real
exchange rate suggests an overvaluation.

—————————

*Demographic parameters (dependency ratio and aging speed) contribute -2.3 percent of GDP to the EBA-lite current account
norm. Models taking into account population growth and the interaction between dependency and aging calculate a much lower
contribution of -0.6 percent of GDP.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between
10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of
risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may
interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize
within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
With recently sluggish growth and a challenging demographic outlook, the consultation focused on the
economy’s medium growth potential and policies—including potentially fiscal ones—to lift it. The
implications for competitiveness of a tight labor market also featured prominently. The main financial
sector issues related to spillover risks from cross-border banking and the effectiveness of the
macroprudential tool kit.

A. Securing Strong Growth Potential2
12.
Estonia’s long-term growth record is impressive, but the main growth engines are
losing steam. Growth since 1995 averaged 4.4 percent per year—together with Lithuania the highest
rate in CEE. But growth has come down sharply in recent years and, while external adversities played
a role, potential growth is estimated to have fallen to 2¼ percent annually during 2011–14. Total
factor productivity (TFP) growth declined to 0.8 percent annually, as relatively “easy” productivity
gains from sectoral reallocation, imitation, and upgrading in the nontradable sector have been
increasingly exhausted. With capital-output ratios higher and investment ratios lower, capital
formation also contributed less than in the past.
13.
Considerable effort will be needed to secure strong and sustainable growth for the
long haul. One challenge is to cope with demographic headwinds and make the most of a workingage population whose rate of decline will triple to almost 1 percent a year. Raising TFP growth
requires structural transformation of an economy that still relies heavily on low-to-medium
technology industries with limited absorptive capacity of spillovers from the frontier. More fully
restoring Estonia’s traditionally high investment and ensuring its efficient use will also be important.
Three scenarios illustrate possible quantitative outcomes for potential growth over the next two
decades.


The central scenario puts potential growth at 2.9 percent during 2015–20 and 2.7 percent over
the longer horizon. It assumes that government’s pro-growth policies will lift TFP growth slightly
above the 2001–14 average, enhance the labor force, and boost investment. Income convergence
with Western Europe will continue, but at only about half its historical pace.



A pessimistic scenario with growth averaging just 2.4 percent during 2015–20 and 2.2 percent
over the longer horizon, reflecting a more modest pickup in TFP growth and investment, which
could arise for example if the planned measures are less effective than expected or are not
implemented as comprehensively as envisioned.



A stretch scenario that would require a combination of higher TFP growth and investment and
rapid convergence toward the labor force participation rates of Sweden—the highest in the EU—
to secure growth of 3.7 percent over the longer horizon.

14.
Estonia’s current policy setting is conducive to growth and additional supporting
programs are planned. They should go a long way toward mitigating the forces that weigh on
future growth, thereby underpinning the central scenario.


Among the current attractions, Estonia already has one of the most business friendly
environments according to the World Bank’s Doing Business Report or the World Economic
Forum’s Competitiveness Ranking and highest public investment ratios in the region. Its
educational standards are also high. Government policies put an emphasis on promoting R&D
and ICT. Almost all classrooms were connected to the internet as far back as 1998. Estonia is a
leader in providing integrated electronic government services and is home to a number of
prominent IT startups. Private companies can draw on the expertise of government-supported
“competence centers” for advice in six scientific areas.



A number of new initiatives are under preparation, mostly in the context of the new
programming period for EU funds. Enterprise support is to be revamped to put more emphasis
on innovation and entrepreneurship, increasingly backed by financial instruments rather than
grants. Life-long learning is set for an upgrade under a new strategy. Already adopted legislation
on “work capacity reform” seeks to put more disability pensioners to work, who currently make
up 10 percent of Estonia’s working age population. Further state reforms are also on the agenda,
to consolidate the large number of local governments, merge central government agencies,
enhance e-government to reap efficiency gains, and reduce government employment in line with
the shrinking working age population.

15.
Yet, Estonia has room to further enhance pro-growth policies. This would help bring
potential growth closer to the rates in the stretch scenario. In the short run, the government should
concentrate on getting the planned new initiatives off the ground and making them a success. But to
support implementation, which exhibited some deficiencies in the past, and boost the effectiveness
of existing and new programs, it will also be critical to now start strengthening the operational policy
focus on fostering productivity growth. Boosting productivity should be articulated as the
overarching economic policy objective. A strong unit in the Prime Minister’s office should be
mandated with overseeing implementation through line ministries; evaluating the relative merits of
programs in terms of their contribution to productivity growth; scaling back ineffective programs,
boosting successful ones, and initiating promising new initiatives; and keeping track of government
spending on productivity support.

A number of programs could be scaled up and expanded in scope.



In the area of human resources, more resources could be devoted to life-long learning, to
address deficiencies in adult skills and help raise the effective retirement age. Spending has been
very small in the past and will remain below 0.3 percent of GDP even under the new strategy.
Spending on active labor market programs currently stands at just 0.4 percent of GDP and
planned increases will go predominantly toward implementation of the work capacity reform.
The envisaged strengthening of apprenticeship programs to around 800 participants could go
further. It would also be important to raise the statutory retirement age further once the ongoing
increase to 65 years is fully phased in by 2026, to bring female labor force participation rates
closer to those of Europe’s best performers, including by improving child care provision, and to
consider increased reliance on foreign labor.



In the area of innovation support, the planned new Company Development Program will cover
only up to 300-400 out of the over 60,000 companies currently operating in Estonia. More
generally, Estonia’s RDI polices follow very much a science-based approach, which risks leaving
behind the more traditional sectors that still make up the bulk of employment and value-added
creation in the economy. Supporting the upgrading of traditional industries as a second leg of
innovation policies should be considered. Also, RDI programs are currently almost fully financed
from EU funds. Mobilizing more own funds is imperative for long-term sustainability and would
increase flexibility, for example in terms of maximum support for projects and international
initiatives, such as cross-border clusters, which are well suited for a small country like Estonia.



In the area of capital formation, high investment has
served Estonia well. It should be maintained, including in
the government sector, considering that Estonia’s capital
stock per worker is still much lower than in Western
Europe. In this context, the Rail Baltica project, further
upgrading of the road network, and efforts to improve
the intermodality in the transport sector are welcome.
R&D expenditure is on par with the EU average, but it is
a concern that investment in intellectual property rights,
which covers R&D expenditure and also technology
imports, is relatively low.

was the main economic policy challenge. Growth potential seems to have indeed slowed
materially in recent years and the high growth rates of the boom years are in any case not a valid
reference point for the period ahead. But the authorities noted that adverse external conditions were
likely also partly responsible for the recent spell of low growth. Moreover, potential growth
calculations are complicated by uncertainties in the measurement of capital accumulation, with
measured investment in Estonia curiously much higher than in neighboring countries without
seemingly delivering materially better growth. With investment potentially overstated, productivity
growth could have been better, implying brighter prospects for the future. Overall, the authorities
estimate long-term potential growth to be in the range of 3 to 4 percent per year.

18.
Growth-supporting policies are important, with the authorities confident that the
existing and planned measures broadly covered all the bases and would deliver important
gains. They saw compensating for adverse demographics and moving to a more sophisticated
output mix as the main challenges. The environment is generally conducive and the new initiatives
will fill most of the remaining gaps, in their view, which they saw as underscoring the importance of
implementation. They agreed that domestic resources would need to mitigate the eventual decline
of EU funds. They are considering broadening the training mandate of the Unemployment Insurance
Fund beyond those unemployed or at imminent risk of losing their jobs. Improving child care
support will also need attention in order to boost female labor supply. While the authorities agreed
that the upgrading of Estonia’s traditional industries was central, some counterparts were doubtful
whether this was a task for the government. But they stressed that universities are important
conduits of innovation and that the government should ensure the appropriate availability of
financial instruments for the private sector.

B. Aiming for Stability and Growth Support in Public Finances
19.
The 2015 budget is headed for another surplus. Thanks to a revenue-friendly composition
of growth and further improvements in tax administration, a small surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP is
likely, compared to a budgeted deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP. Corporate income tax collection
received an unanticipated boost worth ½ percent of GDP from a superdividend distribution by
Swedbank, but the effect on the budget balance will effectively be moved into 2016 because of an
offsetting postponement of dividend payments by state-owned enterprises. Investment is lagging
behind plan because of delays in unlocking EU funds, but with a strong effort in the remainder of the
year it could still come close to last year’s level and reach 4.9 percent of GDP. The structural surplus
should decline somewhat to 0.8 percent of GDP, exerting a timely fiscal stimulus.
20.
The 2016 draft budget envisages labor tax cuts and more generous family benefits
financed by excise tax hikes, as well as higher investment. These measures are part of a multiyear plan to lighten the labor tax burden, especially for low-income earners, and provide relief to
families with children, all paid for by higher excises on energy, alcohol, and tobacco. They provide a
welcome reduction of the labor tax wedge. Investment would climb to 5.3 percent of GDP next year
as the new Multiannual Financial Framework for EU funds comes fully on stream. The budget surplus
should increase to 0.5 percent of GDP. But, due to the one-off nature of revenues related to the
superdividend, the structural surplus is projected to decline to 0.5 percent of GDP—which would
provide a useful moderate fiscal stimulus as insurance against the downside risks in the growth
forecast.
21.
Estonia’s public finances are guided by a strict fiscal rule. The State Budget Act mandates
the budget to be at least in structural balance annually. However, in practice the rule generates
surpluses because of an asymmetric correction mechanism—deficits need to be compensated by
subsequent surpluses while surpluses generate no “credit” that can be spent later on—and because
uncertainties in budget execution and structural balance calculations prompt policy makers to build

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

in safety margins and target ex-ante surpluses. Indeed, Estonia’s latest Stability Programme
envisages structural budget surpluses through the medium term.
22.
Estonia should consider deploying fiscal space to finance additional measures in
support of productivity growth while preserving fiscal prudence. With Estonia’s public finances
already exceptionally strong, promoting productivity growth should at the margin be the higher
priority than strengthening the fiscal position further.


In the shorter run, room under the existing fiscal rule should be utilized. This could be
achieved by implementing the fiscal rule so that budgets are close to structural balance each
year and on average in structural balance over a multi-year period, rather than systematically in
structural surplus. For 2016, the focus should be on fully executing the budget, especially
regarding investment and the planned pro-growth measures. The government should not
hesitate to pre-finance these outlays from domestic sources if it takes longer than expected to
access EU-funds that are envisaged to finance them, thereby running down the projected
structural surplus.



In the longer term, a moderate relaxation of the fiscal rule could be considered, to unlock
additional resources for the promotion of productivity growth or to compensate for declining EU
funds. The rule could be aligned with European rules that allow for medium-term objectives of
up to a deficit of 1 percent of GDP for countries with strong public finances, such as Estonia.

For both the shorter and the longer run, it will be important to ensure that fiscal resources are
indeed used for the intended purpose. It is therefore crucial that the accounting and monitoring of
productivity promoting programs is strengthened first, for example in the context of the
establishment of the strong dedicated productivity unit in the Prime Minister’s office.
23.
The authorities stated that Estonia’s fiscal framework should not be changed anytime
soon and maintained that a structural balance should remain a target for fiscal policy. They
had a somewhat more conservative take on likely near-term fiscal developments, projecting a
balanced budget for this year and a deficit of 0.1 percent of GDP for 2016. Regarding the fiscal rule,
they underscored that strong fiscal discipline has been a feature of Estonia’s fiscal policy that long
predated European fiscal rules. Fiscal reserves were instrumental in successfully steering Estonia
through the crisis of 2008/09. Reopening the debate on the fiscal rule that was only introduced in
2014 was considered premature. With regard to increasing productivity-promoting spending, the
authorities noted that they prioritize spending that increases productivity, highlighting that Estonia’s
public investment has been one of the highest in the EU. They argued that productivity-promoting
spending can be increased further, even without changing the current fiscal rule. Furthermore, EU
funds are already being re-directed toward innovation in the new programming period. They argued
against weakening of the fiscal rule, which they considered too risky given the high volatility of
growth and fiscal revenues. However, some counterparts conceded that the surplus bias in the fiscal
rule was unintended and that there may be a case to revisit the fiscal rule once EU funds decline, but
this is many years away and does not warrant opening a discussion at this juncture.

C. Remaining Competitive As Labor Markets Tighten
24.
The labor market is tightening. Labor market entries are declining with the population
aged 20–29 years shrinking by over 2 percent a year since 2012. Wage convergence with
neighboring Finland also contributes to pressures. Over the last 36 months the unemployment rate
has fallen by 4 ppts and real wages increased by 4.6 percent per year on average. Increases pervade
all sectors of the economy.
25.
The current pace of wage increases is unsustainable. While current real wage growth is
not materially higher than the average since 2002, GDP and productivity growth are now lower.
Minimum wage hikes are steep—40 percent over the past three years and 10 percent each for 2016
and 2017 already agreed. The minimum wage will reach 42 percent of the average wage by then and
could increasingly weigh on formal-sector employment prospects of the low-skilled, in less
developed regions, or labor-intensive industries. Minimum wages are negotiated between unions
and employer associations, but government representatives attend the negotiations, the unionemployer agreement is extended to the whole economy by government decree, and minimum wage
issues feature prominently in political discourse, with the current coalition agreement proposing that
social partners raise it to at least 45 percent of the average wage over four years. Public sector wages
have also increased disproportionately in recent years and now command an unusually high
premium over average wages, although their growth may moderate next year, with the central
government granting wage increases only to selected groups of employees. In this context, it will be
important to guard against minimum wage hikes unduly spilling over and pushing broader wage
growth ahead of productivity growth.

Currently Estonia’s external position is solid and the exchange rate broadly in line with
fundamentals, but there is a risk for prospects in the tradable sector to become clouded and

effect come to fruition.
27.
The authorities agreed that the current wedge between wage and productivity growth
was unsustainable. Wage developments of recent years were supporting household incomes, but

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

were also eroding companies’ buffers and could soon start denting competitiveness. Nonetheless,
the authorities project that wage growth will come down only very gradually going forward because
labor supply shortages will persist. Wage developments may induce companies to invest in laborsaving technologies and gradually move out of labor-intensive industries. In this spirit the
government’s planned state reforms seek to economize on labor and reduce public employment,
which should help alleviate the squeeze on the private sector. The authorities explained that large
hikes in the minimum wage were motivated by their low levels coming out of the crisis and the
perceived need to bring them closer to average wages. In their view, minimum wage developments
are largely outside the government’s control, with government essentially only endorsing what social
partners negotiate.

D. Tailoring Financial Sector Policies to Estonia’s Needs
28.
Financial risks are primarily external and are mitigated by strong domestic and foreign
lines of defense. Nordic cross-border banks dominate the financial sector and are exposed to a
range of risks, especially in their home property markets and in wholesale funding markets, but they
also have strong lines of defense. Estonian affiliates have large capital and liquidity buffers. Reduced
parent-bank funding further adds to their resilience. Nonetheless, potential shocks could adversely

affect credit supply in Estonia and simultaneously lead to a

deterioration of the quality of loans taken out by Estonian
exporters operating in the Nordic region. It will therefore be

important to remain vigilant and continue close cooperation
with home-country authorities. The Nordic-Baltic Financial

Stability Group should be revitalized and secure appropriate
involvement of the ECB, which directly supervises the two

but are closely supervised to monitor their soundness.
29.
Estonia’s framework for financial sector oversight has undergone important upgrades.
The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive has been transposed, with the Financial Supervision
Authority as the designated resolution authority. Recovery and resolution plans for the large banks
have not yet been drafted, pending the transposition of the directive in Sweden. The government has
approved a new deposit insurance law based on the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive. The
liquidity coverage ratio and the capital conservation buffer have been implemented, bringing total
capital requirements to 12.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. The countercyclical capital buffer is
currently set to zero, but a framework for assessment, coordination with the ECB, and
communication is in place. A comprehensive set of macroprudential tools is operational—maximum
loan-to-value and debt-service-to-income ratios have already been set, though at currently barely

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

binding levels. These tools also apply to foreign branches. Oversight of consumer lending companies
is being strengthened through a licensing requirement from March 2016.
30.
Traction of macroprudential tools can also benefit from close cooperation with homecountry authorities. Deployment of macroprudential tools at more aggressive levels is not currently
called for, but their traction in the next credit upswing may be complicated by banks’
overcapitalization and the dominance of foreign-owned affiliates. Mortgage lending appears well
covered, unless mortgages were booked at headquarters abroad rather than locally. Controlling
corporate loans could be more challenging, considering capital requirements that are far from
binding and the possibility to book them abroad. Support from home-country authorities in the form
of moral suasion and reciprocity of capital requirements beyond the provisions in the Capital
Requirement Directive IV may be helpful.
31.
The authorities broadly shared this risk assessment and intend to continue with the
close Nordic-Baltic cooperation. Financial soundness is bolstered by high capitalization, ample
liquidity, and low non-performing loan ratios. Small banks with riskier business models are closely
monitored and supervisors report they are financially sound. The authorities view the current pace of
credit expansion at close to nominal GDP growth as near optimal. Supervisors agreed that there were
spillover risks from Nordic banks, but were not overly concerned and thought that the trade channel
might be more important than the credit supply channel. They were also keeping a close eye on
housing prices, but agreed that mortgage lending is not behind recent price increases. They
recognized that there has indeed been a hiatus in the activities of the Nordic-Baltic Financial Stability
Group, but argued that this reflects disruptions from the establishment of the banking union and
that activities would resume. ECB supervisors may choose to be represented indirectly through the
national competent authorities, they added. The authorities took note of potential leakages of
macroprudential tools, but thought that they should be minimal in the case of mortgages.

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
The economy has been holding up reasonably well in the face of difficult and uncertain
external conditions. Growth is likely to decelerate to 1.6 percent this year, reflecting recession in
Russia and stagnation in Finland, two important destinations for Estonian exporters. It should pick up
to 2.5 percent in 2016 as the external drag diminishes and private consumption remains robust on
the back of strong wage growth. Risks are mainly to the downside and relate to the external
environment.
33.
Yet, sluggish growth in recent years likely also reflects a decline in potential growth.
Since 1995, Estonia has achieved the highest average growth in Central and Eastern Europe, but
potential growth is estimated to have averaged only 2¼ percent a year during 2011–14. Going
forward, worsening demographics, diminishing options for “easy” productivity gains, and reduced
scope for capital accumulation will be additional headwinds. As a result, convergence with living
standards in Western Europe could slow markedly.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

34.
This makes policies to lift potential growth the primary economic policy imperative.
While Estonia clearly faces headwinds, it also has many assets: macroeconomic and institutional
fundamentals are very strong; the business climate is amongst the most favorable in the region;
educational standards are high; technology and science are being promoted; and Estonia is a leader
in e-government. A range of further commendable reforms is under preparation in the context of the
new programming period for EU funds, including revamped enterprise support with more emphasis
on innovation and entrepreneurship, a new life-long learning strategy, a “work capacity reform”
seeking to put more disability pensioners to work, and reforms to streamline local and central
governments.
35.
Additional growth-promoting measures could be considered. In the short-run, the focus
should be on getting the planned new initiatives off the ground. It will also be critical to now start
strengthening the operational policy focus on fostering productivity growth. To that effect, a strong
productivity unit in the Prime Minister’s office could be established to oversee implementation,
evaluate and adjust programs, and keep track of government spending on productivity promotion.
Over time, existing programs should be scaled up—active labor market programs, life-long learning,
enterprise support, and apprenticeship programs are still rather limited in size. Supporting the
upgrading of traditional industries as a second leg of innovation policies should also be considered
as these industries account for the bulk of employment and value creation in the economy.
36.
Estonia’s public finances are exceptionally strong and fiscal space could be used to
support productivity-enhancing programs. With no net public debt and structural fiscal surpluses
since 2009, there is room for additional spending to promote productivity growth rather than
accumulate more fiscal reserves. But it will be important to ensure that these fiscal resources are truly
used for their intended purpose by keeping close tabs on them, for instance in the productivity unit
in the Prime Minister’s office. Once in place, fiscal space could be accessed while remaining in
compliance with Estonia’s stringent fiscal rule by producing budgets that are on average in structural
balance rather than systematically in surplus. In the longer run, the rule itself could be made more
flexible and allow modest structural deficits in line with European requirements while preserving
overall prudent fiscal policy.
37.
Estonia’s external position is solid, but wage growth far in excess of productivity
growth is starting to cloud the outlook for the tradable sector. Company profits have lately been
falling and export market share gains have begun to peter out. This further underscores the centrality
of raising productivity, but wage growth also needs to come down to a more sustainable pace. In this
context, the more moderate wage increases envisaged in the central government’s 2016 draft
budget send a prudent message. The government should also make clear to social partners that the
steep minimum wage increases since 2013 risk becoming counterproductive and cannot set the pace
for general wage developments.
38.
Impressive soundness indicators and further upgrades to oversight frameworks
underpin financial sector stability. The return to moderate private sector credit growth is a positive
development. Risks reside mainly abroad. They could be transmitted to Estonia through the cross-

20

border banks that dominate Estonia’s financial system and through trade channels, but domestic and
foreign lines of defense are also strong. Nonetheless, close cooperation with home-country
authorities remains important and existing Nordic Baltic platforms should be revitalized. Cooperation
could also help strengthen the traction of macroprudential instruments should they need to be
deployed in the next upswing in the financial cycle.
39.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

Estonia has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4 of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system free of multiple currency practices and
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for
those measures imposed for security reasons in accordance with Regulations of the Council of the
European Union, as notified to the Executive Board in accordance with Decision No. 144-(52/51). An
updated and comprehensive list of all EU restrictions can be found at:
http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/cfsp/sanctions/measures.htm
Article IV Consultation: Estonia is on the 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation
was concluded on May 5, 2014. The Executive Board assessment is available at:
http://www.imf.org/external/country/EST/index.htm
FSAP Participation and ROSCs: A review under the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was
completed at the time of the 2000 Article IV Consultation. Further Reports on Observance of Standards
and Codes (ROSC) modules were discussed in the 2001 Article IV Consultations and updated during
the 2002 Consultation. A FAD mission concluded a fiscal transparency ROSC in January 2009 and an
FSAP update was completed in February 2009.
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT): MONEYVAL’s report
on the 4th round assessment of Estonia adopted in September 2014, which is a follow-up round on the
2003 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standard, highlighted the authorities’ progress in
strengthening the AML/CFT legal and supervisory frameworks, specifically development of a risk-based
approach to determine priorities for AML/CFT activities, amendments to the financing of terrorism
offence, and the establishment of the Economic Crime Bureau. The report notes some remaining
deficiencies, in particular with respect to the sanctioning regime for AML/CFT breaches and the
transparency of legal persons. The authorities are addressing these issues and also working on
ensuring compatibility of the widespread use of information technology, including in the context of
their “e-Residency” initiative, and AML/CFT requirements. The FATF standard and methodology have
been revised in 2012 and 2013 respectively, placing a greater emphasis on the implementation of a
risk-based approach and on assessing the effectiveness of the AML/CFT regime. Estonia is tentatively
scheduled to undergo an assessment against the prevailing standard in 2020.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
General: Estonia’s data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes. A May 2001
data ROSC mission found that the quality of macroeconomic statistics was generally good. The 2009
fiscal transparency ROSC indicated that Estonia now meets nearly all of the requirements of the
transparency code, and approached best international practice in some areas. Estonia subscribed to
the SDDS on September 30, 1998, with metadata posted on the DSSB on January 27, 1999, and met
SDDS specifications on March 30, 2000. The latest (2010) annual observance report for Estonia for
the SDDS was posted on the Fund’s website in May 2011:
(http://dsbb.imf.org/images/pdfs/AnnualReports/2010/EST_SDDS_AR2010.pdf)
SDDS webpage for EST: http://dsbb.imf.org/Pages/SDDS/CtyCtgList.aspx?ctycode=EST
National Accounts: The national accounts are compiled by Statistics Estonia (SE) in accordance with
the guidelines of the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010). Quarterly GDP estimates at
current and at constant prices are compiled using the production, income and expenditure
approaches. The annual and the quarterly national accounts are compiled at previous year prices
and chain-linked to 2010, using double deflation. As of September 2011, data are compiled on the
basis of the new version of classification of activities EMTAK 2008. However, often large statistical
discrepancies between headline GDP and its expenditure components and significant GDP data
revisions (especially those effected in 2014) complicate economic analysis.
