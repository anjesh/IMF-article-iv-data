April 9, 2004
•

The 2004 Article IV Consultation and first Post-Program Monitoring discussions were held
in Jakarta during February 24–March 5. The mission met with Coordinating Minister for
Economic Affairs Dorodjatun Kuntjoro-Jakti, Coordinating Minister for Social Affairs Yusuf
Kalla, Minister of Finance Boediono, Minister of Trade and Industry Rini Soewandi, Bank
Indonesia Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah, other senior officials, parliamentarians and
representatives of civil society and the private sector.

•

The staff team comprised Messrs. Citrin (head), Schwartz, Bingham, Bhundia, and Wolfson
(all APD), Baldacci (FAD), Tadesse (PDR), and Federici (LEG), and was assisted by
Messrs. Nellor, Khatri, and Taylor of the Fund’s Jakarta office. Ms. Indrawati (OED) also
attended many of the meetings. The mission worked closely with an overlapping MFD
technical assistance mission, and with the World Bank and AsDB.

•

Indonesia’s Extended Arrangement (SDR 3.6 billion) expired on December 31, 2003. All
available purchases were made, and total outstanding obligations to the Fund currently
amount to SDR 6.8 billion (Annex I). Under the existing repayment schedule (expectations
basis), outstanding obligations to the Fund would remain above 100 percent of quota until
August 2008.

•

The last Article IV Consultation took place in April 2002. At the conclusion of the eleventh
and final review of the Extended Arrangement (December 19, 2003), Directors welcomed the
progress that had been made under the four-year arrangement. They were encouraged that
sustained policy implementation had contributed to an ongoing improvement in
macroeconomic performance, but noted that a durable recovery was yet to take hold. They
urged the authorities to maintain investor confidence through continued sound policies, and
to act vigorously to strengthen the investment climate to enable Indonesia to realize its
economic potential.

•

Indonesia has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, and maintains an exchange system
free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.

•

Indonesia is in compliance with the SDDS, but there are a number of data weaknesses that
hamper effective surveillance (Annex II). In particular, fiscal data is of uneven quality, and
key components of the balance of payments need to be strengthened. Efforts are underway to
address these data shortcomings.

-3EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

The Article IV consultation provided a timely opportunity to assess achievements
under recent Fund arrangements and to take stock of remaining challenges. While
significant progress has been made in restoring macroeconomic stability and
implementing key areas of the structural reform agenda, notably in rehabilitating the
banking sector, Indonesia’s overall economic performance has lagged behind others in
the region.

•

Economic developments and policies in the coming months are likely to be
influenced by the protracted electoral cycle. Parliamentary elections were held on
April 5, and will be followed by the Presidential election in July, with a possible second
round to take place in September. The electoral process has proceeded relatively
smoothly and peacefully so far.

•

Assuming that market confidence can be sustained, economic performance is
expected to strengthen in 2004. Growth is expected to pick up to 4.8 percent and
inflation should remain subdued at around 5 percent. Notwithstanding the absence of
exceptional financing from the Fund and Paris Club, the external position should remain
comfortable, with reserve cover staying at over 150 percent of short-term debt.

Key Issues and Staff Recommendations
•

The discussions focused on policies to strengthen Indonesia’s growth prospects. The
emphasis was on identifying a set of policy actions to bolster competitiveness and growth
that the authorities could implement even in an election environment. To this end, the
mission recommended that the government focus on measures to address weaknesses in
taxation and regulation, labor market uncertainties, and weaknesses in the legal system.

•

Maintaining macroeconomic stability and continuing the restructuring of the
financial sector will also be key. In this context the discussions focused on the
following:
¾ Monetary policy. The mission urged Bank Indonesia to maintain a firm monetary
stance during the election period, and to proceed cautiously with further reductions in
interest rates.
¾ Fiscal policy. The mission noted that there was a risk that the 2004 deficit target of
1.3 percent of GDP could be exceeded, unless non-oil revenues pick up. The
authorities stressed their determination to bolster revenue collections to ensure that
the deficit target is met.
¾ Financial sector reform. State bank reform remains a priority, given the sector’s
large size and weak asset quality. The mission urged the authorities to monitor closely
the business plans of the state banks, to ensure sound lending practices. Over the
longer term the staff encouraged the authorities to press ahead with the transfer of
these banks to private sector management. The mission was encouraged by the
progress being made to develop a robust financial sector safety net.

-4I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Indonesia’s extended arrangement concluded at end-2003, bringing to a close six
years of Fund-supported programs since the Asian financial crisis.1 The programs can
claim a number of important successes, particularly over the past few years when greater
political stability facilitated policy implementation (Box 1). The macroeconomic situation
was stabilized, the fiscal position placed on a sustainable path, and external vulnerability
reduced. Good progress was also made in key areas of structural reform, notably in
rehabilitating the banking sector.
2.
Despite the gains in macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms,
Indonesia’s overall economic performance has lagged behind others in the region
(Chart 1). In particular, GDP growth, investment, and exports have continued to perform
poorly when set against the experience of other Asian economies (Figures 1 and 2). Further
structural reforms are needed to enhance the investment climate and raise growth prospects
sufficiently to reduce unemployment and make further inroads in poverty alleviation.

The Article IV consultation discussions provided a timely opportunity to assess
recent policy achievements and to take stock of the remaining challenges.2 The
discussions focused in particular on policies to strengthen Indonesia’s growth prospects. In
addition to maintaining macroeconomic stability, it remains essential to continue
restructuring the financial sector, and to implement further structural reforms to bolster
competitiveness and enhance the investment climate.

1

The extended arrangement was approved in February 2000, and was extended by an
additional year in early 2002. It replaced an extended arrangement approved in August 1998,
which in turn succeeded a stand-by arrangement that was approved in November 1997.

The accompanying Selected Issues paper provides an in-depth discussion of policy
outcomes and key challenges.

-5-

Box 1. The Economic Recovery Strategy (1998–2003)
The economic recovery strategy was formulated in 1998 against the background of deep crisis.
Initial efforts at stabilization and economic reform supported by the November 1997 stand-by
arrangement had failed to take root. The economy in early 1998 was under severe financial stress,
reflected most notably in a freefall of the rupiah and a rapid acceleration in inflation (Text Figure 1). The
banking system had imploded, the corporate sector was insolvent, crushed by its external debt burden,
and output had collapsed (GDP had fallen by 13 percent, the sharpest such decline of the crisis-stricken
Asian economies). Poverty was rising rapidly as a result.
80

The immediate priorities were to stabilize the
macroeconomic situation and lay the basis for a
recovery in economic activity. The principal
macroeconomic objectives were to break inflation,
reduce external vulnerability and restore economic
growth. Public finances also had to be placed back
on a sustainable footing, as restructuring the
banking system while preserving the public’s
deposits had resulted in a huge increase in public
debt.

A number of fundamental structural weaknesses
needed to be addressed to secure these objectives. In addition to securing adequate recoveries from
bank assets taken over during the crisis, the key strategic objectives were to restore a functioning
banking system and resolve the debt overhang in the corporate sector.
Five years on, there have been a number of important successes:
•

The macroeconomic situation has stabilized. The exchange rate has recovered from a crisis low of
Rp 16,000 per dollar and has remained in a narrow range of Rp 8,300-8,600 per dollar since
July 2003. Inflation has declined sharply to mid-single digits and interest rates have fallen
correspondingly.

•

Progress has been made in restoring a sustainable budget situation. Reforms to reduce subsidies
and raise non-oil revenues have halved the budget deficit to 2¼ percent of GDP, and public debt has
declined to around 65 percent of GDP from a peak of 100 percent.

•

External vulnerability has been reduced. A substantial build-up in reserves has significantly
increased the reserve coverage to 7½ months of imports. External debt has been halved to around
60 percent of GDP.

Progress has also been made in key areas of structural reform. After a slow start, IBRA asset
recoveries accelerated, reaching Rp 163 trillion by the time of its closure in February, and the
government has divested all but one of the banks taken over during the crisis. The banking system’s
fundamentals have been strengthened (although vulnerabilities remain, especially among state banks)
and the process of establishing a robust financial infrastructure is advancing. An independent central
bank is in place, bank supervision is being overhauled and a new financial safety net is well on the way
to being established.
Nevertheless , the economic recovery has not been robust enough to ensure a sustained reduction
in poverty and unemployment. Slow progress in addressing underlying structural weaknesses has
impeded the development of the institutions needed for a stable and efficient market-based economy,
and contributed to the sluggish recovery. In particular, legal and judicial reforms have lagged; despite
recent advances, tax administration remains inconsistent and nontransparent; and corruption and weak
governance remains a major source of concern.

-64.
The discussions took place in the context of strong market sentiment and an
improvement in macroeconomic indicators, but with some uncertainty relating to the
forthcoming parliamentary and presidential elections. Indeed, economic developments
and policies through much of 2004 are likely to be influenced by the protracted electoral
cycle. Campaigning for parliamentary elections (held on April 5) began in early March; the
presidential election is scheduled for early July, with a possible second round to take place in
September if no candidate wins an outright majority of votes in the first round. The electoral
process has been proceeding relatively smoothly so far, although there is still a possibility
that political tensions could escalate in the months ahead. The new government is scheduled
to take office on October 20.
II. ECONOMIC SETTING AND OUTLOOK
Economic setting
5.
Short-term financial market indicators have continued to improve, although
there have been some signs of cooling off as the elections approach (Figure 3 and
Chart 2). The rupiah has remained in a relatively narrow range against the U.S. dollar, at
around Rp 8,300–8,600 since mid-2003, and the stock market reached a new high in late
February (up 80 percent since end-2002) before leveling off in line with recent regional and
global trends. The positive trend in market sentiment was evident in the highly successful
$1 billion sovereign bond issue in early March.3 Domestic bond yields are also declining,
although the yield curve remains relatively steep, reflecting lingering uncertainties over the
economic outlook (Figure 4). Market sentiment weakened somewhat ahead of the elections,
with the stock market falling briefly by almost 10 percent from its peak, but has recovered
following the peaceful election outcome.

Over $4 billion in bids were received for the 10-year issue (the first sovereign issue since
1996). The bonds yielded 6.85 percent, reflecting a spread of some 280 basis points over
comparable US treasury bonds, below the yields achieved for some recent higher-rated
sovereign issues. The issue included a collective action clause.

-76.
Real GDP growth edged up to 4.1 percent in 2003, slightly above earlier
projections (Table 1, Figure 5, and Chart 3). The economy proved resilient to a number of
shocks, including the regional impact of SARS early in the year, and the lingering effects of
the Bali bombing in October 2002 (tourist

While base money growth accelerated at the
end of 2003 (exceeding the end-year projection) this mainly reflected larger-than-anticipated
seasonal effects.
8.
The government’s 2003 fiscal deficit target was exceeded by a small margin, but
public debt ratios have continued to decline (Table 2). The 2003 budget deficit outturn
was 2.3 percent of GDP, somewhat above the 1.9 percent of GDP target in the revised
budget. This outcome was largely due to higher than expected donor-financed development
spending, although shortfalls in non-oil tax revenues also contributed. Nonetheless, public
debt declined to below 70 percent of GDP at end-2003, from 80 percent the previous year.
9.
Sustained current account surpluses and improved capital flows have led to a
reduction in external vulnerability (Tables 3 and 4). The current account surplus reached
$8 billion in 2003 (4 percent of GDP), well above earlier projections, helped in part by high
oil prices. Private capital inflows have strengthened, driven by renewed portfolio inflows,
and greater access to international capital markets among corporations and banks. Gross
reserves increased by about $4 billion in both of 2002 and 2003, and now stand at around
$37 billion, equivalent to 7½ months of imports and about 150 percent of short-term debt.
10.
The ongoing improvement in economic performance has been underpinned by
steady policy implementation. Performance against the EFF’s targets for 2003 was good,
with all four reviews completed on schedule and significant advances made in bank

-8divestment and fiscal reforms.4 The government’s economic strategy for the post-program
period, as set out in the White Paper, has provided continuity in the reform process, with a
number of notable advances achieved so far in 2004. The sale of bank Lippo has been
concluded, a further minority stake in bank Mandiri has been divested, IBRA has completed
operations, and long-delayed amendments to the BI Law have been adopted. More generally,
policy implementation over the past couple of years has been largely in line with Fund
recommendations, with differences mainly limited to the pace of legal and institutional
reforms, and the strategy for privatizing and strengthening state banks.
11.
Nevertheless, Indonesia’s growth performance remains below potential, and the
economy has yet to share fully in Asia’s recovery (Box 2).5 Per capita income remains
below pre-crisis levels, and there has been only limited progress in reducing unemployment
and poverty (Annex III and Box 3). While the social and political turmoil of the crisis period
may have delayed the recovery, slow progress in addressing underlying weaknesses in the
investment climate have also contributed. A particularly sharp fall-off in gross FDI inflows
(to around 2 percent of GDP from 5 percent in the pre-crisis period) has been a factor for the
relatively slow export growth, particularly in manufacturing sectors such as textiles, apparel,
and footwear. While exports to China have grown rapidly (averaging 11 percent over the past
two years), other countries have experienced even stronger growth.
Near-term Outlook
12.
Economic performance is projected to strengthen in 2004, provided that market
confidence can be sustained through the election period. Growth is forecast to pick up to
4.8 percent, sustained by robust consumption

would remain in substantial surplus at about

modest improvements in both official and private flows. In the absence of exceptional

$1 billion during the year, in line with scheduled repayments to the Fund, but should remain

-9Box 2. Indonesia’s Recovery
Indonesia suffered a larger initial fall in GDP during the 1997/98 crisis, and has had a
slower recovery than other Asian crisis
130
economies. The more severe downturn
Figure 1. Per Capita GDP
(1997=100)
was in part the result of adverse political
120
developments during the crisis which led
Korea
to policy uncertainty and economic
110
dislocation. Output was back to pre-crisis
levels only in 2002, lagging other Asian
100
Malaysia
crisis countries by about 1–2 years, and
per capita incomes are still below preThailand
90
crisis levels (Figure 1). At an average of
Indonesia
3–4 percent, economic growth since the

crisis has been significantly below the

levels that are needed to make headway
in reducing poverty and absorb new entrants into the labor market.
The relatively slow recovery has
been characterized by weak
investment and export
performance compared to other
Asian economies (Table 1). Growth
in Indonesia has been narrowly based
on private consumption. In contrast,
export performance has been much
weaker than in other Asian crisis
economies, and investment has also
lagged.

There is no single factor behind the weak investment and export performance. One
important impediment to growth has been the weak investment climate due to shortcomings in
taxation and regulation, labor relations, and the legal system. These weaknesses have also
adversely affected export performance. A collapse in FDI to export sectors since the crisis and
a deterioration in cost competitiveness over the last two years have also undermined export
performance.
Many of the structural weaknesses that need to be addressed were present prior to the
crisis, when growth performance was much stronger. In particular, weaknesses in
governance and in the banking and legal

Box 3. Poverty Developments1
The level of poverty has fallen sharply from its crisis levels (Table 1). The share of the population
below the poverty line (currently about $1.55 per day) has fallen from 27 percent in 1999 to 16 percent in
2002. The reduction in expenditure poverty since the crisis appears to have benefited almost all regions,
including strong recoveries for some regions in the East. Macroeconomic stabilization and readjustment
of relative prices and the exchange rate after the crisis have been key factors in reducing expenditure
poverty.
Nevertheless, poverty remains extensive and
there is a large cluster of households just
above the official poverty line. A large share
of households remain just above the official
poverty line: 7.4 percent of Indonesians fall
under the dollar-a-day poverty line whereas
53.4 percent fall under the two dollars-a-day
poverty line.

disparities in poverty incidence across the
country. While the poverty rates are 15.7 percent and 4 percent on Java and Bali, the Eastern Islands lag,
with poverty rates of 36.8 percent. Despite regional disparities, 78 percent of Indonesia’s expenditure
poor live in Java, Bali, and Sumatra. Addressing poverty in Indonesia will not only require efforts to
tackle the issues affecting the poor in all regions.
High levels of unemployment are limiting progress in raising income levels. Open unemployment has
risen from 4.7 percent 1997 to 5.8 percent in 2002, and the latest surveys suggest that almost 30 percent
of the labor force is “under-employed” (i.e., work less than 35 hours per week). Employment growth
remains below pre-crisis rates, making it difficult to absorb the approximate 2 million people entering the
labor force each year. Improving the investment climate for growth and job creation, both in rural and
urban areas, will be essential for poverty reduction.
Other dimensions of poverty also need to be tackled. Many Indonesians lack access to basic services,
particularly water and sanitation. Inadequate service delivery affects the poor and is itself a cause of
poverty and deprivation in Indonesia. These shortcomings are also reflected in poor outcomes against the
MDG goals, especially in health. Women in particular suffer problems of access to quality services and
bear the consequences: for example, Indonesia’s maternal mortality rate is two times higher than the
Philippines and five times higher than Vietnam. Directed efforts to improve the delivery of basic services
will be critical to reduce multidimensional poverty in Indonesia.
The government continues to make progress toward completing its poverty reduction strategy. The
lead agency charged with developing such a strategy aims at completing a draft by May 2004, in line with
the schedule in the White Paper. It is expected that the government will work to refine and integrate the
strategy into a new national five-year plan, to be completed in draft before the start of the new incoming
government in October 2004. This plan is expected to be ratified by the new government early in its term.

fully met through a larger drawdown in
reserves. On the domestic front, such a shock would have adverse implications for inflation
and the budget.7
Medium-term outlook
14.
The staff has updated its assessment of the medium-term outlook, under the
assumption that strong efforts are made to improve the investment climate (Annex IV).
In such a scenario, GDP growth could reach 5–6 percent, in line with the government’s
medium-term objectives. This outturn would be predicated on a rise in the investment ratio
by about 2½ percentage points of GDP, to about 22 percent of GDP by 2009, and a pick-up
in annual export growth to around 5–6 percent. However, the achievement of this outlook
depends on progress in addressing the factors underlying the recent poor performance of
exports and investment.
15.
The staff has also considered a scenario where Indonesia is unable to make
headway in addressing the constraints to export and investment performance. In such a
“muddle-through” scenario, growth would remain at around 3–4 percent. While public debt
levels would still decline slowly, the economy would be relatively more vulnerable to
setbacks and shifts in confidence. In addition, poverty levels and unemployment would
remain high.
6

The adverse scenario considers a temporary shock involving a 30 percent depreciation, a
250 basis point rise in domestic interest rates, and a slowdown in growth to 3 percent.
7

Absent compensating measures, the budget deficit would increase by ½ percent of GDP,
and the public debt-to-GDP ratio would rise by about 8 percentage points.

- 12 III. POLICIES FOR STRONGER GROWTH
16.
The discussions focused on policy priorities needed to put Indonesia on a higher
growth path. In addition to maintaining macroeconomic stability and continuing financial
sector reforms, the priority is to address weaknesses in the investment climate. With respect
to the latter, the mission emphasized that efforts are needed to tackle shortcomings in
taxation and regulation, enhance labor market flexibility, and address fundamental legal
issues such as contract enforcement.8 In light of the difficulties posed to the reform process
by the electoral cycle, the discussions focused on specific steps which could realistically be
taken in the near term to tackle the impediments to higher growth. The authorities agreed
with these priorities, and noted that initiatives were underway to address them in the context
of the government’s White Paper. While they were pleased with policy implementation so
far, looking ahead they shared the mission’s assessment that it would be desirable to
undertake a more visible and determined effort to strengthen the investment climate, and for
the new government to carry these efforts forward.
A. Maintaining Macroeconomic and Financial Stability
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy

The stable rupiah and fall in inflation have allowed BI to adopt a more

modest reductions in interest rates (the spread with offshore rates still remained modestly
higher than other countries in the region), this would depend on the inflation outlook
remaining favorable. A cautious approach would be especially important given the potential
for market sentiment to be fragile through the election period, and the possibility that interest
rates abroad could soon begin to rise. The recent retrenchment in market sentiment,
associated in part with domestic political developments, underscored the need for BI to
maintain a steady hand over the coming period. The mission also expressed some concern
that monetary policy in the recent past may have been driven by an excessive concern about
BI’s profit-and-loss position in the context of large outstanding stocks of central bank paper,

These are the most frequently cited shortcomings by the business community, as reflected
in survey results and in the mission’s discussions with private sector representatives.

- 13 and encouraged the authorities to maintain their focus on inflation and exchange rate
developments. The authorities largely agreed, and explained that they planned to maintain a
cautious approach.
18.
It will be important to ensure a smooth transition from a base money framework
to full-fledged inflation targeting. For 2004, BI has indicated that it will seek to keep
inflation in a range of 4½–6½ percent; to that end, it is monitoring a variety of indicators to
guide the setting of interest rates. In early March, BI publicly announced its intention to
gradually adopt an inflation-targeting framework. The mission recommended that to achieve
a smooth transition, BI should still retain a base money framework with an announced target
path consistent with the growth and inflation outlook. At the same time, the mission
encouraged BI to accelerate the preparatory work for the adoption of inflation-targeting,
drawing on the work of the overlapping MFD team.9 The authorities agreed on the merits of
retaining a base money framework in the lead-up to inflation targeting, although they
preferred to maintain their current practice of using the path as an internal guide, while
focusing the public’s attention on interest rates as the operational tool. Going forward, the
mission encouraged the government, in consultation with BI, to adopt an inflation target for
2005 and beyond that would be consistent with preserving the downward trend in
inflationary expectations.
19.
The mission shared the authorities’ view that the current level of the exchange
rate was not seriously misaligned from a competitiveness point of view. While the real
effective exchange rate (relative CPI basis) has appreciated about 20 percent since early
2002, it remains some 25 percent below pre-crisis levels, broadly in line with regional
currencies (Figure 9). The strengthening of the rupiah has facilitated the recent decline in
inflation and interest rates, and eased the external debt burden of the corporate sector.
However, recent increases in minimum wages have combined with a stronger nominal
exchange rate to lead to a significant rise in relative unit labor costs, eroding the cost

The MFD team recommended that the BI Board establish a monetary policy committee to
decide on the appropriate monetary stance in light of the inflation outlook. BI’s assessment
of the inflation outlook, in turn, would be clearly communicated to the public through the
preparation of regular inflation reports. The team also proposed a number of parallel reforms
to improve the efficiency and transparency of BI’s monetary operations.

- 14 advantage Indonesia had gained during the post crisis period (Figure 10).10 The erosion of
labor cost competitiveness places a premium on addressing structural weaknesses in
Indonesia’s investment climate, which staff analysis suggests is a key factor for export
underperformance.11 That said, cost competitiveness is an emerging issue that should be
monitored.
20.
There was also agreement on the merits of maintaining a floating exchange rate
regime, which has served the economy well over the past few years. A floating regime
would continue to act as a shock absorber and reduce external vulnerability. Consistent with
the approach of recent years, BI has recently intervened sporadically in the foreign exchange
market to limit abrupt depreciation. The staff supports the approach of smoothing volatility,
but has also encouraged BI to be prepared to intervene in both directions, and to take
advantage of appreciation pressures to accumulate reserves.
Fiscal Policy
21.
The mission welcomed the government’s commitment to further fiscal
consolidation to reduce vulnerability arising from the high level of public debt. The
authorities explained that they remained fully committed to meeting their 2004 deficit target
of 1.3 percent of GDP (entailing a decline of 0.6 percent of GDP decline in the non-oil
primary deficit, to 2.2 percent of GDP). In light of the non-oil tax revenue shortfall in 2003,
however, the mission noted that there was a risk that the deficit target could be exceeded,
perhaps by ½ percent of GDP, unless the performance of non-oil revenues improved. The
authorities responded that they intend to bolster revenue collection efforts, with a particular
emphasis on non-oil tax revenues. There may also be scope for expenditure savings,
including on the wage bill (0.2 percent of GDP) following a recent civil service census. The
authorities agreed that close monitoring will be essential to ensure that budget execution
evolves as expected.
22.
The mission also updated the 2004 budget financing outlook, in light of the large
required step-up in market financing. Recent developments have been favorable, with the
government’s sovereign issue attracting strong investor interest, and yields on domestic debt
issues declining.12 So far in 2004, the government has raised about Rp 12 trillion from
10

A shift toward organized labor and the new decentralized minimum wage setting process
may have been contributing factors to the large wage increases in recent years. A new
tripartite wage council (comprising government, labor, and employers) has been established
to set national guidelines on wage policies.
11

As described in Chapter VI of the Selected Issues paper, the comparatively weak export
performance reflects lower global demand for Indonesia’s mix of export products, a sharp
decline in export-oriented FDI, and a number of obstacles related to tax, legal, and labor
relations issues.
12

At the most recent auction in mid-March, Rp 2 trillion in eight-year bonds were placed at a
yield of 11.6 percent (down from 13 percent in December).

- 15 domestic and international bond issues, against a gross annual target of about Rp 30 trillion.
The mission encouraged the authorities to take advantage of the current favorable market
conditions by accelerating bond issuance to the extent possible. The authorities also plan to
raise Rp 5 trillion in privatization proceeds (mainly from the sales of shares in state banks
Mandiri and BNI).
23.
The mission reviewed the strategy for strengthening the budget position over the
medium term (Table 9). The authorities’ objective is to achieve broad balance by 2006–07,
consistent with lowering public debt to below 50 percent of GDP. The authorities agreed that
the main priority is to enhance non-oil tax revenues to provide adequate resources for
physical and social infrastructure, and to reduce reliance on oil revenues. In line with
previous advice, the mission recommended that this be done through a broadening of the tax
base and a further strengthening of tax administration. The mission also encouraged that care
be taken to ensure that new policy initiatives do not weaken the budget situation. In
particular, the mission emphasized that revenue losses associated with a proposed plan to
simplify personal and corporate income taxes (estimated at around ½ percent of GDP) should
be offset by measures to expand the tax base (e.g., by scaling back exemptions under the
VAT), and that measures should be taken to ensure that a social security bill now in
Parliament does not create unfunded mandates.13 Going forward, the mission recommended
that fiscal reforms should focus on addressing identified weaknesses in tax collections
through enhanced taxpayer registration, improved audit procedures, and tax compliance
initiatives. The staff emphasized that it would also be important to press ahead with reforms
to modernize tax and customs administration (as discussed below, this has become a major
issue for investors). The authorities largely agreed with these priorities, although they did not
presently have a strategy to ensure that the tax policy proposals were implemented in a
revenue-neutral manner.
24.
Another key element of the fiscal reform strategy is to strengthen expenditure
management and the decentralization framework. Reforms in these areas would improve
control over the public finances and limit risks to fiscal sustainability:
•
Expenditure management. The ongoing reorganization of the Ministry of Finance and
the establishment of a well-functioning treasury system are key elements of the plan to
improve budget preparation and execution.14 The mission stressed that it will also be
important to reduce poorly targeted subsidies by reintroducing the automatic fuel price
mechanism (a measure that had originally been planned for early 2003, but which was rolled
back in response to popular protest). The authorities explained that they planned to do so
once currently high oil prices return to more normal levels, most likely in 2005 at the earliest.
In the meantime, the mission encouraged the authorities to clarify the timetable and
accelerate technical preparations for the reintroduction of the mechanism.
13

The bill proposes a gradual expansion of health care, work accident insurance and pension
coverage.
14

The Fund and World Bank are providing technical assistance to support these efforts.

- 16 •
Decentralization framework. The subnational government budgets have been in
surplus, and the decentralization process that was started in 2001 has not undermined fiscal
stability. However, a mismatch between expenditure functions and revenue sources assigned
to subnational governments and lack of clarity in expenditure assignments pose a risk to the
implementation of fiscal policy and public service delivery. The authorities explained that
amendments to the decentralization laws that they have presented to Parliament should
reduce the scope for mismatches of revenue and expenditure assignments. They have also
made progress to improve subnational budget reporting, although further work is still needed
to strengthen regions’ capacity to produce timely reports. There is also a need to develop a
robust framework for borrowing by subnational governments, to replace the temporary
blanket ban.

highlighted by the discovery of a large-scale fraud
at bank BNI in late 2003. A particular concern is state banks’ financial performance and
some lingering tendencies to pursue aggressive lending strategies.
26.
With the authorities sharing the mission’s concern about the state banks, the
discussions focused on near-term measures to address the problems. The mission
encouraged continued close oversight of the state banks, and urged BI and the government to
be prepared to take swift action if necessary, as they had in dealing with the fraud at BNI
(including wholesale changes to the bank’s boards of directors and commissioners). With
respect to bank Mandiri, the authorities agreed that the bank’s 2004 business plan should
incorporate a relatively restrained pace of credit expansion, and were hopeful that a BIendorsed business plan would be finalized shortly. In view of recent statements by various BI
and government officials, the mission also urged BI to refrain from using moral suasion to
encourage banks to accelerate lending, as this could ultimately undermine the health of the
banking system.

15

See Chapter II of the Selected Issues paper.

- 17 27.
The mission also encouraged the authorities to press ahead with plans to
increase private sector participation in the state bank sector. On top of the recent
divestment of a 10 percent stake in Mandiri, the government noted that it was also planning
to divest up to 30 percent of bank BNI in the middle of the year. The mission argued that it
would be desirable to adopt a more fundamental reorientation toward private management to
ensure efficiency and improve governance. In particular, the mission encouraged the
authorities to consider the sale of strategic stakes or private management contracts in a
competitive and transparent process.
28.
The mission congratulated the authorities on the successful closure of IBRA at
end-February. Over its five-year mandate, IBRA had made significant progress toward
meeting its primary objectives of securing recoveries from bank assets taken over during the
crisis and returning the banks it took over to private ownership.16 The mission reviewed the
plans for dealing with remaining unsold assets.17 The bulk of these will be handled by a new
public sector asset management company with a mandate to dispose of all assets within five
years. In addition, a new high-level committee, chaired by the Minister of Finance, has been
charged with resolving problematic assets (e.g., those with outstanding legal issues). With
respect to the agreements with former bank owners, the mission noted that most had been
brought to closure by the end of IBRA’s mandate.18 The authorities were hopeful that the
remaining cases would be concluded shortly.
29.
Progress continues to be made in developing a robust financial sector safety net.
The authorities’ strategic goal is to have the key elements in place by the end of the year, to
allow the gradual phase-out of the blanket guarantee to commence. Toward this end, the
authorities noted that legislation establishing a deposit insurance agency with broad bank
resolution powers was expected to be approved by Parliament during its next session (some
of these powers had lapsed with the closure of IBRA; in the interim, troubled banks are to be
handled under existing law, which requires that they be liquidated). The BI Law has also
been amended to provide the central bank with an appropriate lender of last resort facility.
The specific modalities for dealing with banks encountering difficulties (in both systemic and
nonsystemic cases) have been elaborated in a MOU between BI and the government. These
understandings are to be codified in a financial safety net law due to be completed by the end
of the year. Improving the accountability of the central bank is also a key element of the
16

See Chapter III of the Selected Issues paper.

17

As of end-February, assets with a face value of about Rp 270 trillion, including
Rp 166 trillion in litigation, remained unsold. Recoveries on these assets—which have been
offered in earlier sales processes—are likely to be very low.
18

Of the 30 settlements with owners of banks closed in 1999, 16 are now complete or almost
complete, 8 have been forwarded to legal authorities for enforcement, and the remaining 6
are expected to be concluded shortly. Five of the nine agreements with owners of banks
closed in 1997 and 1998—which in some cases involved personal guarantees—have now
been settled, with an additional agreement nearing conclusion.

- 18 financial sector safety net. In this regard, the mission encouraged the authorities to establish
the supervisory body for BI, as set out in the recent amendments to the BI Law, as soon as
possible.
B. Improving the Investment Climate
30.
The authorities agreed that achieving higher economic growth will require a
concerted effort to improve Indonesia’s investment climate. They emphasized that this
has been a central theme of their economic strategy as laid out in the White Paper.
Discussions with a wide range of interlocutors suggested that in addition to lingering
concerns about the re-emergence of macroeconomic instability, investors are most affected
by uncertainties in the investment framework arising from poor tax administration,
burdensome regulations, labor market rigidities, and a weak and inefficient legal system
(Box 4).19
Weaknesses in taxation and regulation
31.
Tax administration and enforcement remains a significant source of uncertainty
to business. The main weaknesses relate to arbitrary tax assessments and inefficiencies in the
refund systems for the VAT and income taxes. The mission noted that pending amendments
to the legal framework for tax administration could be used to help address these issues, and
recommended the following priority areas for reform, drawing on ongoing FAD technical
assistance:
•
Tax assessments. The key priority will be to reduce the discretion of tax officials in
the assessment of tax returns. This will require further reform of internal audit and
assessment procedures, as well as steps to strengthen the tax court (to provide taxpayers with
recourse to an external review of their tax assessments). Additional steps are also needed to
strengthen the governance framework, notably with regard to investigations of misconduct of
tax officials.
•
Refund system. The key step is the elimination of the legal requirement to audit all
refund claims. The recent decree to simplify refund procedures for gold card taxpayers is a
helpful step, but a more fundamental shift towards ex-post auditing of refunds is needed to
simplify the system.

19

See Chapter V of Selected Issues paper.

- 19 Box 4. Investment Climate
Indonesia’s weak investment climate remains a significant obstacle to reviving investment and
growth. Indonesia’s low score in the 2003 Global Competitiveness Report by the International
Institute for Management Development provides the broad context (Table 1). Indonesia is ranked as
significantly less competitive than its ASEAN neighbors and major regional competitors. Other
surveys also suggest that Indonesia’s investment climate is seen to be very weak. The recent World
Investment Report 2003 by UNCTAD ranks Indonesia at

Direct Investment performance. Surveys of business risk

• Macroeconomic stability—the impact of large swings
in exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation on the corporate sector remains fresh in the minds of
investors. Thus extending the recent macroeconomic gains is vital.
• Labor market—increases in formal sector labor costs and minimum wages that have far outpaced
inflation in past 5 years; severance costs which are high by regional standards; inflexible labor
markets, given restrictions on hiring
and firing; and the policy

• Institutional, social and physical infrastructure—the legal system is perceived to be corrupt,
inefficient, and an impediment to orderly workouts (through bankruptcy for example); decentralization
has increased uncertainty (through conflicting laws and regulations and proliferation of taxes and
charges), and created new rent-seeking opportunities at different levels of government; the low labor
value added in manufacturing reflects the quality of education and training; and insufficient investment
in physical infrastructure is leading to bottlenecks (particularly in the power sector).

Tax administration. The mission noted that the introduction of large taxpayer offices
had resulted in a significant improvement in the services provided to these taxpayers. The
mission encouraged the authorities to expand the number of large taxpayers covered by these
offices and to extend the approach to other taxpayers through the development of similar
dedicated tax offices for medium-sized taxpayers.
32.
The authorities largely agreed with the priorities outlined above. They noted that
they had already seen benefits from their steps to improve tax administration, and planned to
continue with such efforts in the period ahead.
33.
In the same vein, the mission encouraged an acceleration of efforts to improve
customs procedures. The authorities indicated that a major reorganization of the unit
responsible for managing the customs modernization strategy had slowed progress in recent
months, but that they were committed to pushing ahead with the reform process. The main
priority would be to continue the implementation of measures to facilitate trade through
streamlining clearance procedures for importers. These reforms would be complemented by
reforms to improve valuation control and combat smuggling.
34.
The mission also encouraged the authorities to address the proliferation of local
tax regulations. The authorities informed the mission that they had recently taken steps to
establish greater central control over local regulations (all regulations now need to be preapproved by the central government). The mission welcomed this step, but noted that further
action to rationalize the range of taxes that regions could levy would be beneficial. Regions
could be compensated for this restriction on their powers by granting them greater autonomy
over the main parameters (rate and base) of key local taxes such as the property tax.
Labor market uncertainties
35.
The lack of a clear and competitive framework for labor relations is a major
impediment to investment in Indonesia. The importance of labor policy to the investment
climate has risen sharply in recent years, following a shift in government policy toward
organized labor.20 Forging a consensus on the key elements of a modern industrial relations
framework—one that provides an appropriate balance between protecting worker rights
while maintaining a competitive labor market—has been relatively difficult, and
complementary legal reforms in this area have consequently proceeded slowly.
36.
The recently enacted manpower and industrial dispute laws provide a basic
framework, but important details have been left to the implementing regulations.
Although some implementing regulations have been finalized in recent months, progress has
been slow, and a number of contentious issues remain unresolved. Of particular concern to
investors is that the new legislation contains provisions regarding the use of short-term
20

The process started in 1998, with the ratification of the ILO conventions on worker rights,
and was followed in 2000 by a major reform of legislation governing rights of association
and union activity.

- 21 contracts, outsourcing, and overtime that may tend to limit firms’ flexibility in making
employment and production decisions. Much will ultimately depend on how the law is
interpreted in the regulations. The mission urged the authorities, employers, and labor groups
to resolve these issues in a timely manner, and to ensure that Indonesia’s labor market
framework does not put Indonesia at a competitive disadvantage. This would be to key to
attracting investment in labor-intensive industries needed to make progress in reducing
unemployment.
Weak and inefficient legal system
37.
Further progress in legal and judicial reforms is needed to strengthen property
rights and contract enforcement. Improvements in these areas are essential to developing
normal commercial and banking operations. While steps have been taken in recent years to
strengthen the court system, uncertainty about the rule of commercial law remains a serious
problem.21 Accordingly, the mission encouraged the authorities to bolster ongoing efforts to
strengthen the judiciary, particularly in the following key areas:
•

Improving accountability and governance. The planned establishment of an
independent Judicial Commission, responsible for appointing judges and maintaining
their professional discipline, will be key to ensuring the accountability and
governance of the judiciary once it becomes fully independent under the “one-roof”
system.22 A draft bill establishing the commission has been prepared, and is awaiting
the government’s appointment of a team to discuss it with Parliament.

•

Placing court finances on a sounder footing. A needs assessment of the
Commercial Court is expected to be completed in early July, which will provide
recommendations on the court’s budget and personnel requirements. The mission
emphasized that it would be important that the findings be incorporated into the
medium-term expenditure framework being prepared for the 2005 budget.

•

Strengthening the administration of the judiciary. The Fund, through technical
assistance from LEG, has been closely involved in strengthening the Commercial
Court, by building up its administrative capacity and improving its transparency and
accountability. Similar assistance has been provided to the Supreme Court, where the
emphasis has been on developing plans to strengthen personnel management,
financial transparency and accountability, and the professional development of

21

See Chapter IV of the Selected Issues paper. Amendments to the bankruptcy law remain in
Parliament, due to the legislative backlog.
22

In early 2004 Parliament passed the final piece of legislation transferring responsibility for
administering all aspects of the court system from the Ministry of Justice to the Supreme
Court. The process, which has been implemented in phases since 1999, is expected to be
completed by the end of this year.

- 22 judges. The mission emphasized the importance of continuing the work to build-up the
capacity of the judiciary.
38.
The authorities agreed that combating corruption should remain an important
element of the strategy to reduce the cost of doing business. The mission noted that the
Anti-Corruption Commission, which is part of this effort, is not yet fully operational. While
the commissioners have been appointed, the Secretary-General is yet to take office, and a
number of operational issues concerning the autonomy and prosecutorial authority of the
commission have to be resolved. In addition to addressing these issues, the mission also
urged the authorities to expedite the establishment of the Anti-Corruption Court, which is
integral to the effective functioning of the Commission.
Trade policy
39.
The mission also emphasized that maintaining a liberal trade regime would be
an important element of the strategy to foster medium-term growth. Indonesia’s trade
regime is relatively open: at 7 percent, its average tariff rate is among the lowest in the region
and it has a relatively low (four out of ten) rating on the Fund’s trade restrictiveness scale.
Nevertheless, the mission noted that several restrictive measures had been implemented in
recent years, including the imposition of restrictions on the imports of certain sugar, textile,
and steel products and, more recently, a temporary ban on the import of rice. The authorities
indicated that these restrictions were temporary measures to safeguard domestic producers
(the steel import restriction was removed in February 2004) and that they intended to allow
any remaining measures to expire as scheduled.23
C. Other Issues
40.
The mission reviewed progress in strengthening Indonesia’s anti-money
laundering (AML) framework. The Financial Intelligence Unit (PPATK) was officially
established in October 2003. Outstanding issues related to the financing of the PPATK and
the procedures for protecting witnesses have now been resolved. An implementation plan for
further reforms was presented to the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering
(FATF) in February. The FATF has indicated that progress against the plan will be needed to
allow Indonesia to be removed from the list of non-complying countries.
While Indonesia subscribes to the SDDS, a number of data weaknesses remain.
41.
Fiscal data is of uneven quality with significant statistical discrepancies in the central
government accounts in some years. The presence of off-budgetary operations and
inadequate coverage and timely recording of general government statistics is also of concern,
especially in the wake of the decentralization effort. New fiscal data recording and reporting
mechanisms are being developed to address these weaknesses. Efforts are also needed to
strengthen key components of the balance of payments, including service transactions in the
current account and the recording of foreign direct investment and corporate sector debt
flows in the capital account.
23

The ban on rice imports is due to expire in June 2004.

- 23 42.
The mission explored the authorities’ interest in undertaking fiscal and statistics
ROSCs. The authorities were of the view that there would be merits in undertaking a fiscal
ROSC, but indicated that a final decision would need to be taken by the new government
after it took office in October. Similar interest was expressed in a statistical ROSC, although
it was noted that any commitment in this area would need to secure the agreement of a
number of agencies.
43.
The authorities agreed that post-program monitoring provided a useful vehicle
for maintaining a close dialogue with the Fund. They looked forward to continuing this
dialogue in the period ahead and supported the staff’s proposal that the next PPM
consultation take place toward the end of the year, after the presidential election. The staff
will also continue to coordinate closely with the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank during this period (Annexes V and VI).
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
44.
Sound macroeconomic management and progress in key structural reforms have
resulted in a steady improvement in economic performance. Over the past couple of
years, real GDP has surpassed its pre-crisis level, the exchange rate has stabilized, inflation
has fallen steadily, and external viability has been restored. Commendably, under the
framework of the government’s White Paper, the authorities have succeeded in maintaining
market confidence since the expiration of the Fund-supported program at end-2003.
Indonesia’s recent return to international capital markets has been marked by the successful
sovereign bond issue, which is further testimony to the authorities’ success in policy
implementation.
45.
While much has been achieved, Indonesia’s economic performance has lagged
behind its regional peers, and the economy is yet to share fully in Asia’s recovery.
Investment remains weak, and export growth has been particularly disappointing when set
against the recent experience of other Asian economies. The main priority for economic
policies is to put Indonesia on a higher growth path. Appropriately, the government’s
strategy is to create a conducive business climate through good policies and institutions, in
addition to maintaining macroeconomic stability and continuing the restructuring of the
financial sector. In the staff’s view, key areas that need to be addressed include weaknesses
in taxation and regulation, labor market rigidities, and a weak and inefficient legal system.
46.
The near-term economic outlook is favorable, provided that the authorities can
continue to maintain market confidence through the forthcoming election period. Real
GDP growth is likely to pick up further in 2004 on the basis of a favorable global
environment and continued strength of private consumption, and the staff projects inflation to
remain subdued. The current account is projected to remain in substantial surplus, and
reserve coverage should continue to be comfortable.
The staff welcomes the government’s commitment to achieve its 2004 budget deficit
target. While there was a modest overrun in the 2003 deficit outturn, this mainly reflected
larger than expected donor-financed development spending, although shortfalls in non-oil tax
revenues also contributed. In light of the continued shortfalls in non-oil tax revenues, the

- 24 staff urges the authorities to monitor budget developments closely, and welcomes the
authorities’ intention to intensify revenue collection efforts.
48.
Further efforts will be needed to strengthen the budget position over the medium
term in order to reduce public debt. The main priority is to enhance non-oil tax revenues
through broadening the tax base and strengthening tax administration, in order to provide
adequate resources for spending on physical and social infrastructure, and to reduce reliance
on declining oil revenues. In this context, the staff encourages the authorities to ensure that
the tax policy reforms under consideration are revenue neutral. In particular, the staff
encourages the authorities to offset any revenue losses from income tax rate reductions with
measures to broaden the tax base. Efforts should also be made to improve the efficiency of
spending, including by eliminating poorly targeted subsidies over time, and to ensure that
any revisions to the decentralization framework do not weaken the central government’s
fiscal position.
49.
Progress in reducing inflation has enabled Bank Indonesia to adopt a more
accommodative monetary stance. Interest rates have been reduced substantially over the
past year without undermining the gains in price and exchange rate stability. Looking ahead,
it will be important to maintain a cautious approach given the potential for market sentiment
to be fragile during the election period, and the possibility that interest rates abroad may
begin to rise. The staff supports the authorities’ intention to adopt an inflation targeting
framework. To provide a solid anchor for policy during the transition, the staff encourages BI
to maintain a base money framework, with an announced target path consistent with the
growth and inflation outlook.
50.
Returning Indonesia to a high growth path also requires further progress in
financial sector reform. The authorities are to be congratulated on the successful closure of
IBRA, which serves as an important signal of Indonesia’s emergence from the financial
crisis. The staff is also encouraged by progress being made to develop a robust financial
safety net, with the completion of the MOU between BI and the government on bank
resolution and lender of last resort procedures now complete, and the safety net legislation
expected to be in place by end-year. Early passage of deposit insurance legislation will also
be important, to enable a phased removal of the blanket guarantee on bank liabilities.
Another key element of the financial safety net is to improve the accountability of the central
bank. The staff encourages the authorities to establish the planned supervisory body for BI,
as set out in recent amendments to the BI Law.
47.
The state bank sector remains a source of fragility in the financial system, given
its large size and weak asset quality. The staff encourages the authorities to continue their
close oversight of the state banks to ensure that their lending policies are consistent with
sound banking practice and to strengthen their financial condition. The staff also encourages
the authorities to refrain from exerting moral suasion on banks to encourage increased
lending and lower interest spreads, as it could ultimately undermine the health of the banking
system. Going forward, the staff encourages the authorities to increase private sector
participation in the state banks to improve efficiency and governance.
48.
The authorities’ structural reform strategy appropriately focuses on
strengthening the investment climate and bolstering competitiveness and exports. In the

- 25 area of tax administration, the staff encourages the authorities to address weaknesses arising
from arbitrary tax assessments, burdensome customs procedures, and inefficiencies in the
refund systems for the VAT and income taxes. The pending tax legislation could be used to
help address these issues. Action is also needed to address the proliferation of local tax
regulations by rationalizing the range of taxes that regions can levy.
49.
The lack of a clear and competitive framework for labor relations remains a
major impediment to investment. In this regard, the staff urges the authorities to finalize
the implementing regulations associated with the manpower and industrial disputes
legislation that was passed last year, in a manner that protects worker rights while
maintaining labor market flexibility in line with regional competitors. In addition, the staff
urges the authorities to ensure that minimum wage increases are contained in order to retain
competitiveness. This is crucial to attracting investment in labor-intensive industries, which
is needed to make progress in reducing unemployment.
50.
Progress in legal and judicial reforms is needed to enhance certainty with regard
to property rights and contract enforcement. While steps have been taken in recent years
to strengthen the court system, much still needs to be done to improve the implementation of
commercial law. In this regard, the authorities are encouraged to foster ongoing efforts to
strengthen the administrative capacity of the judiciary and enhance its accountability and
governance including through establishing the planned Judicial Commission. The staff also
encourages the authorities to continue with ongoing efforts to combat corruption and promote
good governance, including by completing the steps required to make the Anti-Corruption
Commission fully operational, and expediting the establishment of the Anti-Corruption
Court.
51.
The maintenance of a liberal trade regime would enhance Indonesia’s mediumterm growth potential. The staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to further
multilateral trade liberalization under the Doha round, and the overall openness of
Indonesia’s trade regime. The authorities’ intention to allow temporary measures imposed
over the past couple of years to expire as scheduled is also welcome, and the staff urges the
authorities to refrain from implementing new restrictive measures.
52.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Indonesia be held
on the standard 12-month cycle.

Exchange Arrangements

The rupiah has floated since August 14, 1997. The market exchange rate was Rp 8,457 per
U.S. dollar on February 29, 2004. Indonesia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions.

- 40 -

VIII. Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation report was discussed by the Executive Board on April 26,
2002.
IX.

Safeguards Assessments

Under the Extended Arrangement, Bank Indonesia (BI) was subject to the transitional
procedures under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy. This required a review of BI’s
external audit mechanism, which was completed on March 15, 2002. The assessment
recommended remedial actions to address a number of vulnerabilities. The main
recommendations have been implemented. These included the establishment of an independent
audit committee at BI and the publication of BI’s audited financial statements. A mid-year audit
of BI’s foreign exchange reserves (conducted by the independent accounting firm of
PricewaterhouseCoopers) was also completed in October 2002. The report indicated that
international reserves data reported to the Fund had been underestimated at June 30, 2002, due
to timing issues and other compilation discrepancies. The audit also found control weaknesses
in BI’s foreign reserves operations, which have been addressed. The staff has recommended the
continued involvement of an independent firm in BI’s external audit mechanism.

- 41 -

ANNEX II

INDONESIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Indonesia has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since
September 1996.
Real Sector
2.
Annual national accounts data are based on a 1993 base year. Quarterly GDP data are
made available to Fund staff in a timely manner, but data are subject to frequent, significant
revisions. Furthermore, the estimates are based on a limited set of indirect indicators of
uncertain quality; although some sectors are influenced strongly by seasonality, seasonally
adjusted data are not prepared. No recent disaggregation of gross fixed capital formation
between government and nongovernment sectors is available and changes in inventories are
calculated residually, and therefore, include any statistical discrepancies. Exports of goods
and services in the national accounts differ substantially from the balance of payments data.
3.
Labor market data, including wages and employment, are available, albeit reported
with some delay, through the annual labor market survey (Sakernas) published by the Bureau
of Statistics. Data are also available on minimum and maximum wages for the formal sector.
Quarterly data are available on industrial wages, again with some delay.
4.
Both consumer (CPI) and wholesale price (WPI) data are collected and published
monthly and on a timely basis. Beginning January 2004, the base year for the CPI was
changed to 2002 and weights used to calculate the index were updated. In addition, the CPI
survey was expanded in terms of its geographical coverage from 43 to 45 cities and the
number of products surveyed has increased from 662 to 744 items.
Public Finance
5.
Comprehensive public finance data are generally not available, and the data that are
available are of questionable quality in terms of definition, coverage and timeliness.
Subnational government fiscal data are available with a lag of nine months, but the quality is
variable. Data on the central government budget are available on a timely basis, although
significant “statistical” discrepancies exist in some years. The coverage and timeliness of
public debt statistics is generally adequate. However, little data is available on contingent
liabilities. There are a large number of quasi-government entities (such as foundations) and
extra-budgetary funds, resulting in non-transparent and unaccountable off-budget activities.
The authorities are considering the adoption of the GFS standards as their general reporting
framework; however, no timetable has been set.
Monetary Accounts
6.
BI balance sheet data are generally of good quality, and available in a timely manner.
The quality of monetary survey data is compromised by a number of methodological

- 42 -

ANNEX II

problems associated with the restructuring of the banking sector, in particular transfers of
non-performing assets to (and purchases from) the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency
(IBRA), and some misclassification of foreign assets and liabilities by banks.
7.
BI has developed an integrated database from which alternative presentations of
monetary statistics can be drawn to meet the needs of BI and the Fund, but no data have been
reported yet under this system. Further work is needed to expand the coverage of depository
corporations to include mutual funds, adopt a fuller sectorization scheme, and improve
monthly compilation methods.
Balance of Payments
8.
The compilation of Indonesia’s balance of payments is in need of major
improvements in several areas. An important initiative in this regard is taking place through
work on the development of an International Transaction Reporting System (ITRS) that will
provide regular data reports on the external transactions of banks, nonbanks financial
institutions, nonfinancial corporations, and the central bank. The use of the ITRS is expected
to address many of the weaknesses in current compilation procedures. At present, while
many components of the ITRS have been developed and are available for use, the data
generated are still being tested and methodologies refined. In the June 2003 technical
assistance mission, STA used the ITRS and other information to compile several components
of a balance of payments statement for two quarters; in a number of areas the compiled data
differed considerably from the published data. The February 2004 mission noted that starting
from the first quarter of 2004, macroeconomic adjustments to the current account and
financial account will be replaced by use of source data, and the ITRS will be used to
compile several balance of payments components.
9.
There are a number of weaknesses in the compilation of current account data. With
respect to merchandise trade data, while customs sources utilized by BI are considered
generally reliable, there is believed to be undercoverage in selected areas. Data on services
suffer from outdated surveys and weak methodologies.
10.
In the capital and financial account, the methodological basis for the compilation of
FDI data needs substantial improvement, as inflows are currently calculated based on loan
disbursements to FDI companies and the application of a fixed ratio to the loan
disbursements data to estimate equity inflows. Surveys conducted by BI to collect FDI data
since 2000 have a low response rate and the directory of enterprises requires substantial
enhancement in terms of its coverage. Other areas that need improvement include the
recording of trade credits and the assets data for portfolio investment and other investment
transactions. In general, there remain serious deficiencies in the recording of financial
transactions of the private sector.
11.
An annual international investment position is compiled, but the underlying data are
weak in several areas, notably for foreign direct investment. External sector debt statistics
have improved considerably with the introduction of a External Debt Information System

- 43 -

ANNEX II

(EDIS) in 2002. The system records external debt of government and over 800 other entities
that report to BI on a monthly basis. The data that this system generates for public sector
external debt and debt service as well as that for private banks are considered reliable.
However, improvements are still needed with respect to components of private corporate
sector data, particularly in distinguishing between scheduled and actual debt service, in
estimating the accumulation/reduction of private sector payments arrears, and in estimating
reschedulings and debt reductions being received by the private sector from external
creditors.

ANNEX IV

INDONESIA: MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS
1.
Achieving a sustained higher growth path depends critically on a revival in investment
and exports. In addition to maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and further financial sector
reforms, this will require sustained efforts to address the institutional weaknesses in the investment
climate by strengthening the legal system, improving public sector government, and increasing
ertainty in the framework for labor relations. Consistent implementation of such reforms would be
expected to strengthen market confidence further, and allow the creation of a virtuous circle in
support of additional reforms and improved macroeconomic outcomes.

3.
Fiscal policy would be geared toward further reducing public debt levels. Continued
fiscal consolidation would be critical to maintain macroeconomic stability and market confidence.
Under the baseline scenario, primary surpluses would remain in their current range of around
2½ percent of GDP. In light of the expected secular decline in oil revenues (reflecting projected
declines in both production volumes and prices) this would require a steady improvement in the nonoil primary balance of about 1 ⁄3 percent of GDP annually. In this scenario, public debt would decline
below 50 percent of GDP by 2007 (from 66.5 percent at end-2003).
4.
Fiscal consolidation would be underpinned by efforts to enhance non-oil revenue
collections and improve the efficiency of spending. Ongoing programs to improve tax and customs
administration would be extended, and complemented by additional revenue-generating initiatives,
with an emphasis on enhancing audit and arrears collection procedures. Going forward, efforts will
be needed to modernize tax administration and expand the revenue base. Expenditure reforms would
focus on improving budget preparation and execution procedures, enhancing budget reporting, and
strengthening debt management. Over the medium-term a gradual move toward performance
budgeting would increase the efficiency and transparency of government operations. Together with
the planned elimination of remaining untargeted fuel subsidies, this would support a reorientation of
expenditure toward priority social and development spending even as overall expenditures as a share
of GDP decline.
5.
The government’s financing needs would remain manageable under this scenario
(Annex Table 2). In the absence of exceptional balance of payments support, budget financing will
rely primarily on domestic sources. With IBRA’s asset sales program largely complete, the emphasis
will be on stepped-up issuance of government debt. While net bond issuance will remain relatively

-

2.
The staff has prepared a medium-term outlook on the basis of such a scenario. The
results are broadly in line with previous assessments (Annex Table 1). Growth would pick up to 5–6
percent, driven primarily by a rebound in private investment and a recovery in exports associated
with strengthening external demand. The investment ratio would increase by about ½ percent of GDP
annually, reaching 22 percent by 2009 (but still about 8 percentage points below the pre-crisis level).
As Indonesia’s competitiveness as an investment destination improved, export growth would
gradually rise to around 6 percent per annum. Progress in achieving price stability would continue,
with inflation declining further to around 3 percent, in line with trading partner inflation. The real
exchange rate would remain broadly stable at its present level, and real interest rates would stabilize
at around 3 percent.

- 47 modest at around ½ percent of GDP, gross bond financing needs would remain substantial (around
1½–2 percent of GDP) as significant volumes of bank recapitalization bonds mature. Staff
projections continue to suggest that the increased reliance on market financing can be managed while
still allowing adequate scope for an expansion in private sector credit.
6.
The external current account surplus would gradually decline. As noted above, non-oil
export volume growth is projected to improve to about 5–6 percent, but non-oil imports would grow
even more rapidly as they recover from compressed levels. Net official capital flows are projected to
increase modestly, in line with the medium-term country assistance strategies elaborated by
Indonesia’s main multilateral creditors. Critically, the scenario anticipates that sustained efforts to
improve the investment climate acts as a catalyst to renewed private capital inflows. FDI and
portfolio investments are projected to increase steadily, with overall private capital flows moving
towards balance by 2009 (from an estimated net outflow of $6½ billion or 3 percent of GDP in
2003). Under this scenario, gross reserves are projected to decline in 2004 and 2005 (matching
repayments to the Fund), but would increase steadily thereafter.
Key risks and vulnerabilities
7.
In the short term, the outlook is susceptible to a loss in market confidence. A weakening
in market sentiment—associated, for example, with an unexpected increase in political tension—
would be expected to result in pressure on the 90

10 percentage points of GDP. Despite this
increase, the debt ratios would not reach
unsustainable levels, and the path of consolidation would be expected to continue (Figure 1).
8.
A longer-term risk relates to the possibility that slow progress in reforms could hold
back a revival in investment and export performance. In such a “muddle through” scenario,
output growth would be expected to remain steady around 3–4 percent per year, well below the levels
projected for regional peers. Market confidence would be expected to erode as Indonesia became
increasingly decoupled from Asia’s recovery. The exchange rate would be weaker than in the
baseline scenario, and risk premia higher. The improvement in private capital flows would slow, and
reserves could come under some pressure. Going forward, the virtuous circle could reverse, as a
weaker macroeconomic position made it more difficult to adopt needed structural reforms.

ANNEX V

INDONESIA: WORLD BANK–IMF RELATIONS1
For questions relating to this annex, contact Mona Haddad (phone: 473-6127) at the World Bank.
The World Bank has a wide-ranging policy dialogue in Indonesia focusing on improving the climate
for high quality investment, making service delivery responsive to the needs of the poor, and
addressing the core issue of governance. This focus, reflected in the new Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) of October 2003, is motivated by the fact that further progress in reducing poverty is
prevented by two major factors—low investment and weak service provision—which in turn are
caused primarily by governance problems.
World Bank Policy Dialogue
Poverty alleviation and PRSP. Macroeconomic stability and modest growth have reduced income
poverty to pre-crisis levels. But progress is lagging in other aspects of poverty reduction, with basic
services still failing the poor—some 53 percent of Indonesians lack access to at least one basic
service (water, sanitation, education, and health), particularly with respect to water and sanitation.
The Government continues to make progress toward completing a poverty reduction strategy by endMay 2004. In early 2003, the Government completed its interim PRSP (I-PRSP) which laid out four
thematic pillars that would support its full strategy: (i) creating opportunities; (ii) empowerment; (iii)
human capital development; and (iv) social protection. The Bank continues to actively support this
process, through analytical work aimed to help the Government formulate policy options for poverty
reduction. A PRSP trust fund supported by the World Bank and other donors, and executed by the
government, is also in place to support the Ministry of Planning (Bappenas) in refining and
implementing the PRSP, linking it to planning and budgeting, and integrating it in the new five-year
plan.
Fiscal issues. While the Fund is in the lead in developing fiscal policy and overall fiscal targets, the
Bank takes the lead on: the development budget and sectoral allocation, fiscal decentralization, and
civil service reform. The Bank also plays a significant role in public financial management and in
capacity building for long-term debt management. In the area of tax and customs administration, the
Bank supports institutional reforms initiated under the Fund-supported program and complemented
by ongoing Fund technical assistance.
Development budget and sectoral allocations. Persistent under-spending of development
expenditures remains a concern. While Parliament opted for higher development expenditures in
2003 (to 3.4 percent of GDP from 2.8 percent) to stimulate the economy and improve the
deteriorating infrastructure which was underfunded during the crisis, actual spending remained well
below budgeted. These sectoral spendings are now largely responsibilities assigned to subnational
entities; their implementation depends on putting in place adequate mechanisms to foster
decentralization in each sector and redefining a new role for the center.

Prepared by World Bank staff.

- 53 Decentralization. While the transition to decentralization went smoother than expected, and
promising reforms are emerging in numerous regions, serious challenges could endanger the success
of decentralization in the medium term. First, the assignment of functions across levels of
government lacks clarity. Second, the distribution of revenues through the general allocations fund is
highly inequitable and leads to large inter-regional imbalances. Third, there is no clear policy on
regional borrowing, beyond on-lending and on-granting of donor funds through the central
government. Fourth, local tax authority is limited, with only minor taxes assigned to local
governments; at the same time, a plethora of local nuisance taxes and charges are being introduced.
Fifth, the authority over civil service is unclear.
The Bank has been an active supporter of the decentralization process in Indonesia. Through the
Dutch Trust Fund, it has been providing technical assistance and policy advice to improve the policy
framework for decentralization, including intergovernmental transfers, regional revenue, regional
borrowing, reporting of regional budgets, minimum service standards, monitoring and evaluation,
and review of regional regulations. Various sector reports, including on health, education, and
environment, analyzed the impact of decentralization on sector management. A Regional Public
Expenditure Review process was started in 1999, and is being expanded to new regions. An overview
report on Decentralizing Indonesia was issued in June 2003. The Indonesia Decentralization
Empirical Analysis (IDEA) research program was launched in September 2003 and will provide a
comprehensive analysis of the impact of decentralization on governance and service delivery. The
Bank is also supporting the regions through its sectoral projects at the local and provincial level. At
the core of the decentralized lending program are the projects to improve governance at the local
rural and urban levels through the Initiative for Local Government Reform and the Urban Sector
Development and Reform Project.
Civil service reform. Indonesia’s civil service size is at par with countries of similar per capita
income. But decentralization created imbalances in the staffing of local governments, and regions
have little discretion in personnel decisions. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate about whether civil
service pay is appropriate, and whether it is linked to corruption in the public sector. The political
will to embark on a major reform of the civil service has been lacking. Through its support for the
Partnership for Governance Reforms, the Bank has been supporting civil service reform experiments
at the local level. But the legal and institutional basis for greater flexibility to reforming regional
governments will need to be put in place. In the medium term, a civil service reform agenda would
need to comprise core elements such as a review of the administrative structures at the central and
sub-national levels based on the new role of the state.
Tax and customs administration. Major multi-year reform strategies have been developed by the
Ministry of Finance (drawing on Fund technical assistance) for tax and customs administration
aiming at improving compliance and facilitating trade. These require major changes in the
organizational structure of tax administration, a redesign of procedures, and substantial investment in
IT and office infrastructure. The Bank is providing additional technical assistance to finalize and
implement key elements of the reform strategies, in particular regarding performance measurement,
human resource management, and redesign of procedures. Special emphasis will be put on improving
stakeholder relations and accountability mechanisms.

- 54 Long-term debt management capacity building. The government has made significant progress in
debt management. With the government’s financing needs rising sharply in 2004, developing the
domestic bonds market is crucial for fiscal sustainability. Along with AusAID, the Bank is providing
technical assistance and advice on building debt management capacity, including setting up an
integrated debt management unit to establish a debt strategy and manage risk, implement an
integrated debt reporting and risk management system that assesses vulnerability, risk, and cost in a
sovereign liabilities portfolio, improve the “front, back, and middle-office” functions for public debt
management, and monitor fiscal risks associated with the government’s contingent liabilities and
incorporate them into debt management policy decisions.
Public financial management. Much progress has been achieved in this area. The new Law on State
Finances, while at a high level of generality, provides for the first time a modern and coherent
framework for Indonesia’s PFM system on which the reform agenda will build. The planned
reorganization of the Ministry of Finance is on track, and may even be advanced. At the request of
the Ministry of Finance, the Bank is preparing a Government Financial Management and Revenue
Administration Project (GFMRAP). The project is intended to finance a set of core institutional
reforms initiated by the Ministry of Finance. The reforms cover three major areas: public financial
management (including MOF reorganization, budget preparation and scope, Treasury modernization
and e-procurement), tax administration and customs. The Bank is working closely with Fund staff on
this project.
Financial Sector. Collaboration among the IFIs has been extensive and strong since the onset of the
banking crisis in the late 1997. The Bank assumed lead responsibility for the oversight of IBRA and
three of the four state-owned banks; the Fund for the central bank, Bank Mandiri, and development
of the financial safety net; and the AsDB for the pension, insurance, SME, and capital market sectors.
Bank staff have participated in many Fund missions and are continuously coordinating with the Fund
and AsDB staff in providing regular inputs and technical assistance to the financial sector authorities.
The division of labor described above largely remains in place.
The health of the banking sector has improved significantly since the 1997 crisis. The government,
through state-owned banks and the one remaining IBRA bank, is still the largest shareholder of the
sector. Banks frauds brought to light recently indicate weaknesses in governance, internal control,
and risk management at state owned banks. The insurance and pension sectors are growing steadily.
The capital market is buoyant due to low interest rates and a stream of new bonds offerings and SOEs
privatization. The Bank’s overall financial sector program is shifting from a banking crisis
management to a medium- and longer-term development of the financial sector aiming at improving
the climate for high quality investment. This requires (i) finishing the banking sector restructuring
agenda and creating an appropriate financial sector safety net; and (ii) increasing the role of non-bank
financial institutions to provide better support of development finance and to achieve a more
diversified financial sector that can provide a cushion in the event of shocks to the economy. With
these building blocks, the Bank will continue and extend its policy dialogue with post-IBRA
institutions, continue monitoring the three state-owned banks overseen by the Bank, and provide
assistance to the regulatory and supervisory authorities of capital market, pension funds, insurance
and other nonbank financial institutions.

- 55 Private Sector. The Bank was the only donor to receive a capital market recognition award by the
government in December 2003 for providing comprehensive technical assistance programs since
2001 to the Capital Market Supervisory Agency and Jakarta Stock Exchange, which include a
strategic plan on its demutualization. The Bank has been requested by the Finance Minister to further
engage in this area, specifically in debt management, secondary markets for government debt,
corporate bond market, and equity markets. The Bank is also involved in capacity building of nonbank financial institutions regulators, including for insurance and pension funds. The Corporate
Restructuring Technical Assistance project, which funded the establishment of a temporary corporate
debt mediation institution—the Jakarta Initiative Task Force (JITF)—was completed in December
2003. By the end of the project, JITF had finalized the mediation of debt restructuring in the amount
of $20.6 billion, or around one third of the total corporate loans that had become nonperforming as a
result of the crisis. In addition, JITF had produced a commendable corporate debt monitoring tool
with its quarterly debt survey.
In corporate governance, the Bank provided support to the National Committee on Corporate
Governance to disseminate the Code of Good Corporate Governance, and to the Indonesian Institute
for Corporate Directorship Institute in its curriculum design and training for trainers and directors. A
ROSC on corporate governance is about to be completed for Indonesia and the Bank’s future work
will be aligned with its findings. In competition policy, the Bank was an active donor since the
inception of the competition agency in 2000 until recently, and has participated in the regional
ASEAN conference on competition policy in 2003. By hosting private sector fora, the Bank played a
catalytic role in encouraging more open dialog between the Government and the private sector to
improve the investment climate. Recognizing the impact of decentralization on the business
environment, the Bank took the fora to the local (municipal) level.
Trade. Indonesia is a very open economy and has greatly benefited from its export-oriented growth
strategy over the past two decades. But new challenges—including a deteriorating investment climate
and increased external competitive pressures—have adversely affected its export performance. The
government has resorted to short-term, ad hoc measures to shield critical labor-intensive sectors, such
as garments and key agriculture commodities. The Bank is preparing a comprehensive Diagnostics
for Trade Integration Study, which includes topics such as trade in services, trade facilitation and
logistics, and the institutional framework for trade policy. The Bank has also provided the
government short policy notes on key WTO issues of interest to the Ministry of Industry and Trade,
as well as a series of training (on trade in services and WITS, a trade database) and seminars (on
recent WTO issues and market access).
Investment climate. Even with macroeconomic stability now back on track, growth remains modest
and investment is not picking up as the investment climate deteriorated following the crisis.
Preliminary results from the World Bank-AsDB Private Investment Climate Survey (PICS) show that
the main concerns of investors in Indonesia are macroeconomic instability, policy uncertainty, and
corruption. The government has recognized the importance of improving the investment climate and
has laid out a whole set of measures for that purpose, ranging from trade policy, a new investment
law with a one-stop shop, improvement in licensing procedures, tax and customs administration,
revamping of infrastructure, and improving the legal framework and labor regulations. The Bank is
undertaking jointly with the AsDB an investment climate survey (of about 800 firms) and will

- 56 prepare an investment climate assessment to identify and prioritize the main constraints to investment
and firm performance. A joint Bank-AsDB workshop was organized in February 2004 for the private
sector and the government to present preliminary results of the survey.
Corruption, justice and legal reforms. Indonesia’s transition to a more open, competitive society
provides new opportunities for improving governance. But there has been weak implementation of
many of the major policy and institutional reforms introduced under Reformasi. The Bank’s country
assistance strategy is to allocate its activities based on where there is scope for achieving,
demonstrating, and multiplying governance improvements. Rather than proposing a set of standalone governance and anti-corruption projects, these issues are central to all aspects of the program.
The Bank’s program is designed to foster transparency and accountability through two
complementary approaches: (i) by enhancing the demand for good governance through greater public
participation in policy-making and policy-monitoring processes across different levels of
government, and (ii) by strengthening the institutions that are accountable for implementing the
impressive body of laws to improve governance already passed during the Reformasi period. The
goal of the program is to help Indonesia address what might be described as an increasing
accountability gap—i.e., the perception that the tremendous gains in transparency and democratic
competition since the fall of the New Order have not been matched by genuine government
accountability for demonstrable results in restoring integrity to the public sector and reducing
corruption. The Bank issued a report on Combating Corruption in Indonesia in October 2003.
World Bank-Fund Overall Collaboration
Bank-Fund collaboration in Indonesia has taken place at two levels: (i) through the lending program;
and (ii) through analytical and advisory services. With the end of the Fund-supported program and
with the Bank’s new CAS, macroeconomic stabilization through the Fund program is no longer an
explicit conditionality of Bank lending. But there is close collaboration in a number of areas,
including on the PFM/tax and customs administration initiatives, decentralization, debt management,
financial sector reforms, and legal reforms.
Lending Operations
For the new CAS period (FY04–07) the Bank Group will continue to focus its program on those
areas most crucial to poverty reduction. At present there are two primary constraints to further
reductions in poverty: (i) inadequate productive employment opportunities, which result from low
investment and a weak investment climate; and (ii) lack of quality service delivery to poor people.
Progress in these two areas, in turn, is being compromised by the underlying problem of weak
governance. The World Bank Group’s strategy is to address the objectives of strengthening the
investment climate and service delivery including, critically, the issue of governance. Four delivery
platforms—corresponding to the community, local (district and provinces), public utilities, and
national levels—will be used to deliver results in these areas.
The base case lending would be of $450–$850 million per year. Under the last CAS, the base case
was set at $400 million and the high case at $800 million. By the end of the last CAS’s period,
Indonesia had broadly achieved the high case triggers and thus became eligible for $1billion lending

- 57 per year. The base case is premised on continued but incremental reforms that lead to gradual
improvements in governance and the investment climate. In the event of sharply accelerated reform,
the high case lending would reach up to $1.4 billion per year. This would require strong measures in
the areas of governance and the investment climate that would result in a more immediate resumption
of higher growth rates and more decisive action and results in reducing poverty. In response to the
government’s request, a policy-based program loan supporting the government’s reform program is
proposed for the first half of FY05. This program loan would be made available under an “enhanced”
base case situation. The Bank’s projects proposed for FY04–07 fall into five categories: community
development, infrastructure, human development, decentralization/governance reform, and
environment.

ANNEX VI

INDONESIA: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
Asian Development Bank (AsDB) cumulative loans to Indonesia reached over $19.4 billion at
end-December 2003. Technical assistance projects amounted to $212 million as of December 31,
2003. In 2003, the AsDB approved a total of $262 million which consisted of six loans for three
projects in health, irrigation and housing. The AsDB is working closely with government agencies to
develop and implement reform agendas in other sectors including corporate governance, trade and
industry, financial sector, power sector restructuring, decentralization and environmental
management. AsDB has also stepped up efforts to implement the Anti-Corruption Action Plan agreed
with the government.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
May 3, 2004
1.
This statement provides a factual update of economic and policy developments
since the issuance of the staff report. The staff appraisal remains valid.
2.
The April 5 parliamentary elections proceeded smoothly and peacefully. Pending
the completion of vote-counting, indications are that Golkar (ex-President Suharto’s party)
has won around 21 percent of the vote, with President Megawati’s PDI-P party coming
second with 19½ percent, and a couple of smaller parties doing better than expected. The
focus is now shifting to the presidential election scheduled for July 5. The main candidates
are: President Megawati (PDI-P); head of the People’s Assembly (MPR), Amien Rais
(PAN party); former Coordinating Minister for Security Affairs, Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono (Democrat party); and ex-general Wiranto (Golkar).
3.
Financial markets have reacted positively to the peaceful election outcome. The
stock market rallied to new highs in the weeks following the election, before falling back
somewhat in recent days, in line with regional developments. The rupiah has remained
broadly stable in recent weeks, at around Rp 8,600 – 8,700 per dollar. Yields on long-term
government bonds have continued to decline. At the most recent auction on April 27,
Rp 3 trillion in 7½ year bonds were placed at a yield of 10.7 percent, down from 11.6 percent
in the previous auction in March.
4.
In mid-April, Bank Indonesia revoked the licenses of two small banks which
were in violation of prudential requirements. The closure of the banks was implemented
smoothly, with coordination among the relevant agencies. Market sentiment was not
adversely affected.
5.
A recent controversial bankruptcy ruling has again underscored the need to
accelerate legal reforms to improve the investment climate. On April 23, Prudential Life
Assurance, the Indonesian subsidiary of a major United Kingdom-based insurance company,
was declared bankrupt by the Central Jakarta Commercial Court, in response to a petition
from a former consultant whose contract had been terminated. The ruling is widely
considered as not supported by law, and echoes a similar finding of bankruptcy against the
subsidiary of a Canadian insurance firm in 2002 (later overturned by Indonesia’s Supreme
Court). Prudential is appealing the decision, and senior officials have expressed serious
concern over the ruling and their hope that it will be overturned eventually. The episode
highlights the need to improve governance and proceed with judicial sector reforms.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Indonesia
On May 3, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article
IV consultation with Indonesia.1
Background

Since the last Article IV consultation, Indonesia has made significant progress in strengthening
macroeconomic policies and implementing key areas of the structural reform agenda, notably
with regard to rehabilitating the banking sector. Indonesia’s economic performance has
improved correspondingly, and following an impressive fiscal consolidation and disinflation
effort, and a significant reduction in external vulnerability, the authorities have laid a strong
macroeconomic foundation for Indonesia’s economic development.
Nevertheless, Indonesia’s economic performance has continued to lag behind other countries in
the region, with GDP growth, investment, and exports, continuing to perform less favorably
when compared to the experience of other Asian economies. Remaining structural weaknesses,
particularly with regard to the development of institutions needed for a stable and efficient
market-based economy, have impeded the pace of Indonesia’s economic recovery.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2The economy performed relatively well in 2003, showing commendable resilience to a number
of shocks, including the regional impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) early in
the year, the Marriott bombing in August and the lingering after-effects of the Bali bombing in
late 2002. Growth edged up to 4.1 percent, supported by strong private consumption. Inflation
continued to fall, reaching 5.1 percent in March 2004, and sustained current account surpluses
and improved capital flows have led to a significant increase in external reserves and a
corresponding reduction in external vulnerability. Although the fiscal deficit exceeded the budget
target by a small margin, public debt ratios continued to decline.
The ongoing improvement in the economy was underpinned by steady policy implementation.
Performance in the last year of the extended arrangement was relatively good, with all four
reviews completed on schedule and significant advances made in bank divestment and fiscal
reforms. The government’s economic strategy for the post-program period, set out in its White
Paper, has provided continuity in the reform process, with a number of notable advances
achieved so far in 2004. The sale of Lippo Bank has been concluded, a further minority stake in
bank Mandiri has been divested, Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) has
successfully completed its operations, and long-delayed amendments to the BI law have been
adopted.
Indonesia’s economic performance is projected to continue to strengthen in 2004, provided that
sound policy implementation is sustained during the remainder of the year. Growth is projected
to pick up to 4.8 percent, sustained by robust consumption. Inflation should remain subdued at
around 5 percent. Although the trade surplus is expected to narrow, as imports recover, the
current account surplus is expected to remain in substantial surplus. This, together with some
improvement in the capital account, would enable Indonesia to absorb the absence of
exceptional financing from the Fund and Paris Club creditors, while maintaining a comfortable
external reserve position.
The medium-term outlook is sensitive to progress made to improve the investment climate.
If strong progress is made, the government’s medium-term objectives of raising GDP growth to
5-6 percent could be realized. Such an outturn would be predicated on a rise in investment and
a pick-up in exports. Achievement of this outlook depends on progress on addressing
institutional weaknesses, particularly with regard to strengthening the legal system, reducing
regulatory uncertainty, and improving public sector institutions.
Indonesia’s first Stand-By Arrangement was approved on November 5, 1997, with a total of
SDR 3.7 billion being drawn (out of a total SDR 8.3 billion). The Stand-By was replaced by an
extended arrangement on August 25, 1998, under which about SDR 3.8 billion was drawn
(out of an augmented total of SDR 5.4 billion). A new Extended Arrangement in the amount of
SDR 3.6 billion was approved on February 4, 2000, and was extended by a year in January
2002. The arrangement concluded on December 31, 2003, with all available purchases drawn.
Indonesia’s obligations to the Fund now amount to the equivalent of about US$10 billion.

-3Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors commended the Indonesian authorities for their good record of policy
implementation in recent years, which has successfully restored macroeconomic stability and
reduced external vulnerability. Real GDP has surpassed its pre-crisis levels, inflation has
declined, the exchange rate has stabilized, gross reserves have risen to comfortable levels, and
the public debt has fallen significantly as a share of GDP. These developments have
contributed to a strengthening in market sentiment, as underscored by the recent successful
sovereign bond issue, marking Indonesia’s return to the international capital markets.
Directors noted that despite these achievements, the authorities face the significant challenge of
putting Indonesia on a higher sustainable medium-term growth path while maintaining market
confidence going forward. Directors observed in this connection that Indonesia’s economic
performance has lagged behind that of its regional partners, and that the economy is yet to fully
share in Asia’s recovery. GDP growth continues to be below potential, and investment and
exports remain weak. Directors considered that strong efforts to enhance the investment climate
will be crucial for achieving higher rates of growth and poverty reduction. In this regard, they
welcomed the authorities’ focus on improving the business environment, as well as on
maintaining macroeconomic stability and continuing the restructuring of the financial system.
Directors commended the authorities for their continued emphasis on fiscal consolidation, which
should help further reduce the level of public debt. They welcomed the government’s
commitment to achieving its 2004 budget deficit target despite the challenges and spending
pressures of an election year. Directors noted that over the medium term it will be important to
reduce reliance on declining oil revenue by enhancing non-oil tax revenues through broadening
the tax base and strengthening tax administration. A priority will also be to strengthen the
governance framework in the institutions responsible for tax policy and administration.
Directors saw scope for savings in the wage bill and noted the need to improve the efficiency of
spending by phasing out poorly targeted subsidies—including for petroleum products—and to
ensure that any revisions to the decentralization framework do not weaken the central
government’s fiscal position. Directors recommended a continued strengthening of debt
management and a cautious approach to foreign currency bond issues, and they welcomed the
use of a collective action clause in the recent foreign currency bond issue.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ progress in reducing inflation. Together with the stability of
the rupiah, this has provided room for significant reductions in policy interest rates over the past
year. Looking ahead, Directors urged Bank Indonesia to maintain a cautious monetary stance,
particularly in light of the potential for shifts in market sentiment and the prospect of higher
interest rates abroad. They supported the authorities’ intention to move over time to an inflation
targeting framework, as well as their continued commitment to a floating exchange rate regime.
Directors emphasized that continued financial sector reform will be key to returning Indonesia to
a higher growth path. They commended the authorities on the successful closure of IBRA, and
emphasized that the successor public sector asset management company should press ahead
with the disposal of remaining assets. Directors were encouraged by the progress made in

-4putting in place a financial safety net, including the establishment of procedures on bank
resolution and lender of last resort support. They called for early passage of the deposit
insurance legislation to enable a phased removal of the blanket guarantee on bank liabilities,
and emphasized the importance of improving the accountability of the central bank by
establishing the planned supervisory body for Bank Indonesia. The authorities were
commended for the steps taken to strengthen the Anti Money Laundering (AML)/Combating the
Financing Terrorism (CFT) framework, and were encouraged to move ahead with the
implementation of further planned reforms.
Directors noted that state banks continue to be the main source of fragility in the financial
system. They urged the authorities to maintain close oversight of state banks to strengthen their
financial position and ensure that their lending practices are in line with sound banking
standards. Also, they stressed that exerting moral suasion on banks to increase lending and
lower interest rate spreads, could entail risks for the health of the banking system.
Directors encouraged the development of a strategic plan aimed at reducing the risks posed by
the state banks by increasing private sector participation and improving their efficiency and
governance.
Directors were encouraged that further structural reforms to strengthen the investment climate
and bolster export performance are a central theme of the government’s White Paper.
They welcomed the authorities’ recognition that priorities include addressing weaknesses in the
area of tax administration, and recommended that emphasis be placed on avoiding arbitrary tax
assessments, illegal fees, burdensome customs procedures, and inefficiencies in the refund
system for VAT and income taxes. Directors suggested that the authorities use the pending tax
legislation to address these issues.
Directors urged the authorities to strengthen their efforts to establish a clear and competitive
framework for labor relations, the absence of which remains a major impediment to investment.
Specific steps in this direction should include finalizing the implementing regulations associated
with the manpower and industrial disputes legislation, in a manner that protects workers’ rights
while maintaining labor flexibility. They urged that minimum wage increases be contained to
preserve competitiveness and reduce unemployment.
Directors underscored the need for progress in strengthening key institutions, particularly in the
legal and judicial areas, to enhance certainty with regard to property rights and contract
enforcement. In this regard, Directors urged the authorities to secure approval of the relevant
amendments to the bankruptcy law, and to support the ongoing efforts to strengthen the
administrative capacity of the judiciary and enhance its accountability and the public’s
confidence, including through establishing the planned Judicial Commission. It will also be
essential to push ahead with efforts to combat corruption and promote good governance by
taking the steps necessary to make the Anti-Corruption Commission fully operational, and by
expediting the establishment of the Anti-Corruption Court.
Directors welcomed the overall openness of Indonesia’s trade regime and the authorities’
commitment to further multilateral trade liberalization under the Doha round. They also
welcomed the government’s intention to allow temporary restrictive trade measures imposed in

-5recent years to expire as scheduled, and urged the authorities to refrain from imposing any new
restrictive measures.
Directors welcomed the use of post-program monitoring to maintain a close policy dialogue
between the Indonesian authorities and the Fund, which should aim to help support Indonesia’s
reform efforts to promote foreign direct investment, economic growth, and poverty alleviation.
Some Directors looked forward to early completion of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP).
