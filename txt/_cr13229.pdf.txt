STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 24, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. Saudi Arabia has been one of the best performing G-20 economies in recent
years and has played a key stabilizing role in the global oil market. Real GDP growth
averaged 6¼ percent per annum during 2008–12, third behind China and India.
Increased oil production in 2011 and 2012 helped prevent supply disturbances
elsewhere from having a detrimental impact on global growth.
Outlook and risks. The near-term economic outlook is positive. While oil output is likely
to fall relative to 2012 and the pace of government spending looks set to slow, growth in
the non-oil private sector should remain strong. Inflation has increased with rising food
prices, but is still moderate, while credit growth remains robust. The oil market is the
main source of risk, although large buffers provide fiscal space to smooth spending in
the medium-term.
Job creation in the private sector. Increased employment of Saudis in the private
sector will require a combination of reduced reliance on jobs in the public sector and
measures to improve the competitiveness of Saudi workers in the private sector. The
labor market reforms will lead to structural change, and careful coordination with other
policies will be needed to avoid unintended side effects.
Macroeconomic policy framework. Fiscal policy is withdrawing stimulus from the
economy and macro-prudential policy settings appear appropriate at present. Were
signs of inflationary pressures to emerge, then either spending projects would need to
be slowed or macro-prudential policies tightened, or both. A reduction in the non-oil
fiscal deficit is expected over the medium-term as infrastructure spending tapers off.
Policy measures on the revenue and expenditure side will be needed to further
strengthen the fiscal position and increase savings for future generations.
Fiscal policy and budget preparation. In recent years, the government has smoothed
oil price volatility and built significant buffers. Moving to a multi-year budgeting
framework that formally incorporates the impact of oil price volatility and integrates the
five-year National Development Plans would help strengthen budget formulation.

SAUDI ARABIA

CONTEXT
1.
Saudi Arabia has been one of the best performing G-20 economies in recent years. Real
GDP growth averaged 61 4 percent per annum during 2008–12, with the non-oil sector growing at an
even faster average rate of 7¾ percent (Figure 1). High oil prices and increased oil production have
resulted in a large increase in oil revenues and substantial external and fiscal surpluses, while
government debt has declined to less than 4 percent of GDP. Inflation in general has been relatively
moderate. Over a longer period, social development indicators have improved substantially.
2.
As the largest crude oil exporter and the only producer with significant spare capacity,
Saudi Arabia plays a systemic and stabilizing role in the global oil market. In 2011, Saudi Arabia
formally committed through the G-20 to use its systemic position in the oil market to promote
global stability. Saudi Arabia raised oil production to a 30-year high to ensure demand was met
following the abrupt decline in Libyan production in 2011 and continued geopolitical tensions
in 2012. This followed earlier episodes during the Gulf wars and the Venezuelan general strike when
Saudi Arabia increased production to ensure global markets were well supplied following
disruptions in other major producers. In the absence of these actions, it is likely that disturbances in
the oil market would have had a detrimental effect on global economic growth.
3.
Within the region, Saudi Arabia has committed financial support to a number of
countries in transition (Egypt, Jordan, Yemen, and Morocco) and to other GCC members
(Bahrain, Oman). The large remittance flows from expatriates working in Saudi Arabia also provide
important income flows to countries in the region and in south Asia. In addition, Saudi Arabia has
been a significant contributor of additional resources to multilateral programs, including the IMF’s
Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), and this has contributed to a strengthening in the
global financial system.
4.
The Saudi population is young and will continue to grow rapidly in the coming years.
Assuming rising labor force participation in line with past trends, the Saudi labor force is projected
to increase by 3½ percent a year over the course of the next decade. To prepare labor market
entrants to compete in and support a more diversified private sector, large investments in education
are being made, both domestically and abroad. As this young and increasingly well-educated
population enters into its working-age years, there is a tremendous opportunity to boost growth
and raise living standards further. However, Saudi unemployment, especially among the youth and
women, remains high.
5.
In recent years, the government has implemented a number of domestic reform
initiatives. In 2011, a jobseekers allowance and a strengthened quota system to increase the
employment of nationals were introduced. Infrastructure investment has been stepped up to ease
transportation bottlenecks and spending on education (domestically and abroad) and health has
increased. On the financial sector side, new mortgage legislation was passed in mid-2012 and is now
being implemented, and Basle III capital standards were implemented in January 2013.
Improvements in economic statistics are continuing.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
6.
The Saudi economy has grown strongly, benefitting from high oil prices and output,
strong private sector activity, and government fiscal spending. Following strong growth of
8.6 percent in 2011—spurred by higher oil output and large fiscal spending packages—the economy
grew at a slower, albeit still robust, rate of 5.1 percent in 2012 as oil output and government
spending growth slowed (Figure 2). During 2010–12, the non-oil private sector grew by an average
of 7.5 percent per annum, with the manufacturing, transport, and retail and wholesale sectors all
seeing double-digit growth (Box 1 discusses the recent revisions to the GDP data). Labor
productivity and TFP growth in the private sector have increased in recent years. High oil prices and
exports translated into another large external surplus in 2012, boosting gross international reserves
(Figure 3).
7.
Inflation has risen over the past year. CPI inflation fell to 2.5 percent in February 2012, but
increased to 3.8 percent in May 2013 as food and housing costs increased. Core inflation, which
excludes food and housing, is 2.6 percent.
8.
Following an expansionary fiscal stance in 2011, expenditure growth began to slow
in 2012. The non-oil primary deficit declined by ¼ percentage point of non-oil GDP, although in the
absence of the thirteenth month wage payment in 2012, the non-oil primary deficit would have
declined by over 2 percentage points of non-oil GDP. Owing to rising oil prices and output, the
overall fiscal balance remained high at 12.4 percent of GDP in 2012.
9.
Credit growth has remained strong, and the banking system is well-capitalized and
profitable. Growth in fiscal spending has contributed to continued robust growth in private sector
credit of over 16 percent and high levels of liquidity in the banking system. Lending by specialized
credit institutions has also increased. Consistent with the exchange rate peg and the monetary
policy stance in the U.S., SAMA has kept the repo and reverse repo rates unchanged. In recent
months, SAMA has stepped up the issuance of central bank bills and the volume of its reverse repo
transactions to absorb excess liquidity. The banking system remains well-capitalized, profitable, and
highly liquid. Non-performing loans (in percent of net loans) declined while provisioning increased.
Corporate profitability has recovered strongly in recent years (Box 2).
10.
Growth is creating jobs in the economy, but most of these have been filled by
expatriate labor. The labor force survey recorded a 2 million increase in employment between 2009
and 2012, but three-quarters of these jobs have gone to non-Saudis (Figure 4). The overall
unemployment rate is 5.8 percent, but amongst Saudis is measured at 12 percent, and is much
higher for youth (30 percent) and women (35 percent). While still very low, female participation has
increased in recent years.

Box 1. Revisions to National Accounts and CPI Data
The Central Department of Statistics and Information has recently released revised national
accounts and consumer price data— the national accounts have been revised for the period
since 2004, while the CPI has been revised for the period since 1988. In the national accounts, the
main reason for the revision is improved coverage of the non-oil sector in the recent
establishment census (2010), which

contrast to the previous estimate of
3.9 percent (top Figure). The key factor is non-oil GDP, for which the average real growth rate rose
to 8.4 percent from 5.3 percent. Investment (in percent of GDP) increased after the revision
from 19.8 percent to 22.8 percent on average, while consumption (in percent of GDP) declined
from 52.7 percent to 49.5 percent.
For the CPI, the revision updates the base year from 1999 to 2007 and consequently has revised
the weights on the subcomponent series. The weight on food and beverages has been reduced,
while that on rent, fuel, and utilities has

The near-term economic outlook remains positive. Overall real GDP growth is projected
at 4 percent in 2013 and 4.4 percent in 2014. Indicators such as point of sales transactions and the

spending will help maintain large, although reduced, fiscal and current account surpluses. In 2013,
the non-oil primary deficit is projected to narrow by 4 percent of non-oil GDP. Headline inflation is
expected to move modestly higher in the next few months, before easing toward year-end as food
price increases moderate, and average 4 percent in 2013 as a whole.
12.
Short-term risks around this central scenario appear balanced at this stage. These risks
include:


On the upside, a more positive global outlook or a supply shock in the global oil market triggered
by geopolitical events could translate into higher oil prices and exports and also help boost
domestic private consumption and investment spending. Stronger growth would also likely lead
to an increase in inflation pressures.



On the downside, if global economic conditions, including in key emerging market countries,
worsen, this would translate into lower oil demand and prices (see risk assessment matrix and
Box 3). However, fiscal buffers are large, and the authorities have space to smooth spending in the
medium-term in the event of an oil price drop.

13.
Longer-term, the outlook depends on the success of current reform initiatives and
global oil market developments. Over the next five years, oil output is projected to grow only
slowly at best, and the private sector will be the main driver of non-oil growth as fiscal spending is
likely to slow compared to the average of recent years. While it is always difficult to estimate, analysis
suggests that the potential growth rate of the non-oil economy could be around 5–6 percent.1
Together with the outlook for oil output, this would result in overall GDP growth of around
4¼ percent over the medium-term. Inflation is projected at 3.5 percent. Uncertainties include:


The oil market outlook: The projected increases in the production of unconventional oil in the
U.S. and Canada and the recovery in production in Iraq and Libya could result in a lower path for
oil production in Saudi Arabia than assumed in the baseline or a larger drop in oil prices. Both
options would see a more significant decline in oil export revenues, and if sustained would
eventually result in a bigger adjustment in fiscal spending. Looking beyond 2020, however,
projections by the IEA, BP and the EIA see demand for OPEC crude and oil prices rising.



The resilience of the private sector to slower government spending growth. The estimates of
medium-term non-oil growth potential could prove too optimistic in a situation where
government spending growth may be slower than in the past. On the upside, the large
government investments in infrastructure and education could translate into stronger than
projected growth in the private sector.

The most significant channel would be through oil prices
which decline by 15 percent after two years (relative to the

pace of fiscal spending could lead to a real GDP decline of
nearly 1.5 percent in 2013–14 before tapering off in the
medium-term. Impact on the banking system should be
small given that capital ratios are currently well above
regulatory norms and the high levels of liquidity.
Low
The most significant channel would be through oil prices,
although these decline by less than 10 percent in staff
simulations (after 5 years, relative to the baseline). Real
GDP could decline by almost 0.5 percent in the mediumterm. Direct financial linkages are relatively modest. Banks
do not rely on wholesale funding and total credit
exposure to Europe is less than 5 percent of total assets.
High
Fiscal and external revenues would fall, and private sector
confidence would likely decline. The government has
fiscal and external buffers to smooth key expenditures in
the medium-term, while banks are well-capitalized and
liquid. However, the depletion of buffers would entail a
more negative impact as government expenditures adjust,
adversely affecting non-oil growth and bank balance
sheets.

Rising youth unemployment and a deteriorating housing
situation may have social implications. The government
would likely respond by increasing public sector
employment and wages, but this would increase risks to
lower oil prices.

Higher production and prices would translate into higher
oil exports and government revenues. In the mediumterm, this would support higher fiscal expenditure and

SAUDI ARABIA

Box 3. Interconnectedness and Spillovers
The Saudi economy is linked to the global economy through multiple channels. These linkages are
both structural and policy oriented.


Oil market: The systemic role of Saudi Arabia in the oil market constitutes the most important
channel through which the country affects, and is affected by, the global economy.1 Saudi
Arabia is the only country with significant spare production capacity and it has used this to be a
stabilizing force in the global oil market. Oil revenues account for over 80 percent of export
revenues and 90 percent of budget revenues. Hence, oil market developments have a direct
impact on the Saudi economy through fiscal policy, the main channel, as well as consumer and
business optimism and FDI.



Remittances: With about 7 million non-Saudis officially employed in the domestic economy,
remittances constitute an important external spillover channel. This is particularly true for
countries such as Jordan, Egypt, Yemen, and Sudan where Saudi Arabia accounts for over
25 percent of total remittance inflows.



External wealth. A large portion of the oil receipts have been invested in international financial
markets. A large and persistent drop in oil prices could cause a reversal of these outflows.
Normalization of monetary policy in the advanced countries may also result in losses on asset
holdings.



Monetary policy and the fixed exchange rate. With the exchange rate pegged to the dollar and a
relatively open capital account, there is limited scope for interest rates to diverge from
U.S. interest rates. However, developing Asia, particularly China, is increasingly driving the global
oil market, meaning that the Saudi business cycle is becoming less connected to the U.S.



Imports. Saudi Arabia relies heavily on imported goods and services, particularly food products.
Exports to Saudi Arabia account for a significant share of total exports for Jordan, Ethiopia,
Egypt, Lebanon, and Syria. At the same time, large swings in international prices or in the value
of the U.S. dollar can have a significant impact on prices.



Foreign aid and outward FDI. Saudi Arabia is a generous provider of aid and financial assistance,
particularly in the Middle East region. It is also a major source of FDI in the MENA region.

Spillovers from Saudi Arabia to the region and the impact of the interconnectedness of the Saudi
and global economies were considered in detail in last year’s consultation.2 The results of a GVAR
model showed that the Saudi economy is more susceptible to an output shock in China than in the
euro area or the U.S. Relative to shocks in China or advanced economies, a shock to oil prices would
have a much bigger impact on Saudi Arabian GDP. Furthermore, real GDP in other GCC countries as
well as in Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria respond strongly to non-oil GDP in Saudi Arabia.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Demographic pressures due to a rapidly growing and young population are posing a
challenge for policy makers in terms of creating jobs, addressing housing needs, and
managing the demand on the natural resources of the country. Reforms are underway to
address some of these challenges. Meanwhile, the global oil market is likely to be less
favorable for Saudi Arabia in the next few years than it has been over the past decade. In
this context, discussions focused on two main areas; (i) policies to address economic and
social issues—high unemployment, housing, and rising energy consumption, and (ii)
maintaining macroeconomic stability while sustaining strong non-oil growth.

A. Dealing with Demographic Pressures
Employing a growing working age population
14.
Within the labor market, Saudis are primarily employed in the public sector, nonSaudis dominate employment in the private sector, and female labor force participation is low.
Government employment is an important channel for oil wealth distribution, and is an attractive
employment option for many Saudi workers. Within the private sector, the wholesale and retail trade
and construction sectors, which rely on foreign labor, have been the key drivers of private sector
growth, while sectors where Saudis are willing or able to work have remained small. Despite total
employment growth averaging near 8.5 percent, Saudi employment growth was 4.6 percent
in 2010-12.
15.
A large number of young people will enter the labor market in the next decade and
beyond, and creating a sufficient number of rewarding jobs for them in the private sector will
be a challenge. Based on historical experience, there is some uncertainty about the private sector’s
ability to absorb new labor market entrants. If Demographics and Employment in Saudi Arabia, 2012–22

would be expected to decline. These estimates illustrate the challenge arising from demographic
change and rising labor participation rates.
16.
Measures to boost inclusive growth and jobs in the non-oil sector are continuing.
Reforms over the past two decades have strengthened the economy, and Saudi Arabia scores well on
the World Bank’s Doing Business Index (DBI) and the WEF’s Global Competitiveness Report (GCR).
Spending on infrastructure to develop transportation networks and create a number of economic
cities is aimed at strengthening growth in the private sector. The authorities are also placing a strong
focus on the development of the SME sector through improvements in the business climate such as
the streamlining of procedures to register a business, increased financing through banks and special
credit institutions, credit scoring of SMEs, and training for potential entrepreneurs on how to run a
business. In addition, the trade liberalization being discussed within the GCC and a further opening
up to foreign direct investment in currently restricted sectors such as transportation would be
supportive of the growth environment.
17.
Labor market policies are aimed at improving skills and raising private sector
employment of Saudi workers. Investments in education have quadrupled enrollments in tertiary
education over the last 15 years, aiming to raise the productivity of Saudi workers and their ability to
access high-paying private sector jobs. Since 2011, labor market reforms have been implemented
focusing on a broad set of measures: (i) a revamped quota system (Nitaqat) that encourages firms to
hire Saudis and imposes sanctions on non-compliant firms; (ii) a jobseekers allowance (Hafiz) which
provides financial support to young job-seekers over a 12-month period; (iii) an increased minimum
wage in the public sector; (iv) a “de facto” minimum wage for nationals in the private sector via the
implementation of Nitaqat credits; and (v) active labor market policies and expanded job placement
services. Meanwhile, public sector hiring of Saudis has continued.
18.
The authorities explained that they are in the process of further developing labor
market policies to improve the competitiveness of Saudi workers, including by:


Using fees imposed on companies with a majority of expatriate workers to finance an expansion
in the scope and duration of time-bound wage subsidies for Saudi workers in companies that are
compliant with Nitaqat requirements.



Considering an unemployment assistance scheme to provide a broad social safety net, while
simultaneously looking at measures to improve the employment flexibility of Saudi workers.



Improving the internal mobility and bargaining power of expatriate workers currently employed
in firms that are not compliant with Nitaqat requirements.



Increasing opportunities for female employment, with specific sectors (e.g. retail) being targeted.

19.
The authorities and staff agreed that increasing the employment of Saudi nationals in
the private sector is a priority and will require careful implementation of labor market policies.
It will take time for these initiatives to take effect. At this stage, the data show that the considerable
initial take-up of Hafiz has tapered off as people have reached the 12-month limit on benefits, and

an unclear impact of Nitaqat.3 Unemployment assistance benefits should be set at a level and
duration to not discourage employment. With rising education levels amongst women, it will be
important to consider additional ways of further expanding employment opportunities to utilize their
human capital, such as improving childcare facilities, improving public transportation, and using
flexible work arrangements such as teleworking. Unemployment of highly educated women in Saudi
Arabia is high by international standards, and this reduces the productive potential of the economy.
Consultation with private sector employers including on any further increases in fees on foreign
workers could help manage the macroeconomic impact of the reforms, and wage subsidies should
be monitored to ensure they benefit Saudi workers.
20.
Investments in education are appropriate, and it will be important to continue
strengthening the quality of education and addressing skill mismatches in the private sector.
While spending on education clearly takes time to yield results, tracking indicators is important to
ensure that progress is being made and government resources are being used efficiently. For
example, scores of Saudi students on internationally standardized tests in mathematics and science
are still relatively low (see Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, 2011) (Figure 3).
21.
As labor market reforms move forward, it will be important to ensure coordination
with government policies elsewhere. In the near-term, with large infrastructure projects continuing
and the building of new housing a priority, labor market policies that reduce the availability of expatriate
labor may create bottlenecks in the economy. More generally, if efforts to boost the employment of
Saudis in the private sector are to be successful, a reduced reliance on public sector jobs will be needed.
Further, good data, including on wage developments, are needed to assess the impact of the reforms.
Housing an expanding population
22.
An expanded supply of housing is needed to meet demographic trends and reduce
pressure on rents. Urbanization, population growth, and smaller average sized households have
boosted demand for housing. The lack of affordable housing saw a sharp increase in rents
during 2007–11, which was one of the main drivers of inflation. The authorities stressed their
multifaceted approach to addressing the housing situation by: (i) passing new mortgage legislation
to increase access to housing finance; (ii) developing affordable housing by providing land and no
interest loans to nationals—loans are provided through the Real Estate Development Fund (REDF), a
specialized credit institution; and (iii) the proposed establishment of a real estate refinancing
company under the umbrella of the Public Investment Fund.
23.
Staff agreed that efforts to expand access to housing are appropriate and could make
an important contribution to inclusive growth going forward. The new mortgage law should
increase the availability of mortgage finance, and regulatory and supervisory guidelines have been
put in place to cover non-bank institutions as they enter the mortgage market.

Taming domestic energy consumption
24.
There was broad agreement that, with a growing population, domestic energy
consumption is likely to continue to rise sharply in the absence of policy reforms. Saudi Arabia
has one of the highest levels of energy consumption per capita in the world and one of the lowest
prices (for consumers and businesses). The pricing structure provides incentives for investment in
energy-intensive industries and could result in continuing rapid growth in domestic energy
consumption. If domestic consumption continues to grow at current rates it will reach more
than 20 percent of output by 2018 (16 percent currently).
25.
Staff recommended that the authorities start planning for an upward adjustment in
domestic energy prices. An increase in energy prices over time would help curb the rapid growth of
domestic consumption, reduce existing incentives in the growth model toward energy intensive
industries, and strengthen the fiscal position. While low energy prices are one of the ways that oil
wealth is distributed to the population, the benefits are heavily skewed toward the better off.
However, an increase in energy prices would have an adverse impact on poor and vulnerable groups
and compensatory measures would need to be put in place. Energy intensive industries would need
time to adjust their production and cost structures to remain competitive. International experience
with energy price reform suggests that such a policy adjustment will need to be well-planned,
phased, and clearly explained and communicated to the population and businesses.
26.
The authorities emphasized that they were taking steps to contain the growth of
domestic energy demand and expand alternative sources of energy supply. Measures on the
demand side are primarily focused on improving energy efficiency through strengthening building and
appliance standards. On the supply side, energy sources are being diversified by continuing to develop
gas and investing in solar energy to meet domestic needs. An increase in energy prices could be
considered subsequent to the development of public transportation options, as planned over the
medium-term.

B. Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability while Achieving Long-Term
Development Goals
27.
Maintaining macroeconomic stability and achieving development goals will require
vigilance toward possible overheating risks, continued strong financial supervision, and fiscal
reforms. The macroeconomic policy stance appears appropriate at present, although the authorities
will need to remain vigilant and adjust policy settings if overheating pressures were to emerge.
Measures to promote financial development should continue to be supported by strong regulation
and supervision. While large fiscal buffers give the authorities the fiscal space to smooth government
spending over the medium-term in the face of volatile oil revenues, fiscal reforms to further develop
budget management and ensure the quality of spending could help achieve development goals.

Near-term macroeconomic policies
28.
Inflation has increased and will need careful monitoring in the period ahead. Headline
inflation has picked-up since the middle of 2012 to 3.8 percent in May 2013. Looking forward, there
are likely to be a number of competing factors driving inflation. Seasonal pressures around Ramadan
and Hajj may push inflation higher in the coming months, before it moderates toward the end of the
year. Factors that should limit inflationary pressures include the relatively subdued global growth
outlook, which will likely keep imported inflation in check. On-the-other-hand, the higher cost of
labor that may result from ongoing labor market reforms could see prices increase—depending on
how companies behave—and continued strong growth in the non-oil sector may test the capacity of
the domestic economy. Increased access to finance could also see sustained strong credit growth
and an increase in the relative demand for non-tradeables, particularly housing.
29.
Under the fixed exchange rate, SAMA relies primarily on macro-prudential tools to
manage demand and systemic financial sector risks. The macro-prudential framework has proven
effective and served SAMA well during the global financial crisis. SAMA’s regulatory loan-to-deposit
and reserve requirement ratios constitute the main policy tools. Capital and provisioning buffers are
facilitated through frequent consultations with banks. SAMA has encouraged banks to provision in a
countercyclical way, and provisioning levels have been rebuilt since the financial crisis. Staff
suggested that a formal, clear, and transparent macro-prudential framework would more explicitly
codify SAMA’s current practices. SAMA indicated that they are examining international experiences
as they consider possible revisions to their framework.
30.
Following an expansionary fiscal policy stance in 2011, the government has begun to
set the budget on an adjustment path. The increase in current and capital expenditures in 2011
resulted in a large increase in the non-oil primary deficit.4 The non-oil primary deficit began to adjust
in 2012 as the government moderated spending growth (and it would have fallen further in the
absence of the thirteenth month wage payment and higher spending from the government surplus
fund).5 Estimates suggest that the non-oil deficit will fall significantly further in 2013 as expenditure
growth slows, partly as the one-off spending in 2012 unwinds. It should be noted, however, that to
achieve the fiscal outcome projected in 2013, spending could exceed the budgeted amount by
14 percent, a smaller amount than seen in recent years, although one that is consistent with previous
years of flat oil prices. This will require firm control of line ministry requests for additional within year
spending.
31.
Staff viewed macroeconomic policy settings as appropriate at present, but emphasized
the need for vigilance on inflation against the background of continued strong growth in the
non-oil sector. Fiscal policy is withdrawing stimulus from the economy this year (as measured by the
declining non-oil primary balance) which will help manage demand and reduce pressures on
inflation. This is appropriate given the limited role of monetary policy under the peg. Macro4

The non-oil primary deficit is driven by government spending in Saudi Arabia, and is considered by staff as the best
measure of the impact of fiscal policy on the non-oil economy and aggregate demand more generally.

prudential policy settings appear appropriate at present. Were signs of inflationary pressures to
emerge beyond expected seasonal effects or credit growth to accelerate significantly further, then
either spending projects would need to be slowed or macro-prudential policies tightened, or both.
32.
The authorities saw limited risks of overheating in the near-term. While they viewed the
staff’s 2013 growth projection as pessimistic, believing the momentum in the non-oil private sector
would be stronger given ongoing reforms, they expected that the open Saudi economy, the subdued
global economic outlook, and falling global food prices would all have a moderating impact on
inflation, albeit with some lag. While wages could increase as a result of labor market reforms, they
are only a small component of overall business costs, so an increase would have a limited impact on
profitability and prices. Investments in housing were expected to contribute to reduced pressures on
rent, and supply bottlenecks in construction were already being addressed through increased
imports of key materials such as cement and better sequencing of capital projects.
Financial sector development and the exchange rate
33.
There was agreement on the need to maintain financial stability while promoting
financial development, which is a key part of the authorities’ agenda to boost private sector
growth (Box 4). The banking sector is well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable, and non-performing
loans have continued to decline.6 The authorities noted that Saudi Arabia was among the first
countries to implement Basle III capital standards, and saw no difficulties for Saudi banks in meeting
the capital, liquidity, and leverage ratios set out by the Basle Committee. Progress has been made in
implementing many of the recommendations of the 2011 FSAP update (Appendix I). SAMA has
tightened single-borrower limits in practice, developed system-wide stress tests, and is in the process
of revising insurance regulations. Since the passage of the mortgage law in July 2012, loan-to-value
ratios for mortgages have been put in place, and non-bank institutions entering the mortgage
market will be licensed and supervised by SAMA. Increased lending to the SME sector is being
supported by a strengthened credit information system and improvements to the accounting and
managerial capacities of entrepreneurs. New prudential and listing rules issued by the Capital
Markets Authority are aimed at deepening financial markets, while limiting speculation and
enhancing investor protection. Opening the equity market to direct foreign participation is being
considered, but would be done in a cautious way. While the government does not intend to issue
debt for the purposes of developing a yield curve, public sector entities have recently increased
Sukuk issuance. While actions have been taken to further strengthen the AML/CFT regime, the CFT
bill has not been enacted yet. Staff noted that as the mortgage market expands, the further
development of existing indicators to monitor the housing market will be important, with a reliable
house price index a key need.

6

Staff analysis on Saudi bank-by-bank data shows that NPLs are strongly negatively correlated with growth in the
non-oil sector as well as oil prices, i.e. a drop in non-oil sector growth or oil prices would increase NPLs.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAUDI ARABIA

Box 4. Financial Deepening
Financial intermediation is dominated by banks. A significant share of bank lending is directed
towards consumption—consumer spending and commerce account for over half of bank credit—
suggesting banks could contribute more towards private investment, particularly with respect to
SMEs and residential real estate. Deeper equity and fixed income markets could provide alternative
saving instruments and allow companies to attract large deposits of excess liquidity trapped in the
banking system.


SME finance: The government has recapitalized its two SCIs that lend to SMEs and has tried to
better integrate its effort with the banking system by guaranteeing up to 80 percent of SME
loans (Kafala program). Improvements in the availability of credit information on SMEs, together
with enhanced accounting and managerial standards and training programs for entrepreneurs
(being implemented in conjunction with the IFC) could help boost the provision of credit by
banks to this sector.



Real estate finance: Although real-estate finance by banks to individuals has grown by more than
25 percent a year since early 2011, it still accounts for less than 5 percent of bank credit. The new
mortgage legislation addresses issues in the legal framework with respect to foreclosure
procedures and should make banks more willing to accept real estate as collateral. It also lays
the foundation for the creation of non-deposit mortgage finance companies. Going forward, this
is expected to help improve access to housing while broadening the availability of investment
instruments for financial institutions.



Equity markets: The equity market has seen substantial growth, but remains dominated by
individual investors and state institutions. The private institutional investor base is small. Allowing
foreigners to invest in the equity market would deepen the investor base and improve liquidity.



Fixed income markets: Sovereign debt has declined, and there is no secondary trading. Currently,
the government has no plans to issue debt for the purpose of capital market development.
However, the Sukuk market saw significant growth in 2012 with quasi-government agencies and
corporate issuance almost tripling to $10.5 billion.

34.
The fixed exchange rate remains appropriate given the current structure of the Saudi
economy. The peg to the U.S. dollar provides credibility to monetary policy and stability to trade,

external sustainability calculation), do not yield clear conclusions on whether the current account is at
the appropriate level (text table, and Appendix II). Over time, as the structure of the economy continues
to evolve, both in terms of macroeconomic linkages and as a result of ongoing labor market reforms,
the costs and benefits of the peg may change, and staff suggested its appropriateness should be
periodically reviewed in coordination with other GCC countries. In the meantime, reforms that would
support a more flexible arrangement if it becomes appropriate at a later date, such as strengthening
the liquidity forecasting framework, should continue.
Fiscal policy
35.
The fiscal position is strong, with risks mainly stemming from oil prices. In recent years,
the government has smoothed oil price volatility, run large budget surpluses, and built significant
buffers against a possible drop in oil revenues by lowering outstanding debt to less than 4 percent of
GDP and building deposits at the central bank of 58 percent of GDP, sufficient to cover
some 20 months of spending.7 Nevertheless, the fiscal breakeven price—the price needed to balance
the budget at current expenditure levels—has risen in recent years, and the biggest fiscal risk is from
a sustained drop in oil prices (see Figure 5).
36.
Against this background, there are three main priorities for fiscal policy. Besides
managing aggregate demand in the near term (see paragraph 31), fiscal policy needs to manage the
volatility of oil revenues to ensure that there are no abrupt and procyclical adjustments in planned
government expenditures due to swings in the oil price. Over the longer-term, a third important
priority is to ensure that oil revenues realized today benefit future as well as current generations,
both through financial saving and by efficient government investment that supports stronger growth
in the future.

7

Two scenarios were developed to consider the adequacy of fiscal buffers. First, under a scenario where the oil price
drops by one standard deviation (which puts the WEO oil price at $95 a barrel in 2013 and declining to $53 a barrel in
2018, and steady thereafter), and expenditures do not adjust, government deposits would fall to zero and debt would
rise to 50 percent of GDP by 2021. Second, under a scenario where oil prices fall to $80/barrel in 2013 and beyond,
existing fiscal buffers would get exhausted by 2025. Of course, the adjustment of government spending to the lower
oil price, which would be expected to happen as it did in the 1980s and 1990s, would prolong the period before
which fiscal buffers are exhausted in both scenarios.

37.
Staff suggested that the concept of a structural budget balance would be useful as a
way of managing the volatility of oil revenues. The structural budget balance is a measure of the
underlying fiscal position once oil revenue volatility (caused by temporary price or output
fluctuations) is excluded.8 Based on this

zero would entail a slowing in the pace of fiscal spending, as envisaged in the baseline scenario. Real
expenditure is expected to be flat over the medium term due to an unwinding of the surge in capital
expenditure, which is anticipated to fall by 2 percentage points of GDP, and restraint in the wage bill
that is projected to remain constant in real terms. This implies an adjustment in the non-oil deficit of
close to 14 percent of non-oil GDP between 2012 and 2018. Over time, aiming for a positive

For this calculation, structural revenues are estimated by assuming that the long-term oil price is the average oil
price from past five years. Long-term oil output is computed as a three year moving average including the current
year. The structural balance is then computed as structural revenues less total expenditures.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

SAUDI ARABIA

structural budget balance (which would imply a larger decline in the non-oil deficit over the
medium-term) would increase saving for intergenerational purposes. At present, the non-oil primary
deficit is well above its sustainable level as estimated from a model that considers the savings that
would need to be accumulated to finance government spending when oil reserves are exhausted.10
38.
Staff recommended a number of policy measures to ensure the non-oil fiscal deficit is
reduced further in 2018 and beyond. These included: (i) keeping government wages and salaries
under firm control; (ii) developing non-oil revenue sources (VAT and excise taxes) in line with the
expanding non-oil economy; (iii) raising domestic energy prices gradually over time; and (iv) ensuring
the quality and efficiency of spending, including by paying close attention to outcomes in the health,
education, and infrastructure sectors to ensure that the objectives of this spending are being met.
The authorities anticipated that the non-oil fiscal deficit would decline over time as large investments
in infrastructure taper off. Together with education spending, these investments would boost growth
prospects in the non-oil private sector.
39.
Fiscal reforms could further develop budget management processes and ensure the
quality of government spending to achieve development goals. Fiscal management has been
strengthened over the past decade, and the volatility of government spending has declined.
Nevertheless, spending (both capital and current) has consistently exceeded budgeted amounts by a
wide margin—26 percent on average since 2006. Staff suggested that while the current system has
the advantage of building spending buffers into the budget process, it reduces the information
content of the initial budget, makes expenditure planning more difficult, and raises the risk that
inefficient spending takes place. Consideration could therefore be given to moving to a budget
preparation framework where the expenditure envelope is set based on an overall target for the
structural balance that is determined based on longer-term fiscal goals. The authorities thought this
framework could be useful, but stressed the need for flexibility given large uncertainties relating to
long-term oil prices.
40.
Staff emphasized the benefits of developing a formal medium-term budget
framework, establishing a macro-fiscal unit, and publishing fiscal data in GFSM 2001 format.
This would better integrate the five-year National Development Plan into the annual budget
planning process, look at the impact of current year commitments in a multi-year setting, and
identify fiscal risks on both the revenue and expenditure side. To support this framework and
strengthen controls on line ministries, the planned introduction of the Government Financial
Management Information System (GFMIS) is important. The establishment of a macro-fiscal unit in
the Ministry of Finance would also help in linking budget policies to macroeconomic objectives and
in deepening the understanding of how fiscal decisions affect the real economy. Lastly, fiscal
planning and transparency would be helped by the production and publication of data in line with
10

The sustainable level of the non-oil primary deficit is estimated by (i) projecting oil revenues based on proven
reserves and an assumed path for future oil prices, and (ii) calculating the constant annuity in real per capita terms
that can be derived by investing the oil revenues. Staff estimates indicate that the sustainable level of the non-oil
primary deficit is 30 percent of non-oil GDP in 2013. Higher (lower) oil prices would allow a greater (smaller) non-oil
primary deficit.

GFSM2001 standards. The authorities responded that they were working to strengthen public
financial management through the introduction of GFMIS, and with the assistance of Fund technical
assistance were moving toward implementing GFSM2001.
41.
Early action to address shortfalls in pensions funding could help reduce future fiscal
risks. Discussions with the two main pension agencies —the Public Pension Fund (PPF) and the
General Organization for Social Insurance (GOSI)—indicated that contributions are not sufficient to
fully fund retirement benefits on an individual basis. While this shortfall will be covered for many
years by favorable demographics, it will eventually become a fiscal cost. The lesson from the very
difficult situation in many of the industrial countries at present is that it is much better to address
these pension issues at an early stage and well ahead of the time when the currently young
population is nearer to retirement age.
Economic statistics
42.
Considerable progress has been made in improving the quality and availability of key
economic statistics. In particular, the authorities have released revised national accounts and
rebased CPI data, have published IIP data for 2007–11, are working to improve the coverage of
financial flows in the balance of payments, and have submitted FSI indicators on a quarterly basis
(although they are not yet published). These are important achievements. Further progress is needed,
however, in the areas of government finance, national accounts, labor, and real estate market
statistics, as well as in implementing the action plan agreed with the recent technical assistance
mission on the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standards.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
The economy is growing strongly, the outlook is positive, and risks are broadly
balanced. Saudi Arabia has been one of the best performing G-20 economies in recent years.
In 2013, non-oil private sector growth is projected be strong, although a decline in oil output and a
slowdown in the pace of fiscal spending are expected to see overall GDP growth slow to 4 percent
from 5.1 percent in 2012. Inflation has picked up since mid-2012, driven largely by food prices. Risks
to the growth outlook are balanced and center around the outlook for the oil market and the success
of the domestic reform program currently being implemented by the government.
44.
Saudi Arabia plays a systemic and stabilizing role in the global oil market. In line with
this role, Saudi Arabia increased oil production in 2011 and 2012 to help prevent supply disturbances
in other countries from having a negative impact on global growth. Within the Middle East region,
Saudi Arabia is a generous provider of financial assistance, and large remittance flows from
expatriates working in the country provide important income flows to countries in the region and in
south Asia.
45.
The Saudi population is young and will continue to grow rapidly in the coming years.
As this young and increasingly well-educated population enters into its working-age years, there is a

SAUDI ARABIA

tremendous opportunity to boost growth and raise living standards further. Of course, there will also
be challenges in terms of creating jobs, addressing housing needs, and managing demand on the
natural resources of the country. Reforms are underway to address some of these challenges and
sustain strong private sector growth as government spending slows, including in the areas of job
creation, housing, infrastructure development, and increased financing and support of the SME
sector.
46.
Staff supports initiatives to improve the competitiveness of Saudi workers in the
private sector, but these need to be carefully implemented and coordinated with other
policies. Investments in education are appropriate to strengthen the skills of the Saudi population,
but the quality of education needs to be carefully monitored, while labor market policies are being
developed to increase the employment of Saudi nationals (including women) in the private sector.
Consultations with private sector employers could help manage any macroeconomic impact from
labor market reforms. Changes in the availability of foreign labor could create bottlenecks, and
coordination with macroeconomic policies will be needed. At the same time, it will be important to
reduce the reliance in the economy on public sector jobs.
47.
Saudi Arabia is pursuing policies to contain the growth in domestic energy demand
and develop alternative energy sources. With one of the highest levels of energy consumption per
capita in the world, the government is following a number of policies to improve energy
conservation and develop gas and solar energy. However, an upward adjustment of energy prices
over time is needed to curb consumption growth. It is essential that lower income groups are not
affected by such changes, and measures would need to be in place to compensate them for higher
prices. A phased approach would allow businesses time to adjust their cost structure and maintain
competitiveness.
48.
Macroeconomic policies need to remain vigilant for signs of overheating. Fiscal policy
looks set to appropriately slow the pace of spending growth this year to help contain demand
pressures. Macroprudential policy settings appear appropriate at present. Were signs of inflationary
pressures to emerge, then either capital spending projects would need to be slowed or macroprudential policy tightened, or both. Over the medium-term, the non-oil fiscal deficit is expected to
decline as infrastructure spending tapers off, but policy measures on the revenue and expenditure
side will be needed to further strengthen the fiscal position and increase savings for future
generations.
49.
Measures to promote financial development should continue in step with ongoing
reforms to strengthen financial sector regulation and supervision. Saudi Arabia was among the
first countries to implement Basle III capital standards for the banking system, which remains wellcapitalized, liquid, and profitable. With the passage of the mortgage law, a regulatory and
supervisory framework is appropriately being put in place for non-bank institutions entering the
market. The further development of a reliable house price index will be needed to help monitor
developments in the housing sector as exposures to the mortgage market increase.

50.
From a position of strength, now is a good time to consider fiscal reforms that would
further develop budget management and ensure the quality of government spending to
achieve development goals. As fiscal management has been strengthened over the past decade,
the volatility of government spending has declined. The budget process could be further
strengthened by moving to a medium-term budget framework that better integrates the five-year
National Development Plans and sets the expenditure envelope based on a long-term estimate of
the oil price. This would help strengthen the alignment of the budget with macroeconomic goals and
improve expenditure planning. This could be supported by the establishment of a macro-fiscal unit,
the introduction of the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS), and the
publication of fiscal data in GFSM2001 format.
51.
Considerable progress has been made in improving the quality and availability of key
economic statistics. Further progress is needed, however, particularly in the areas of government
finance, national accounts, labor, and real estate market statistics. Moving ahead to subscribe to the
IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standards is an important and achievable goal.
52.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Appendix I: Key Recommendations of 2011 FSAP Update
Recommendation

Progress
Bank and Securities Regulation



Update the BCL and remove need for ministerial
approval of certain SAMA decisions.

SAMA’s assessment is that the existing BCL has
provided a strong basis for effective supervision.
Ministerial approval is only required in times of
extreme stress and is viewed by SAMA as a means
of ensuring communication with Cabinet.



No longer allow large exposure up to 50 percent
of bank’s own capital.

There have been no changes in the legislation.
However, SAMA expects banks to ensure that their
single exposure limit should not exceed 15 percent
of capital and reserves.



Strengthen the CMA’s regulatory transparency by
fully disclosing all enforcement actions,
interpretation, and funding rules.

The CMA has established an internal committee to
discuss relevant FSAP recommendations, including
disclosure policies.

Systemic Stability



Introduce a formal liquidity forecasting
framework.

SAMA is currently working on a formal liquidity
forecasting model.



Enhance data on cross-border financial activities
of banks and corporate.

SAMA published the International Investment
position in 2012 (annual basis), and submitted ten
core indicators of FSI to the IMF in March 2013. It is
planning to submit locational and consolidated
bank data to the BIS.



Maintain a stable stock of government securities
and regular issues to help anchor a robust yield
curve

There are no plans to increase and maintain a stable
stock of government securities. However, public
sector entities have recently increased sukuk
issuance, and eventually this could help in
establishing a proxy government benchmark.



Introduce a payment system law.

The authorities believe that the current legal
framework is adequate and serving the purpose
well.



Conduct stress tests with a wider range of shocks,
including liquidity shocks, on regular basis and
incorporate lessons into supervision.

Detailed rules on stress testing were issued in
November 2011, making stress testing mandatory.
SAMA has also developed a system-wide stress test,
covering credit, market, operational and liquidity
risks.



Establish a formal early warning system (EWS) for
the banking sector.

SAMA considers that its current off-site surveillance
system is adequate as a EWS.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35

SAUDI ARABIA

Recommendation

Progress



Develop a more formal and transparent
macroprudential policy framework, drawing on
work in international fora.

SAMA is actively participating in the international
fora on macro-prudential frameworks and will
review its framework in line with emerging best
practices. Considerable coordination already takes
place between SAMA and MoF and between SAMA
and the Capital Markets Authority (CMA).



Strengthen the legal framework for bank
resolution

The authorities will assess the need for any further
steps required to strengthen the existing bank
resolution framework.

Expanding Access to Finance and Preserving Financial Stability



As housing finance expands in the future, ensure
loan soundness through strong prudential
measures, notably lowering permissible loan-tovalue and debt service ratios.

Although housing loans continue to grow, SAMA
believes that the current prudential measures that
are in place will ensure that banks are managing the
associated risks prudently. LTV ratios have been
capped at 70 percent. Housing finance companies
that may enter the market will be licensed and
supervised by SAMA.



Contract banks to manage both the existing and
new Real Estate Development Fund (REDF)
portfolio.

As of now there are no plans to allow banks to
manage the portfolio of REDF.



Complement mortgage reform by establishing a
housing market observatory, developing
consumer guidance options, and strengthening
the developer industry.

A separate Ministry of Housing has been
established, which will look into these and any other
related issues.



Prepare long-term funding solution for mortgage
finance, starting with a refinance facility.

REDF is considering several options to enhance its
integration with the banking sector, including longterm funding facility. A mortgage refinancing
company will be established under the Public
Investment Fund (PIF).



Create a modern, electronic and unified registry
for movable collateral.

The authorities will assess the need to further study
the proposal.



Enact and implement the draft Enforcement law

The Mortgage Law, which includes the Enforcement
Law, has already been enacted.

that introduces specialized enforcement courts
operating with strict time-bound procedures.



36

Closely supervise the quality of SME units in the
banks, including the robustness or their internal
rating systems and automated procedures.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

All banks have been required to set up their own
separate SME units in order to more effectively deal
with SME financing.

SAUDI ARABIA

Recommendation

Progress

Insurance, Institutional Investors, and Capital Markets



Finalize and issue the outstanding functional
regulations for insurance

SAMA has expedited all outstanding regulations,
except corporate governance regulations which are
in draft phase. Two regulations; actuarial and audit
committee are in the final stage for publication.



Improve enforcement of mandatory motor third
party liability insurance

SAMA and the joint working group are meeting
regularly and are in the final stage of improving the
implementation of motor TPL enforcement.



Disclose the investment policies, portfolio, and
portfolio performance of the Public Pension
Agency (PPA) and General Organization for Social
Insurance (GOSI).

There have been no changes in the disclosure
policies of PPA and GOSI. GOSI has established a
committee to discus disclosure issues.



Further outsource the management of portfolio
of the PPA and GOSI.

PPA and GOSI have no plans to outsource part of
their domestic portfolio. The foreign portfolios are
outsourced to a large degree.



Permit foreign international investors to invest
directly in Tadawul.

The CMA is considering whether to allow foreign
investors to invest directly in the equity market.
Such steps would be adopted carefully and
gradually.

Appendix II: External Sustainability and Exchange Rate
Assessment
Estimates from current account assessment methodologies tailored to oil exporters give inconclusive
results about whether the current account surplus is at an appropriate level, although estimates suggest
the real exchange rate is in line with its long-run relationship with real oil prices. Staff believes the peg to
the U.S. dollar is appropriate given the current structure of the Saudi economy.
1.
Increased current account surpluses in 2011–12 were driven by higher oil prices and
increased oil production as Saudi Arabia acted to help offset supply shocks in the global oil
market. Oil prices are anticipated to decline over the medium term while oil export volumes are
expected to adjust as supply conditions normalize, implying significantly reduced current account
surpluses going forward. Errors and omissions are large and consistently negative, suggesting
unrecorded capital outflows. Over the long term, the current account will be determined by the nature
of the development strategy chosen—in particular the balance between saving oil revenues overseas
to create an income stream for future generations versus investment (public and private) within Saudi
Arabia.
2.
In recent years, the share of Saudi non-oil exports in global non-oil exports has
increased as the authorities have pursued economic diversification, particularly in
petrochemicals. Despite the increase, Saudi non-oil exports in 2011 were less than 1/3 of 1 percent of
global non-oil exports. In terms of metrics of external vulnerability, the Saudi external situation is very
comfortable. Foreign exchange reserves covered 34 months of imports and 175 percent of broad
money in 2012, while external assets stood at 122 percent of GDP in 2011 and external liabilities at
35 percent of GDP (of which portfolio and other investments amounted to 7 percent of GDP). The
financial account, excluding official reserves, is dominated by direct investment inflows and portfolio
outflows.
3.
Despite terms of trade gains, the
real exchange rate has appreciated by only
2 percent since the end of 2008.1 Following a
period of an annual average depreciation of
4 percent between 2002 and 2007, the tradeweighted real effective exchange rate (REER)
index appreciated by 11 percent in 2008
(Figure 1). The nominal effective exchange rate
closely followed the REER trend until 2008,
when it began to diverge owing to higher
inflation relative to trading partners—in part
due to the relatively high weight on food in
the Saudi CPI basket.

Inflation measures, and therefore the estimated real exchange rate, are affected by the presence of a range of
subsidies—fuel, electricity, water, and certain food items.

4.
The macroeconomic balance approach suggests the current account is within the range
of medium-term norms estimated from several different specifications. The macroeconomic
balance approach estimates four main specifications of the equilibrium current account (norm) from a
set of fundamentals (non-oil and gas fiscal balance, oil and gas reserves, old-age dependency ratio,
population growth rate, initial net foreign assets (NFA) net of external debt, oil trade balance, growth
rate of real per capita GDP, relative income, and lagged dependent current account) employing a
generalized method of moments (GMM) technique (see Beidas-Strom and Cashin, 2011). As shown (in
the table below), the estimation yields a range of current account norms for Saudi Arabia from a
surplus of about 6 to 15 percent of GDP in 2018, with specification II, yielding a norm of 8.8 percent,
being the preferred one given the absence of a lagged dependent variable and the inclusion of NFA
data. The projected current account position in 2018 is a surplus of 11.3 percent of GDP, which lies
within the estimated range of current account norms, but above that derived from specification II.

5.
The external sustainability approach suggests the current account surplus in the
medium-term may be too low. The underpinning of this approach is that the sustainability of the
current account trajectory requires that the net present value (NPV) of all future oil and
financial/investment income (wealth) be equal to the NPV of imports of goods and services net of
non-oil exports. Subject to this constraint, the government would choose a path for imports, and
hence a current account norm, that would support intergenerational equity—and some precautionary

revenues are discounted at 8 percent rather than 6 percent, the current account norm under the
constant real per capita rule drops to 11.2 percent of GDP in 2018 compared to 18.8 percent of GDP.

A third approach that looks at the relationship between the real exchange rate and real
oil prices suggests the riyal is not misaligned. As a country whose dominant export is oil, the
movements in the terms of trade are mainly

Based on SAMA annual report, the proven oil reserve at end of 2011 is 265.4 billion barrels. The oil production grows
at a constant rate (2 percent) and peaks at 13.1 million barrels in 2029 before declining gradually (2 percent). Domestic
oil consumption grows at 2 percent. Oil prices and the GDP deflator increase by 2.5 percent after 2018, and real non-oil
GDP grows by 5 percent while total real output growth is assumed to be 3 percent. Future oil revenues are nominally
discounted at 6 percent, the assumed rate of return on externally held financial wealth/NFA, while population growth
is 1 percent.

Lending to the Fund and Grants:
Saudi Arabia has consented to the amendments of the NAB Decision and the increases of credit
arrangements of participants as approved by the Executive Board on April 12, 2010 (Executive Board
Decision No. 14577-(10/35), increasing its own credit arrangement in the expanded NAB to SDR
11.13 billion, from SDR 1.76 billion. The current outstanding amount as of April 30, 2013 is SDR
1,358.01 million. The Fund also has a borrowing agreement with Saudi Arabia in association with the
General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB), for an amount equivalent to SDR 1.5 billion, which was
renewed for another five-year period from December 26, 2008. The Fund as Trustee of the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) entered into a borrowing agreement with the Saudi Arabian
Monetary Agency in May 2011, by which Saudi Arabia would provide new loan resources of up to
SDR 500 million. In May 2012, Saudi Arabia pledged a new grant contribution of SDR 16.7 million in
subsidy resources to the PRGT, which will be disbursed at end-December 2021, and also provided
assurance for additional subsidy contribution to the PRGT through the transfer of its full share in the

distribution of the general reserve attributed to windfall gold sale profits. In March 2001,
Saudi Arabia agreed to support the PRG-HIPC Trust with investments totaling SDR 94.4 million. In
April 2006, these investments were extended with an additional investment of SDR 38.2 million, to
provide SDR 40 million (end-2005 NPV terms) in subsidy resources to support the Exogenous
Shocks Facility. In February 1989, Saudi Fund for Development disbursed SDR 49.5 million in PRGT
loan resources, which were fully drawn and repaid by September 2004.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
Saudi Arabia maintains an exchange rate system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. The Saudi Arabian riyal was formally pegged to the
U.S. dollar, effective January 2003 and the exchange arrangement is classified as a conventional peg.
Prior to that, it was officially pegged to the SDR at the rate of SAR 4.28255=SDR 1, with margins of
7.25 percent even though in practice it has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1986, with a middle
rate of SAR 3.7450=$1. Saudi Arabia maintains security-related exchange restrictions pursuant to UN
Security Council resolutions 1267 and 1373.
Last Article IV Consultation
Saudi Arabia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was
held during May 14–26, 2012 in Riyadh. The staff report was considered by the Executive Board on
July 2, 2012 and published on September 18, 2012

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
World Bank
The World Bank’s Technical Cooperation Program (TCP) has been providing policy advice, capacity
development, and implementation support to development efforts in Saudi Arabia on a
reimbursable basis since 1975.
The TCP aims to assist Saudi Arabia in addressing its development challenges of generating
productive jobs for a fast growing population; improving the performance of its education and
health system to meet evolving needs; enhancing the provision of public services including water,
electricity, and transport; and strengthening capacity in national and municipal institutions.
In recent months, advisory work was completed in the areas of: public financial management, small
and medium enterprise strategy, social assistance programs, economic diversification strategy,
special economic zones and housing finance regulations. Among priority activities in the ongoing
program are: work on employment policy including a focus on unemployment assistance;
workshops on education quality, assessment, and decentralization issues; developing funding
options to promote energy efficient investments; updating the water sector strategy and building a
consensus around it; developing an implementation plan for the national ports strategy; and
advising on the creation of a Public Transport Authority as a new regulatory body.
International Finance Corporation
IFC activities in the country, as well as with Saudi investors outside the country, have increased
significantly in recent years. They are in line with the following three objectives:
Promoting Selective Business in Saudi Arabia
IFC’s strategy for investments in Saudi Arabia is to invest in selective transactions that can add value
in terms of institution building, development of new financial instruments and SME development.
Specific investments in the financial sector include housing finance, insurance, leasing and
microfinance (with total commitments around $180 million). IFC also provides Advisory Services in
mortgage finance, SME finance, corporate governance, risk management and PPP transactions.
Promoting South-South Investments from Saudi Arabia
Many Saudi investors are looking to expand outside of their home-base. This is an opportunity for
IFC to work with such companies and invest with them inside and outside the MENA region. IFC
Riyadh office increased its activity, especially in facilitating south-south investments that reached
around $1.4 billion in IDA and middle income countries (Pakistan, Egypt, Yemen, Ethiopia, Ghana,
etc.). IFC continues to work closely with Saudi sponsors to further facilitate cross border investment
in the region.

Mobilizing Funds
IFC is working closely with Saudi public institutions and IFIs in which KSA is a majority shareholder to
undertake global initiatives that benefit private sector activities in developing countries. So far, these
efforts have resulted in obtaining commitments of over US$500 million.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 31, 2013)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected areas are: national accounts, labor markets, government finance statistics, and balance
of payments.
National accounts: Annual estimates of GDP have been revised for the period since 2004, and
are calculated at current and constant prices (with 1999 as a base year). Quarterly estimates are
only available for 2011. On the expenditure side, data are now available on a constant price basis
from 2004–11.
Government finance statistics: The authorities are in the process of reclassifying the budget in
line with GFSM 2001. Most chapters have been completed and the Ministry of Finance is planning
on using the GFSM 2001 framework to report fiscal data.
Balance of payments: The authorities are now publishing an annual IIP (available for 2007–11).
However, the coverage in the capital and financial accounts, particularly for the private sector,
needs to be improved, and the errors and omissions in the balance of payments remain sizable.
The authorities are working on strengthening financial account statistics.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 12, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Saudi Arabia
On July 08, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Saudi Arabia.1
Saudi Arabia has been one of the best performing G-20 economies in recent years, and has
supported the global economy through its stabilizing role in the global oil market. Generous
financial support has also been provided to countries in the Middle East region.
The Saudi economy grew by 5.1 percent in 2012, benefitting from high oil prices and output,
strong private sector growth, and government spending. Inflation has risen over the past year
to 3.8 percent in May 2013, driven by higher food prices and housing costs. High oil prices
and production led to large fiscal and current account surpluses, and international reserves
rose further. Credit growth has remained strong, and the banking system is well-capitalized
and profitable, with Basle III capital standards implemented in January 2013. Following an
expansionary fiscal stance in 2011, government expenditure growth slowed in 2012 and the
non-oil deficit began to narrow. Consistent with the exchange rate peg, monetary policy
settings have remained unchanged.
Looking ahead, growth is projected to slow to 4 percent in 2013. Private sector growth is
expected to be strong, but oil production is likely to be below 2012 levels while government
spending growth may slow. Inflation is expected to ease toward year-end in line with
declining international food prices. With oil prices and production expected to be lower,
fiscal and external surpluses, while remaining large, are projected to narrow this year.
The Saudi population is young and increasingly well-educated, and as it continues to enter
into its working-age years, there is a tremendous opportunity to boost growth and raise living
standards further. Against this background, the government is continuing to implement
initiatives to boost the employment of Saudi nationals, increase the supply of housing,
improve infrastructure, particularly in the area of transportation, and develop the small-and
medium enterprise (SME) sector.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found
here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

SAUDI ARABIA

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the continued strong performance of the Saudi Arabian
economy and the systemic and stabilizing role that the country plays in the global oil market.
They also acknowledged Saudi Arabia's role as an important source of financial assistance
and remittances for many developing countries. Directors noted that the outlook for the Saudi
economy is positive. Looking ahead, they stressed the importance of continuing reforms
aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability and addressing demographic challenges.
Directors agreed that the fiscal and macroprudential policy settings are appropriate. They
noted that if signs of inflationary pressures were to emerge, capital spending would need to
be slowed and/or macroprudential policies would need to be tightened. Over the medium
term, while the non-oil fiscal deficit is expected to decline as infrastructure spending tapers
off, additional measures would be needed to further strengthen the fiscal position. Directors
welcomed the measures the authorities have undertaken to strengthen fiscal management, but
saw scope for further improvements. They generally agreed that moving to a medium-term
budget framework that better integrates the five-year national development plans and sets the
expenditure envelope based on a long-term estimate of the oil price would be useful.
Directors noted that an upward adjustment of energy prices would help curb the growth of
energy demand. Implementing the adjustments in a phased and well communicated manner
would allow businesses and households time to adjust. Vulnerable groups would need to be
protected from the effects of higher prices.
Directors welcomed the continuing steps to promote financial development and strengthen
financial regulation and supervision. They noted that Saudi Arabia is among the first
countries to implement Basle III capital standards. Directors agreed that the pegged exchange
rate remains appropriate. A few Directors considered that, if at a later stage a flexible
exchange rate were to become appropriate with the evolution of the structure of the economy,
steps to facilitate the transition would be helpful. Directors looked forward to enactment of
the bill on countering the financing of terrorism.
Directors noted that the young, rapidly growing Saudi population provides both an
opportunity and a challenge in raising growth and living standards. In this regard, reforms
under way to boost employment, support the housing market, develop infrastructure, and
foster the small and medium enterprise sector will help address the challenges. Directors
welcomed the large investments in education aimed at strengthening the skills of the
population, noting that such spending should be monitored vis-à-vis achievement of desired
outcomes. They also cautioned that implementation of labor market policies to boost Saudi
employment should be carefully coordinated with macroeconomic policies.
Directors noted that considerable progress has been made in improving economic statistics
but saw scope for further improvement. Subscription to the Special Data Dissemination
Standards would be an important goal.
