KENYA
Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation, Second Review Under the
Three-Year Arrangement Under the Extended Credit Facility and Requests for
Modification of Performance Criteria and Augmentation of Access
Prepared by the African Department
(In Consultation with Other Departments)
Approved by Saul Lizondo (AFR) and Dominique Desruelle (SPR)
November 23, 2011
Background: After recovering in 2010, the Kenyan economy has faced a number of challenges
in 2011, including the severe drought in the Horn of Africa and high international commodity
prices that have affected both the urban and the rural poor. However, growth momentum has been
preserved. But the combination of external shocks and strong domestic demand, fueled by rapidly
expanding credit to the private sector, has led to sharp inflationary pressures, a widening of the
current account deficit, and the depreciation of the shilling.
Program: The Executive Board approved a three-year ECF for Kenya on January 31, 2011 for
SDR 325.68 million (120 percent of quota). Policies in the first half of 2011 remained in line with
the program. All June program targets were met. However, net domestic assets (NDA) and net
international reserves (NIR) deviated from their September indicative targets because the
authorities delayed their monetary policy response to inflation, expecting a reversal in
international and domestic food prices that did not materialize. The authorities are now adopting
decisive measures to address macroeconomic imbalances. On the strength of these policies, the
authorities are requesting augmentation of access equal to 60 percent of quota under the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement for total access equivalent to 180 percent of quota.
Discussions: The team comprised Messrs. Fanizza (head), Morales, Milkov, and Ms. Raei (all
AFR) and Mr. Liu (SPR). Ms. Meeyam (MCM) provided support from Headquarters.
Discussions were held in Nairobi October 13–31, 2011. Mr. Gudmundsson (Resident
Representative) participated in the discussions, and Ms. Rose Ngugi from the Executive
Director’s office joined the mission. The mission met Prime Minister Odinga, Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Finance Kenyatta, Central Bank Governor Ndung’u, the Parliament
Finance and Budget Committees, other senior officials, representatives of the private sector
including financial institutions, and the donor community.
Staff views: The staff recommends completion of the review, modification of all performance
criteria and indicative targets for the next 12 months to fit the revised balance of payments
outlook, and approval of augmentation of access equal to 60 percent of quota with frontloading
equal to 18 percent of quota for the first disbursement and four disbursements equivalent to
10.5 percent of quota. Kenya continues to maintain an exchange system that is free of restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Publication: The authorities have consented to publication of the staff report and Letter of Intent
and its attachments.

Executive Summary
Kenya’s economy has continued to expand, but high inflation and exchange rate pressures are
threatening the growth outlook. Economic activity has remained strong, with GDP growth above
5 percent in FY 2010/11 and little sign of a slowdown so far. The drought in the Horn of Africa, higher
international prices and strong domestic demand have boosted inflation—18.9 percent in October—and
swelled the external current account deficit. Because monetary authorities hesitated to respond to these
developments, inflationary expectations heightened, leading to a rapid depreciation of the shilling that if
not addressed could destabilize macroeconomic conditions and bring growth to a halt. The authorities
have already started to adjust their policies to stem inflationary expectations and stabilize the exchange
rate to preserve the basis for continued growth.
Program implementation during the first half of 2011 was in line with the objectives. All
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for June 2011 have been met. In particular, the
fiscal position at end-June was significantly better than expected, thanks to strong revenue performance
and strict expenditure control. Structural reforms have also moved forward and the benchmark on the
submission of the value-added tax (VAT) law is set to be met before the end of January 2012. After June
2011, monetary policy response to inflation shocks was delayed in the expectation of a reversal in
international and domestic food price increases that did not materialize. Since September 2011, the
central bank has increased its policy rate significantly and maintained a tightening bias to discourage
excessive credit growth, which had previously fueled inflation and widened the external current account
deficit.
The authorities have requested augmentation of access under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
arrangement to deal with the impact of the drought and higher-than-anticipated international
prices, and they have adopted additional measures to address macroeconomic imbalances. Fiscal
policy in 2011/12 will be geared toward rationalizing non-priority expenditure to contribute to the
stabilization effort, while expanding targeted policies to shield the poor from the impact of higher prices.
This will help contain the primary fiscal deficit and reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio to below
43 percent by end 2013/14. The central bank will maintain a tightening bias to bring inflation down
within the authorities’ target range (5 ± 2 percent) by end-2012. The floating exchange rate regime will
be maintained, and the central bank will resume the buildup of its international reserve buffer once the
exchange rate stabilizes.
Fundamental reforms under the program are under way. The Public Finance Management (PFM) Law
is ready for submission to the Commission on the Implementation of the Constitution. The new VAT law
will contribute significantly to increasing revenue mobilization and minimize administrative costs.
Financial sector reform will aim at strengthening cross border supervision and enhancing risk management.
Capital markets reform will allow small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) to expand their access to new
sources of financing, and pension schemes will be redefined under a comprehensive pension reform that
will transform the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) into a social insurance pension scheme.
Risks to the program implementation arise from a further deterioration of the global outlook and
possible heightened political tensions. The latter are associated with the upcoming 2012 elections and
the International Criminal Court hearings on the 2007 post-election violence. In addition, security
concerns linked to the ongoing military operations at the Somali border could have an adverse impact on
both tourism inflows and the budgetary position.

I. MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
1.
Kenya’s economy has continued to expand, but inflation and exchange rate
pressures have increased sharply as a result of external and domestic factors. The drought
in the Horn of Africa has magnified the impact of the surge in global food and oil prices.
Balance of payments needs have grown as a result of persistently higher international prices and
the cost of supporting the population affected by the famine. Delays in the monetary policy
response to rising inflationary expectations, coupled with a widening external current account
deficit, have placed strong pressures on the exchange rate.
 GDP growth has shown little sign of
slowing down so far and is estimated
at 5.3 percent in 2010/11. Private
investment remains dynamic and has
supported growth above 5 percent
across all non-agricultural sectors.
Agriculture is recovering from the
downturn in the first quarter of 2011.
 Inflation reached 18.9 percent in
October (11.3 percent for core
inflation), well above the Central
Bank of Kenya (CBK) target range
(5 ± 2 percent).1 Food and fuel
inflation have remained higher than
anticipated, and exchange rate
depreciation has led to higher inflation
expectations and an acceleration of
core inflation.

 Fiscal policy has moved toward
consolidation. The primary deficit
declined from 3.8 percent of GDP in
FY 2009/10 to 1.5 percent of GDP in
FY 2010/11 because of delays in
domestically-financed investment,
restraint in current spending, and
strong tax revenue performance. The
FY 2010/11 primary balance was
significantly above the program floor.

 The CBK has raised its central
bank rate (CBR), its policy rate, by
9 ½ percentage points since
October to reverse inflationary
pressures, pushing commercial
banks to adjust their lending interest
rates. Interbank interest rates hovered
around 17 percent in October from
below 2 percent in January 2011.
Treasury bill rates have risen sharply,
although they are still slightly below
interbank rates.

 Private sector credit growth
accelerated to 36 percent in
September, about twice the rate of
the year before. From the first
quarter of 2011, credit growth has
exceeded deposit growth as the latter
has slowed down in the face of
higher inflation. Monetary policy
remained in line with the program
targets until end-June 2011, but it
became looser than programmed
with the CBK’s net domestic assets
(NDA) above the September
indicative targets under the program.2

 High international prices, strong
domestic demand, and higher
drought-related energy and food
imports swelled the external
current account deficit to an
estimated 9.5 percent of GDP in
2010/11 from 5.5 percent the
previous year. The CBK observed the
June net international reserves (NIR)
target under the program. However,
NIR started to decline since June
because the CBK suspended foreign
exchange purchases in light of
persistent exchange rate pressures.

2.
The implementation of the structural reforms under the program has progressed.
The value-added tax (VAT) bill is almost ready to send to parliament (structural benchmark for
the second review), and submission to the Commission on the Implementation of the
Constitution of a public finance management (PFM) bill that harmonizes different views within
the government is expected by end-2011. The government is in the process of incorporating
relevant suggestions from the public on the draft VAT bill. The government has also made
significant progress in preparing the ground for the implementation of an Integrated Financial
Management and Information System (IFMIS), which will facilitate expenditure controls.
3.
Kenya’s growth potential remains hampered by the lack of adequate infrastructure
and an economic activity that is heavily dependent on climatic vagaries. The authorities
have started to (i) upgrade the country transport infrastructure by investing on new roads and
ports; (ii) invest in geothermal energy to reduce the country’s dependence on hydro-power
generation that has been affected by the increased frequency of droughts; and (iii) expand the
coverage of the irrigation systems to reduce the impact of droughts on agriculture.

9
II. THE ISSUES
4.
Kenya faces adverse external conditions from the drought in the Horn of Africa,
persistently high import prices, and the weak global financial environment. These conditions
have magnified the inflation and currency depreciation pressures from the ongoing
expansion of domestic demand. The authorities believe that high inflation and exchange rate
instability now threaten to bring to a halt the economic expansion. They plan to adjust
monetary and fiscal policies to rein in excessive growth of domestic demand, to bring
inflation down and preserve the basis for continued growth. Augmentation of access under
the ECF arrangement would prevent the need for an abrupt adjustment.
A. Heightened External Vulnerabilities
5.
Adverse external conditions have placed pressures on Kenya’s external position.
The drought in the Horn of Africa has hit Kenya hard (Box 1). The need for emergency food
relief for about 10 percent of the country’s population and for Somali refugees has raised
balance of payments needs. Increases in import prices appear more persistent than previously
anticipated, explaining most of the deterioration of the external current account (cumulative
1.8 percent of GDP) over the medium term relative to the projections at the time of the first
review. Also, weakened global financial conditions have reduced expected financial inflows.

10
Box 1. Horn of Africa Drought and Food Crisis: Impact on Kenya
The drought in the Horn of Africa has hit Kenya hard. The overall contribution to GDP of drought-affected
areas is just about 5 percent, but the number of Kenyans in need of immediate food aid could reach
3.75 million, concentrated in the country’s north and north-eastern districts. The total number of refugees from
Somalia in Kenya has reached nearly 600,000 at end-September 2011.
The negative impact of the drought on 2011/12 GDP is estimated at about 0.4 percent. This includes a direct
impact of about 0.2 percent of GDP, chiefly from loss of livestock, and an additional slowdown of similar
magnitude in agriculture and hydropower generation because of lower than normal rainfall.
The drought exacerbated inflationary pressures by limiting domestic supplies of cereals and increasing the cost
of imports. It also put pressure on the balance of payments, because of higher food imports for emergency
humanitarian assistance (about 1.7 percent of GDP), and increased fossil fuel imports (0.6 percent of GDP)
needed to substitute for lower hydropower generation. In response to the drought, the authorities have
reallocated expenditure equal to about 0.3 percent of GDP within the 2011/12 budget to help the most
vulnerable households to mitigate the impact of the crisis.
The recurring nature of droughts in Kenya points to the need for long-term solutions. These include investments
in irrigation schemes; enhancements of market mechanisms for the production, storage, and distribution of
cereals; improvements of road infrastructure for access to drought-prone areas; and investments in renewable
energy to reduce the country’s dependence on thermal power.

B. Monetary Policy and Macro-financial Imbalances
6.
The authorities explained that
the decision to delay the response of
monetary policy in JuneSeptember 2011 reflected the
expectation of a reversal in the
international and domestic food price
increases. The CBK resisted raising
interest rates to address rising inflationary
expectations. As demand pressures

mounted, inflation became persistent and reached its historical peak in October.3 Policy delays
have also contributed to the buildup of macroeconomic imbalances. The loose monetary
conditions contributed significantly to the substantial deterioration of the private savingsinvestment balance in FY2010/11.
7.
Low interest rates not only fueled higher inflation pressures (Box 2), but also
encouraged financial arbitrage against the shilling and delayed the execution of the
government borrowing program:


The interest rate on the CBK overnight lending facility has often been below interbank
market interest rates, encouraging its use by banks as a regular funding facility, sometimes
in volumes that have exceeded total daily interbank transactions.



Low interbank interest rates at the beginning of 2011 encouraged offshore banks to borrow
in Kenya shillings to take long foreign exchange positions. This may have contributed to the
rapid exchange rate depreciation.



The government has raised interest rates on its securities sharply, but not to a level high
enough to attract sufficient financing. Moreover, banks’ appetite for government securities
has declined as a larger share of government securities is held to maturity to avoid further
mark-to-market losses. As a result, the government has used all of the available CBK
financing under the statutory limits (overdraft facility) in FY 2011/12.

8.
The authorities emphasized that rapid private sector credit growth has been driven
by demands reflecting a welcome dynamism in economic activity, but they agreed that
easy monetary conditions have more recently played a key role (Box 3). Demand for
investment financing and working capital has steadily increased for banks oriented toward the
corporate sector. Personal and real estate loans have increased faster, raising their share in total
loans markedly.
9.
The acceleration of credit growth has heightened credit and liquidity risk. Half of
total bank loans are concentrated in personal, real estate and trade loans, sectors more sensitive
to a possible deterioration of the quality of the loan portfolio arising from high interest rates or a
slowdown in retail economic activity. Liquidity risks and funding costs are rising faster for
small banks with limited access to interbank markets and wholesale funds in an environment of
higher interest rates and rapid credit growth.

Box 2. Monetary Policy and Food Inflation: A Model for Policy Analysis1/
Disentangling the effects of food inflation shocks –both domestic
and foreign- from other inflationary pressures is of crucial
importance for assessing the monetary policy stance in Kenya. We
use a small monetary model for this purpose, adapted to the
specific features of Kenya. The model incorporates food and nonfood price dynamics via two separate Phillips Curves and a Taylortype monetary policy rule. The model’s parameters are not
econometrically estimated but calibrated to be consistent with the
structure of Kenya’s economy.
We apply the model to decompose historical data into trends and
2/
shocks. The main findings are as follows:






Imported food shocks have accounted for some of the inflation
dynamics in Kenya, both in 2008 and 2011, but domestic food
shocks (harvest shocks) have also played a role.
Loose monetary policy has played an important role in driving
inflation above trend in 2008 and 2011.
Despite the accommodative monetary stance, inflation rapidly
declined towards the end of 2008. This sharp fall was mainly
explained by external disinflationary forces (rapid fall in
commodity prices owing to global recession) and a sharp
slowdown in private domestic demand because of political
uncertainty.
However, in 2011, private domestic demand remains strong
and global commodity prices are projected to stay high.

Model simulations suggest that, unlike the 2008 food inflation episode, higher international prices and strong
domestic demand require prompt monetary policy tightening, whereas a delayed response would lead to higher
inflation and would require a stronger adjustment later on.

________________________________

The model is work in progress by IMF staff from the African Department (AFR) and the Research Department (RES),
with the collaboration of OG Research.

/ The second chart illustrates the contributions of different shocks to food inflation. Shocks comprise output gap, exogenous
prices (Prices), international food prices (Int. food), policy changes (Policy), exchange rate (ex rate), external demand
(RoW) and residual shocks (Other).

13
Box 3. Is Private Sector Credit Growth Supply or Demand Driven?
Economic recovery explains increasing demand for credit, but more recently supply factors, in the
form of low interest rates, seem to play a more important role in explaining credit growth. Private
sector (PS) credit growth reached 36 percent (year on year) in end-September 2011 on the back of the
strong economic recovery and historically low interest rate environment. Historical shock decomposition
analysis 1/ that identifies the contribution of supply and demand factors suggests demand factors
explained most of the rise in private sector (PS) credit growth during the 2009–10 economic recovery.
However, since mid-2010, supply factors driven by declining interest rates and easy monetary conditions
have played the dominant role. Despite the increase in interest rates at the end of the sample, supply
factors continue to contribute to above average credit growth. Using the elasticity of the demand for PS
credit, we find that a 1 percent increase in the repo rate (an upward vertical shift of the supply curve)
reduces PS credit growth by about 3 percentage points for a given level of credit demand.

1The historical decomposition is based on a bi-variate monthly VAR of private sector credit growth and the repo rate. A positive
supply shock assumes a decrease in the repo rate (price) and an increase in private sector credit (quantity), whereas a demand
shock assumes an increase in both the repo rate and PS credit.

III. POLICY ADJUSTMENT AND THE ECF-SUPPORTED ECONOMIC PROGRAM
10.
The authorities’ economic program plans additional adjustment in monetary and
fiscal policies to strengthen the external position while preserving the basis for strong growth.
The policies will focus on reducing domestic absorption by gradually bringing the growth in
domestic demand more in line with that of available resources, in order to curb inflation and
lower the external current account deficit. However, the authorities believe that, in light of
the worsened external position, they would require additional Fund financing to be able to
gradually accumulate international reserves to the equivalent of four months of imports by
the end of the program period. Moreover, they stressed that enhanced Fund support in the
near term will help their efforts to stabilize the exchange rate and rein in inflation while
maintaining growth at above 5 percent in 2011/12:


Monetary policy will bear the brunt of the adjustment to rein in domestic demand.
The CBK has raised its policy interest rate substantially and will seek to keep a tight
policy to bring inflation down to the upper bound of the inflation target range by end-

14
2012, helped by a reduction in international food and fuel prices in line with WEO
projections.


Fiscal policy will continue to focus on medium-term consolidation, and will front
load the adjustment to temper domestic demand. The authorities have adopted a
somewhat more ambitious medium-term target to deal with the worsened balance of
payments outlook. The objective is now to bring the debt-to-GDP ratio to about
41 percent by FY 2014/15, compared with over 44 percent under the original program.
The primary deficit target for FY 2011/12 has been adjusted downward despite
additional spending to prepare for the 2012 elections and conduct the operations at the
Somali border.



Policy adjustment would be complemented by additional financing from
international development partners and increased access under the ECF
arrangement to help rebuild the international reserves buffer (Table A). Exogenous
shocks and demand pressures increased financing requirements by 4.9 percent of GDP
relative to the First Review over FY 2011/12 to FY 2014/15. The external current
account deficit is expected to narrow by 3 percentage points of GDP over the program
period, despite a projected continuous deterioration of the terms of trade. This
improvement will result mainly from the impact of policies on imports of goods and
services. The domestic-foreign interest rate differential should attract capital inflows to
Kenya once the exchange rate stabilizes.



Financial sector policy will concentrate on mitigating credit and liquidity risks
potentially arising from an environment of high interest rates. Following a period of
buoyant credit growth, monetary policy tightening may bring about an increase in nonperforming loans (NPLs) that may affect the financial soundness of banks with weaker
balance sheets.

15
A. Reining in Inflation
11.
Starting in October 2011, the CBK has tightened monetary policy and streamlined
its monetary policy framework. The CBK has increased its policy rate (CBR) to 16.5 percent
in several steps. Under the new monetary policy framework, the CBK will use the CBR to guide
interbank market rates to achieve the NDA operational target. In addition, the CBK raised
reserve requirements by 0.5 percent to 5.25 percent of liabilities (to become effective on
December 15, 2011).
12.
To mitigate pressures on the shilling, the CBK has lowered the limit on banks’ net
open currency position from 20 percent to 10 percent of assets and set a minimum tenure
of seven days for currency swaps. In addition, it has taken several measures that would limit
scope for non-resident banks to take positions against the shilling. These include (i) a one-year
minimum period to borrow or lend in shillings from/to non-resident banks; and, (ii) a restriction
to use non-resident shilling accounts for purposes not justified by underlying customers’
transactions.
13.
Looking forward, monetary policy would seek to ease inflationary expectations and
bring down inflation to the upper bound of the inflation target by end-2012. Credit growth
is expected to decelerate to 20 percent by June 2012. The government intends to borrow from
the CBK only on a temporary basis with a zero balance on the overdraft facility by the end of
the fiscal year. Accumulation of international reserves will resume gradually. To assess the
extent of the needed monetary policy response, the central bank intends to monitor
developments in (a) its net domestic assets in relation to the program targets, (b) private credit
growth, (c) interbank market rates and volumes and (d) interbank foreign exchange markets. In
addition, to gauge inflation expectations, it will extract information from the evolution of yield
curve and the market survey it conducts on monthly basis.
14.
The floating exchange rate regime has helped to absorb the impact of exogenous
shocks. The Kenyan shilling depreciated against major currencies in 2011 reflecting
deteriorations in the terms of trade and persistently high inflation. The REER depreciated by
6.5 percent from December 2010 to September 2011, in line with the deterioration of the current
account balance. The authorities indicated that their internal assessment did not point to
significant real exchange rate misalignment. This assessment is in line with staff’s external
stability and sustainability analysis, which finds no significant evidence of exchange rate
misalignment or threat to medium-term external sustainability (Figure 1).
15.
The government indicated its commitment to maintaining free prices and avoiding
price controls. Parliament has approved a law giving the ministry of finance the power to
declare some goods essential and cap their prices, but the government indicated that it will
refrain from using these powers and continue to rely instead on targeted subsidies and cash
transfers to protect the poor.

17
B. Consolidating the Fiscal Position
16.
The authorities aim at a fiscal primary deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP in FY 2011/12,
down from 2.7 percent envisaged in the first program review. This level is consistent with
program objectives and frontloaded adjustment, and includes the cost of implementing the
constitution, preparing elections, and financing the security operations at the Somali border. To
achieve this target, the authorities plan to keep a tight lid on current outlays and, if needed,
delay the implementation of low-priority investment projects.
17.
In the medium term, the authorities plan to bring the fiscal primary deficit to
1.4 percent of GDP by FY 2013/14. This would reflect an increase in revenue from
24.5 percent of GDP in FY 2011/12 to 25 percent of GDP in FY 2013/14. Total expenditure and
net lending are projected to decline by 0.1 percent of GDP in the same period, allowing capital
spending increase from 10.1 to 10.5 percent of GDP.
18.
To further progress towards their medium-term consolidation objectives, the
authorities plan to focus on expenditure control and prompt implementation of the VAT
law. The government would continue to seek savings in non-priority spending, contain growth
in the wage bill, and reprioritize investment spending. It would also boost revenue collection
through the implementation of the VAT law. Before submitting the bill to parliament for
approval, the government is incorporating suggestions to the VAT law, including suggestions
from the Fund.4
19.
The authorities intend to reinstate in FY 2012/13 the excise tax on diesel fuel that
was removed to mitigate the impact of higher fuel prices on the purchasing power of the
vulnerable portion of the population. The elimination of excise taxes on kerosene and its
reduction for diesel fuel, the release of maize reserves, and the removal of tariffs on maize and
wheat imports have led to an estimated revenue loss of 0.3 percent of GDP in FY2011/12. These
measures will be replaced by targeted policies, including expanding Kenya’s existing social
safety net programs for both urban and rural areas, with a neutral impact on revenue.
20.
Kenya continues to follow its prudent medium-term debt strategy, but changing
financial conditions pose challenges. The sharp increase in the cost of domestic financing has
complicated borrowing decisions while exchange rate depreciation has raised the value of
external debt significantly. The Debt Management Office (DMO) has maintained its policy of
providing guarantees only for energy projects (still in the pipeline). A draft Private-Public
Partnership (PPP) Act plans the review of eventual contingency liabilities arising in PPP
contracts by the DMO.
21.
The authorities emphasized that their commitment to sound expenditure
management would ensure an orderly transition towards fiscal decentralization. The
proposed new PFM law defines the extent and the modalities of the decentralization process that

will allow assessment of the costs of decentralization before its implementation. Technical
assistance from the IMF Statistics Department (STA) is helping the authorities to extend the
coverage of the fiscal accounts to the general government.
22.
Technical arrears were incurred in repaying the International Development
Association (IDA) obligations last September and have since been fully repaid. The
authorities explained that the delay occurred because of the introduction of new procedures to
obtain clearance by the controller of the budget according to the new constitution. The process
has already been streamlined to avoid further technical arrears episodes.

million) will contribute about 17 percent toward covering Kenya’s total financing needs
between FY 2011/12 and FY 2014/15.



Other underlying balance of payments’ financing requirements are expected to come
mainly from foreign direct investment, capital goods suppliers credit, and portfolio
capital inflows attracted by higher interest rates as the central bank tightens monetary
policy.



The central bank plans to resume building up its international reserve buffer. Once
external pressures subside, a sizable international reserve buffer (at a minimum of

4 months of import coverage) would shield Kenya from volatile international prices and
private capital flows.6
D. Monitoring Financial Risks and Deepening Financial Reform
24.
The financial system remains sound. Most banks remain highly profitable and capital
adequacy ratios are still high, although they declined in September 2011 compared to June. This
decline reflects: (i) an acceleration in lending that increased total risk-weighted assets, and
(ii) mark-to-market losses that limited the growth of capital. NPLs continued to decline
(4.9 percent of loans in September 2011), reflecting the rapid growth of the loan base and
improved loan recovery practices by banks. Leading domestic financial institutions continue
expanding to neighboring countries, chiefly Uganda, Tanzania, and Sudan (Box 4).
25.
The authorities indicated that banking supervision will increasingly focus on
emerging risks in small banks (Figure 2). The central bank will monitor the use of central
bank liquidity facilities to identify structural liquidity imbalances in individual institutions and
take early corrective action if needed. Banks facing structural liquidity problems will put in
place a recovery plan without resorting to CBK facilities.
26.
The authorities indicated that credit risk will be monitored more closely in light of
rapid credit expansion. In particular, personal loans show higher-than average NPL ratios and
may have been hit by higher interest rates. Moreover, to address risks stemming from increasing
financial inclusion and strong credit growth, the CBK plans to conduct macro and micro stress
tests, and more frequently assess whether loan write offs and provisioning practices are in line
with regulations.
27.
The Capital Markets Authority (CMA) has continued improving capital market
governance and development. The CMA has adopted a risk based supervision model and is
actively enforcing higher minimum capital requirements for brokers and investment banks.
Guidelines on Internal Control and Risk Management have been drafted to provide guiding
principles for licensed institutions on minimum requirements for complying with applicable
laws. To strengthen the Investor Protection Fund, a draft regulation of Investor Compensation
is prepared and is in the market consultation process. The CMA is also working on more
flexible requirements for SMEs that want to be listed in the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE). The
demutualization process is still planned for completion by June 2012, but the process has been
put on hold temporarily because of an injunction raised by a broker seeking inclusion in the
process.
28.
The National Social Security Fund (NSSF) is undertaking significant reform. A new
framework for social security policy will redefine pension schemes, including by transforming
the NSSF from a provident fund into a social insurance pension scheme. A new management
has radically improved the NSSF’s governance environment, including by appointing fund
managers and custodians, fully complying with requirements set by the Retirement Benefits
Authority (RBA), the pension funds regulator.

29.
Kenya has taken steps towards introducing anti-money laundering (AML) and
combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) provisions, but the action plan agreed with
the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has been partially implemented. The AML
advisory board to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has been appointed. A Mutual
Evaluation Report reflecting an assessment by the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money
Laundering Group has been recently finalized. However, a review conducted by the Financial
Action Task Force (FATF) found strategic AML/CFT deficiencies and insufficient progress in
addressing them. Deficiencies include pending staffing of the FIU, lack of effective
implementation of the AML law, and lack of criminalization of terrorist financing.



Cross border linkages have become a prominent feature of the Kenyan banking sector. Foreign
and regional banks hold 40 percent of the banking sector’s assets. In recent years, six locallyowned Kenyan banks, some of systemic importance, have

At this stage, direct cross-border financial linkages between the

and foreign banks in the region depend on local low-cost
deposits rather than funding from parent banks or international
markets.
However some risks may emerge:

Local banks with subsidiaries: Problems in affiliates of
Kenyan-owned banks in neighboring countries may
affect the parent institution through reputational risks and the need for recapitalizing by
the parent bank. This is particularly relevant because some systematically important
Kenyan banks are expanding rapidly to other countries in the region. Growth, inflation,
and monetary policy tightening cycles tend to be synchronized across EAC. Therefore, a
parent bank and its affiliates could simultaneously face similar risks, including market
risks, higher non-performing loans (NPLs) and liquidity risks, leading to compounded
pressures on the parent bank’s balance sheet.

The authorities are involved in several joint initiatives with supervisors from other EAC countries
and several other countries in the region to enhance joint supervision. The key supervisory
priorities are: (i) mapping relationships among local groups including banks, (ii) requiring
disclosure and notification of intergroup transactions, and (iii) identifying channels of regulatory
arbitrage.

IV. PROGRAM ISSUES
30.
It is proposed that targets for the next two reviews are modified and that targets for
end-December 2012 be established. The authorities met all the June 2011 targets. However,
NIR and NDA targets need to be revised because exchange rate pressures have made it difficult
for the CBK to continue purchasing foreign exchange as planned, leading to deviations of the
NIR and NDA from their September 2011 indicative targets. The new targets take into account
changes in the macroeconomic outlook and a new base period for the program exchange rate
from April 2011 to September 2011. The direction of macroeconomic policies under the
program has not changed.
31.
Augmentation and total access. Staff estimates external financing of US$670 million
for 2011–13 to address the exogenous shocks, while preventing an abrupt adjustment in
domestic demand. Reflecting the estimated financing needs and the strength of planned reforms,
in particular those allowing fiscal consolidation over the medium term, staff proposes an
augmentation of the equivalent of 60 percent of quota, which would lead to a total access of
180 percent of quota (SDR 488.52 million) under the ECF arrangement. Disbursements ahead
would be made in five tranches, following completion of semi-annual reviews. The authorities’
intention to front load their adjustment effort justifies front-loading of disbursements. Staff
proposes disbursement of 30 percent of augmentation (18 percent of quota) upon approval by
the Board, with remaining disbursements to take place in equal tranches.
32.
Financing. The program would be fully financed. Of the estimated US$670 million
financing gap, the IMF will finance US$250 million under the proposed 180 percent of quota
access, and other development partners are expected to disburse US$420 million over the next
three years.
33.
The balance of risks is tilted downward, and room for policy slippages and
countercyclical policies has substantially narrowed. If adverse risks materialize, additional
external financing may well be limited. As regards the IMF, the proposed augmentation would
already bring access to concessional resources close to the cumulative access limit. Policies
would then have to bear the brunt of adjustment. The main risks to the program are:


A further deterioration of the global outlook affecting not only demand for nontraditional exports but also financial inflows and jeopardizing the authorities’ efforts to
build external reserve buffers. Although financial spillover risks to the domestic banking
sector are low (Box 4), demand for horticulture exports may be affected by
developments in Europe.



A deterioration of the political outlook in the run-up to elections in 2012 and during the
implementation of fiscal decentralization, leading to lack of political support for the
program. The International Criminal Court’s hearings for the confirmation of charges
against six high-profile individuals suspected of instigating the December 2007
post-election violence are underway, and could unsettle the political climate.

24


A worsening of weather conditions, leading to stronger pressures on the external
position.



A protracted military intervention at the Somali border, translating into additional
budgetary costs and heightened security concerns that may hamper tourism revenue.

34.
Capacity to repay the IMF. Kenya has a strong capacity to repay the IMF. Its current
obligations to the IMF are SDR 367 million at end-October 2011, or 135 percent of quota. The
proposed access would not affect significantly the level of total debt, and the risk of debt
distress is low according to the most recent Debt Sustainability Analysis. Repayment of
obligations to the IMF from existing and prospective credit will remain lower than 1.3 percent
of gross international reserves and 14 percent of debt service during 2011-2019. In the same
period, outstanding IMF credit would remain under 3 percent of GDP (Table 8). Moreover, the
additional IMF financing is part of broader efforts, in which development partners play the key
role, covering two-thirds of the financing requirements net of the efforts of policy adjustments.
35.
The CBK safeguards assessment was completed in September 2011, and reported
in Country Report No. 11/165. The CBK Board and a new deputy governor have been
appointed, and a new audit committee is now functional. On data, the CBK is implementing the
recommendations in the transition to the new accounting system. The assessment will be

Article VIII issues. Kenya continues to maintain an exchange system that is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Achievements: Kenya has sustained strong growth for two years in a row, but since June
policy adjustment efforts bumped into unexpected obstacles. The drought in the Horn of Africa
and persistently high increases in international prices have boosted inflation and raised the
country’s balance of payments needs. Nevertheless, Kenya has made progress in reducing its
fiscal imbalance and in pushing forward key reforms in the fiscal and financial sectors.
38.
Challenges: Inflation has reached levels that threaten to bring to a halt the country’s
favorable growth performance. More persistent than expected increases in food prices have fed
into core inflation and expectations because delays in the monetary policy response left rapid
domestic demand growth unchecked. Rising inflationary expectations in a context of a widening
external current account deficit have fueled pressures on the exchange rate that now risk to feed
back into inflation and in turn to spiral on the exchange rate. Macroeconomic policies need to
address this risk promptly by bringing under control domestic demand to reverse inflationary
expectations, and stabilize the exchange rate.
39.
Monetary policy: Monetary policy will have to bear the brunt of the adjustment through
decisive tightening, because the rapid pace of growth in credit to the private sector has played
the key role in generating domestic demand pressures. The large recent increases in the CBK’s
policy rate are steps in the right direction that signal a shift away from the gradualist approach
the CBK followed until September. The CBK will need to maintain a tightening bias in its
monetary operations to keep the interbank rate above the CBR. Moreover, further increases in

25
the CBR may need to be considered to keep the CBK’s NDA in line with the program targets
that aim at bringing inflation down.
40.
Foreign exchange policy: The recent regulatory changes to limit the scope for
shortening the shilling on forward contracts may help to assuage pressures in the short term, but
they do not constitute an alternative to monetary tightening. Moreover, the CBK should
reconsider these regulations once the exchange markets stabilize, to assess whether these
constrain inflows and hamper the efficiency of financial intermediation. The CBK should also
resume its foreign exchange purchases to gradually build a buffer in international reserves
because monetary tightening will help to support the shilling.
41.
Fiscal policy: There is a case for accelerating fiscal consolidation to complement
monetary policy to curb domestic demand. The authorities’ decisions to adopt a more ambitious
medium-term target, and to frontload the adjustment in FY 2011/12 are in the right direction. In
particular, if achieved, the primary balance target for FY 2011/12 would allow a significant
decline in the government debt-to-GDP ratio. Moreover, this target includes provisions for key
outlays that should be protected. These include emergency food relief for the population hit by
the drought, implementation of the new constitution, preparation of the 2012 elections, targeted
transfers to the poor, ongoing security operations, and high-priority investments. The authorities
need not only to continue to restrain the growth of non-priority current spending, but also to tap
increasingly the domestic market by accepting interest rates on government securities that are in
line with those prevailing in the interbank market.
42.
Exchange rate assessment: Despite the recent market turbulences, the floating exchange
rate regime has, without doubt, helped the country to cope with adverse shocks. In fact, the
recent real depreciation of the shilling provides incentives that should reorient economic activity
toward exports, helping monetary and fiscal policies to bring under control domestic demand
and lower the external current account deficit. Thus, there are no indications that the real
exchange rate is misaligned.
43.
Financial sector policies: The continued acceleration in credit to the private sector has
heightened risks for the quality of banks’ loan portfolios. These risks may become more evident
as monetary policy succeeds in slowing the pace of credit expansion. Thus, it is essential that
banking supervision redoubles its efforts to ensure that banks comply with provisioning
practices and that the continued decline in the ratio of NPLs to assets does not reflect a
deterioration of the banks’ loan portfolio masked by an expanded loan base. Similarly, the
growing cross-border linkages of the Kenyan banking sector call for strengthening supervision
focusing on intergroup transactions and the possibility of regulatory arbitrage.
44.
Fiscal decentralization: The draft PFM law defines a new framework for
intergovernmental relations consistent with the principles of fiscal devolution in the new
Constitution. Stakeholders are still discussing the detailed modalities of devolution, but a
comprehensive PFM law should be in place before the devolution process takes off. The law
will allow the authorities to fully quantify the costs of the devolution process and ensure that the
principles of sound fiscal management apply at both the central and the county government
levels. The establishment of a Single Treasury Account is consistent with devolution and
constitutes an important step toward strengthening accountability in the use of public resources
and reducing the scope for corruption.

26
45.
VAT reform: Implementing the new draft VAT law will be essential to increase revenue
mobilization and minimize administrative costs. The authorities have already started to modify
elements of the existing collection mechanism in line with the new VAT design, in particular
the withholding and refund mechanisms. These changes will certainly improve the business
climate and facilitate tax compliance. However, to safeguard its revenue potential and economic
efficiency features, the tax base should be as broad as possible, with very limited exemptions.
46.
Poverty reduction: The authorities are finalizing an update to their 2008–12 poverty
reduction strategy that sets more realistic targets in light of recent macroeconomic developments
and have initiated work to prepare the next five-year plan, and the report will be circulated to
the Board for information before end-December 2011.
47.
IMF support: The proposed augmentation of access would bring access to concessional
resources close to the cumulative access limit. This underscores the importance of the
authorities fully implementing the program to strengthen the country’s balance of payments
position. If adverse shocks or policy slippages create new balance of payments needs, IMF
concessional support would not be available as a cushion and the burden of adjustment would
fall on policies with an impact on economic activity and living conditions.
48.
Program performance: All performance criteria (PCs) and indicative targets for endJune 2011 were observed. The structural benchmark was met as programmed. The CBK has
made progress in implementing the recommendations of the recent safeguard assessment
update. Staff recommends completion of the second review under the ECF arrangement,
approval of the request for augmentation of access to IMF resources under the program,
approval of the request for modification of the end-December 2011 PCs and end-June 2012 PCs,
and the establishment of new PCs for end-December 2012.
49.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place within 24 months, subject
to the decision on consultation cycles (Decision No. 14747– (10/96), September 28, 2010).

To provide a roughly consistent CPI time series,
we apply simple regressions to measure the
upward bias for different ranges of food inflation,
in periods where CPI data using old and new
methodologies were available. By comparing the
two overlapped series, we are able to calculate a
modified food CPI for periods before October
2005. Maintaining the same non-food CPI across
the board, we arrived at a new CPI.1

20

Oct-97
Sep-98

We calculate a modified CPI time series to address
inconsistencies in the historical CPI as a result of
several changes in the CPI basket and calculation
methodology. The new CPI methodology and
basket, which came to use in February 2009, has
been applied by KNBS to recalculate the CPI
index going back to October 2005. However data
limitations and the differences in coverage and
formulas made it difficult to apply the
methodology further back. The spliced time series
is therefore not methodologically consistent. This
old methodology generated a substantial upward
bias to the measurement of inflation, particularly
for volatile items such as food prices.

For illustrative purposes, we use the modified CPI to study the relation between CBR and
inflation. The revised CPI series responds significantly to changes in the CBR, whereas the old
CPI does not.

1

The modified CPI series for data points before October 2005 is used in this Staff Report. The methodology was agreed upon with the
authorities and will be reflected in the next publications of the World Economic Outlook.

APPENDIX II. LETTER OF INTENT
Nairobi, Kenya
November 18, 2011
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
Kenya’s economy continues to recover steadily despite new challenges stemming from the
severe drought in the Horn of Africa, higher food and fuel prices, and rapidly deteriorating
global conditions. Our economy grew by 4.5 percent in the first half of 2011, spurred by a
dynamic private sector and the recovery in tourism and agricultural production. We remain
sanguine on the growth outlook, although there are formidable downside risks to the ongoing
economic expansion.
Our program under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement remains broadly on
track. All quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for end-June 2011 have
been met. Our fiscal position at end-June was significantly better than envisaged under the
program, despite additional spending pressures to support the implementation of our new
constitution and the need to cushion vulnerable households from the impact of the drought
and higher food and fuel prices. In addition, our fiscal structural reforms remain on track.
However, the increased global market turbulence since June together with rising inflationary
expectations have placed growing pressures on the Shilling and on the demand for
government securities. Inflation has reached levels that could threaten the economic
expansion, while the external current account deteriorated on the back of higher import prices
and strong domestic demand.
To confront these challenges and to protect the ongoing economic expansion, we require
further assistance with external BOP financing to cushion the economy from the impact these
exogenous shocks. We request augmenting our access under the existing ECF arrangement
by 60 percent of quota over the remaining two years of the program (for a total of 180
percent of quota). Moreover, we would also request that the disbursements of the additional
amount to be front loaded to enable us to deal with current challenges more effectively.
We remain committed to the economic reform program set out in the ECF arrangement to
achieve macro-economic stability and sustainable growth crucial for poverty reduction. To
achieve these objectives, we will implement and monitor policies set out in the attached
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). We will maintain close policy
dialogues with the Fund on the adoption of measures, and in advance of revisions of the

38
policies contained in this Letter of Intent and its attachments, in accordance with the Fund’s
policies on such consultation.
Based on our additional BOP needs and policies described in this letter of intent and its
attachments, we request that the Executive Board complete the second review of the ECF
arrangement and approve the corresponding disbursement of SDR 92.27 million,
augmentation of our three-year arrangement under the ECF to the amount of 488.52 million
SDR in total for the period January 2011-December 2013. We also request modifications of
the end-December 2011 and end-June 2012, as well as establishment of performance criteria
for end-December 2012. It is expected that the third review will be completed by April 15,
2012, based on end-December 2011 performance criteria, the fourth review will be
completed by October 15, 2012, based on end-June 2012 performance criteria, and the fifth
review will be completed by April 15, 2013, based on end-December 2012 performance
criteria.

We authorize the IMF to publish this Letter of Intent and its attachments, as well as the
accompanying staff report.

Sincerely yours,
/s/

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies for 2011–13 under the
Three-Year Program of the Extended Credit Facility Arrangement
This memorandum updates and complements the policies set forth in the MEFP under the
original ECF arrangement, as well as the Letter of Intent, attached to the First Review under
the ECF arrangement.
I. Background
1.
Despite the severe drought in the arid and semi-arid parts of the country, high food
and oil prices, and rapidly deteriorating global conditions, our economy has shown resilience
with continued strong growth. We project real GDP growth to remain around 5 percent in
FY 2011/12, supported by robust public and private investment. We therefore remain
positive on the growth outlook, but we believe that the downside risks have risen, and need to
be addressed to preserve and sustain the ongoing expansion in economic activity. Coping
with the impact of persistently high international prices, the drought in the Horn of Africa,
and the security threats coming from the Somali border, poses formidable challenges to
macroeconomic policies.
2.
Progress in implementing our reform program under the ECF arrangement has
continued. All quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for June 2011 have
been met. In particular, we have managed to improve our fiscal position, despite the
necessary measures taken to protect the vulnerable from high food and fuel prices, and the
expenses associated with the implementation of the new constitution. Structural reforms have
also moved forward and we are set to meet the benchmark on the submission of the VAT law
for the second program review.
3.
However, since June the increased global market turbulence together with rising
inflationary expectations has placed growing pressures on the shilling and on the
demand for government securities. As a result, we have not been able to accumulate
international reserves as programmed and the government has fully utilized its overdraft
facility with the CBK. Therefore, the CBK’s net international reserves (NIRs) have fallen
below the September indicative floor, and the CBK’s net domestic assets (NDAs) have risen
above the September indicative ceiling.
4.
Since the program first review, the country’s macroeconomic outlook has
worsened with respect to inflation and the external position:


Inflation has intensified and reached levels that could threaten the economic
expansion. First-round effects from the increased food and fuel prices have fed into
core inflation because of strong domestic demand fueled by the rapid growth in credit
to the private sector.



The country’s external position has deteriorated not only because of higher than
originally expected international prices and drought-related import needs but also
because of the strength of domestic demand.

40
5.
The shilling’s exchange rate has depreciated substantially in response to a
widening current account deficit. The shilling’s slide has added immediate pressures on
domestic prices that, if not addressed, could feed back on the external position and the
exchange rate raising the risk of destabilizing macroeconomic conditions. To address this
risk and protect the ongoing economic expansion we intend to promptly adjust our
macroeconomic policy stance by:


Further tightening monetary policy as needed to stem inflationary expectations; and



Cutting back on non-priority government spending to contribute to lower domestic
demand and mitigate the impact of monetary tightening on market interest rates.

6.
We remain committed to a policy regime free from controls on prices, interest
rates, and the exchange rate. We are convinced that price controls do not work, may be
detrimental to economic activity, reduce access to essential goods, and hurt the poor most.
II. The Economic Program for 2011/12
A. Monetary Policy
7.
Policy objective: The CBK will aim at bringing down annual inflation to 7 percent
(within the CBK’s inflation target) by end-2012. Monetary policy will continue relying on
NDA as an intermediate target (performance criterion). In addition, the CBK has modified
the monetary policy framework to give more prominence to the central bank policy rate
(CBR) to help anchor inflation expectations. In the new framework, monetary operations to
mop up liquidity (repos) as well as to inject liquidity (reverse repos) are conducted using the
CBR as a pivot rate to guide interbank market interest rates to a level consistent with the
monetary policy stance.
8.
Tightening monetary policy: The CBK has raised the CBR by a total of
9½ percentage points in the last two MPC meetings. The CBK will maintain a tightening bias
promptly absorbing liquidity surplus when needed to induce a deceleration in credit growth
and the demand for foreign exchange. The interest rate on the overnight window facility will
be maintained at a penalty with respect to the CBR.
9.
International reserve accumulation: We will continue with our efforts to gradually
accumulate international reserves through regular purchases of foreign exchange from the
interbank market. We also remain committed to our medium-term objective to increase
reserve coverage to four months of prospective imports, but the pace of reserve accumulation
will need to take into account the impact of the external supply shocks that has created
instability and volatility in the foreign exchange market. We are also committed to
maintaining a floating exchange rate regime.

41
B. Fiscal Policy
10.
Policy objective: The primary fiscal balance will remain well below the original
target for FY 2011/12, as a part of policy adjustment (performance criterion). We have
revised our medium-term consolidation target to partially offset the permanent part of the
increase in commodity prices. In addition, we have front-loaded the fiscal consolidation in
2011/12 in order to deal with the temporary demand and BOP pressures. We will maintain
our efforts to reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio to below 45 percent by end 2012/13, but
we will provide sufficient resources for the necessary investment in infrastructure, food
security and implementation of our Constitution. We will continue to invest in infrastructure,
which will increase the growth prospects of the country, relying on mainly concessional
financing from our development partners.
11.
Fiscal reforms: We will maintain our policy of rationalizing recurrent expenditure,
and we will restrain growth of the wage bill. Expenditure management control will be
enhanced with the implementation of new legislation on public finance management (PFM),
to be submitted before the end of the fiscal year (structural benchmark for the third review).
To complement this effort, we are in the process of incorporating suggestions to a new draft
VAT law to parliament that will remove a number of ad hoc exemptions and zero rated goods
that have undermined revenue collection (structural benchmark). In addition, we will also
examine our broad tax administration framework in order to increase efficiency in revenue
administration, including in customs administration.
12.
We are actively preparing for the fiscal decentralization, which in line with the
constitutional implementation process, will start following the elections in 2012. In this
regard, the new PFM legislation will strengthen expenditure control at both the Central and
County government level. In addition, we will implement the Integrated Financial
Management Information System (IFMIS) across Ministries and Departments. We remain
committed to implementing a single treasury account (TSA) by June 2012 (structural
benchmark).
13.
Emergency relief expenditure: In order to provide emergency relief following the
drought, we removed duties on wheat and maize to keep prices affordable. Moreover, we
removed and lowered excise taxes, on kerosene and diesel respectively, to counter the
increase in fuel prices. We plan to phase out these measures by the end of the fiscal year and
instead scale up targeted interventions, including expanding our existing food safety net
programs covering all vulnerable groups in both urban and rural areas. .
14.
Poverty reduction: Consistent with our Vision 2030, we are updating the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) taking into account current macroeconomic conditions and
emerging challenges. This framework will provide for social expenditure in the transition
towards a new government following elections in 2012, consistent with the overall poverty
reduction strategy of the country.

42
15.
Financing policy: We will remain prudent in approving new project loans to ensure
public debt dynamics remain sustainable. We will aim at obtaining the necessary domestic
financing by accepting interest rates on our securities that are consistent with money market
rates in order to reduce reliance on the use of the overdraft facility at the CBK. We will also
monitor closely the risks related to contingent liabilities exposure, including through the
integration of projects funded through public private partnerships into the medium term debt
management strategy. We continue to maintain non-concessional financing, including
guarantees, below US$700 million for the remainder of 2011/12 (performance criterion).
While we still plan to issue a sovereign bond in 2012/13, we will monitor developments in
the international markets with the view to issuing the bond early to take advantage of the
favorable interest rates, market conditions permitting. The non-concessional financing,
including the sovereign bond proceeds, will be limited to investment projects that
demonstrate revenue streams and are of high social returns. As before, we will continue with
our policy of not incurring external arrears (performance criterion).
C. Financial Sector Policy
16.
Policy objective: We remain committed to the twin objectives of promoting financial
inclusion and strengthening financial stability. Following the introduction of legislation
allowing the Central Bank to take prompt corrective action to deal with problem banks, we
will sustain ongoing initiatives to upgrade crisis management frameworks to deal with the
challenges of cross-border operations and mobile banking. We will increase the use of stress
testing and improve the evaluation of provisioning practices by financial institutions. As we
transition to a higher interest rate environment we will monitor the banks’ liquidity position,
any deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio, and the impact on profitability of
changes in the valuation of assets.
17.
Financial development policies: We will make further progress in deepening our
financial sector to transform it into a regional hub for financial services. We expect the
process of demutualization of the Nairobi Stock Exchange to be completed during the
FY 2011/12. This will convert our stock exchange into a for-profit entity and open it to
participation from a wider range of investors, contributing to greater transparency,
accountability and liquidity. Other measures we plan to implement in the near term include
the raising of capital requirements for listed companies and the introduction of a new
framework allowing for more issuance and OTC trading.
18.
Pension reform: A comprehensive reform of social security policy is ready for
cabinet discussion. The new framework will redefine pension schemes, including by
transforming the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) from a provident fund into a social
insurance pension scheme. Reform of the NSSF has already started under a new management
that has radically improved the Fund’s governance environment, including by appointing
fund managers and custodians, fully complying with requirement set by the Retirement
Benefits Authority (RBA), the pension funds regulator.

Program Issues

19.
Safeguards assessment. The latest safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of
Kenya was completed on September 9, 2011. We are in the process of implementing the
recommendations of the assessment.
20.
Program monitoring. Our program will be monitored using the definitions, data
sources, and frequency of monitoring set out in the accompanying revised TMU. The
government will make available to Fund staff all data appropriately reconciled and on a
timely basis, as specified in the TMU. Table 1 shows the quantitative performance criteria to
be used in monitoring performance in 2011/12, and structural benchmarks, with
corresponding dates, are identified in Table 2. Fiscal performance criteria will cover the
budgetary central government, but the authorities will prepare to expand coverage to include
the budget of national government and county governments as early as possible in
anticipation of fiscal decentralization. The third review under the ECF arrangement,
assessing end-December performance criteria, is expected to be completed by April 15, 2012,
the fourth review will be completed by October 15, 2012, based on end-June 2012
performance criteria, and the fifth review will be completed by April 15, 2013, based on endDecember 2012 performance criteria., the fourth review will be completed by October 15,
2012, based on end-June 2012 performance criteria, and the fifth review will be completed
by April 15, 2013, based on end-December 2012 performance criteria.

Attachment II. Updated Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Kenyan authorities and
the IMF regarding the definitions of quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets,
their adjusters and data reporting requirements for the three-year Extended Credit Facility
(ECF) arrangement.
I. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND BENCHMARKS
2.
Quantitative performance criteria are proposed for December 31, 2011; June 30,
2012; and December 31, 2012 with respect to:


the primary balance of the central government including grants, excluding external
concessional project loans, cash basis (floor);



the net official international reserves (NIR) of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
(floor);



the net domestic assets (NDA) of the CBK (ceiling);



nonconcessional medium- and long-term external debt contracted or guaranteed by
the central government or by local and municipal governments without central
government guarantee (ceiling); and



medium- and long-term external public debt arrears (continuous ceiling).

3.
The program sets indicative targets March 31, 2012 and September 30, 2012 with
respect to:


priority social spending of the central government (floor).
II. PERFORMANCE CRITERION ON THE PRIMARY BALANCE INCLUDING GRANTS OF THE
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT

4.
The central government primary balance excluding external concessional project
loans on cash basis is defined as central government revenues and grants minus expenditures
and net lending, plus due interest payments and investment expenditure financed through
external concessional project loans, adjusted for cash basis.
5.
For program purposes, the central government primary balance excluding
external concessional project loans on cash basis is cumulative from July 1, 2011 and will
be measured from the financing side as the sum of the following: (a) the negative of net
domestic financing of the central government; (b) the negative of net external financing of
the central government, excluding external concessional project loans; and (c) domestic
and external interest payments of the central government. For the December 31, 2012 test

47
date, the central government primary balance including grants excluding external
concessional loans will be measured cumulative from July 1, 2012.
The above items are defined as follows:


Net domestic financing of the central government is defined as the sum of:







net domestic bank financing;
net nonbank financing;
change in the stock of domestic arrears of the central government; and
proceeds from privatization.

Net external financing excluding external concessional project loans is defined as the
sum of:








disbursements of external nonconcessional project loans, including securitization;
disbursements of budget support loans;
principal repayments on all external loans;
net proceeds from issuance of external debt;
any exceptional financing (including rescheduled principal and interest);
net changes in the stock of short-term external debt; and
any change in external arrears including interest payments.



External concessional project loans of the central government are defined as external
project loans contracted by the central government, which are considered concessional
according to the definition in paragraph 11. All other external project loans are deemed
nonconcessional external project loans.



Domestic and external interest payments of the central government are defined as the
due interest charges on domestic and external central government debt.
III. PERFORMANCE CRITERION ON THE NET INTERNATIONAL RESERVES OF THE
CENTRAL BANK OF KENYA

6.
The net official international reserves (stock) of the CBK will be calculated as the
difference between total gross official international reserves and official reserve liabilities.


Gross official international reserves are defined as the sum of:


the CBK’s holdings of monetary gold (excluding amounts pledged as
collateral);



holdings of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), including the August 28, 2009
General allocation and the September 9, 2009 Special allocation;

48







CBK holdings of convertible currencies in cash or in nonresident financial
institutions (deposits, securities, or other financial instruments).

Gross official international reserves exclude:


the reserve position in the IMF;



pledged, swapped, or any encumbered reserve assets, including but not limited
to reserve assets used as collateral or guarantees for third-party external
liabilities;



deposits with Crown agents; and



precious metals other than gold, assets in nonconvertible currencies and
illiquid foreign assets.

Official reserve liabilities are defined as:


the total outstanding liabilities of the CBK to the IMF except those arising
from the August 28, 2009 SDR general allocation and the September 9, 2009
SDR special allocation;



convertible currency liabilities of the CBK to nonresidents with an original
maturity of up to and including one year;



commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from derivatives (such as
futures, forwards, swaps, and options).

The following adjustors will apply to the target for NIR:


If budgetary support (external grants and loans)1 and external commercial debt
exceed the programmed amounts, the target for NIR will be adjusted upward
by the difference.



If budgetary support (external grants and loans) and external commercial debt
fall short of the programmed amounts, the target for NIR will be adjusted
downward by the difference.

7.
NIR are monitored in U.S. dollars, and, for program monitoring purposes, assets
and liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. dollar shall be converted into dollar equivalent

1

No budgetary support in the form of external grants and loans is expected in the next 12 months.

49
values, using the exchange rates as specified in Table 1, and net international reserves will be
computed as the daily average for the month when the testing date is due.
IV. PERFORMANCE CRITERION ON THE NET DOMESTIC ASSETS (NDA) OF THE CENTRAL
BANK OF KENYA
8.
Net domestic assets are defined as reserve money minus NIR converted in shillings
at the accounting exchange rate of 99.7 shillings for one U.S. dollar, plus medium- and longterm liabilities (i.e., liabilities with a maturity of one year or more) of the CBK, including
those arising from the August 28, 2009 SDR General allocation and the September 9, 2009
SDR Special allocation; minus the value in shillings of encumbered reserves converted at the
accounting exchange rate of 99.7 shillings for one U.S. dollar.


NDA is composed of:






Reserve money is defined as the sum of:





net CBK credit to the central government;
outstanding net credit to domestic banks by the CBK (including overdrafts);
and
other items net.

currency in circulation; and
required and excess reserves.

The following adjustors will apply to the target for NDA:


If budgetary support (external grants and loans) and external commercial debt
exceed the programmed amounts, the target for NDA will be adjusted
downward by the difference.



If budgetary support (external grants and loans) and external commercial debt
fall short of the programmed amounts, the target for NDA will be adjusted
upward by the difference.

9.
NDA are monitored in shillings, and will be computed as the daily average for
the month when the testing date is due.
V. PERFORMANCE CRITERION ON NONCONCESSIONAL EXTERNAL DEBT CONTRACTED OR
GUARANTEED BY THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
10.
The definitions of “debt” and “concessional borrowing” for the purposes of this
memorandum of understanding are as set out in point 9 of Executive Board Decision
No. 6230-(79/140), as subsequently amended, including by Executive Board Decision
No. 14416-(09/91), effective December 1, 2009. This definition also includes the following:

50




Debt is understood to mean a direct, that is, not contingent, liability, created under a
contractual agreement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including
currency) or services, which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in
the form of assets (including currency) or services at some future point(s) in time;
these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under
the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:


loans, that is, advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the
basis of a undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future
(including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits)
and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized
loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay
interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as
repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);



suppliers’ credits, that is, contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to
defer payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered
or services are provided; and



leases, that is, arrangements under which property is provided which the
lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are
usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the
lesser retains title to the property. For the purpose of this guideline, the debt is
the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected
to be made during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that
cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.

Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded
damages arising from failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that
constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not
considered debt under this definition (for example, payment on delivery) will not give
rise to debt.

11.
Debt is considered concessional if, on the date on which the contract was signed, the
ratio of the present value of the loan, based on the commercial interest reference rates
(CIRRs), to the nominal value of the loan is less than 65 percent (that is, the grant element of
the loan is at least equal to 35 percent of its nominal value). The present value of the loan
will be calculated by discounting future payments of interest and principal using the CIRRs
established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Specifically, the 10-year average of CIRRs reported by the OECD will be used for loans with
maturities longer than 15 years while the six-month average of CIRRs will be used for loans
with shorter maturities. To both the 10-year and 6-month averages of the reference rate, the
margin for different repayment periods will be added, as established by the OECD

51
(0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years; 1 percent for repayment periods of
15–19 years; 1.15 percent for repayment periods of 20–29 years; and 1.25 percent for
repayment periods of 30 years or more).
12.
The definition of external debt, for the purposes of the program, is any debt as
defined in paragraph 9, which is denominated in foreign currency, i.e., currency other than
Kenyan shillings (Ksh). Similarly, external borrowing is borrowing denominated in foreign
currency.
13.
The performance criterion on nonconcessional external debt is measured as a
cumulative flow from January 1, 2011 and this includes: (i) nonconcessional external debt
contracted or guaranteed by the central government; and (ii) nonconcessional external debt
contracted by local and municipal authorities without central government guarantee. The
authorities should consult with the Fund where public enterprises and other parastatals seek
nonconcessional external borrowing without central government guarantee to limit the
potential fiscal risk to the government. Medium- and long-term debt refers to debt with
maturity of one year or longer.
14.
The ceiling on nonconcessional external borrowing (see Table 1 in LOI) excludes the
proceeds of the issuance of a sovereign bond up to a maximum amount of US$500 million
now scheduled for the fiscal year 2012/13. The authorities will consult with the Fund should
they decide to issue the sovereign bond earlier.
VI. PERFORMANCE CRITERION ON THE STOCK OF CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED EXTERNAL PAYMENT ARREARS TO OFFICIAL
CREDITORS
15.
Central government and central government guaranteed external payment arrears to
official creditors are defined as overdue payments (principal or interest), which were not
made by their contract due date nor during the applicable grace period thereafter, on debt
contracted or guaranteed by the central government. The definition excludes arrears relating
to debt subject to renegotiation (dispute) or rescheduling.
16.
The performance criterion on the stock of central government and central government
guaranteed external payment arrears applies only to newly accumulated arrears on or after
January 1, 2011.

52
VII. INDICATIVE TARGET ON PRIORITY SOCIAL SPENDING
17.
The program sets a floor on priority social spending of the central government. For
the purposes of the program, priority social spending of the government is defined as the sum
of:






cash transfers to orphans and vulnerable children;
cash transfers to elderly;
anti-retroviral treatment expenditures;
free primary education expenditure; and
free secondary education expenditure.
VIII. COVERAGE

18.
All the references to central government in the current TMU will be changed to
general government, in order to include local governments whenever the fiscal
decentralization takes place according to the new constitution.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
KENYA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank
Approved by Saul Lizondo and Dominique Desruelle (IMF)
Marcelo Guigale and Jeffrey Lewis (World Bank)
November 23, 2011
This analysis updates the previous joint Bank/Fund debt sustainability analysis (DSA)
submitted to the Executive Board in January 2011(Country Report No. 11/48).1 Compared to
the January 2011 analysis, overall debt sustainability indicators have not changed
significantly. Lower than anticipated fiscal deficit in 2010 was offset by an increase in
external debt-to- GDP ratio due to exchange rate depreciation and increased IMF financing.
Risks are somewhat greater for external debt, particularly in the historical scenario, as the
current account deficit has widened in 2010. Nevertheless, Kenya remains at low risk of
external and domestic debt distress. 2,3 Strategies to guard against shocks could include a
build-up in international reserves as envisaged in the ECF framework.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
At end-2010, nominal public external debt was estimated at $7.3 billion
(24 ¼ percent of GDP). About 60 percent of this debt was to multilateral creditors
(including 43 percent owed to the World Bank) and 39 percent to bilateral creditors. A small
share of this debt (under 2 percent) represents disputed arrears on security-related contracts,
owed to commercial creditors.

1

It has benefited from consultation with African Development bank staff.

2

World Bank classifies Kenya as a medium performer in terms of the quality of its policies and institutions as
measured by a three-year average of the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)
index. (available at http://go.worldbank.org/AXO6I14PK0)
3

For a medium performer, the indicative thresholds for external debt sustainability are a net present value
(NPV) of debt-to-GDP ratio of 40 percent, an NPV of debt-to-exports ratio of 150 percent, an NPV of debt-torevenue ratio of 250 percent, a debt service-to-exports ratio of 20 percent, and a debt service-to-revenue ratio of
30 percent.

56
2.
Kenya has managed its debt relatively well and has regularly met its obligations,
except for some disputed commercial arrears. Its external debt-to GDP ratio was
24 percent at end-2010, mainly a result of prudent external borrowing, and Kenya has a more
manageable debt ratio than most of its low-income country peers. Kenya did not qualify for
heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) debt relief, as its debt indicators have been below the
HIPC Initiative thresholds, but it benefited from Paris club rescheduling in 2004.
3.
The disputed external commercial arrears, estimated at US$242 million, are
subject of ongoing investigations and litigation. The timeline for clearance of these arrears
has not been determined. The amount of arrears has been revised upward from an earlier
estimate of US$91 million, following completion of independent valuation of works, goods,
and services delivered under each contract. The authorities think that it is more prudent to
estimate a higher figure to reflect the likelihood of court rulings in favor of all creditors.
4.
Kenya’s net domestic debt stood at Ksh 580 billion at end-2010 (24¾ percent of
GDP), but potential domestic contingent liabilities due to pensions could be large.
During 2003–07, domestic debt declined to 13½ percent of GDP, as a result of strong
economic growth, prudent fiscal policies, and lower interest rates. The downward trend was
reversed during 2008–09 reflecting fiscal stimulus measures implemented to mitigate the
impact of the global financial crisis. Despite relatively low domestic debt-to-GDP ratio,
Kenya may be vulnerable to possible realization of contingent liabilities associated with
unfunded obligations of the National Social Security Fund and government’s current pay-asyou-go pension scheme for civil servants as well as domestic debt of parastatal companies.
5.
The DSA is based on non-reconciled debt data provided by the authorities, and
staff estimates. It consists of two parts—external and fiscal.


The external DSA covers external debt of the central government and the central
bank. External debt sustainability is assessed in relation to policy-dependent debtburden thresholds. A single discount rate of 4 percent is used.



The fiscal DSA covers total debt—external and domestic—incurred or guaranteed by
the central government.4

4

Public domestic debt comprises central government debt. In this analysis, total public debt refers to the sum of
public domestic and public external debt, but does not cover the entire public sector (e.g., parastatal borrowing
without a government guarantee is not covered).

57
II. MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
6.
Key medium-term assumptions underlying the DSA are consistent with the Staff
Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultations, Second Review Under the Three-Year
Arrangement Under the Extended Credit Facility and Request for Modification of
Performance Criteria and Augmentation of Access. These assumptions are:


Real GDP growth is projected at around 5 percent for 2011, 5 ½ in 2012, and about
6 percent afterwards. The projected growth remains, on average, about the same as
the pre-crisis five-year average of just above 6 percent and represents a deceleration
from the 2007 growth of 7 percent. As such, the projected growth reflects in part a
resumption of the momentum that was abruptly disrupted by the 2007 post-elections
violence.5



Average inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, is projected at about 12 percent
in 2012, 7 percent for 2013, and 5 percent after 2014.



The exchange rate is assumed to remain constant in real terms over the medium term.



The noninterest external current account deficit rises to about 9¾ percent of GDP in
2011, before falling to about 3 percent of GDP by 2015.



Broadly constant revenue and grants as a share of GDP (about 26 percent);6 the
primary fiscal deficit is 1.5 percent of GDP in 2010/11 and gradually declines to
1.1 percent by the end of the forecast period.



Development spending increasing from just about 8.0 percent of GDP in 2010 to
about 10 percent by 2012; a constant wage bill of 7.1 percent of GDP after 2012
compared to 6.8 percent in the 2011/12 budget, and a gradual decline in other
recurrent spending from 8.9 percent of GDP in 2008 to 7.2 percent of GDP over the
long-term, in line with the government’s budget strategy.



Real interest rates on domestic public debt are assumed at about 3 percent for shortterm debt and about 5 percent for medium- and long-term debt.



New domestic borrowings consists of 30 percent short-term debt and 70 percent of
medium- and long-term debt, with the latter having an average maturity of about
seven years. The NPV of domestic debt is assumed to be equal to its face value.

5

The likelihood of the domestic shocks of this nature has been reduced following the August 2010 ratification
of the new constitution.
6

The increase from the average of about 23 percent of GDP in the past three years reflect an expected
improvement in the revenue mobilization effort stemming from tax reforms, as well as in the capacity to absorb
project grants.

58


New external borrowing as a share of GDP (including nonconcessional borrowing
described below) increases over the medium and then declines gradually. It is
projected to average 3 percent of GDP during 2011–15, up from 2 ¼ percent of GDP
in 2010. It subsequently declines, falling below 1 percent by the end of the forecast
period. New external borrowing assumptions include sovereign bond issuance of
$500 million in 2012, additional commercial borrowing of about US$450 million
during 2013–14 and about US$200 million per year in the long run. Assumptions on
the debt terms include a 7½ percent fixed interest rate 10 year maturity and a bullet
amortization.

7.
Continued eligibility for concessional borrowing from the International Development
Association is assumed, although achievement of assumed growth rates could imply
graduation during the forecast period.
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
8.
Kenya faces a low risk of external debt distress reflecting the limited reliance on
external borrowing and an expected improvement in macroeconomic performance.


Under the baseline scenario, initial debt ratios are well below all of the indicative
thresholds for a medium performer, even if they increase over the medium-term
reflecting a higher rate of debt accumulation (see Figure 1 and Table 2a and 2b).



Alternative scenarios and stress tests indicate that Kenya’s external debt
situation is generally resilient. Standard stress tests reveal an initial upward trend
for the debt indicators but do not result in a breach of the thresholds during the
projection period. Over the period 2011–15, a shock combining lower GDP growth,
weaker exports, a lower GDP deflator, and a fall in non-debt creating flows would
push the NPV of public external debt as a share of GDP from 18 percent to
26 percent, and the NPV of debt-to-exports from almost 57 percent to 89 percent. The
most extreme shocks to debt dynamics by 2021 generally stem from a one-time
30 percent depreciation in 2011 or from a one standard deviation shock to the growth
of exports proceeds.7

7

The most extreme shock to the NPV of debt-to-GDP, the NPV of debt-to-revenue, and debt service-to-revenue
results from a 30 percent exchange rate depreciation in 2011, whereas the most extreme shock to the PV of
debt-to-exports results from an exports growth subdued during 2011–12 at only 1.3 percent (the historical
average minus one standard deviation).

IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
9.

Kenya’s public debt shows some vulnerability to growth shocks.



Under the baseline scenario, the NPV of total public debt-to-GDP, at 40½ percent in
2010, increases and peaks at almost 42 percent in 2012 and gradually trends down to
40 percent of GDP by 2014. Afterwards, it trends down to around 25 percent by 2031
(Figure 2 and Table 1a). Given Kenya’s relatively strong revenue performance, the
NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio declines to below 150 percent in 2013. The debt
service-to-revenue ratio falls to 22 percent by 2015, from 25 in 2009. It declines to
below 20 percent by 2030.



Alternative scenarios and stress tests indicate that Kenya’s debt indicators are
vulnerable to slower growth, keeping the primary balance fixed to a historical
average, and materialization of contingent liabilities (see Figure 2 and Table 1b). A
scenario assuming that 10 percent of 2010 GDP in potential domestic currency
liabilities as of end-2010 would be paid by the government in equal tranches over a
10-year period shows that debt indicators deteriorate notably compared with the
baseline. An alternative scenario shows that a two-year growth shock leads to a rise in
the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio to 55 percent by 2014, an NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio
to over 200 percent by 2020, and a rise in the debt service-to-revenue ratio to over
31 percent by 2030. Also, the scenario of permanently lower growth—baseline minus
half a percentage point—results in debt indicators that are considerably higher in the
long-term (e.g., by the end of the forecast period, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio
would be 50 percent). This result reinforces the importance of implementing fiscal

60
consolidation and expanding productive capacity in the medium term, in addition to
pursuing a prudent borrowing approach, to avoid a rising debt burden.
V. CONCLUSIONS
10.
Kenya faces a low risk of external debt distress, reflecting the limited reliance on
external borrowing and an expected improvement in macroeconomic performance. All
external public debt indicators remain below the relevant country-specific debt burden
thresholds. Further, although standard stress tests reveal a worsening in debt indicators, they
do not result in a breach of the thresholds during the projection period.
11.
Total public debt, however shows greater risk of unfavorable debt developments,
especially under a shock to GDP growth, unchanged fiscal policy, or materialization of
some contingent liabilities. Even temporarily lower GDP growth would set the NPV of
public debt-to-GDP, the NPV of debt-to-revenue, and the ratio of debt service-to-revenue on
a sharply increasing trend. A permanently unchanged primary balance from its 2010 level
worsens debt dynamics notably. Potentially large but unreported contingent liabilities also
pose additional risks to the sustainability of public debt.
12.
The sustainability of Kenya’s debt depends on macroeconomic performance and
a prudent borrowing strategy. The projected investment in infrastructure and the assumed
improvement in the investment climate would be crucial to sustaining strong exports and
GDP growth. Additionally, Kenya’s success in avoiding unsustainable debt to date reflects
good management, but also limited willingness on the part of creditors to provide financing,
at times due to governance concerns.
13.
The authorities were involved in the DSA exercise and concur with its
conclusions. The staffs encourage Kenyan authorities to build on their recent medium-term
debt strategy and to use tools such as the joint IMF/WB DSA template to help maintain a
prudent borrowing strategy. Such a strategy should continue to consider the total
concessionality and interest costs of Kenya’s borrowing, maturity structure, and steps that
would help guard against volatility, whether due to shocks such as droughts or to fluctuations
in external assistance. Strategies to guard against shocks could include a build-up in
international reserves as envisaged in the ECF framework.

Safeguards Assessments

An update safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) was completed on
September 9, 2011 with respect to the ECF Arrangement approved on January 31, 2011. As
reported in Country Report No. 11/165, the assessment identified heightened safeguards risks
since the 2009 assessment in the form of governance gaps and monetary program data
uncertainties which were resolved before the first review. Key governance bodies, including
the CBK Board and the Audit Committee, were not in place between September 2010 and
June 2011. Three Board vacancies were filled in April and the remaining two in mid-June.
The newly reconstituted Board has since met in June 2011 at which time it established a new
audit committee. The reliability of financial data was temporarily hampered during the
transition to a new accounting system. The assessment recommended that data reports be
closely monitored in the period ahead, and that internal audit should review reporting
procedures as a priority, including data reported to the Fund. The government is involved in
Kenya’s currency printing arrangements, in addition to the CBK, and sole sourced contracts
persist. In this environment, the assessment recommended that controls over currency
printing and delivery to the CBK be audited by external and internal audit to ensure security.
The assessment will be updated as required in cases of augmentation under the ECF
arrangement.
XI.

Exchange Arrangements

Kenya's currency is the shilling, which floats against other currencies. The official exchange
rate, which is set at the previous day’s average market rate, applies only to government and
government-guaranteed external debt-service payments and to government imports for which
there is a specific budget allocation. The exchange rate regime is a float, in which the
U.S. dollar is the principal intervention currency. Kenya has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions, other than restrictions notified

71
to the Fund under Decision No. 144 (52/51). On September 30, 2011, the exchange rate was
KSh 99.67=US$1.00.
XII.

Article IV Consultations

The last Article IV consultation with Kenya concluded on December 22, 2009. Kenya is
subject to a 24-month consultation cycle.
XIII.

FSAP Participation

A joint IMF/WB mission assessed Kenya’s financial sector as part of the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) update during September 2009. The staff report on the
Financial Sector Stability Assessment was issued to the Executive Board concurrently with
the 2009 Article IV Consultation Staff Report.

II. KENYA: JOINT WB–IMF MANAGEMENT ACTION PLAN OCTOBER 2010– SEPTEMBER
2011
1.
The Fund Kenya team led by Mr. Fanizza (mission chief) met with the World
Bank Kenya team led by Mr. Zutt (country director) on September 21, 2010 to identify
macro critical structural reforms and coordinate the two teams’ work for the period October
2010–September 2011.
2.
The teams agreed that Kenya’s main macroeconomic challenges are to ensure
public debt sustainability while strengthening the investment climate to diversify the
economy. To meet these challenges, Kenya needs to consolidate its fiscal position over the
medium term to bring the public debt-to-GDP ratio back to about 45 percent while creating
the right environment for investments to unlock the country’s growth potential.
3.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified the following structural
reform areas as macro critical, as they will be key to achieving sustained growth, a
strengthening of the fiscal position, and debt sustainability:


Public financial management reform: Progress has been made recently in linking
expenditure to medium term policy objectives. However, the preparation, execution, and
monitoring of the budget need to be strengthened. This is important in light of the
planned devolution of at least fifteen percent of government revenues to local levels of
government by 2015. Key elements of a reform include (i) supporting the complete roll
out of IFMIS in all ministries through the Institutional Reform and Capacity Building
project; (ii) establishing a Single Treasury Account to improve Treasury control; and
(iii) implementing a comprehensive Public Finance Administration bill prior to the
transfer of resources to decentralized units.



Tax reform: Efforts are under way to enhance tax policy and administration, and will
center on the implementation of a new VAT to be modernized and simplified in line with
best practice. Customs administration is also set to be strengthened in line with
commitments under the EAC Common Market Protocol.



Financial sector reform: The ongoing modernization of the financial system and the
growth in the regional activities of financial institutions call for enhanced consolidated
and cross-border supervision as well as an upgrade in the crisis management framework.
Focus also needs to be placed on strengthening Kenya’s capital markets through the
demutualization of the stock exchange, enhancing the Capital Markets Authority and
further development of debt and capital markets in the regional context. Similar efforts
are required to strengthen insurance markets, highlighted by the FSAP update as one of
the weaker areas in the system. An additional weak area highlighted by the FSAP update
is related to the NSSF and other sustainability aspects of the public pension system.



Infrastructure reform: Infrastructure has been identified as one of the most
problematic factors for doing business in Kenya. Reforms focus in three specific areas

74
(i) improvements at the Mombasa port; (ii) strengthening Kenya’s infrastructure in
transportation, energy, water and sanitation; and (iii) improving PPP institutional capacity
at the ministries.


Investment climate reform: Kenya has made important progress in improving the
investment climate. Nonetheless, other countries have been reforming even faster, and
post-election violence slowed down the reform momentum in Kenya. The slack in
reforms partly explains Kenya’s (relative) regression in international rankings of
investment climate. The authorities need to revive the reform momentum to create a
better investment climate, both through interventions in private sector competitiveness as
well as financial sector deepening and strengthening.
The teams agreed on the following division of labor:



Public financial management reform: The Fund is providing technical assistance (TA)
on a comprehensive Public Financial Management bill, on program budgeting, as well as
support on the establishment of a Single Treasury Account. The WB is supporting the
implementation of IFMIS and essential PFM reforms through the Institutional Reform
and Capacity Building Project and proposed DPL.



Tax reform: The Fund is providing technical assistance on enhancing customs
administration, including through improvements to inspection procedures and
information technology.



Public Expenditure Review: The WB will lead in the PER with specific focus on
service delivery in agriculture education and health sectors and building capacity for
social accountability, including expenditure tracking and public expenditure analysis.



Financial sector reform: Reform efforts are being supported by the WB through the
Financial and Legal Sector Technical Assistance Loan (FLSTAP) since 2005 with a
strong agenda on all regulatory and supervisory agents in the market. Support from the
Fund has been through technical assistance on focalized aspects such as stress testing.
The WB and the Fund should coordinate technical assistance on the establishment of a
crisis management framework, per discussions prior and during the FSAP update. Efforts
should also be coordinated on pension markets (particularly with regard to the NSSF).
Ad-hoc support related to the insurance sector should be carefully linked to ongoing
reform effort through the FLSTAP.



Infrastructure reform: The WB has been supporting the developments related to PPPs
and infrastructure finance for the last few years, intensified early this year with the
creation of the PPP secretariat. The authorities have requested support for the growing
agenda, including through the preparation of a new PPP/infrastructure finance project.
Additional elements are emerging, such as contingent liabilities analysis related to PPP
and beyond, which will be coordinated with the Fund.

75


Investment climate reform: The WB has been supporting investment climate reforms
through the FLSTAP (i.e., support for the drafting, peer reviewing, and sharing of
international practices on key laws; reforms to companies and land registries, and legal
framework for lending) which the proposed DPL is expected to complement. It also
supports targeted interventions related to business environment through the Kenya
investment climate program and the micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSME)
competitiveness project. Analytical work on industry mapping/clusters is also ongoing.



Fiscal decentralization: The WB and Fund will jointly provide TA on fiscal
decentralization envisaged in the new constitution. The TA will focus on setting up
equitable and efficient fiscal and public finance management systems and mechanisms
that allow county governments to perform their functions effectively over the long term.



ECF arrangement with the Fund: ECF-supported program will focus on strengthening
Kenya’s external position, promoting gradual fiscal consolidation while stepping up
infrastructure investment and providing sufficient resources to implement the new
constitution, bringing back the debt burden to the government’s medium-term target,
maintaining the floating exchange rate regime, and moving gradually to an inflation
targeting framework. The program will seek to strengthen public financial management,
modernize and simplify tax policy, and broaden access to financial services.

4.

The teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:



The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in the above macro critical
structural reform areas. Timing: when milestones are reached (and at least semiannually).



The WB team requests to be kept informed of the Fund’s assessments of
macroeconomic policies and prospects. Timing: in the context of Article IV and other
missions (and at least semi-annually).

October 2010–September 2011.

III. KENYA: KEY STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of November 14, 2011)
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General
1.
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance and
program monitoring. Although the overall quality, timeliness and coverage of
macroeconomic statistics have improved over the past few years, further improvements in the
methodology of compiling real, fiscal, and external sector statistics would be desirable in
order to facilitate enhanced design and monitoring of economic policies.
National Accounts
2.
The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) has made significant efforts to
enhance national statistics compilation. Limited funding for data collection activities, a longterm funding strategy, and a lack of trained staff are major constraints. A Statistics
Department (STA) advisor assisted the authorities in rebasing the national accounts estimates
at constant 2001 prices and compiling institutional accounts for the general government
sector. As a result, national accounts estimates for the years 1996–2010 in current and
constant (2001) prices) have been published. KNBS has made progress in developing
estimates of quarterly GDP at constant prices that are now published. However, there is still
need for improvements in the corresponding quarterly GDP in current prices and from the
expenditure side. Additionally, better coverage of the informal sector in GDP estimates is
highly desirable.
Price statistics
3.
KNBS still faces significant challenges in its compilation of price indices. In
particular, the compilation and dissemination of CPI series at a detailed level with a historical
dimension. In March 2008, a Technical Assistance (TA) mission assisted the authorities in
identifying the methodological issues relating to the measurement of inflation. The current
methodology of aggregating prices at the elementary level was found to impart a substantial
upward bias on CPI measurement. In line with STA recommendations, the KNBS released a
revised series that is consistent with international best practices in November 2009. By
February 2010, KNBS began to publish another series with rebasing and reweighing of the
CPI basket using the geometric mean method. The current series does not extend beyond
February 2009 and KNBS only plans to publish a historical series based on this methodology
in 2012.
4.
Import and export price indexes are compiled on a base year of 1982, based on annual
customs value and quantity data. A TA mission in June 2011 made recommendations for
improving the methodology; KNBS will seek additional resources for FY 2012-13 to develop
indexes that conform to international good practice. A mission may be undertaken in mid
2012 to provide training and assist in implementing appropriate methodology.
5.
No PPI is compiled at present. A TA mission in August 2011 provided
recommendations developing a prices survey and a PPI.

78
Government finance statistics
6.
The 2005 ROSC Data Module mission recommended: compiling fiscal statistics
following the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001 classifications and
tables; compiling annual fiscal statistics for extra-budgetary units, social security funds,
consolidated central government, and consolidated general government; investigating the
discrepancy between deficit/surplus and financing; obtaining more complete information on
external financing and expenditure directly financed from abroad; reconciling data
discrepancies between the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
on a regular basis; compiling and disseminating monthly and quarterly budget execution data
on a discrete (non-cumulative) basis; and preparing and disseminating a document on data
sources and methods. Limited progress has been made implementing these recommendations.
7.
A GFS TA mission that visited Nairobi in October 2011 identified a number of
shortcomings and made recommendations to address them: set-up a tripartite technical
working group ( MOF, CBK, and KNBS) to determine the institutional coverage of the
general government sector (public sector) and subsectors; disseminate the monthly budget
outturn on the MOF’s website, and report regularly these data to STA for publication in
International Financial Statistics (IFS); reconcile on a regular basis the monthly, quarterly,
and annual fiscal statistics; investigate the causes of the large discrepancy between net
lending and financing; develop the necessary modules to access the general ledger
information in the implementation of the Integrated Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS) for purposes of monthly and quarterly budget monitoring and reporting;
compile and disseminate fiscal statistics for budgetary central government following
GFSM 2001 classifications and tables, and gradually expand the coverage to include the
major extra-budgetary units and social security funds; and prepare a migration plan with a
detailed timetable for gradual migration to the GFSM 2001 methodology.
8.
The country reports data to STA for the budgetary central government for inclusion in
the GFS Yearbook, the last data reported were for the year ending June 2010. The KNBS
compiles the aggregate annual GFS revenue and expenditure data for the budgetary central
government based on detailed data in the reports of the Controller and Auditor General. The
data are currently submitted for publication in the GFS Yearbook in GFSM 2001 format,
using bridge tables developed by technical assistance missions.
Monetary statistics
9.
Progress has been shown in the improvement of monetary data and development of
the standardized report forms (SRFs). Kenya benefited from participation in the monetary
statistics module in the Phase II of the DFID Project. The main objectives of the Project were
the adoption of internationally accepted methodologies and best practices as recommended
by the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) in monetary data compilation, and
establishment of an Integrated Monetary Database (IMD) that meets the needs of all users on
monetary data. The principal achievements were (1) the completion of the SRF for the
Central Bank of Kenya (1SR); (2) the design and implementation of a new reporting system
for other depository corporations (ODCs) that meets the needs of statistics and bank
supervision; (3) completion of the 2SR for ODCs; and (4) production of a revised depository
corporation survey. Limited work was done on expanding the ODC sector to include Savings
and Credit Cooperatives (SACCO), on developing harmonized monetary statistics for
members of the East African Community, and compiling data for other financial corporations
(OFCs).

79
10.
The mission in August 2011 further improved the ODC reporting system introduced
in 2008, in particular with respect to reporting the repo and financial derivatives positions.
The mission also assisted in setting procedures for improvements of internal data
consistency. In addition, the mission met with the supervisory authorities of various groups
of other deposit taking financial institutions and designed reporting forms that meet the needs
of the SRFs, but are much simplified to reflect the limited transactions of these deposit
takers. With regard to the OFCs, the mission designed a reporting form for non-money
market unit trusts and reviewed in detail a new reporting system for pension funds produced
by the Retirement Benefits Authority.
Balance of payments
11.
The KNBS compiles annual balance of payments statistics in Kenya shillings that are
regularly reported to STA. In addition, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) compiles a
complete set of annual balance of payments statistics in U.S. dollars, which are reported to
AFR and used for programming and surveillance purposes. The two datasets are not entirely
consistent, and Fund staff has strongly encouraged the authorities to reconcile them.
12.
Although the overall quality of trade data may be reasonably good, data for other
current account and many financial account transactions are rather weak. The financial
account is largely drawn from the International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) which
suffers from a large and growing element of unclassified inflows and outflows that might
well include settlements of current account transactions.
13.
Kenya participates in the external sector module of the DFID Project. Three TA
missions have been conducted under the auspices of this project to undertake a
comprehensive enterprise survey of cross-border financial flows and stocks with a view to
significantly improving the quality of balance of payments and to compile international
investment position statistics. The latest November 8-19, 2010 TA mission assessed the
results of the 2009 IIP survey and the 2010 Foreign Investment Survey (FIS), and designed
the frame for a 2011 FIS.
14.
The establishment of a database developed by the Macroeconomic and Financial
Management Institute of Eastern and Southern Africa (MEFMI) for use within the region for
private capital flows surveys and for generating reports proved very effective. This database
generates tables that are needed to review reported data to assess gaps.
B. Data Standards and Quality
15.
Kenya participates in the Fund’s GDDS and the EDDI project for Anglophone Africa.
A Data ROSC was conducted in October 2005.
C. Reporting to STA
16.
The data for the budgetary central government, submitted for publication in the GFS
Yearbook, have been reported in GFSM 2001 format, albeit with a significant lag. Monthly
and quarterly GFS data are regularly reported for inclusion in the International Financial
Statistics (IFS). Monetary data for the central bank and ODCs are regularly reported for
inclusion in the IFS. Annual balance of payments data, following BPM5 classifications, are
regularly reported to STA.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 12/1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 17, 2012

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Kenya
On December 9, 2011 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Kenya.15
Background
Kenya’s economy has continued to expand, but high inflation and exchange rate pressures
have come to threaten the growth outlook. GDP growth has shown little sign of slowing down so
far and is estimated at 5.3 percent in 2010/11. Private investment has remained dynamic and
has supported growth of above 5 percent across all non-agricultural sectors. Agricultural sector
has begun to recover from the downturn in the first quarter of 2011.
Inflation reached 19.7 percent in November, well above the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) target
range. Food and fuel inflation have remained higher than anticipated, and exchange rate
depreciation has led to higher inflation expectations and an acceleration of core inflation. In
response, the CBK has raised its policy rate (CBR) by 11 percentage points since October to
contain demand pressures and rein in inflationary expectations.
Fiscal policy has moved towards consolidation. The primary deficit declined from 3.8 percent of
GDP in FY 2009/10 to 1.5 percent of GDP in FY 2010/11 as a result of delays in domestically
financed investment, restraint in current spending, and strong tax revenue performance.
15

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

82
Higher drought-related food and energy imports coupled with higher international prices, and
strong domestic demand, swelled the external current account deficit to an estimated
9½ percent of GDP in 2010/11 from 5½ percent the previous year. The combined impact of
these shocks has led Kenya to request an augmentation of access under the Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) arrangement.
The nominal effective exchange rate depreciated by 15 percent this year through September
2011, reflecting BOP pressures and high inflation. The CBK’s intervention in the foreign
exchange market has been limited, and this has allowed the exchange rate to adjust to absorb
the external shocks. Since mid-October, the exchange has stabilized on the back of CBK policy
rate hike.
The implementation of structural reforms under the program has progressed. A new valueadded tax (VAT) bill is almost ready to be sent to parliament, and a Public Finance
Management (PFM) bill has been submitted to the Commission for the Implementation of the
Constitution.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Kenya’s strong economic growth and satisfactory program
implementation despite challenges posed by the severe drought in the Horn of Africa and higher
than expected food and fuel prices. However, the combination of external shocks and strong
domestic demand, fueled by rapidly expanding credit, has led to a sharp increase in inflation, a
widening current account deficit, and currency depreciation. Directors welcomed the authorities’
firm commitment to address these imbalances, stressing the need for continued steadfast
implementation of their economic program.
Directors welcomed the recent decisive steps taken to rein in inflation and noted that further
tightening of monetary policy should anchor inflation expectations. They commended the
Central Bank of Kenya for raising its policy rate to help absorb liquidity and discourage
excessive credit growth and demand for foreign exchange. A gradual accumulation of
international reserves and maintaining the existing floating exchange rate regime will mitigate
the impact of external shocks.
Directors agreed that fiscal policy should continue to focus on medium-term consolidation and
complement monetary policy to curb domestic demand. Noting the progress made in reducing
the primary deficit, they welcomed the authorities’ plans to adopt a more ambitious
medium-term target by rationalizing non-priority expenditure and front-loading adjustment.
Directors underscored the importance of protecting key outlays, in particular emergency food
relief for the population, targeted transfers to the poor, implementation of the new constitution,
and high-priority investments.
Directors observed that Kenya’s financial system remains sound. They supported the efforts to
monitor credit risks more closely and to strengthen the supervision of intergroup transactions.
They also looked forward to the capital markets reform which will allow small and medium-sized

83
enterprises to expand their access to new sources of financing. Directors urged the authorities
to address deficiencies in the AML/CFT framework.
Directors noted the progress in structural reforms. They stressed that prompt implementation of
the new legislation on public finance management and the draft VAT law will be important to
ensure sound expenditure management in the context of fiscal decentralization and to
strengthen revenue mobilization. Directors underscored that additional reforms to improve the
business environment and adopt long-term solutions to the recurring droughts, including
investment in infrastructure, will enhance Kenya’s prospects for growth and poverty reduction.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Completes Second Review Under the Extended Credit Facility for
Kenya and Approves Request for Augmentation of Access and US$143.67 Million
Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the second
review of Kenya’s economic performance under a three-year arrangement under the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF). The Board also approved an augmentation of access equal to 60 percent
of quota, which would lead to a total access of 180 percent of quota, an amount equivalent to
SDR 488.52 million (about US$760.63 million), under the ECF arrangement. The Board’s
decision enables the immediate disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 92.276 million
(about US$143.67 million), bringing total disbursements under the ECF arrangement to an
amount equivalent to SDR 200.836 million (about US$312.7 million).
In completing the review, the Board also approved a modification of three performance criteria
for end-December 2011 and end-June 2012 related to the net international reserves, the net
domestic assets of the central bank, and the primary budget balance of the central government.
The three-year arrangement under the ECF for Kenya was originally approved by the IMF
Executive Board on January 31, 2011 (see Press Release No. 11/21).
Following the Executive Board’s approval of the arrangement with Kenya, Mr. David Lipton,
First Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
“Kenya’s economy has continued to expand despite the challenges posed by the drought in the
Horn of Africa, higher than expected food and fuel prices, and the uncertain global environment.
The combination of external shocks and strong domestic demand, fueled by rapidly expanding
credit has led to sharp increase in inflation, a widening of the current account deficit, and
currency depreciation. The authorities are taking decisive measures to address these imbalances
and to preserve macroeconomic stability.
“Program implementation during the first half of 2011 was in line with the objectives of the
ECF-supported program. The fiscal position at end-June was significantly better than expected,
as a result of strong revenue performance and strict expenditure control. Beginning September,
the Central Bank of Kenya increased its policy rate substantially and maintained a tightening
bias to discourage excessive credit growth, which had contributed to inflation and the current
account deficit.

86

“Sustaining high growth will require addressing macroeconomic vulnerabilities. The impact of
the increase in international prices on the country’s external position will require fiscal and
monetary policy adjustment. Monetary policy will need to remain geared towards reining in
inflationary expectations. It will be complemented by strengthened fiscal consolidation to curb
domestic demand, while protecting key outlays, including emergency food relief.
“Important structural reforms are under way. The Public Financial Management Law has been
submitted to the Committee for the Implementation of the Constitution. The benchmark on the
submission of VAT law is set to be met by end-January 2012,” Mr. Lipton said.

87
Statement by Mr. Moeketsi Majoro, Executive Director for Kenya
December 9, 2011
My authorities continue to demonstrate strong commitment to sound macroeconomic policies
and program implementation. Economic growth has remained strong and fiscal imbalances have
narrowed on account of revenue buoyancy and spending restraint despite considerable
budgetary pressures. However, balance of payments challenges remain. The balance of
payments needs have intensified stemming from the impact of severe drought conditions in the
Horn of Africa and high food and fuel prices. These shocks have exerted pressure on
macroeconomic stability and are threatening to slow Kenya’s strong economic growth unless
urgently addressed. It is in this regard that my authorities request augmentation of access under
the existing Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program to help reverse the deteriorating balance of
payments and stabilise the exchange rate. On account of their strong commitment to the
implementation of the program, my authorities request Directors’ support in concluding the
second review under the ECF, augmentation of access and modification of performance criteria.
Program performance
My authorities met all quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for end-June
2011. The fiscal position was significantly strong, despite heightened spending pressures to
cushion vulnerable households from the impact of the drought and persistently higher food and
fuel prices. Fiscal structural reforms moved forward with the new VAT bill set to be submitted
to parliament before the end of this fiscal year, while the new PFM bill is ready for submission
to the Constitution Implementation Commission (CIC).
Recent economic developments and medium term outlook
Kenya’s economic growth is vulnerable to prevailing external shocks including the severe
drought in the Horn of Africa, persistently higher food and fuel prices, rapidly deteriorating
global conditions, and the security threats from the immediate neighborhood. Although the
economy recorded strong growth of 4.5 percent in the first half of 2011, spurred by recovery in
tourism and agricultural production, the expected growth for the FY 2011/12 has been revised
downwards to 5.3 percent from 5.7 percent due largely to the impact of these external shocks.
My authorities consider faster, stable and inclusive growth as a key objective of economic
policy. In this regard, they remain committed to the implementation of the policies under the
ECF program to maintain macroeconomic stability, foster sustainable and inclusive growth
which is crucial for employment generation and poverty reduction.
Since the beginning of the second quarter of 2011, inflationary pressures have intensified with
inflation rising from 12 percent in April to 19.7 percent in November, 2011. In recognition of
the current macroeconomic challenges and rising inflationary pressures, the Minister for
Finance has set an inflation target of 9 percent for the fiscal year 2011/12 and 5 percent in the
medium term. Further, my authorities are committed to free market prices and have indicated
that they will refrain from using the powers provided under the recently enacted Price Controls
(Essential Goods) Act 2011 to regulate prices of essential commodities. Instead, they will rely
on targeted subsidies and cash transfers to protect the poor and studiously implement the
recently enacted Competition Act.

The current account deficit has widened to almost 9 percent of GDP in 2010/11 from
5.5 percent in 2009/10, due mainly to higher drought-related energy and food imports and slow
recovery in export growth. The exchange rate depreciated to a historic high of KES 107 to the
US dollar in October but has since appreciated by about 15 percent due to recent monetary
policy tightening and review of foreign exchange guidelines. However, international reserves
have remained low especially since June 2011 when the CBK suspended purchases of foreign
exchange reserves from the market while capital flows have moderated.
The fiscal position remains strong with the primary deficit contracting by more than
2 percentage points to 1.5 percent of GDP in 2010/11 from its 2009/10 level, reflecting good
revenue performance. My authorities target a fiscal primary deficit of 2.2 percent in 2011/12 a
downward revision from the 2.7 percent envisaged at the beginning of the program.
Monetary policy developments
My authorities consider price stability as the key objective of monetary policy. As such the
current monetary policy calibration is aimed at stabilising inflation and the exchange rate. During
the global financial crisis the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) rightly adopted an accommodative
monetary policy which saw the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) drop the policy rate from
9 percent in December 2008 to just under 6 percent in January 2011. However, as conditions
have begun to change, the stance of monetary policy has tightened: since the beginning of second
quarter 2011 the policy rate has begun to rise, reaching 18 percent in November 2011. This has
led to an increase in short term interest rates while commercial banks have revised upwards their
base lending rates. In addition, the MPC has raised the cash reserve requirement by 0.5 percent
effective December 15, 2011.
The authorities have also adopted a new framework for monetary policy giving more
prominence to the policy rate. In addition, various administrative measures were implemented,
in particular the review of the foreign exchange guidelines, to streamline foreign exchange
trading including a reduction in foreign exchange exposure from 20 to 10 percent. My
authorities are committed to a floating exchange rate regime and accumulation of foreign
reserves as a measure to better manage exchange rate volatility.
