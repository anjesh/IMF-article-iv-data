STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
DISCUSSIONS

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and risks. The macroeconomic outlook is favorable. Growth has firmed,
inflation has eased, and unemployment has remained low—trends that are expected to
continue. The main risks relate to the impact of the Fed’s tapering, the outlook for the
Mainland, and a possible correction in property prices.
Financial. The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) conducted in
2013‒14 concluded that the financial system is well regulated and supervised and the
banking system is resilient to shocks. The main areas for improvement are the financial
sector resolution regime and insurance sector regulation and supervision. The large and
growing exposure to the Mainland warrants continued close monitoring.
Property. After a prolonged rise, property prices have stabilized. Counter-cyclical
prudential and fiscal measures deployed during the upswing provide buffers that can be
used to faciliate an orderly adjustment in the market while safeguarding financial
stability. A long-run solution to housing hinges on ensuring adequate supply.
Fiscal policy. Hong Kong SAR has a track record of fiscal discipline. Casting fiscal policy
in a long-term framework will help strike a balance between spending to address aging
and inequality, preserving low taxes, and maintaining fiscal prudence.
External assessment. Hong Kong SAR’s external position is consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. The Linked Exchange Rate System
remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong SAR.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
1.
Political context. The leadership assumed
office in July 2012 amid public concerns over the
high cost of housing, inequality, and immigration. In
his annual Policy Address at the beginning of 2014,
the Chief Executive committed to provide additional
assistance to low-income households, increase
housing supply, and improve competitiveness.

slowdown in 2012 amidst weak global conditions,
Sources: CEIC; and IMF staff estimates.
Hong Kong SAR’s growth recovered to 2.9 percent
in 2013 as resilient domestic demand helped offset the continued drag from net exports (Figure 1).
As the global recovery takes hold, external demand is forecast to improve and lift growth to around
3¾ percent in 2014, while domestic demand remains solid. Inflation is expected to remain at around
4 percent, given the slow pass-through of housing costs. The labor market has remained strong,
with unemployment slightly above 3 percent. The current account is projected to improve gradually
in line with the global recovery.
3.
Financial developments. Credit continued to grow rapidly, especially lending for use
outside of Hong Kong SAR. Credit growth picked up through 2013 (16 percent y/y), though it
started to moderate towards year’s end (Figure 2). The main driver of growth was strong demand for
credit for use outside of Hong Kong SAR. Such lending was generally in foreign currency and mainly
represents Mainland-related lending. Regarding loans for use in Hong Kong SAR (excluding trade
finance), growth picked up slightly to 11 percent y/y and the composition shifted away from real
estate. Both residential and commercial property prices have leveled off, albeit at an elevated level
(Figure 3). Housing transactions in the secondary market are, however, at a record low. IPO activity
and debt issuance has picked up, while the Hang Seng index has remained subdued.
4.
Risks. Hong Kong SAR is a small and highly open economy and, as such, is heavily
influenced by global developments (see attached risk matrix). The main external risks are from Fed
tapering and the implications of economic transformation in the Mainland (including slower
Mainland growth). On the domestic front, a disorderly

spread) on the Hong Kong SAR economy is fairly muted as most borrowing costs are closely linked to
short-term interest rates, which move in tandem with the U.S. short-term rates. An orderly exit from
unconventional monetary policy in the U.S. would tighten domestic liquidity conditions, but any
negative effects would likely be outweighed by the benefit of a stronger U.S. economy. However,
negative spillovers could prevail if exit is associated with increased volatility in global capital
flows and financial markets. Higher interest rates, especially short-term rates, would also affect
property prices with implications for bank and household balance sheets.


Reforms in the Mainland. Hong Kong SAR has become increasingly integrated with the
Mainland through goods and services trade as well as financial linkages. Hong Kong SAR is also the
main offshore RMB center and has benefited from Mainland companies’ fund raising activities.
Empirical evidence suggests that permanent shocks from the Mainland explain a large part of Hong
Kong SAR’s trend output volatility.1 This close integration presents both downside and upside risks,
depending mainly on growth and reform implementation in the Mainland. Full implementation of
reforms in the Mainland could lift GDP growth in Hong Kong SAR about 0.3 percentage points in the
medium term (Box 2). In the near term, however, growth could slow by ¼–½ percentage points
depending on the extent that reforms slow growth in the Mainland. Further financial and exchange
rate reforms, together with the liberalization of the capital account would create more cross-border
opportunities for Hong Kong SAR’s financial sector. Conversely, a sharp slowdown in the mainland
would have a significant negative impact on Hong Kong SAR’s growth with implications on the
financial sector.2



Property price correction. Property prices have
increased some 300 percent from their trough in
2003. While prices have leveled off more recently,
estimates from staff models suggest they could be
higher than suggested by fundamentals.
Specifically, a user cost of property model, which
suggests that property prices should have adjusted
more to the increase in long-term interest rates (the
opportunity cost of holding real estate) following
Fed tapering3 and a regression-based model were
both updated.4 Thus, a disorderly correction,

This scenario was explored in previous staff reports and in N’Diaye and Ahuja (2012). Hong Kong SAR’s output could fall by
about ¾ of a percentage point for each 1 percentage point reduction in Mainland output.

resulting from, for example, global market volatility or domestic shock, remains a key risk as an
abrupt downturn in prices could trigger an adverse feedback loop between economic activity,

including implementing six rounds of
counter-cyclical prudential measures to bolster the resilience of the financial sector. Regarding
spillovers from the Mainland, the authorities were aware of both the benefits from continued closer
integration as well as the potential risks. In particular, they had been closely monitoring cross-border
lending. They considered the current swap/liquidity arrangement with the People’s Bank of China
(PBC) as sufficient to guard against liquidity problems in the offshore renminbi market. They were
confident that Hong Kong SAR would continue to benefit from further financial liberalization and
reforms in the Mainland, especially given Hong Kong SAR’s close ties and strong institutions. Growth
in other offshore renminbi markets and further opening in Mainland presented, in their view,
opportunities for expansion, such as providing wholesale renminbi services to other financial
centers.

EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT
6.
External assessment. The real exchange has appreciated modestly over the last year, official
reserves of over 100 percent of GDP provide a sizable buffer, vulnerabilities in the international investment
positions are low given the strong net external asset position, and there has been no foreign exchange
purchase since early 2013 (Figure 4). Empirical results in assessing equilibrium exchange rate and
considerations on external stance suggest that the external position is consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policies (Box 3).
7.
Exchange rate regime. The LERS is a transparent, credible, and effective exchange rate regime
and warrants continued support as the best arrangement for Hong Kong SAR. This is reinforced by recent
research, done jointly with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), which concludes that the United
States remains the biggest driving force behind Hong Kong SAR’s business cycle fluctuations.5 More
broadly, the success of the LERS over the past 30 years reflects Hong Kong SAR’s strong fiscal position,
robust and well-supervised financial system, and flexible markets.

8.
Authorities’ views. The authorities concurred with the staff’s assessment that the external
position and real exchange rate are broadly in line with fundamentals. They remain firmly committed
to the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) and considered it as the most appropriate exchange rate
arrangement for Hong Kong SAR.

FINANCIAL SECTOR
9.
Risks. Credit growth has been rapid since 2010. Low interest rates have fueled both corporate
and household borrowing. As a result, corporate and household debt is at a record high. Corporate debt
to GDP is among the highest in the region, but household debt is still low compared to international
peers. Among the listed firms, the distribution of leverage appears to be broad-based with no large
pocket of highly leveraged companies, and firms are profitable and liquid. Credit growth has been
mainly driven by lending for use outside Hong Kong SAR, including Mainland China.

systemically important exposure for Hong Kong SAR
in terms of a potential shock to interbank markets.6 A broader concept of nonbank exposure—
Nonbank Mainland China exposure (NBMCE)—has risen to about 170 percent of GDP or 19 percent
of total assets. NBMCE includes exposure to resident Mainland affiliates for use outside of Hong
Kong SAR (including the Mainland and elsewhere), lending of Hong Kong SAR bank subsidiaries in
Mainland China, and borrowing by foreign companies for use in the Mainland. While these
exposures could generate significant spillover risks, there are also a number of mitigating factors.
For example, foreign bank branches account for 43 percent of the exposures with credit risk
ultimately born by head offices. On the borrower side, Mainland large and well-known SOEs account
for half of the lending with the rest split between Mainland private entities (19 percent) and other
international and Hong Kong SAR corporations (31 percent). For the latter, repayment ability is
based on group financials rather than their Mainland operations. Also more than half of the
exposures are collateralized. The HKMA has recently enhanced reporting requirements on
Mainland exposures. In addition, since 2012, the HKMA has introduced specific RMB risk management

supervisory priority for the HKMA, including effective cooperation with Mainland supervisors.

is also found to be resilient to changes in liquidity
conditions, with foreign branches being more vulnerable as some rely on their parents for funding.

12.
Supervision and regulation. The FSAP finds that Hong Kong SAR’s financial system is well
regulated and supervised—at the global forefront in many areas—in line with the needs of a major
global financial center. Main areas for improvement include the financial sector resolution regime and
insurance sector regulation and supervision (see Box 4). As a financial center, it is also important for the
authorities to maintain their active international engagement to effectively manage cross-border
challenges and comply with evolving international standards including with regard to AML/CFT.
Continued market infrastructure development while maintaining a high standard of regulation and
supervision will also help sustain Hong Kong SAR’s competitiveness in the growing offshore RMB
business.

development. The latest initiative is to introduce a mutual recognition program with the Mainland for
asset management funds. Through the program, Mainland investors will be able to invest in Hong Kong
SAR-domiciled funds and vice versa.
14.
Authorities’ view. The authorities appreciated the work of the FSAP team and broadly
concurred with the main findings, which are consistent with ongoing reforms. They emphasized that
high-quality supervision and regulation combined with a sound financial infrastructure were critical
for consolidating Hong Kong SAR’s position as a global financial center. They added that it was
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

natural for Hong Kong SAR to become a financial hub for the Mainland corporate sector’s offshore
funding. Exposure to the Mainland could therefore rise further, especially as the Mainland continues
to open up. The HKMA would continue to closely monitor these exposures, and, as required, take
steps to manage risks. They noted their active financial sector policy agenda, which includes
implementing Basel III, introducing a new resolution regime for financial institutions, and reforming
OTC derivative and insurance regulation and supervision. They were also working on reviewing the
legal framework for market development, including the tax regime for the asset management
industry. Regarding AML/CFT, the authorities noted that Hong Kong SAR had made significant
progress in addressing the issues identified in the 2008 FATF mutual evaluation, and thus was
removed from its “follow-up process” in October 2012.

residents. Supply-side measures have also been
proposed with more land supply and a new 10-year housing target. Despite the recent price stabilization,
housing affordability remains a concern with the highest price-to-income ratio among regional peers.

16.
Property-related policies. A long-run solution to housing hinges on ensuring adequate supply.
The recently announced plan to increase housing supply, including a refocus on public housing, will help
address concerns on elevated house prices and rising inequality. However, this will take years and, in the
mean time, the counter-cyclical prudential and fiscal measures deployed during the upswing can
facilitate an orderly adjustment in the market. In unwinding the counter-cyclical prudential measures,
priority should be placed on safeguarding financial stability. For example, if growth in residential
mortgage lending was expected to slow excessively—as could happen during a market correction—then
some of the cyclical tightening of LTVs could be safely unwound. However, under such circumstances
(weak credit demand) the impact on the housing market may also be fairly limited. The fiscal measures
(stamp duties) more directly affect prices and thus are likely to have a stronger impact on the housing
market. These could be eased as the market normalizes, with a faster reduction in the event of a sharp
correction.
17.
Authorities’ view. The authorities noted that the current property cycle, starting from the trough
in 2003, has been long, partly due to the low global interest rate environment in recent years. While
recognizing the risk of a possible abrupt downturn, they noted that Hong Kong SAR households have
proved resilient to large swings in property prices in the past. Moreover, the relatively low LTV ratios and
household debt service ratios would provide an important cushion. They agreed with staff that the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

objective of maintaining financial stability must prevail in considering unwinding counter-cyclical
prudential measures and stressed the importance of being forward looking. They also pointed out
that the impact of unwinding counter-cyclical prudential measures on the market during a down
cycle may be uncertain because, at that time, credit demand would be weak and banks would likely
be more conservative in their lending decision. On housing supply, the authorities are committed to
increase public housing (a new target of about 280,000 units, compared to about 151,000 units
completed in the last 10 years) and land supply in the coming decade.

the past 15 years). Meanwhile, rising inequality and
population aging are adding to spending pressures, which has often led to ad-hoc or one-off initiatives,
including waiving rates (annual fee paid by most property owners or occupiers), paying rents for public
housing tenants, one-off tax relief, subsidies for electricity, transfers to the poor and elderly, and higher
capital spending. A Commission on Poverty was established in December 2012 and published the first
official poverty line last September, which will be used to facilitate policy formulation and assess policy
effectiveness. A statutory minimum wage was introduced in 2011 and increased by 7.1 percent in May
2013.

19.
Consistent budget overperformance. The
overperformance has in part been driven by an
underestimation of consolidated fiscal revenues by
around 2 percent of GDP on average, while
consolidated spending averaged about 1 percent lower
than budgeted.7 Excluding the capital account—
consisting of volatile land premium and capital works
spending—the operating surpluses also have
outperformed the budget estimate by nearly

The bias is estimated based on the initial budget forecast and the actual outturn of a fiscal year ending in March. The
government also announces a revised budget estimate in the interim of a fiscal year, often at the budget announcement
for the upcoming fiscal year, of which the bias is smaller. Some one-off items, such as bond issuance in FY2004/05 and
subsequent redemption may affect the magnitude of bias.

2014/15 Budget and fiscal policy framework. In line with the improved economic outlook,
the 2014/15 budget has an appropriate unwinding of stimulus, including a reduction in one-off

recurrent spending for 2014–15 over the revised estimate for 2013–14. Near 60 percent of recurrent
expenditure for FY2014/15 is allocated to education, health and social welfare, an increase of
6.7 percent from last year. In this context, there may be scope to strengthen social programs through a
reprioritization of spending and efficiency gains in existing programs. The recent report of the
Working Group on Long-Term Fiscal Planning casts fiscal policy in a long-term framework. This will
help anchor the discussion about how to balance spending to address aging and inequality with the
authorities’ commitment (enshrined in the Basic Law) to preserving low taxes and maintaining fiscal
prudence. The report showed an emergence of structural deficits over the next decades given
increased spending due to aging. It also proposed, for further public consideration, some
recommendations as inputs to help frame the discussion about long-term fiscal policy.
21.
Authorities’ view. With the recovery taking hold, this year’s budget unwinds most of the
temporary relief measures included in recent budgets. Budget overperformance underscores strong
fiscal discipline and a cautious approach to budgeting. The authorities also noted that existing social
programs have contributed to containing rising inequality, and that the Gini coefficient after
redistributive taxes and transfers has stayed broadly unchanged in recent years. They added that the
recently-established official poverty line will provide a useful tool for designing and assessing social
programs aimed at improving welfare of lower-income families. The authorities noted that the report
of the Working Group on Long-term Fiscal Planning could help anchor public debate, and they
intended to develop long-term policies on the basis of the recommendations in the report. While
recognizing the long-term fiscal needs, the authorities stressed that preserving fiscal discipline was of
paramount importance and critical for fostering macroeconomic and monetary stability.

STAFF APPRAISAL
22.
Macroeconomic context. Hong Kong SAR is recovering from a slowdown in 2012. Stronger
external demand as well as continued resilient domestic demand should help propel the economy this
year. Growth this year is expected to rise to 3¾ percent with low unemployment and stable inflation.
The main domestic risk continues to be an abrupt property price correction. As a small and highly
open economy, Hong Kong SAR is susceptible to external shocks and could be affected by Fed’s
tapering and developments in the Mainland.
23.
External assessment. Hong Kong SAR’s external position is assessed to be consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. This finding is supported by empirical estimates,
analysis of the balance of payments and the net foreign assets position, and consideration of Hong
Kong SAR’s status as a global trading and financial center. Robust and proactive financial
supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, flexible markets, and the Linked Exchange

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

Rate System have worked well to keep the external position broadly in balance. The LERS is a
transparent, credible, and effective exchange rate regime.
24.
Financial sector. The FSAP finds that Hong Kong SAR’s financial system is well regulated and
supervised, displaying a high level of compliance with international standards. The priorities for
improvement are in the area of the financial sector resolution regime and insurance sector
regulation and supervision. The FSAP stress tests also suggest that the financial sector has the
capacity to withstand a diversity of large and global shocks. Deepening ties with the Mainland
suggest that financial linkages, including through the offshore RMB market, will continue to grow,
especially as the Mainland further liberalizes its capital account and financial sector. However, the large
and rapidly growing exposure to the Mainland and the potential for higher RMB volatility to impact the
offshore market requires close monitoring and cooperation with Mainland supervisors.
25.
Property sector. The authorities’ target to increase housing supply is a welcome step in
improving affordability and addressing the medium-term challenges in the property market.
Counter-cyclical prudential policies that have been implemented over recent years should provide
buffers to the financial system in the event of a property price correction. Fiscal measures deployed
during the upswing could facilitate an orderly adjustment in the market while safeguarding financial
stability. The unwinding of the counter-cyclical prudential measures should be linked to the dissipation of
systemic financial sector risks. The fiscal measures (extra stamp duties) could be eased in line with the
normalization of the market, with a faster reduction in the event of a sharp correction.
26.
Fiscal policy. The authorities continue to maintain a prudent, counter-cyclical fiscal policy that
provides a solid foundation for the LERS. This year’s budget has an appropriate unwinding of stimulus as
the economic recovery takes hold. The effort to cast fiscal policy in a long-term framework, as proposed
recently by the Working Group on Long-Term Fiscal Planning, is welcome. Fiscal policy planning will need
to strike a balance between addressing aging and inequality related needs while fulfilling the authorities’
commitment to low taxes and fiscal prudence. In this context, there may be scope for a reprioritization of
spending and efficiency gains in existing social programs. Beyond that, public discussion should continue
on policies to address long-term spending pressures while preserving fiscal prudence.
27.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation discussions take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Fed’s Tapering and Implications on Hong Kong SAR
This box examines how U.S. Fed tapering could impact Hong Kong SAR’s economy. Evidence from past
episodes suggests that Hong Kong SAR growth and exports are likely to rise. This implies that any drag
from higher interest rates has been offset by the benefit of stronger U.S. growth. The impact on Hong
Kong SAR financial conditions is less clear. Moreover, some caution is warranted in extrapolating from
past episodes to the current one, as many factors are at a play that could influence how Hong Kong SAR
is impacted this time.
With the LERS, Hong Kong SAR imports U.S. monetary policy. Therefore, since 2009, it has been in
a high-liquidity low-interest rate environment, which has fueled growth in credit and property prices.
Hong Kong SAR can be affected by Fed’s tapering (or rise in the term spread) through:


Asset prices. Property prices could correct with the rise in the opportunity cost of funds (long-term
interest rates), which would have negative wealth effects and dampen household consumption.



Credit. While credit in Hong Kong SAR is mostly based on short-term rates, the higher-term spread
could affect borrowing costs (such as in the bond market).



Risk sentiment. Cross-border flows would be impacted by portfolio shifts as investors reevaluate
risk and return, as evidenced by the bouts of global capital market volatility since the Fed’s
announcement of tapering in May 2013. Staff analysis suggests that U.S. interest rates do not
significantly impact non-FDI capital flows into Hong Kong SAR. However, such flows have
increased noticeably during the period of U.S. unconventional monetary policy—pointing to the
possibility that global capital market volatility could spillover into Hong Kong SAR.

Rising U.S. long-term interest rates tend to be associated with a pick-up of growth in both the
U.S. and Hong Kong SAR. The performance of Hong Kong SAR’s economy is examined around peaks
and troughs of U.S. financial cycles (see figure). Since the early 1990s, in all but one episode growth in
Hong Kong SAR rose following increasing U.S. yields. The exception is 1994, which was followed by
deteriorating conditions in emerging markets. Hong Kong SAR exports also tended to rise, as import
demand from the U.S. picked up with the increase in U.S. growth. However, the impact on general
financial conditions is not conclusive. Staff’s formal examination of the relationship through a structural
vector autoregression (SVAR) model also finds that an increase in U.S. term spreads is associated with
an increase in output in Hong Kong SAR.1 Negative effects from U.S. yield curve steepening were
generally offset by stronger U.S. growth. However, it is not conclusive to what extent the current
episode will follow these past patterns, especially if it is associated with rising global capital flow
volatility or other shocks.

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

Box 2. Impact of China’s Economic Transition Under the Third-Plenum Reform Blueprint
Successful implementation of reforms in the Mainland would be good for the Mainland, World, and Hong Kong SAR
economies. Implementation could initially slow Mainland growth, with knock-on effects to Hong Kong SAR. However, over
time, Mainland growth would be more inclusive and sustainable with much higher per capita income and consumption,
providing significant benefits to the Hong Kong SAR economy.
China has put forward a comprehensive and ambitious reform blueprint. If successfully implemented, it would move
the economy to a more inclusive, green, and sustainable growth path. By giving markets ‘decisive’ role, reforms would
guide better resource allocation, expand the service sector, and fuel productivity gains. This move to a slower but higherquality and more sustainable growth path will have global spillovers. A structural general equilibrium model is used to
1
assess the impact of reforms, with a focus on the Mainland and Hong Kong SAR. Translating the blueprint to a structural
2
model requires making assumptions about the timing and sequencing of implementation. The World Economic Outlook

baseline, which assumes a full but gradual implementation of reforms, is compared to two alternative scenarios. One with
faster implementation (“fast implementation”) and another with little progress (“No implementation”).
In the “fast implementation” scenario Mainland growth slows in the near-term, but in the long-run income is
much higher. The simulation suggests that near-term growth could slow by ½–¾ percentage points relative to the WEO
baseline (text figures). Over time, however, the reform dividends would kick-in and by 2020 income would be higher than
in the baseline. Moreover, private consumption would grow faster than output and converge to the GDP share in
comparable economies. By 2030, income per capita would rise from 25 percent of the U.S. level (PPP terms) to 40 percent
and consumption per capita would nearly double (to 25 percent of the U.S. level). The global economy would benefit from
China’s rise in per capita income and consumption. The gradual move towards higher value-added exports in China would
give room for labor-intensive industries in other emerging economies to gain ground. After an initial slowdown, global
growth could increase by 0.2 percentage points per annum over the medium term.
Hong Kong SAR would benefit significantly in the long run. The simulation suggests that growth in Hong Kong SAR,
relative to the baseline, would slow modestly (about ¼ percentage points) for two years. The benefits, however, will
emerge over time as Hong Kong SAR gains from higher per capita income. Growth would be ¼ percentage points higher
over the medium term (text figures) and, by 2030, income per person in Hong Kong SAR is 3½–5 percent higher than
under the baseline.


Trade channel. The Mainland is Hong Kong SAR’s largest trading partner and accounts for more than half of Hong
Kong SAR’s external trade (at about 180 percent of GDP). In the simulation, RMB appreciation and a loss of
competitiveness from rising labor and resource costs dampen re-exports from Mainland in the near term. However,
over time, Hong Kong SAR would benefit from higher value-added exports as the Mainland moves up the quality
ladder in supply chains and household income improves. In addition, Hong Kong SAR also provides a host of
services, including logistics, financial, and business services while tourism is an important source of employment. By
continuing to upgrade its infrastructure and human capital, Hong Kong SAR would best be able to benefit from rising
Mainland demand.

––––––––––––

This note uses the Flexible System of Global Models (FSGM) to assess the spillover impact. The model is also used in Spillover Reports by

the International Monetary Fund.

The parameters used in the model are based on previous empirical research and cross-country comparisons, where applicable, which
would generate endogenous impact on key macroeconomic variables. For details, see forthcoming working paper.

Financial channels. Reforms in Mainland would provide a ‘first-mover’ advantage for Hong Kong SAR as a
leading offshore RMB center. Hong Kong SAR has the largest pool of RMB deposits, is the main hub for RMB
payments, and has asset markets poised to expand as the Mainland undertakes financial and exchange rate
reforms. As reforms progress, gross capital flows are likely to increase significantly and financial activity in
Hong Kong SAR could rise accordingly, including initial public offerings, offshore bond issuance, and
syndicated loan markets. Activity has already picked up in the first quarter of 2014, with new listings reaching
US$5.8 billion, a fivefold increase from last year, while RMB bond issuance (not including RMB certificates of
deposit) amounted to about US$9.5 billion.



However, in the “no-implementation” scenario, the Mainland and global economies would be worse off, with
knock-on effects to Hong Kong SAR. This becomes clear over time, as the convergence of Mainland income to
advanced economy levels stalls. This maps into slower growth that adversely impacts the global economy and
Hong Kong SAR. The “no-implementation” simulation suggests that by 2030, Hong Kong SAR income per capita
would be 4–7 percent lower than in the baseline and about 7–12 percent lower than in the “fast-implementation”
scenario.

result, net foreign assets and the current account balance are
likely to be more variable, making quantitative estimates subject to more uncertainty than other economies.

1

External developments and outlook. Net foreign assets increased significantly after the global financial crisis, to
over 250 percent of GDP, reflecting a pickup in capital inflows as result of monetary easing in advanced economies
and valuation changes. As a regional financial center, gross capital flows are large relative to the economy (over
100 percent of GDP). Hong Kong SAR’s strong financial institutions, buttressed by robust regulation and
supervision and experience as a financial center, help contain the risks from volatile capital flows. As such, Hong
Kong SAR has been able to maintain external stability with a fully open capital account and the Linked Exchange
Rate System. Foreign exchange reserves are 110 percent of GDP, and are adequate for precautionary purposes and
ensuring the smooth functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System. In addition, the government has fiscal
reserves of about 35 percent of GDP, sufficient to cover 20 months of public spending. The current account surplus
fell substantially following the global financial crisis, but is expected to improve in line with the global recovery.
From a low of 2¾ percent of GDP in 2012, the surplus is projected to rise to 5 percent of GDP over the medium
term in line with the global recovery, driven mainly by a pickup in the income balance.

2

Overall assessment. The external position is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable
policy settings. In quantitative terms, the gap relative to the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policies is -3 to 3 percent of GDP for the current account and -10 to 10 percent for the REER. This
judgment is based on the quantitative estimates, staff’s assessment that macroeconomic policies are appropriate,
and the outlook for the external position. Staff does not perceive distortions substantially affecting saving and
investment rates and balances. The relatively wide ranges reflect the uncertainty in such assessments for a global
trading and financial center. Robust and proactive financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal
management, flexible markets, and the Linked Exchange Rate System have worked well to keep the external
position broadly in balance.
––––––––––––

Hong Kong SAR is not included in the External Balance Assessment (EBA), in part because these techniques are not wellsuited for offshore financial centers. As in other financial centers, the external sustainability (ES) approach, in assuming a
stabilizing net foreign asset to GDP ratio at high levels, may not be indicative of Hong Kong SAR’s external stability.

Box 4. Main FSAP Recommendations
Overall, the FSAP finds Hong Kong SAR’s regulation and supervision framework of the financial sector to be
robust. Key recommendations are as follows:



Crisis management and resolution. The authorities are encouraged to push forward their plans to
establish a fully comprehensive framework for recovery and resolution, in line with emerging
international good practices. This is especially important given the role the globally systemically
important institutions (G-SIFIs) play in Hong Kong SARs, but also for the resilience of the financial
market infrastructures (FMIs).



Insurance sector. The authorities should ensure implementation of the independent Insurance Agency
(IIA) as scheduled in 2015. In addition, the legal and regulatory framework should be strengthened in a
number of areas, including by establishing a regulatory regime for insurance groups, implementing a
risk-based capital regime and strengthening supervision of intermediaries.



Securities market. As the authorities have already identified, it is important to strengthen the oversight
regime of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, especially as its business model evolves. In
addition, oversight of external auditors should be improved, and the enforcement regime strengthened
in a few areas.



Banking sector. Hong Kong SAR has a very high level of compliance with the strengthened Basel Core
Principles for Effective Banking Supervision (BCPs).



Financial market infrastructure (FMIs). Further enhancements will be needed by the clearing houses
to comply fully with new international standards and support Hong Kong SAR’s position as an
international financial center.



Macroprudential oversight. Strengthening the capacity for systemic risk analysis at the SFC and the IA
would help ensure that cross-sectoral interconnections are adequately captured and brought to the
attention of the Financial Stability Committee.



Cross-border regulatory coordination. Continued active participation in the supervisory colleges and
crisis management groups of GSIFIs is essential in managing risk in the financial system. Similarly, strong
cooperation with regulatory counterparts in China is essential to manage the risks associated with
increased integration. Continued active participation in international regulatory fora is also needed to
mitigate potential effects from global regulatory developments.

Box 5. Update on RMB Internationalization
The use of offshore RMB has continued to expand rapidly. This is true in terms of use for trade and FDI, number of offshore
financial centers, depth of assets markets, and daily turnover.
Trade and investment. By end-2013, trade settlement in RMB had increased to about 14 percent of the Mainland’s total
current account transactions trade, double the ratio share in 2011. The share of FDI settled in RMB increased from 4 percent
in 2011 to 20 percent. About 9 percent of outward direct investment (ODI) it settled in RMB.
Offshore financial centers. RMB business has expanded to other financial centers. In 2013, RMB clearing banks were
established in Singapore and Taiwan Province of China. The United Kingdom and Germany are also expected to establish
RMB clearing banks soon. Singapore, France, and the United Kingdom were also granted Offshore RMB Qualified Foreign
Institutional Investors (RQFII) quota (RMB 50-80 billion each, compared to RMB 270 billion for Hong Kong SAR). However,
Hong Kong SAR remains the leading offshore RMB center. It has the largest pool of RMB deposits and is the main hub for
RMB payment through HKMA’s Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) infrastructure. RMB deposits in Hong Kong SAR grew
strongly in 2013 (43 percent y/y), and at end-2013 totaled RMB 860 billion. This is about 12 percent of total deposits in
Hong Kong SAR, but only about 1 percent of Mainland deposits. Singapore and Taiwan Province of China hold, respectively,
about RMB 200 billion and RMB 180 billion of RMB deposits. According to SWIFT payment data, Hong Kong SAR is a
leading hub for RMB payment with a market share of 73 percent. For comparison, Singapore and the UK each have a share
of about 6 percent.
Offshore RMB assets. Issuance of dim sum (offshore RMB) bonds remained active and the outstanding amount reached
RMB 310 billion at end-2013. A variety of Mainland and international entities have issued bonds, seeking to establish a
footprint in the RMB market and take advantage of low funding costs—analysts reported that some issuers could lower
funding costs by around 50 basis points by issuing in RMB and swapping into U.S. dollars. The market has deepened
further with the emergence of new types of RMB-denominated assets, including (as of March 2014) 17 ETFs, 1 REIT, and
derivative warrants. Average daily trading of these listed RMB securities in Hong Kong SAR reached RMB 95 million in 2013
(over 90 percent of the trading was in ETFs). The outstanding amount of RMB bank loans rose to RMB 116 billion in 2013.
Offshore RMB trading volume. From 2010 to 2013, total RMB

Treasury Markets Association launched an interbank reference

participants manage interest rate risk. The HKMA also enhanced the RMB liquidity facilities available to participating banks
in Hong Kong SAR by using (i) the PBC swap agreement (RMB 400 billion) to make one-day funds available on the next day
(T+1 basis); and (ii) the HKMA’s own RMB facility to make overnight funds available on the same day (T+0 basis).

Likelihood

Impact

Recommended Policy Response

High

Medium. Hong Kong SAR has weathered EM volatility
rounds in the last year quite well. Still, volatile asset prices
and capital flows could lead to financial distress and slow
growth.

‧ Ensure bank lending standards and risk management practices are sound.
Adjust countervailing macroprudential measures to contain risks.

Medium

High. Falling collateral values and negative wealth effect
could trigger adverse feedback loop between economic
activity, bank lending, household indebtedness, and the
property markets.

‧ Adjust macroprudential measures while safeguarding financial stability.

Disorderly correction of housing
prices

Protracted slow growth in global
economies (due to adverse impact
of deleveraging larger than
currently expected, slower trend
growth in emerging markets, and
delayed reforms and fiscal
adjustment)

Medium

High. As a small open economy, financial center, and key
trading hub, Hong Kong SAR growth and financial markets
would be impacted.

‧Deploy fiscal stimulus to support domestic demand with emphasis on lowincome and vulnerable households. Options include targeted tax relief,
increased transfers to households, and support for smaller enterprises.

‧ Ensure regulatory and supervision standards and risk management
practices are sound.

Medium

Medium. Uneven progress on reform across major
jurisdictions and uncertainty on the design of future
regulatory landscape could lead to regulatory arbitrage and
exacerbate financial fragmentation, which could reduce the
willingness of foreign banks in Hong Kong SAR to maintain
cross-border exposures and operations.

Medium

High. Steadfast implementation of the third plenum reform
blueprint will lead to higher-quality and more sustainable
growth in China over the medium term. These would improve
growth potential for Hong Kong SAR through closer trade
and financial links, although growth may slow in the near
term.

‧ Continue to undertake reforms and investment to enhance domestic
competitiveness through improving labor market flexibility, human capital,
and upgrading public infrastructure that would provide synergy to benefit
from China's higher-quality growth over the medium term.

Medium

High. Deterioration of corporate balance sheets, worsening
of bank asset quality (related to cross-border exposures and
trade links), and drop-off of tourism affecting the Mainland
contribution to consumption spending in Hong Kong SAR.

‧ Combination of fiscal stimulus and liquidity support described above. In
addition, work closely with Mainland counterparts to facilitate an orderly
resolution of distressed assets and address any weaknesses in banks'
balance sheets.

Surges in global financial market
volatility in relation to the exit of
unconventional monetary policy

‧ Provide liquidity through existing facilities (such as discount window,
foreign exchange swaps, and term repos)

‧ Deploy fiscal measures to address demand-supply imbalances.
‧ Ensure adequate supply of land and public housing in the medium term.

‧ Continue to maintain close relationship with foreign financial supervisory
agencies in the formulation and implementation of global regulatory
framework.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the
staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of
30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Nonmutually exclusive risks may interact and
materialize jointly.

FUND RELATIONS
Membership Status
As a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong SAR is not a
member of the Fund. However, annual consultation discussions have been held with the
Hong Kong SAR authorities since October 1990, and the staff also holds discussions with the
authorities in connection with the Fund’s Global Financial Stability reports. STA has provided
Hong Kong SAR with technical assistance in the area of balance of payments statistics and
Hong Kong SAR officials have attended IMF Institute courses on balance of payments and monetary
statistics, and financial programming. The authorities requested an FSAP, which has been
undertaken in conjunction with the 2014 Article IV consultation.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
The Hong Kong dollar has been linked to the U.S. dollar under a currency board arrangement, the
Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), since October 1983 at a rate of HK$7.8/US$1. The Hong Kong
Monetary Authority (HKMA) refined the operations of the LERS in May 2005—the first changes since
September 1998. For the first time since the introduction of the LERS in 1983, the HKMA explicitly
committed to sell Hong Kong dollar at a preannounced price (set at HK$7.75/US$), which is referred
to as the strong-side convertibility undertaking. Previously, the HKMA had only committed to buy
Hong Kong dollar at a preannounced rate (the weak-side convertibility undertaking introduced in
October 1998) and could sell Hong Kong dollar at any price. Along with this two-way convertibility
undertaking, the HKMA also introduced a symmetric trading band of 0.6 percent around a central
parity of HK$7.8/US$. There are no restrictions on current or capital account transactions in
Hong Kong SAR, and the Hong Kong dollar is freely convertible. The People’s Republic of China
accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement on
December 1, 1996.
Resident Representative
The Hong Kong SAR sub-office of the Beijing Resident Representative’s office was opened on
September 23, 2000. Shaun Roache is the current Resident Representative.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes. Hong Kong SAR provides statistics to the Fund
on a timely basis for surveillance and publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Hong Kong SAR subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard and is fully compliant
with its requirements.
Hong Kong SAR publishes comprehensive balance of payments data and international investment
position statistics for 2000 onwards, and also publishes quarterly external debt statistics according to
the recommendations given in the External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users.
Hong Kong SAR reports both cash and accrual-based annual data for the general government
according to the Fund’s Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 1986 and GFSM 2001,
respectively). No subannual data are provided for publication in the IFS.
Hong Kong SAR participates in regular reporting of Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) to the IMF for
dissemination. The reported data are quarterly and cover all core FSIs and 12 additional FSIs for the
deposit takers sector.
In late 2009, the HKMA began reporting quarterly monetary data using Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs) that present data consistent with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. However, the
SRF data for Hong Kong SAR have not been published in IFS, which uses monthly data periodicity.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with People’s Republic of
China—Hong Kong Special Administrative Region

On May 9, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
Hong Kong SAR’s growth recovered to 2.9 percent in 2013 as resilient domestic demand helped
offset the continued drag from net exports. As the global recovery takes hold, external demand is
forecast to improve and lift growth to around 3¾ percent in 2014, while domestic demand
remains solid. Inflation is expected to remain at around 4 percent, given the slow pass-through of
housing costs. The labor market has remained strong, with unemployment slightly above
3 percent. The current account is projected to improve gradually in line with the global recovery.
Credit growth has been rapid since 2010. Low interest rates have fueled both corporate and
household borrowing. As a result, corporate and household debt is at a record high. Financial
integration with the Mainland has continued. More recently, credit has been driven mainly by
lending to Mainland affiliates. Nonbank Mainland China exposure has risen to about 170 percent
of GDP or 19 percent of total bank assets. The banking system is highly capitalized (Tier 1 capital
ratio is just over 13 percent) and Nonperforming Loans (NPLs) are low at 0.5 percent. With larger
pool of offshore RMB in Hong Kong SAR and more varieties of RMB-denominated assets,
offshore RMB in Hong Kong SAR has already become one of the most traded emerging market
currencies.
After a prolonged rise, both residential and commercial property prices have leveled off, albeit at
an elevated level. The authorities’ have proactively implemented measures to safeguard financial
stability and stabilize the property market. Supply-side measures have also been proposed with
more land supply and a new 10-year housing target. Despite the recent price stabilization,

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the
staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

housing affordability remains a concern with the highest price-to-income ratio among regional
peers.
Rising inequality and population aging are adding to fiscal spending pressures and has led to a number
of one-off initiatives in recent years, including waiving rates (annual fee paid by most property owners
and occupiers), paying rents for public housing tenants, one-off tax relief, subsidies for electricity,
transfers to the poor and elderly, and higher capital spending. A Commission on Poverty was
established in December 2012 and published the first official poverty line last September, which will
be used to facilitate policy formulation and assess policy effectiveness. A statutory minimum wage
was introduced in 2011 and increased by 7.1 percent in May 2013. In line with the improved
economic outlook, the 2014/15 budget includes a reduction in one-off measures of about
1.9 percent of GDP.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Hong Kong SAR’s recovery from the 2012 slowdown and the
favorable prospects for strong growth, low unemployment, and stable inflation. They noted,
however, that Hong Kong SAR is susceptible to adverse effects from the Federal Reserve’s
tapering and developments in the Mainland, and to risks from a potential price correction in
domestic property markets. Directors, accordingly, recommended persevering with prudent
policies, and welcomed the authorities’ determination to remain vigilant and take necessary steps
to safeguard Hong Kong SAR’s macroeconomic and financial stability.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to increase housing supply to improve affordability.
They noted that the counter-cyclical prudential policies implemented over recent years should
provide buffers to the financial system in the event of a property price correction. These
measures should be unwound with caution as circumstances permit.
Directors welcomed the findings under the Fund’s Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
that Hong Kong SAR’s financial system is well regulated and supervised, and commended the
high level of compliance with international standards. They noted, nonetheless, that there may be
scope for improvements as regards financial sector resolution and the oversight of the insurance
sector. Directors also welcomed the FSAP stress test results, which suggest that the financial
sector has the capacity to withstand a diversity of large and global shocks. They advised,
however, that the large and rapidly growing exposure to the Mainland requires the continuation
of close monitoring and cooperation with Mainland supervisors.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors took note of staff’s assessment that Hong Kong SAR’s external position is consistent
with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. They agreed that robust and proactive
financial supervision and regulation, prudent fiscal management, flexible markets, and the
Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) have worked well to keep the external position broadly in
balance. Directors generally agreed that the LERS remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong
SAR.
Directors commended the authorities’ track record of fiscal discipline. They considered the
unwinding of stimulus in this year’s budget to be appropriate and welcomed efforts to cast fiscal
policy in a long-term framework, as proposed by the Working Group on Long-Term Fiscal
Planning. They noted that fiscal policy will need to strike a balance between addressing
population aging and inequality-related needs while fulfilling the authorities’ commitment to low
taxes and fiscal prudence.

Statement by Tao Zhang, Executive Director for the People’s Republic of China—
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and
Michael Cheng, Advisor to Executive Director
May 9, 2014
On behalf of the Hong Kong SAR authorities, we would like to thank the Article IV and the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) teams for the candid and constructive dialogue
held during the missions. We broadly agree with staff’s assessment of the economic outlook
and we welcome staff’s view that Hong Kong SAR’s financial system is well regulated and
resilient.
Latest economic development and outlook
The Hong Kong SAR economy continued to grow at a stable pace. The year-on-year real
GDP growth rate was steady at about 3.0 percent throughout the four quarters of 2013, as
private consumption demand held up well on the back of full employment, while exports of
goods and services strengthened alongside the gradual recovery in external demand. Recent
releases of high-frequency economic indicators suggest that the Hong Kong SAR economy
will remain firm in the near term, and the authorities project the full-year growth rate to pick
up to 3–4 percent in 2014 from 2.9 percent in 2013.
Inflation remained moderate, with the year-on-year underlying consumer price inflation rate
staying at about 4.0 percent since the second half of 2013, thanks to the restrained food price
inflation and slower pass-through of market rentals. Looking ahead, consumer price inflation
is expected to be contained by reduced market rental inflation and stable global commodity
prices, and the authorities project the annual underlying inflation rate to ease to 3.7 percent in
2014 from 4.0 percent in 2013.
The authorities agree with staff that an increased volatility in global capital flows and
markets associated with the exit from unconventional monetary policy in the U.S. is a key
source of uncertainty facing the global economy. Meanwhile, the firm commitment by the
Chinese government to deepen and broaden economic reforms would help to put the
Mainland economy on a robust and sustainable growth path in the medium to longer term, to
the benefit of Hong Kong SAR and the global economy, even though the structural
transformation might result in slightly slower growth in the short run. The authorities will
stay vigilant to all these developments and take necessary actions to safeguard the
macroeconomic and financial stability of Hong Kong SAR.
Linked Exchange Rate System
The authorities welcome staff’s continued support for the Linked Exchange Rate System.
The positive assessment of the IMF on the suitability of the Linked Exchange Rate System

2
for Hong Kong SAR has greatly helped consolidate public confidence in the System. The
authorities also welcome staff’s balanced assessment of the external position of Hong Kong
SAR.
Property market
The residential property market has softened since February 2013, with residential property
prices consolidating and transaction volume staying subdued. The authorities welcome staff’s
support for property-related measures deployed to address the exceptional exuberant property
market caused by the tight supply situation and the low interest rate and abundant liquidity
environment. These measures have helped stabilize the overheated property market, reduce
the risk of a property bubble, and safeguard macroeconomic and financial stability. For
instance, the six rounds of countercyclical macroprudential measures introduced since 2009
have resulted in a reduction of the actual loan-to-value ratio for new mortgages and the debtservicing ratio, thus strengthening the resilience of banks against any property market
downturn. Moreover, the authorities are also determined to tackle the housing problem at
source by increasing land supply. The latest Policy Address has set out a target of providing a
total of 470,000 housing units in the coming ten years, with public housing accounting for
60 percent of the total.
That said, the countercyclical demand-side management measures are extraordinary
measures introduced under the present exceptional circumstances. The authorities have an
unwavering determination to uphold free market principles and the market mechanism, and
will continue to closely monitor the property market and consider adjusting or even
withdrawing these measures as and when appropriate.
Fiscal policy
Hong Kong SAR’s fiscal position continued to be strong, with the fiscal balance registering
surplus for the tenth consecutive year in FY2013/14, buoying fiscal reserves alongside.
While the fiscal position is expected to remain healthy in the short to medium term, the
authorities will continue to uphold fiscal discipline to ensure the sustainability of public
finances by aligning the growth of government expenditure with the growth of the economy
and government revenue, and will put in place a more vigorous internal control and
monitoring mechanism for assessing and prioritizing competing funding needs with
appropriate offsettings from different programs. Meanwhile, the authorities would strive to
preserve, stabilize, and broaden the revenue base having regard to the competitiveness of
Hong Kong SAR and the impact on the community.

3
Financial sector
As assessed by the FSAP mission, Hong Kong SAR’s financial system is regulated at the
global forefront in many areas and the financial regulatory framework has a high level of
compliance with international standards. The comprehensive set of stress tests also indicates
that the banking system is highly resilient, with no aggregate capital shortfall and liquidity
shortage even under extreme scenarios. This result is attributed to the proactive measures
taken by the authorities to safeguard financial stability.
Apart from the countercyclical measures in relation to mortgage lending, in light of the
relatively strong credit growth in the past few years, the authorities have stepped up
supervisory efforts on credit risk management of the banks since 2010. These include regular
and thematic onsite examinations on banks’ credit underwriting processes; regular
supervisory stress-testing to assess banks’ resilience to credit shocks; and introduction of a
Stable Funding Requirement since the fourth quarter of 2013 to ensure that the loan growth
of the banks are supported by adequate long-term funding and would therefore be more
sustainable against possible future deterioration in the liquidity situation.
While growth in Mainland-related lending has contributed to a notable part of the overall
loan growth in Hong Kong SAR, it is a natural consequence of the growth of the Mainland
economy and development of Mainland corporates. It also reinforces Hong Kong SAR’s role
as a significant international financial center. Such Mainland-related lending encompasses a
high degree of heterogeneity with regard to lender types, borrower industries, loan use, and
credit risk mitigations. The loans include those extended to Mainland enterprises obtaining
funds to finance their business expansion and acquisitions both on the Mainland and in other
markets, and also to local and international corporates for supporting their business ventures
on the Mainland. On the lenders’ side, foreign banks have increasingly participated in the
relevant intermediation activities using their branches in Hong Kong SAR, which account for
some 40 percent of the total. The results of supervisory work suggest that the risks of
Mainland-related loans are properly managed. At the end of 2013, the classified loan ratio of
the Hong Kong SAR banking sector’s Mainland-related lending portfolio stood at
0.29 percent, lower than that of the sector’s total lending portfolio (0.48 percent). Despite the
absence of any early signal of credit quality deterioration, the authorities will continue to
closely monitor banks’ asset quality and ensure banks are resilient to credit loss throughout
the economic cycle by maintaining strong capital positions and, where necessary and
appropriate, regulatory reserves.
Looking ahead, the authorities are committed to ensuring that the financial regulatory
framework follows international best practices. Specifically, the authorities are:



advancing the plans to establish in 2015 an independent Insurance Authority with
enhanced legal capacity, financial and operational independence, and more explicit

4
powers. In the meantime, the authorities are developing a framework for the supervision
of insurance groups and introduction of a risk-based capital regime for consultation with
the industry;



pushing forward the plans to establish an effective resolution regime for financial
institutions including financial market infrastructures. The second public consultation
exercise will take place later this year, with a view of introducing legislation proposals
into the Legislative Council in 2015;



preparing proposals to enhance the independence of the regulatory regime for auditors of
listed entities, with a view to better aligning with international standards and enhancing
international recognition of local auditors. The authorities aim to conduct public
consultation in mid-2014, and introduce amendment legislation into the Legislative
Council by 2015; and



working on the legislation to introduce capital buffers and liquidity standards following
the successful implementation of the minimum capital requirements under Basel III.

Offshore RMB business
Offshore RMB business in Hong Kong SAR has been developing steadily, with increasing
depth and breadth of the offshore RMB market, and the RMB deposit pool, trade settlement,
financing activities, foreign exchange transactions, and investment products continuing to
grow at a vibrant pace. Meanwhile, channels for the circulation of RMB between the onshore
and offshore markets have been expanding steadily.
As RMB becomes more widely used and circulated in different parts of the world, it is
natural that banks and financial institutions globally are starting to offer RMB services to
serve the needs of their clients. This would be conducive to Hong Kong SAR’s sustainable
development as the leading offshore RMB business center. For instance, when the scale of
RMB activities of overseas enterprises and banks grows, so would the demand for financing
and correspondent banking services offered by banks in Hong Kong SAR. Apart from being
a pioneer with a decade of experience and solid foundation in offshore RMB business, Hong
Kong SAR’s biggest and unique edge is its very close economic and business links with the
Mainland. Supported by these links, Hong Kong SAR’s offshore RMB market has developed
with greater size, depth, and breadth, and such intrinsic advantages will not erode simply
because of the introduction of RMB business in other offshore markets.
Looking ahead, to ensure that the offshore RMB business develops further in an efficient and
robust manner, the authorities will continue to enhance its financial infrastructure, work with
the Mainland authorities in expanding the channels for RMB fund flows with the onshore
market, and strengthen links between Hong Kong SAR and overseas markets in RMB
business.
