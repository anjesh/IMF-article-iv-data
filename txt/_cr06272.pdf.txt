ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation,
First Assessment of the Staff-Monitored Program, and
Assessment of Qualification for the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2006 Consultation with Mauritania
Approved by Amor Tahari and Anthony R. Boote
June 7, 2006


Discussions were held in Nouakchott from April 26 to May 9, 2006. The staff team consisted of
Messrs. Le Dem (head), Loko, Wieczorek, and Ms. Hijazi (all MCD), Mr. Meier (PDR) and
Mr. Callier, the Fund resident representative.



The mission met with Governor Ould Zeidane (Central Bank of Mauritania), Ministers Ould
Abed (Economic Affairs and Development) and Ould Cheikh Sidiya (Finance), other cabinet
members and government officials, and representatives of the business sector, civil society
organizations, and development partners. Mr. Sidi Bouna, Senior Advisor to the Executive
Director, attended most of the meetings.



Following the new authorities’ decision to resolve the data issues that had plagued the relations
with the Fund since early 2004, Mauritania embarked on a six-month staff-monitored program
(SMP) covering the first half of 2006 (Country Report 06/255). Successful implementation of
the SMP would pave the way for a new Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) supported program. In the attached letter (Attachment I) the authorities inform the Managing
Director of the progress in implementing the SMP and of the preparation for the new program.



On March 27, 2006, the Executive Board determined that Mauritania would be expected to
repay two noncomplying disbursements under the 1999–2002 PRGF arrangement
(SDR 12.14 million plus accrued interest) in two installments by June 15, 2006. The first
installment (SDR 2 million plus accrued interest) was paid on April 26, 2006, as expected.



In December 2005, Executive Directors agreed that to qualify for the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI), in addition to the resolution of data issues, Mauritania needed to implement
six months of sound macroeconomic policies and other remedial actions in the areas of budget
formulation, execution, and reporting. All these conditions have been met.



Mauritania accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 (a), 3, and 4 in 1999, but still
maintains foreign exchange rationing, which constitutes an exchange restriction under
Section 2 (a). Since 2003, the official exchange rate has been de facto pegged to the U.S. dollar,
with a minor adjustment to the parity in October 2005.



Despite shortcomings in the national accounts and balance of payments statistics, data provision
to the Fund is now broadly adequate for surveillance purposes.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The transition authorities, in power since August 2005, have implemented an
impressive policy shift toward transparency and good governance and have resolved
the data issues. The revisions of most economic and financial data since 1992 confirmed
that over many years fiscal and monetary policies had been substantially looser than
previously reported to the Fund.
Since the last quarter of 2005, the authorities have embarked on sound macroeconomic
policies and structural reforms. The elimination of extra-budgetary spending and central
bank financing of the budget were instrumental in limiting the government deficit. As a
result, inflation fell to single-digit levels over the last quarter of 2005 and official reserves
started to rebound. Mauritania’s external outlook and growth prospects took a boost from the
start of oil production in February 2006.
The staff-monitored program (SMP) covering the first half of 2006 is firmly on track.
Quantitative targets for end-March 2006 and structural indicators through May 2006 have all
been realized. Mauritania has achieved progress in the area of public finance management
(PFM), through the preparation of a medium-term expenditure framework ahead of the
budget preparation cycle, stricter budget execution, and improved reporting and tracking of
poverty reducing spending. The creation of the National Hydrocarbon Revenue Fund, which
is now operational, marked a key step toward a transparent management of oil revenues.
Staff considers that Mauritania has met all the criteria for MDRI qualification,
including the resolution of the data issues, six months of satisfactory macroeconomic
performance (October 2005–March 2006), and implementation of the PFM remedial actions.
Broad consultations are under way on a new poverty reduction strategy for 2006–10.
The authorities remain committed to the original 2006 budget spending limits and
intend to use the projected additional oil revenue for reducing domestic government
debt. This will also help the central bank achieve a significant build-up of official reserves,
while preparing the conditions for a successful liberalization of the foreign exchange system.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ plan to eliminate the foreign exchange rationing by October
2006 and move to a more flexible exchange rate regime.
Satisfactory implementation of the SMP through end-June 2006 would pave the way for
a new PRGF-supported program. The program should be based on further strengthening of
data collection and reporting procedures, and focus on a growth-enhancing framework of
sound macroeconomic policies and financial sector, trade, and governance reforms. The
medium-term fiscal framework should rely on a prudent use of oil revenue, consistent with
ambitious but realistic growth and poverty reduction objectives, and a manageable degree of
real exchange rate appreciation.

4
I. BACKGROUND AND REASSESSMENT OF PAST ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
1.
The Mauritanian transition authorities, who took power in the aftermath of the
military coup last August, have initiated a democratization process that receives
increasing support from the international community. Steps toward democracy include a
referendum on constitutional amendments in June 2006, parliamentary elections in
November 2006, and presidential elections in March 2007. The new parliament and
government are expected to be in place by May 2007. The transition authorities decided to
put transparency and good governance at the center of their program of economic
stabilization and structural reforms and, accordingly, have revised the data that had been
provided to the Fund to present a more accurate account of Mauritania’s economic
performance since 1992.
2.
The authorities have prepared a preliminary report on economic performance
during 1992–2004 covering all sectors of the economy.1 The revisions (Figure 1) mostly
concern government expenditure, revealing the previously omitted large extra-budgetary
outlays. The external trade data were corrected for significant underreporting of import
values. All these revisions have been incorporated in the national accounts, but their effects
on real GDP growth data and inflation indicators appear limited.
3.
The revised fiscal data confirm staff’s assessment of a year ago that
Mauritania’s past fiscal policy might have been substantially looser than previously
reported to the Board. Fiscal accounts now show substantial fiscal deficits (exceeding 10
percent of GDP in 2001 and 2003), which were largely financed through advances from the
Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM) and accumulation of payment arrears. Large extrabudgetary expenditure, ranging from 5 percent of GDP early on to more than 20 percent of
GDP in 2003, were the main element missing in the original fiscal data. Extra-budgetary
military expenditure, which reached 3½ percent of GDP per annum in 2003–04 (bringing
military spending to four times the levels envisaged in the annual budgets), represented the
largest identified component of these outlays. Other big items included spending on goods
and services, supplementary allocations for embassies and, in 2003–04, drought-related
expenditure.2 One third of extrabudgetary spending remains to be fully identified.

1

The horizon of the revisions varies across sectors depending on the availability of the sources and the nature of
the data (e.g., stocks versus flows); a broadly consistent set of data has been provided for 1994–2004.
2

During the 2005 Article IV consultation discussions, the authorities reported extra budgetary expenditure in
2003–04 equivalent to 55 percent of GDP over 18 months. The revised data show that extra budgetary outlays
increased substantially in 2003–04 but to a lesser degree than reported in 2005 (reaching 33 percent of GDP
over 24 months).

"Old" series refer to the data that were communicated to staff during the 2005 Article IV consultation discussions; "Revised"
series refer to the 1994–2004 data that were communicated to staff between November 2005 and May 2006.

6
4.
Revised BOP data reveal the chronic weakness of Mauritania’s external
position. The main revisions show higher imports of goods and services, implying weaker
trade and current account balances throughout the period. Customs understated the level of
imports over much of the period by using artificially low reference prices instead of
transaction prices for sensitive imports (e.g., sugar and wheat); this effect on the trade
balance is partly offset by the estimation for the first time of Mauritania’s informal reexports.
5.
The new fiscal and external sector figures appear broadly consistent with the
revised monetary and foreign reserves data that were provided to staff in November
2005. These data showed broad money growing at 15 percent per annum throughout the
1994–2002 period (more than twice as fast as implied by the originally reported data) and
foreign reserves fluctuating around an average of some US$50 million instead of growing
steadily to reach nearly US$400 million by end-2002.3
6.
Despite the substantial upward revision to money growth, CPI revisions are
marginal with a broadly neutral overall cumulative effect. Inflation figures have been
revised downward by nearly one percentage point for 1993–99 and upward by two
percentage points for 2000–03, leaving the annual average for the entire period broadly
unchanged at some 5½ percent. The authorities affirmed that the new harmonized CPI
(introduced in mid-2003) had been reported correctly. The retroactive correction of price
indices led to an upward revision of the 2000 poverty indicators (e.g., the poverty headcount
rose from 46.7 percent to 51 percent of population).
7.
Revised national accounts, reflecting the revised fiscal, balance of payments, and
CPI data, as well as methodological refinements, produced a downward revision to the
average annual growth performance over the period.4 According to the revised figures,
real GDP during 1993–2003 grew on average by slightly above 3 percent per annum instead
of 4½ percent.
8.
The data issues that were raised in the past have been resolved.5 A few
developments need further explanation, including inflation, the remaining (although much
more subdued than suggested by the 2005 Article IV consultation data) instability in the
income velocity of broad money (Figure 2), and the apparent low income elasticity of
imports (in U.S. dollar terms).

3

The comparisons are made with respect to the data communicated to the Fund staff prior to September 2004.

4

The main change concerns the level of the value added of the fishing sector, which is revised up following a
new methodology for estimating intermediate consumption.

The reassessment of past economic performance raised the question of why the
misreporting continued and went unnoticed for such a long time. The lack of program
ownership and low accountability of government institutions, combined with their deficient
domestic oversight, were the main factors perpetuating the misreporting. The apparent
consistency of the erroneous data made it difficult to suspect the misreporting, although staff
noted several puzzling facts early on. The Fund’s safeguards assessment procedures, now
effective for all Fund-supported programs, proved instrumental in revealing the misreporting
case (Box 1).
10.
Mauritania does not presently qualify as having Longer-Term Program
Engagement (LTPE) under the new definition adopted by the Executive Board. Under
the old definition, an ex post assessment of past Fund-supported programs was expected at
the end of the 2003 PRGF arrangement (which was cancelled on November 7, 2004), but the
data issues have prevented until now its preparation. In any case, evaluating the design and
monitoring of past PRGF-supported programs would have limited relevance as these
programs were fundamentally distorted by the previous authorities’ long-lasting provision of
inaccurate information to the Fund.

8
Box 1. Mauritania: Causes, Consequences, and Lessons of
a Prolonged Misreporting
Starting as early as with the 1992–94 ESAF-supported program, the authorities provided
inaccurate, albeit consistent, data to Fund staff. Revised data indicate that net bank financing of the
government and monetary aggregates were underreported and foreign reserves were overreported in a
coherent manner, so that program quantitative targets appeared met. The need for continued support
from the Fund and the lack of political changeover and program ownership perpetuated the misreporting,
hence data inaccuracies accumulated in reports to the Fund.
Until the initiation of the safeguards assessment (SA) procedures, staff did not suspect the
misreporting. Over the period, staff noted several puzzling facts, such as large swings in the income
velocity of broad money or persistent downward pressures on the exchange rate in spite of the reported
comfortable level of official reserves. On several occasions, staff also expressed concerns over the
quality of data, in particular consumer price indices, national accounts, and balance of payments
statistics. Staff however blamed this on the limited capacity of Mauritania’s statistical system and
provided assistance and recommendations for data accuracy improvements. Following a review of fiscal
transparency in 2002, staff also recommended that top priority should be placed on addressing chronic
weaknesses in fiscal accounting and transparency, emphasizing the need for providing the public with
more complete and timely fiscal information, and strengthening the mechanisms of external and internal
audit (Mauritania—Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes—Fiscal Transparency Module;
Country Report 02/268).
The 2004 onsite SA mission was instrumental in leading the authorities to admit, in two steps, that
data needed to be revised. The January 2004 SA mission found that only 15 percent of the BCM
foreign exchange reserves stated in its 2002 accounts could be reliably confirmed by the external auditor.
In September 2004, the new economic team released revised data for 2003 and the first half of 2004
(which led the staff to conclude that the 2003 PRGF-supported program was irremediably off track), but
maintained that data for periods prior to 2003 were correct. The transition government’s desire to
reestablish data transparency and cooperation with the Fund led to the data being revised over the entire
1992–2004 period.
The authorities acknowledge that the misreporting had a heavy cost on the country. The
communication of erroneous data for the 1992–2004 period biased past staff assessments and led to
inadequate policy recommendations and program designs, including on foreign exchange market issues.
In retrospect, fiscal and monetary tightening, not currency depreciation, might have been the main policy
instrument to restore confidence in the ouguiya and ensure a durable improvement in the functioning of
the foreign exchange market. In fact, these policies were progressively implemented from mid-2004 and
contributed to the virtual disappearance of the parallel market premium in late 2005.
The lessons that can be drawn from this misreporting case would be incorporated in the design of
a possible Fund-supported program, following satisfactory implementation of the current SMP. Such
a program would be based on data that derive from audited central bank’s accounts; these audits and the
external audit procedures would be evaluated as part of the SA process. Additional SA recommendations
may be incorporated in program conditionality. Program ownership, further steps toward fiscal and
monetary transparency and good governance, and strengthened domestic oversight and accountability of
government institutions will also be critical in preventing the recurrence of misreporting.

9
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND SHORT-TERM OUTLOOK
11.
After years of loose macroeconomic policies, the return to sound
macro-management from mid-2004 started to produce encouraging results in late 2005.
The BCM tightened monetary policy from mid-2004, but a commensurate tightening of the
fiscal stance followed only a year later. Inflation subsided in the last quarter of 2005, when
the transition authorities ended extra-budgetary spending and started to improve public
finance management (PFM), ultimately containing the deficit (including grants) below
7 percent of GDP (Table 1). Although construction and other sectors heavily dependent on
public spending suffered from a temporary slowdown, the run-up to oil production helped
maintain the growth momentum at 5½ percent in 2005. Meanwhile, improved coherence in
the policy mix, lower inflation, and the imminent start of oil production strengthened
confidence in the ouguiya and reduced the parallel foreign exchange market premium to
single-digit levels in the last quarter of 2005 (Figure 3).
12.
The beginning of oil production in 2006 has boosted growth prospects and the
credibility of the authorities’ economic stabilization program. Oil production, which
started in February 2006 and reached an average of 54,000 barrels per day in March–May
2006, is expected to boost 2006 nominal GDP by nearly 50 percent, with real GDP
increasing by 19 percent. Real non-oil GDP is projected to increase by about 6½ percent in
2006, reflecting the beginning of copper and gold mining and large foreign-financed
investments in infrastructure. Outside these sectors, growth prospects remain vulnerable to
capacity constraints in the (state-owned) iron ore mining and electricity companies, and
soaring fuel prices, which are particularly burdensome for the domestic fishing industry.
Based on the January–April 2006 performance,6 the authorities’ ambitious disinflation target
for 2006 appears attainable, provided the present monetary policy stance is maintained. The
20 percent increase in the civil service wage bill was partly a catch-up with the 2005
minimum-wage increase and reportedly has not passed through to the private sector. With the
ouguiya de facto pegged to the U.S. dollar, the recent rise of the Euro has reversed much of
the significant appreciation of the real effective exchange rate (REER) during 2005, and the
fluctuations in the foreign exchange market parallel market premium narrowed to a range of
0.5–3.0 percent over the official exchange rate.
13.
The expected oil revenues and the maintenance of fiscal discipline should enable
a substantial fiscal consolidation in 2006. Fiscal performance in the first quarter of 2006
was fully satisfactory. By maintaining recurrent spending well within the SMP quarterly
limits (while executing poverty-reducing spending in line with annual allocations), the

6

Prices increased by a cumulative 3.2 percent, in part reflecting two rounds of increases to the regulated
domestic petroleum product prices, on average by about 9½ percent on December 30, 2005 and 4 percent on
February 28, 2006. Another petroleum price increase of about 13½ percent took place in early May.

authorities took advantage of good revenue performance to reduce the treasury float. On
current projections, despite the expected revenue loss from fishing, the overall fiscal surplus
could exceed 10 percent of non-oil GDP in 2006, much of which is to be used for the
reduction of domestic government debt, including payment arrears (Table 2). In addition, the
2006 budget has provided for a substantial increase in social spending (from 6.9 percent of
GDP in 2005 to 8.1 percent of non-oil GDP in 2006) and has eliminated all under-budgeting
of allocations for embassies, pensions, and government consumption of public services.7
14.
Efforts to improve public expenditure management continued on a wide front in
early 2006, including preparations for the sound management of oil revenues. The 2005
budget execution period was closed (for the first time) within two months from year-end,
posting significantly reduced payment arrears. Treasury figures are now reconciled with the
BCM on a continuous basis and are presented in monthly budget execution reports. The
adoption of a functional classification enables the improved tracking of budget execution and
allows for the identification of poverty reducing expenditure. The Hydrocarbon Revenue
Fund (FNRH) is now operational.8 On May 10, 2006, the council of ministers adopted a
convention that details the delegation of administrative powers for the FNRH from the
Ministry of Finance to the BCM.
15.
Important tax reforms were also pursued. These included a reform of taxation on
fisheries, reorganization of the Large Taxpayers Unit (including the creation of a division
dealing with the taxation of the nascent hydrocarbon sector), introduction of the single tax
identification number, strengthening of risk management (anti-fraud) procedures by customs,
and the extension of customs control over oil exports.
16.
The authorities’ decision to end central bank financing of the budget deficit
slowed broad money growth and tightened liquidity conditions in 2005 and in the first
quarter of 2006. With the government forced to tap the banking system for its financing
needs, liquidity conditions became progressively tighter during 2005. Despite the favorable
Treasury situation in the first quarter of 2006, the increase in T-bill rates (now at about
13 percent) at recent auctions suggests that liquidity conditions still remain tight.
Concomitant with a prudent monetary policy stance, the expansion of credit to the economy
was also relatively modest (Table 3).
17.
Mauritania's external position has started to improve on account of favorable
terms of trade and the tightened policy stance, but foreign reserves are expected to

remain low until mid-2006. High world market prices boosted the proceeds of the national
iron ore company, while fish exports inched up (Table 4). Combined with the moderate
growth of non-fuel imports (excluding foreign direct investment (FDI) -related flows), these
positive trends helped improve the underlying external current account balance, despite the
sharply increased bill for imported petroleum products. Continued high FDI inflows covered
equipment imports by the emerging oil and mining industries. As of end-March 2006, official
reserves stood at 0.6 months of import cover (nearly three times the end-March 2005 level).
18.
Starting in the second half of 2006, Mauritania’s external position is set to
strengthen considerably with the arrival of oil export proceeds and higher export
commodity prices. Based on current projections for oil production, Mauritania’s exports will
more than triple in 2006 relative to 2005. Iron ore exports will benefit from a further rise in
international prices. The revenue outlook for Mauritania’s fisheries sector is more uncertain,
depending on when sales of commercial licenses and a higher catch by Mauritania’s national
fleet will replace the lost revenue from the EU agreement, which will expire on
July 31, 2006. The external current account is projected to post a surplus of 3½ percent of
GDP in 2006, despite the surging cost of imported fuel. Net capital inflows will decrease
from their high 2005 level, reflecting the amortization of oil-related investments, the
anticipated clearance of private external arrears (estimated at US$67 million at end-March
2006), and commercial banks’ strengthening of their foreign exchange positions throughout
the year. Official reserves would grow substantially and reach 1.4 months of imports by yearend.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
19.
Discussions focused on the appropriateness of current macroeconomic policies
and implementation of key reforms (notably related to the SMP and MDRI remedial
actions, and preparations for the liberalization of the foreign exchange market). Staff,
together with the World Bank staff, held discussions with the authorities on the medium-term
outlook and policies, based on the first drafts of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) and the Medium-Term Budget Framework (MTBF).
A. SMP and MDRI Remedial Actions
20.
The SMP remains firmly on track. Fiscal and monetary aggregates were well
within the program targets for end-March (Table 5). All structural indicators have also been
observed (Table 6). All other actions that were envisaged in the memorandum of economic
and financial policies (MEFP) for the first four months of 2006 have been implemented,
including the actions needed to ensure transparent and efficient management of oil revenue
and to improve public expenditure management and reporting.
21.
Mauritania has implemented all the remedial actions that were required for
MDRI qualification (Table 7). The authorities solved the data issues; macroeconomic
policies have been satisfactory since October 2005; and all the remedial actions in the areas

13

of budget formulation, execution, and reporting have been implemented. In a broad
consultative process, the authorities also substantially advanced the preparation of the new
poverty reduction strategy (¶34). The information available to staff indicates that Mauritania
is current on its obligations to the Fund, the World Bank and the African Development Bank.
B. Policies for the Remainder of 2006
Fiscal Policy
22.
The authorities are determined to achieve the original fiscal targets for 2006.
Government revenue prospects have substantially improved since the beginning of the year,
but some revenue uncertainties remain. A US$100 million bonus that the Woodside-led oil
consortium agreed to pay upon the signing of the revised production–sharing contract and
higher expected tax payments by oil companies are likely to boost oil revenue substantially
above the original 2006 projections.9 Lower revenues could not be excluded outside the oil
sector, unless alternative sources are secured (as envisaged in the original budget projection)
to cover at least 2½ percent of GDP representing half the revenue loss due to the non-renewal
of the EU fisheries agreement. The revenue neutrality of the recent changes in the taxation of
imports and the domestic fishing industry remains also to be confirmed.10 With the
forthcoming Fund (TA) on trade taxation and customs administration, the authorities will
prepare a comprehensive package of reforms in these areas to be included in the 2007 budget.
23.
To consolidate macroeconomic stability, the authorities intend to adhere to the
original budget spending limits for 2006. The authorities plan to pass a supplementary
budget ordinance to enable a transfer of up to US$150 million from the FNRH to the
Treasury account at the BCM, in order to reduce domestic government debt and strengthen
official reserves. Within these limits, the authorities are preparing rehabilitation plans for two
parastatals, Sonimex (whose interventions have aimed to regulate domestic markets for
sensitive staple goods) and Air Mauritanie, a partially privatized domestic carrier. The
authorities considered the survival of both companies in the public interest, although their
viability is questionable under present local market conditions. The staff agreed that the
future PRGF-supported program should address these and a few other public enterprise
-related issues to protect the budget against potential drains.

9

Assuming that the pace of oil extraction can be maintained as projected. Tax revenue projections have been
reassessed on the basis of declarations filed by oil operators in April.
10

Main changes to import taxation included applying transaction prices (rather than artificially low reference
prices) for import valuation while reducing nominal tariff rates and eliminating excises on sugar, tea, and
tobacco. The reform of fishing taxation, broadly endorsed by Fund tax experts, consisted in adopting a system
of access rights with fixed (per boat) and variable (per catch, species-dependent) components with a view to
improving the management of fishing resources.

14

24.
The authorities aim to achieve further progress in expenditure management. The
Treasury intends to maintain the payment float significantly below the UM 10 billion ceiling
projected for 2006 (the equivalent of a one-month average payment delay) to strengthen
confidence and foster competition in the public procurement system. Expenditure controls
will continue to be strengthened, both ex ante (with the planned computerization of the
spending authorization circuit) and ex post (with the ongoing development of onsite
inspections by the State General Inspectorate).
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
25.
The BCM is maintaining a strict monetary policy with no central bank financing
of the budget and interest rates geared toward building up official reserves while
keeping inflation under control. Bank liquidity will remain tight through mid-year until
proceeds from the additional oil revenue will allow the Treasury to reduce the volumes of
T-bill auctions. The strengthened external position of the BCM will enable the clearance of
private external arrears, which in turn is expected to entail a significant drawdown of bank
deposits. As a result, broad money growth for 2006 is now projected at below 16 percent.
Although the implied room for credit growth will be relatively modest throughout the year,
reduction in government arrears is expected to bring the growth rate of financing available to
the economy to 16.9 percent.
26.
The monetary authorities acknowledged the need to diversify their policy
instruments. At present, reserve requirements are the only liquidity management instrument
the BCM has at its disposal. The BCM is aware of the challenges arising in this respect once
oil surpluses eliminate the primary rationale for Treasury’s borrowing from the banking
system. In this context, building on recent Fund TA, the authorities are considering the pros
and cons of several instruments (including issuing central bank bills) that could be used to
afford the appropriate liquidity management flexibility, in coordination with the Treasury and
in step with the development of an interbank market and a secondary market for T-bills.
27.
There is no apparent need to adjust the official exchange rate against the U.S.
dollar before the planned move toward a more flexible exchange rate policy, together
with the introduction of foreign exchange auctions, possibly in the second half of 2006.
The foreign exchange parallel market premium remains low and the depreciation of the
ouguiya against the Euro significantly reversed the 2005 upward REER movement. The
authorities keenly discussed the specifics of the new exchange rate regime and intervention
policy. Although they support the move toward market-based exchange rates, they foresee
the central bank having a role in limiting day-to-day fluctuations while targeting a broadly
stable REER to preserve the competitiveness of the non-oil sectors. Staff argued that a
certain degree of REER appreciation might be unavoidable and that competitiveness should
be dealt within a broader policy framework.

15

28.
The authorities outlined the conditions and the timetable for the successful
introduction of foreign exchange auctions. The new system will ensure free access to
foreign exchange for current international transactions. A key step will be the elimination by
October 2006 of foreign exchange rationing, an exchange restriction which contravenes
Mauritania’s obligations under Article VIII, Section 2 (a), of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement. Given the present difficult balance of payments situation, the authorities
requested the Fund to approve this restriction on the grounds that it is strictly temporary and
is applied on a nondiscriminatory basis. Furthermore, the authorities established a timetable
for the launching of foreign exchange auctions, including the required preliminary and
accompanying measures such as the elimination of the existing partial (60 percent) surrender
requirement for fish exports. They intend to introduce the new system before
end-2006, provided that official reserves reach at least two months of import cover
(for imports that are not financed by FDI or foreign assistance). The preparations of
necessary regulations, including decrees for the establishment of a foreign exchange market
and for the monitoring of commercial banks’ net foreign open positions are under way.
C. External Sector Policies
29.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to seek final agreements with
bilateral creditors (Algeria, Iraq, Libya, and the United Arab Emirates) that have not
yet provided irrevocable HIPC relief. A related important issue is the status of passive debt
(debt that was excluded from HIPC relief calculations at the decision point) to Kuwait and
Libya.11 The authorities pointed out their renewed —yet thus far unsuccessful— efforts to
reach an agreement on a treatment comparable to the one granted on Mauritania’s Paris Club
debt.12
30.
Regarding trade policies, the authorities are pursuing regional integration and
trade facilitation efforts with neighboring countries. Mauritania is associated in the
ongoing negotiations for an Economic Partnership Agreement between ECOWAS countries
and the European Union, which could lead to a free trade agreement with both of them,
possibly as early as end-2007, and greater financial support from the EU for investments in
infrastructure and industrial development. The staff encouraged the authorities to carefully
assess the implications of the partnership with the EU and urged them to complement the
preferential liberalization with MFN-based tariff reduction to minimize trade diversion. The

11

In the absence of debt treatment (contrary to the agreements that Mauritania obtained on its debt vis-à-vis
Paris Club creditors), the authorities estimate that Kuwait’s “passive debt” claims on Mauritania have
snowballed from US$49 million in 1981 to US$904 million (including late fees and interests) in 2005, while
Libya’s interest-free “passive debt” claims stand at US$11 million.
12

An agreement would also help resolve accounting issues with regard to the BCM’s liabilities toward Kuwait
and Libya, which the authorities intend to rectify by end-2006.

16

Mauritanian authorities have also decided to join the Maghreb countries’ trade facilitation
initiative.
D. Financial Sector Reforms
31.
Discussions on the preliminary conclusions of the FSAP mission focused on ways
to improve financial sector stability, promote competition in the banking sector, and
improve access to banking services (Box 2). The authorities undertook to implement
promptly the recommendations regarding banking supervision, including on the production
of more credible financial statements, a more rigorous implementation of prudential
regulations, and measures aimed at ensuring good governance.
32.
The mission discussed with the authorities the preparations of the financial
system against a possible avian flu pandemic. Mauritania’s coastal wetlands are a major
nesting place for a large variety of migratory birds, which makes it particularly vulnerable to
the avian flu. In the context of a national plan to fight a possible avian flu pandemic, the
BCM is preparing a set of measures to limit disruptions to the financial system, including
through awareness campaigns for the staff of commercial banks.
33.
The authorities have taken steps toward establishing a fully fledged Anti-Money
Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework.
Mauritania adopted the relevant legislation in mid-2005 and joined the Middle East & North
Africa Financial Action Task Force in early 2006. The setting up of the national AML/CFT
committee and the financial intelligence unit at the BCM is under way.
E. Poverty Reduction Strategy and the Medium-Term Framework
34.
The authorities prepared drafts of the second poverty reduction strategy paper
(PRSP) and the medium-term budgetary framework (MTBF). The new PRSP covers the
period 2006–10 and is embedded in a very ambitious long-term vision that reflects
Mauritania’s dramatically improved resource prospects, (including possible MDRI debt
relief) enabling a significant increase in social spending.13 Drawing important lessons from
the shortcomings of the previous PRSP, the new PRSP recognizes that poverty in Mauritania
ought to be approached as a predominantly rural phenomenon. As a result, improved
targeting of the pro-poor expenditure and intervention programs will lead to a strategy for the
development of regions and local communities. However, additional work is needed
to: (a) undertake a deeper analysis of the link between economic growth, existing or
proposed policies and poverty reduction; (b) use existing costing exercises with a view to
13

One long-term objective is to reduce the poverty headcount from nearly 47 percent in 2004 to 35 percent in
2010 and 15 percent in 2015; significantly beyond the Millennium Development Goals (Table 8). The MTBF
assumes that the share of expenditure on education, health, and rural development will increase from
31½ percent to nearly 35 percent of all expenditure between 2007 and 2009.

17

Box 2. Mauritania: Preliminary Findings of the FSAP Mission
A Bank/Fund staff mission visited Nouakchott during February 19–March 3, 2006 to complete the
FSAP that had been initiated in February 2005. A successful assessment was made possible by the
new authorities’ decision to provide the needed financial sector data which had been previously
withheld. The mission assessed the performance of the financial sector, reviewed its regulatory
framework and judicial environment, and identified the range of financial services available. The FSSA
is expected to be discussed at the Board this Fall.
The FSAP mission found that financial services in Mauritania are underdeveloped, with the
banking system still accounting for an overwhelming share of the financial sector. While banks hold
88 percent of the financial sector’s total assets, bank loans and deposits represent less than 20 percent of
GDP. Most banks have close ties with local conglomerates, and channel the savings of the public in their
direction. For corporations with no direct links to a bank and for the public at large, especially poorer
households and clients in rural areas, banks’ services are hardly accessible, limited, costly, and obsolete.
Banks’ financial conditions as reported seem fair, with reasonable levels of equity and
profitability. On the whole, this does not raise immediate stability concerns. The main issues
affecting banks’ financial stability are a substantial shortage of provisions for nonperforming loans
(2.5 percent of GDP), some questions about their reported profitability, and the general opacity of their
accounts.1 Deducting in full the missing provisions from the banks’ net worth would lower their average
equity-to-assets ratio only from 20 percent to 12.2 percent—still well above the 8 percent prudential
floor.
Stress testing has identified two main vulnerabilities. Credit risk, including risk concentration, is
Mauritanian banks’ main vulnerability. Banks are also highly sensitive to the level of interest rates, with
lower rates having a large negative impact on their financial performance because interest income
represents a large part of their total income while interest expenses are quite low and inelastic
(most deposits are short term with no or very low remuneration).
The FSAP mission found that banking supervision has been strengthened but the regulatory
framework still lags significantly behind international standards. In 2005, the BCM improved onsite
inspections of banks, and better enforced provisioning requirements. However, inspection reports,
uneven in quality, do not analyze banks’ profitability and are not sufficiently documented. Mauritania
fully complies with only three of the Basel Core Principles, and largely complies with another eight.
Non-bank financial services are at an early stage of development. Microfinance institutions are
numerous (63 licenses) but hold only one percent of financial sector assets and most have not achieved
self sufficiency. The prudential framework requires a comprehensive overhaul and central bank
supervision in this area needs strengthening. The penetration of the insurance sector is particularly low
and, although its regulatory framework is by and large in line with international norms, supervision is
ineffective for lack of adequate resources.

At present, the BCM is actively monitoring the cases of a small bank in difficulty and of a larger
undercapitalized bank.

18
aligning the MTBF and the budget with the priority programs identified in the PRSP; and
(c) build a consensus on priorities that can survive the forthcoming election cycle.
35.
The discussion focused on the use of oil revenue to achieve Mauritania’s growth
and poverty reduction objectives, while preserving macroeconomic stability and
avoiding undue real exchange rate appreciation.14 With a view to laying the groundwork
for future PRGF discussions, the authorities agreed with staff on a baseline scenario founded
on a prudent assessment of oil revenue prospects, featuring a nonoil primary deficit
increasing by about 1¾ percent of nonoil GDP per year over the next three years, and
gradually bringing capital expenditures to about 12 percent of nonoil GDP (Table 9). The
authorities acknowledged the need to accumulate savings in the oil account, while keeping
current government expenditures in pace with nonoil GDP growth to avoid hard budgetary
choices in case of a downturn in the world oil market. They established a working group in
charge of preparing a rules-based framework for the use of oil revenues, which will be
incorporated in a future hydrocarbon law.
36.
The authorities intend to remain vigilant on competitiveness issues, especially in
view of Mauritania’s still narrow export base and the risk of Dutch disease. They are
determined to limit future real exchange rate appreciation that might arise from the incipient
oil boom and agreed with staff on the central role that savings in the FNRH should play in
this respect. Staff also argued that competitiveness should be taken into account in the
ongoing wage policy discussions. Excessive upward wage pressure would undermine the
development of agriculture and fish processing industries, which may be the primary vehicles
for diversifying Mauritania’s production and export base. The authorities concurred with this
view but also highlighted the need to address the problem of weak productivity, including
through ambitious public programs geared toward physical and human capital accumulation.
37.
Against the backdrop of the rapidly improving external debt situation, the
authorities are planning to develop a medium-term debt management strategy. Strong
economic growth will bring the ratio of nominal public external debt to GDP below
70 percent in 2006. Qualification for MDRI relief would further reduce the nominal debt
stock by about 39 percent (Table 10),15 implying a much more benign outlook for debt
sustainability. Going forward, the principal challenge consists in avoiding a resurgence of
external liabilities. The authorities acknowledged the need to pursue prudent policies with
respect to the contracting of new loans. However, they also emphasized Mauritania’s
substantial needs in terms of public infrastructure investment; several ongoing
14

These issues were covered extensively in the 2005 Selected Issues (Country Report 06/248 , Chapter I:
“Managing Oil Wealth”.

15

The expected amount of MDRI debt write-off also includes liabilities that are already subject to flow relief
under the HIPC initiative. Mauritania’s external debt situation will be examined in greater detail in a joint BankFund debt sustainability analysis, which is scheduled for the Fall of 2006.

19
foreign-financed projects, such as the new Nouakchott airport, were already initiated by the
previous government. The authorities have recently created a national public debt committee
to prepare (with Fund TA) a comprehensive debt management strategy.
38.
The authorities agreed with staff on the main reform areas to be covered in the
medium-term economic program that could be supported by the PRGF. These would
include oil revenue management and external debt management strategies, further
strengthening of public finance management and wage policy, public enterprise restructuring,
and financial sector reforms.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
In the past ten months, the Mauritanian transition authorities have implemented
an impressive policy shift toward transparency and good governance. The resolution of
the data issues that had plagued Mauritania’s relations with the Fund since 2004 also opened
the road to Mauritania’s qualification for the MDRI and initiated a track record for the use of
Fund resources under an SMP covering the first half of 2006. The program rightly focuses on
the consolidation of macroeconomic stability and the strengthening of the still fragile
external position through the prudent budgetary use of the newly acquired oil revenues and
no central bank budget financing. The authorities should be commended for the strict
implementation of their staff-monitored program during the first four months of 2006.
40.
Staff considers that Mauritania has met all the criteria for MDRI qualification,
including the resolution of the data issues, six months of satisfactory macroeconomic
performance (October 2005–March 2006), and implementation of the PFM remedial actions.
Broad consultations are under way on a new poverty reduction strategy for 2006–10. The
anticipated debt relief should lead to higher poverty reducing outlays in the 2007 budget and
in the medium term. The newly-adopted functional classification of expenditure will enhance
their targeting and tracking.
41.
Mauritania’s swift implementation of several key public finance management
reforms is encouraging, but progress needs to continue. The measures implemented by
the new authorities will improve checks and balances on public expenditures. The newly
instituted State General Inspectorate’s “reality checks” on public spending, going beyond
controlling the regularity of spending procedures, are also welcome. The 2007 budget will
benefit from the early integration of the MTBF exercise in the budget preparation cycle, but
further work will be needed to improve its presentation. A strong drive will also be required
for the successful decentralization and computerization of the public expenditure chain, both
within the Ministry of Finance and with line ministries.
42.
The decision to adhere to the original budgetary ceilings on government
spending, despite significantly higher-than-budgeted oil revenue in 2006, will allow
further reduction of domestic debt. It will also enable the BCM to rebuild its foreign
reserves and eliminate the remaining exchange restriction in parallel with a reduction of

20
private sector external arrears; all three elements being of critical importance for the central
bank to prepare for a decisive and credible foreign exchange market reform. The next budget
should focus on reforms of international trade taxation and civil servants’ remunerations
based on a thorough review of the civil service functional grid. The selection of public
investment projects should be geared toward addressing critical growth bottlenecks and the
new PRSP priorities. Ailing parastatals’ further drain on public resources should be stopped.
43.
The establishment of transparent mechanisms to collect and channel
government oil revenues needs to be pursued. Staff welcomes progress made to ensure
proper and timely reporting, auditing, and publication of oil production, sales and revenue
data, and the operational start of the offshore hydrocarbon revenue fund. Efforts should
continue to put in place rigorous control and audit mechanisms (in particular, to strengthen
the finance ministry’s oversight over oil revenue collection, and to proceed with the
appointment of an auditor of international reputation) and, with Fund technical assistance, to
set up an institutional decision-making process for the efficient management and use of these
revenues.
44.
The recent sizable interest rate increases have strengthened the BCM’s
credibility in pursuing price stability but careful monitoring of international and
domestic price pressures is still required to control the risks to the 2006 disinflation
objective. With the issuance of T-bills expected to decline, the BCM will need to develop
alternative instruments for more active liquidity management. In a not too distant future, a
more flexible exchange rate policy would help contain inflation pressures that could originate
from increased domestic absorption and capital inflows. However, the central bank cannot by
itself control REER appreciation. The well-regulated spending of government oil revenue
(through the oil fund mechanism) and the channeling of this spending into priority physical
and human capital investment projects should be the main safeguards of non-oil sectors’
competitiveness. Well-designed trade liberalization should also help in this endeavor.
45.
Staff welcomes the BCM’s decision to eliminate the present foreign exchange
rationing system by October 2006, to phase out the partial surrender requirements on
fish export proceeds, and to help eliminate private external arrears. These steps will
inspire confidence in the ouguiya and create a sound basis for the successful introduction of
foreign exchange auctions. Staff supports the authorities’ request for Board approval of the
balance-of-payments-related temporary and nondiscriminatory foreign exchange rationing,
which constitutes an exchange restriction under Article VIII, Section 2 (a).
46.
Successful SMP implementation through end-June 2006 will be needed to
establish a good track record toward a possible PRGF-supported program. While the
draft PRSP is a good basis for PRGF discussions, the authorities need to identify in the
coming months the priority actions needed to unleash Mauritania’s growth potential and help
reach its ambitious poverty reduction goals. Given the pluralism of the political scene that is
likely to emerge in the aftermath of the general elections, a broad political consensus may be

21
crucial to support these actions. In the staff’s view, a promising and sustainable poverty
reduction strategy should focus on the market-based development of labor-intensive
industries based on primary goods for which Mauritania has a comparative advantage
(including fish, agriculture, and livestock). In this context, a PRGF-supported program
should focus on a growth-enhancing framework of sound macroeconomic, trade, financial,
and good governance policies. Improved data collection and analysis should also remain key
priorities.
47.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ The large increase in the GDP deflator in 2006 (and the relatively low increase in real GDP for this year) reflect the authorities' choice of 1998
as the base year for the calculation of national accounts at constant prices. Oil prices were at a low in 1998.
2/ Excluding oil exploration/production and other mining (copper, gold)-related activities.
3/ Excluding oil account.
4/ Including oil signature bonuses.
5/ In 2006: estimates through end-May.

2/ On a cumulative basis.
3/ Including transfers to public entities outside central government.
4/ Net change in outstanding payment orders registered by the Treasury.
5/ Arrears accrued at the budget; related to the expenditure that were executed, but for which payment orders were not issued, and payments were not made.
6/ A significant increase in errors and omissions in 2004 is probably related to arrears on extra-budgetary expenditure.
7/ Expected to be covered by possible MDRI relief.
8/ The upward revision in Q2 reflects a reassessment of spending seasonality to account for annual rent on government-leased property falling due in June.

Financing gap (shortfall +) 5/
Of which: Arab Monetary Fund
Memorandum items:
Current account balance (in percent of annual GDP)
Idem, excluding oil and other mining (except SNIM)
Gross official reserves
In months of imports 6/
Oil account
Net BOP impact of oil operations
PPG external debt (in percent of annual GDP) 7/
Debt service after HIPC debt relief (in percent of
exports of goods and services) 7/

Sources: Data provided by the Mauritanian authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ Figures based on staff estimates and projections, for lack of data provision from the respective FDI companies.
2/ From 2006 onward, the shortfall from the expiring EU fisheries agreement is assumed to be partially offset by higher sales of individual fishing licenses.
3/ Oil-related outflows comprise profit transfers and negative FDI, the latter capturing the amortization of investment (cost oil) in line with the March 2006 agreement
between Mauritania and the foreign oil operator.

Updating of the MTEF and its integration in the budget cycle:

Elimination of all extrabudgetary spending:

Sufficient progress in the elimination of payments arrears and regularization of the public accounts:

Improvement of public expenditure tracking (including poverty-reducing expenditure) using a functional classification:

Implemented: Functional classification was adopted, including a module enabling the tracking of (the domestically-financed) poverty-reducing expenditure (foreignfinanced projects are to be included later on).

5.

Implemented: The arrears reduction target for the first quarter was observed with a wide margin. Final balance of the Treasury accounts for 2005 was established
after the closure of complementary period for the execution of the 2005 budget in February 2006. Public accounts for 2003–05 are being prepared by the Treasury for
submission to the General Audit Office) by end-June 2006.

4.

Implemented: The 2006 budget allocations expanded compared with the 2005 budget with a view to accommodating all the justified spending that previously gave
rise to extra-budgetary slippages. Budget execution procedures were tightened: elimination of treasury debits without pre-existing budget allocation, stricter adherence
to the documentation requirements by the Treasury, tightening of procedures for domestically-financed investment spending.

3.

Implemented: A draft of the Medium-Term Budget Framework was discussed during the mission.

2.

Implemented: Budget executions reports (TOFE) through April have been transmitted to staff.

1.
Preparation of the monthly TOFE with a lag of one month, based on the Treasury balance and reconciled with the central bank accounts on a monthly basis,
cumulative data from the start of the year, beginning with end-March TOFE (end-April 2006):

Remedial actions in the areas of budget formulation execution and reporting

Implemented: The six-month period ran from October 2005 through March 2006.

Six months of sound macroeconomic policies

Implemented: Monetary and official reserves data for 1992–2004, have been revised; BCM’s financial statements for 2003, 2004, and 2005 have been audited.

Resolution of the data issues

22, 2006 for the Fund, and on October 1, 2006 for IDA.
3/ Delivery of MDRI relief on June 22, 2006 would imply a write-off of SDR 32.9 million (US$ 47.3 million), of which SDR 2.5 million (US$ 3.6 million)
correspond to already approved HIPC relief. The amount of MDRI relief differs from the projected end-2006 stock before MDRI (US$ 39.9 million)
by the sum of principal payments scheduled between June 22 and December 31, 2006.
4/ Exports of goods and services for the year under consideration.

_________________
Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to
be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income
as defined in the footnote above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the
implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
VIII. Safeguards Assessments
A full safeguards assessment of the BCM was completed on May 21, 2004. The assessment
identified serious vulnerabilities in the central bank's safeguards framework and concluded
that, with the exception of appointing an international audit firm, the central bank had made
17

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts cannot be added.

18

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

35
little progress in strengthening the framework since the 2002 transitional assessment of the
BCM's external audit mechanism. In particular, critical vulnerabilities were found in the
areas of financial reporting (including reporting of monetary data to the Fund) and controls.
A number of recommendations were made to address these vulnerabilities, including with
respect to audits of reserves and quarterly monetary program data, the preparation of
financial statements on the basis of International Financial Reporting Standards, and
measures to improve controls in reserves management. Measures have been taken in some
areas, and a new timetable for the implementation of outstanding safeguards
recommendations was agreed with the authorities in November 2005. The external audits of
FY 2003 and FY 2004 have been completed, and it is expected that the FY 2005 audit will be
finalized by end-June 2006. International Financial Reporting Standards have been adopted
by the BCM Board as the financial reporting framework and it is envisaged that IFRScompliant financial statements will be prepared for FY 2006. At this stage, recommendations
related to monetary program data remain relevant in the context of possible future programs.
IX.

Exchange Arrangements

The currency of Mauritania is the ouguiya (UM). The ouguiya has been de facto pegged to
the U.S. dollar, despite minor adjustments to the central rate in 2004–05. Since October 24,
2005, US$1 has been equivalent to UM 268.6. In August 2002, the BCM issued two
circulars: the first sets limits on, and regulates, the handling of foreign bank notes and the
second reimposes a variant of a surrender requirement where 70 percent of fishing export
receipts should be repatriated via the BCM. In July 2005, this surrender requirement was
reduced to 60 percent. Starting in mid-2003 the BCM suspended the previous system of
foreign exchange auctions and introduced foreign exchange rationing, which constitutes a
restriction on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions
under Article VIII, section 2 (a).
X.

Last Article IV Consultation

Discussions for the 2005 Article IV consultation were held in Nouakchott, from January 8 to
22, 2005, and at headquarters from March 12 to 14, 2005. Country Report 06/247 was
considered by the Executive Board on May 27, 2005. The Executive Board approved the
HIPC Completion Point document for Mauritania on June 7, 2002.
XI.

FSAP Participation, ROSCs and Offshore Financial Center (OFC) Assessments

A joint Fund/Bank FSAP preparatory mission visited Nouakchott in February 2005 and
requested detailed financial data, including on individual banks. Following resolution of the
data issues, a full mission visited Nouakchott during February 19–March 3, 2006 to assess
the soundness and vulnerabilities of the financial sector; assess the provision of financial
services and identify missing services and markets; review the regulatory, legal and judicial
framework; and identify policy measures to address the vulnerabilities and the obstacles to
the effective provision of a broad range of financial services. The Final Report on the Fiscal

36
transparency Module of the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was based on two
missions, respectively conducted from May 14 to 24, 2002 and from August 6 to 13, 2002.

38
APPENDIX II. MAURITANIA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
As of May 25, 2006
Partnership in Mauritania’s Development Strategy
1.
Mauritania developed its Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP) in February 2001. Since
2001 two PRSP Progress Reports (PRs) have been prepared and discussed by the Boards of
the Bretton Woods institutions in June 2002 and July 2003 respectively.1 The draft
PRSP2 – for the period 2006–10 – was received in mid-May 2006, and should be finalized
during the third quarter of 2006. It is based on the findings of the recently completed national
household survey (EPCV 2004).
2.
The World Bank and the IMF continue to cooperate closely in assisting the
Government of Mauritania to implement its medium-term poverty reduction strategy with
each institution taking the lead in the policy dialogue in its areas of expertise. The Bank leads
the policy dialogue on sectoral structural reforms, including the financial sector, privatization
and poverty monitoring and evaluation. Areas of close collaboration include the PRSP,
public expenditure management, the nascent oil sector, financial sector, external debt
sustainability, poverty and social impact analysis, tax reform and private sector development.
3.
The Bank has officially re-engaged with Mauritania in January 2006 (in accordance
with OP7.30 “dealing with de-facto governments”) and is free to undertake new operations,
following the coup of August 3, 2005, when the Mauritanian President Ould Sid’Ahmed
Taya was ousted.
Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy
The Country Assistance Strategy
4.
The World Bank supports the implementation of the government’s PRSP through its
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, FY03–05 – extended to cover FY06). The CAS program
of lending and non-lending operations was specifically designed to support implementation
of the four strategic axes of the PRSP, with particular emphasis on capacity building. In the
CAS it was assumed that a series of PRSCs would gradually become the main pillars of the
lending program, but this shift did not materialize, mainly as a result of the deterioration of
macro-budgetary discipline, which emerged in 2004.
5.
The next CAS (FY07-10) will follow the finalization of the new PRSP. It will
continue to outline a Bank program that is closely aligned with the priorities of the PRSP and

1

A third PRSP-PR was not finalized in 2004 due to persisting uncertainty on key macroeconomic indicators in 2003 and
2004 (and consequently on medium-term projections).

39
will outline the Bank’s strategy for transitioning to Mauritania’s possible graduation from
IDA to IBRD.
The Bank Portfolio
6.
To date the WB has approved 69 projects in Mauritania for a total of
US$1,019 million. The current portfolio has 8 operations for a total of US$260.5 million,
with an undisbursed balance of US$186.96 million as of May 23, 2006. The Bank's program
concentrates on rural development, urban development and social sector operations (health
and education), with other specific investments in growth-stimulating sectors, such as
mining, energy, and transport. In FY05 the Bank delivered a Higher Education Project
(US$15 million) and an Integrated Development Program for Irrigated Agriculture
(US$39 million). In FY06 the Bank will deliver the second Health and Nutrition Project
(US$10 million), a GEF Community-based Watershed Management project (US$6.0 million)
and two Regional projects: (i) Senegal River Basin Multi-Purpose Water Resources
Development project - Credit to Mauritania (US$31.78 million), (ii) Hydroelectric project –
Credit to Mauritania (US$25.0 million). In the first quarter of FY07 the Bank will also
deliver a Capacity Building Project (PRECASP - US$13 million), and an Additional
Financing Credit to the Second Mining Sector Capacity Building project (US$5.0 million) to
provide technical assistance on the oil sector.
7.
The Bank’s program also encompasses Economic and Sector Work (ESW), the
provision of Institutional Development Facility (IDF) grants and Trust Funds (TF). A Public
Expenditure Review (PER) was completed in June 2004. A PER update – which benefits
from the revision of all main economic data – will be completed in FY06, along with an
update of the 2003 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), focusing chiefly on natural
resources management (oil and mining). An Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) is also
expected by end-FY06. The Bank provided US$448,000 in an IDF for the Justice Sector that
closed end September 2005, US$549,825 through a PHRD to prepare a Public Sector
Capacity Building project, US$349,000 through an IDF to strengthen the public procurement
function and US$273,000 through an IDF to support the accountancy profession. A PRSP-TF
(US$496,900) closed on December 31, 2005.
Main Policy Reform Areas
8.
The Bank supports the authorities in the implementation of the four pillars of the
PRSP.
9.
Promoting Private Sector-led Growth. One of the key objectives of the government is
to accelerate the implementation of reforms geared at stimulating private sector-led growth
and rendering Mauritania more attractive to foreign investors. The Bank’s policy dialogue in
this area focuses, inter alia, on: (a) lowering factor costs (energy, transport, labor);
(b) stimulating growth in the mining sector by opening competition in iron ore production;
and (c) improving the overall business climate by removing remaining barriers to

40
competition and factor mobility. The Bank is also promoting the growth agenda in its rural
operations, particularly through the activities supported by the PDIAIM project, which works
with private sector operators in the Senegal valley area.
10.
Achieving Broad-based Growth. This requires, above all, increasing productivity in
the livestock and agricultural sectors, which employ a large swathe of the rural poor. In
livestock, the policy dialogue focuses on the application of the new Livestock Code and the
elaboration of a coherent sector strategy, paying particular attention to key sub-sectors
(e.g. cattle, meat, and leather). In agriculture, attention is being paid to improving farm
productivity by easing access to inputs and credit and promoting training schemes for
farmers. Efforts are also being undertaken to improve living conditions at the local level
(village communities) by stimulating income generating activities, expanding access to basic
socio-economic services, and improving natural resource management practices. More
efforts need to be made to establish a national authority dealing with the cross-cutting issue
of the environment.
11.
Developing Human Resources. Education. The Bank’s operations and policy advice
support the objectives of the National Program for the Development of the Education Sector
(PNDSE 2002–10). Main actions have led to: (i) the expansion of infrastructure to boost
access to schools; (ii) the recruitment of new tutors and teachers; (iii) the implementation of
training schemes for teachers to strengthen education quality. Efforts are also being
undertaken to support the expansion of higher education, focusing on the University of
Nouakchott. Mauritania has also begun to benefit from the Education for All Fast Track
Initiative to accelerate the implementation of the national education program. It received
US$7 million in 2004, and a further US$2 million in 2005.
12.
Health. Additional efforts are needed to reduce (child and maternal) mortality rates
and malnutrition rates, at the levels needed to reach the MDGs by 2015. Actions – which will
be also supported by the Bank mainly through the upcoming second Health and Nutrition
Project – have resulted in: (i) greater access to primary health; (ii) improvements in the
quality of health services, especially for the poor, (iii) the establishment of new benefit
packages to attract health personnel in rural areas, and (iv) the recruitment of additional
health personnel. The authorities have adopted a multi-sectoral approach to combat
HIV/AIDS. The leadership for this program is located in the Prime Minister’s office and has
translated to date in strong cross-sectoral response at both the central and local levels.
13.
Strengthening Institutions and Governance. The new Government of Mauritania has
recently finalized an inter-ministerial report on governance, which incorporates many
elements of the 2004 National Program of Good Governance (PNBG) and an earlier Strategy
for the Strengthening of National Capacity. It is expected that this report should feed into the
upcoming second PRSP. The PRECASP project selectively supports elements of the abovementioned road-map, including decentralization, modernization of public administration and
strengthening of civil society capabilities.

41
Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas
14.
As part of its overall assistance to Mauritania––through lending, country analytical
work, and technical assistance––the Bank supports policy reforms in close collaboration with
the Fund, in the following areas:
15.
Public Expenditure Management. The Fund and Bank jointly emphasize the need to
significantly improve public expenditure management (PEM), accountability, and
transparency, notably following the deterioration in macroeconomic management, which
emerged in 2004. However, recent evidence points to substantial progress on PEM key areas.
Based on this progress, the Bank has prepared an update of its Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) assessment, which will be presented to the World Bank Board, in June
2006.
16.
Oil. The Mauritanian government recently adhered to the Extractive Industry
Transparency Initiative (EITI). The Bank and Fund actively support the authorities in the
implementation of the EITI and in the management of oil revenues, focusing in particular on
the following topics: (i) the creation of a single oil account (SOA) – where all government
revenues that are derived from hydrocarbon production should be directly deposited –
managed by the BCM; (ii) the treatment of oil in the budget laws, which should indicate the
portion of resources held by the SOA to be either saved or used to finance part of the non-oil
budget deficit; and (iii) the auditing of SOA accounts by an independent auditor on a
quarterly basis. Good progress has been realized in these areas, notably on the establishment
of the oil account – which is now operational – and the delegation of powers from the
Ministry of Finance to the BCM. Further progress is required to elaborate, finalize and enact
the National Hydrocarbon Law. The World Bank Treasury is also providing technical
assistance to the BCM in the area of reserve management, following a specific request from
the authorities and in agreement with the IMF.
17.
Financial Sector Reform. As part of the CAS, the Bank, in close collaboration with
the Fund, is helping the authorities in improving financial sector intermediation for private
sector development, and mobilizing savings, while promoting competition in the financial
sector. A Financial Sector Study was completed in 2004. A joint Bank/IMF in-depth review
of the financial sector (FSAP) took place in late March/early April 2006 and found that:
(i) Financial services in Mauritania are underdeveloped, with the banking system still
accounting for an overwhelming share of the financial sector; (ii) Credit risk, including risk
concentration, is Mauritanian banks’ main vulnerability; (iii) Banking supervision has been
strengthened but the regulatory framework still lags significantly behind international
standards; and (iv) Non-bank financial services (e.g. microfinance, insurance) are at an early
stage of development. The authorities have asked the bank to assist with the implementation
of the FSAP proposed action plan and a proposed project is under preparation for delivery in
FY08.

42
18.
Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA). The Bank and Fund have agreed to
review closely the poverty and social impact of reforms that are being implemented. To date,
benefit-incidence analysis has been conducted in the health and education sectors to assess
the welfare impact of public spending on different groups of people: this analysis will be
updated with the data from the recently completed EPCV 2004. In the mining sector, PSIA is
being conducted to evaluate the impact of reducing the services provided by the national
mining company (SNIM) to different groups of people. Additional poverty-related analytical
work includes: (i) a survey on the dynamics of rural labor markets (finalized); and (iv) the
elaboration of poverty maps (ongoing).

43
APPENDIX III. MAURITANIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of May 25, 2006
Despite the efforts invested by the authorities in the revision of the historic data, the data
compilation and reporting system remains weak and suffers from staffing shortages. While
data provision to the Fund is now broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, shortcomings
in the national accounts and balance of payments statistics hamper analysis. However the
authorities are now committed to maintaining full data transparency in all sectors, in line
with their participation in the GDDS, which began in September 2004. The National
Statistics Council (CNS) called for by the Statistics Law of January 2005 was established in
February 2006.
Real sector
National accounts data require substantial further improvement. Revisions of national
accounts have been under way for several years to take advantage of methodological
refinements in estimates of informal sector activity. The new set of national accounts
follows 1993 SNA and uses 1998 as a base year. Thus far, national accounts from 1998 to
2001 were finalized. The National Statistical Office (ONS) has produced preliminary
estimates for 2002–04. Nevertheless, technical assistance is still needed to conduct statistical
surveys (current estimates are based on data reported by tax authorities) and prepare
estimates for the informal sector.
Based on results from the 2001 household expenditure survey and with the assistance of
AFRISTAT, the ONS started to publish in May 2004 a new CPI index with an updated
consumption basket, covering a wider range of markets albeit with geographical coverage
still limited to Nouakchott.
Government finance
There are still no monthly or annual government finance statistics being reported to STA.
With ongoing methodological improvements, the monthly statements of treasury accounts
could provide the basis for reporting budgetary central government statistics to STA. The
monthly Treasury balance is reconciled with the Treasury accounts at the BCM. It constitutes
the basis for a monthly fiscal reporting table (TOFE) that is provided to the Minister of
Finance with a maximum lag of one month. Expenditures are recorded on a payment order
basis, and since April 2006, on the basis of a functional classification of expenditure, thus
allowing for monthly tracking of the execution of poverty-reducing expenditure. A detailed
quarterly budget execution report will be published on the Treasury website
(www.tresor.mr).
The verification of fiscal data is an ongoing process. Tax auditing should improve following
the government’s decision to establish a single tax identifier for enterprises, which would
allow the crosschecking of data available in various administrations. For its part, the General
Directorate of Customs will improve its import verification methods. The Office of the
Minister of Finance has produced in April 2006 a first report on the reconciliation of
discrepancies between import valuations by Customs and the values reported by the Société
Générale de Surveillance (SGS). On the expenditures side, a review of the payroll database to

44
identify and eventually eliminate ghost workers is still underway. The 2006 budget includes
all expenditures previously financed without budgetary appropriations. A substantial
proportion of budget appropriations previously allocated to centralized expenditures has been
broken down by ministry. Moreover, the budget document presently shows operating and
(domestically financed) capital expenditure together for each ministerial department.
Money and banking
Data on monetary authorities and deposit money banks are reported on an irregular basis to
STA. The most recent monetary data received and published in the IFS are for March 2004.
However, starting in July 2006, the BCM intends to publish monetary accounts on a monthly
basis. An STA expert provided in November 2005 detailed recommendations on the way
central bank statistics should be derived from the central bank accounts, so as to ensure
accurate data reporting to the Fund. The implementation of those of the January 2004 IMF
safeguards assessment mission will continue, particularly the recommendations relating to
the improvement in the presentation of the central bank accounts. The final audit reports of
the BCM’s 2003, 2004, and 2005 financial statements have been released to staff and are
now broadly consistent with the revised data. These report (and reports for future years) will
be published on the BCM’s official website.
Balance of payments
The balance of payments is compiled based on the foreign exchange records of the central
bank, which requires commercial banks to regularly report details of external transactions
they conduct on behalf of their customers. This information is supplemented by a limited
number of secondary sources, including customs data, external debt statistics, and data
communicated directly by the state-owned iron ore company. However, significant
weaknesses in the balance of payments remain, in particular concerning nonmining exports,
services, transfers, foreign direct investment, and short-term capital flows. A recent balance
of payments statistics mission (April 5–18, 2006) noted that the central bank’s foreign
exchange record did not provide an accurate picture of external transactions undertaken
during the reporting period. Moreover, there is no systematic effort to collect data on tourism
receipts, certain types of transfers, and foreign direct investment. As a result, many BOP
items are routinely based entirely on estimates. Despite recommendations from earlier
missions, the balance of payments continues to be presented in line with the Fourth Edition
(1977) of the Balance of Payments Statistics Manual. The 2006 mission proposed several
measures for improving the quality of commercial banks’ reporting on external transactions.
It also advised the authorities on how to obtain additional and better data on services,
transfers, and foreign direct investment, notably in the oil and mining sectors. In terms of the
organizational setup, the mission recommended that the ONS develop competencies in the
area of the trade balance, while the BCM should clarify and consolidate its internal
responsibilities for the compilation of balance of payments statistics.

45
Poverty and social indicators
The household expenditure surveys, conducted at the national level for the years 1990, 1996,
and 2000, are a main source for building poverty profiles and setting poverty reduction
targets. A limited survey was conducted in 2003 by the ONS in the capital city Nouakchott
(which hosts about one-third of the country’s population). A new Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP) covering the period 2006–10, currently under preparation, will present revised
poverty indicators.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
June 21, 2006

1.
This statement summarizes information, which has become available since the staff
report was circulated to the Executive Board on June 7, 2006. It does not change the thrust of
the staff appraisal.
2.
The noncomplying disbursements have been repaid. The second installment of SDR
10.14 million with SDR 6,529 as interest was paid on June 12, 2006, three days earlier than
expected.
3.
Preliminary data indicate that macroeconomic performance through May 2006 was in
line with the staff-monitored program objectives for the first half of 2006. The basic nonoil
deficit through end-May appears to be contained at one percent of non-oil annual GDP below
the end-June target of 2.7 percent; base money increased by only 8.6 percent during
January–May, well below the 15.3 percent projected for the first six months; gross foreign
assets of the BCM reached US$63.7 million at end-May (compared with the end-June
projection of $65.4 million) and the parallel market premium over the official UM/US$
exchange rate stood at ¼ percent through mid-June. With the CPI rising by 0.9 percent in
May—somewhat less than anticipated given recent domestic petroleum price increases—
12-month inflation at end-May receded to 5.1 percent (from 5.3 percent at end-April); this
strengthened the prospect for attaining the end-2006 inflation objective of 8.1 percent. The
authorities have approved the new production sharing contracts for the Chinguetti zone
(signed on June 6, 2006), which implies that the signature bonus of US$100 million would be
disbursed by end-June 2006, a month earlier than projected in the staff report.
4.
Implementation of structural reforms is proceeding as scheduled. The final audit
report for the BCM’s end-2005 accounts has been transmitted to the Fund and is expected to
be published on the Internet by end-June. The national committee for the implementation of
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative took further steps in preparation for the first
annual 2006 report, scheduled for publication by end-September 2006. National consultations
on the draft PRSP were held during June 5–7, 2006.

Press Release No. 06/137
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 21, 2006

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves 100 percent Debt Relief for Mauritania Under
the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved today 100 percent debt
relief for Mauritania under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) amounting to SDR
32.9 million (about US$49 million), including SDR 2.7 million (about US$4 million) of
assistance remaining under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
The Board’s decision brings to 21 the number of countries that have received 100 percent relief
from the IMF under the MDRI, and the total amount of relief granted by the Fund under the
initiative to SDR 2.54 billion (about US$3.67 billion).
Mauritania has implemented all the remedial actions that were required for MDRI qualification,
including the resolution of data issues, six months of satisfactory macroeconomic performance,
and remedial actions in the areas of budget formulation, execution, and reporting (see Press
Release No. 05/308).
“Mauritania has made important strides since last autumn, including the resolution of data issues
and the implementation of reforms in the management of public finances, prominently in the
context of oil revenues and the tracking of social expenditures,” said IMF Deputy Managing
Director Agustín Carstens, who chaired the Executive Board session on Mauritania. “These are
steps that will help Mauritania reach its ambitious poverty-reduction targets under the
Millennium Development Goals. For our part, the IMF is supporting the government’s efforts
through sweeping debt relief.”
The purpose of the MDRI is to accelerate eligible countries' progress towards the Millennium
Development Goals by providing relief on their eligible debt to the IMF and by ensuring that the
corresponding resources are allocated to poverty reduction (see Public Information Notice No.
05/164).

Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director
for the Islamic Republic of Mauritania
June 21, 2006

During the preliminary assessment of the first group of countries eligible for relief
under the MDRI, in December 21, 2005, the Executive Board determined that Mauritania
was not in a position to qualify immediately for debt relief because the country’s
macroeconomic performance had deteriorated substantially since it was assessed at the
completion point. Furthermore, serious data issues had plagued Mauritania’s relations with
the Fund. The Board estimated that prior to assessing Mauritania’s qualification to the
MDRI, the authorities would need to resolve pending data issues and take remedial actions in
the area of public expenditure management. Sound macroeconomic policies over a period of
six months would also be necessary. My authorities have addressed these issues within the
current SMP framework covering the period January-June 2006.
Today, Mauritania has complied with all the recommendations of the Executive
Board. The new government, in place since August 2005, has made transparency and good
governance a priority in its reforms agenda. It has taken strong measures to solve the data
issues, and has implemented sound policies with a high degree of ownership. The authorities
have also repaid the two disbursements that were determined to be noncomplying by the
Executive Board on March 27, 2006. The first installment of SDR 2 million was repaid
within the month following the Board decision, and the second installment of SDR 10.14
million was repaid on June 12, 2006. I would like, on behalf of my authorities, to express my
deep appreciation to staff and management for their close cooperation and active support to
Mauritania and their valuable assistance in helping my authorities solve all pending issues
and ensuring a prompt qualification of Mauritania to the MDRI.
My Mauritanian authorities are confident that the progress achieved so far in
stabilizing the economy –and in such a short period–, will give assurances to the international
community of my authorities’ sincerity and determination to put the issue of past data behind
them, and move on to address the considerable challenges ahead. They welcome in this
regard the resumption of the European Union (EU) assistance to Mauritania. My authorities
are also hopeful that the steps they have taken will qualify them for debt relief under the
MDRI.
I.

Data Revision and Past Economic Performance

The authorities have prepared a report that reassesses past macroeconomic
performance based on revised data over the 1992-2004 period. Major efforts are now under
way, with the assistance of the IMF, to ensure that data reporting will remain reliable. In the

2

same vein, the authorities have put an end to extra-budgetary spending and to the Central
Bank financing of the fiscal deficit. The report, however, is still preliminary. Additional work
is under way to explain some of the issues raised by staff in the report.
II.

Stabilization of the Economy and Policies under the SMP

In 2005, real GDP growth rose to 5 ½ percent mainly due to a surge in investment
associated with the imminence of oil production. The implementation of tight monetary and
fiscal policies in the last part of the year, resulted in a declined in inflation. The slight
deterioration of the fiscal deficit in 2005, was further contained by the interruption of extrabudgetary spending from September 2005. The parallel market premium disappeared by
the end of the year, as a result of the improved confidence in the national currency resulting
from the on-coming of oil production while the exchange rate appreciated moderately. The
improvement in the external position has benefited from higher commodity prices
worldwide, and an increase in FDIs attracted by the booming oil and mining sectors. Foreign
exchange reserves, however, remained low in 2005, and are expected to rise slowly from 1.4
month of import cover at end-2006, to 3 months in 2008.
For the first quarter of 2006, tight budgetary and monetary policies under the SMP,
have helped further stabilize the economy. Fiscal performance, in particular, was strong and
spending was maintained within the SMP limits. Efforts were made to improve PEM,
including through the preparation of a medium-term expenditure framework. In addition, the
authorities have adopted a functional classification of the budget that will enable, notably, the
tracking of poverty reducing expenditure.
For the remainder of the year, real GDP growth in the non-oil sector is expected to
increase to 6.8 percent. Oil revenues and fiscal discipline will improve the fiscal stance
significantly, while allowing for a substantial increase in poverty reducing expenditure.
Government borrowing from the banking sector through the emission of treasury bills will
help to keep monetary policy tight, until oil receipts reduce the government’s need for
financing from the banking sector. To prevent a rapid spending of oil revenues, efforts are
being made to promote a transparent and sound management of oil resources. In this regard,
Mauritania has adhered to the EITI since September 2005, and the authorities have created a
committee composed of representative of all relevant stakeholders to monitor the
implementation of the initiative.
To further enable a sound management of oil resources, a single oil account has also
been established at the Banque de France, where all government oil revenues will be
deposited –the Hydrocarbon Revenue Fund. Oil resources will be channeled into this fund
and will be used notably to smooth out public spending if prices were to fall. A law for the
management of these resources is also under preparation. The additional revenues expected

3

by the end of the month of June 2006, from the revision of the production sharing contract
with the oil company Woodside, will also be deposited in the hydrocarbon fund and will be
used to repay the government’s domestic debt, including its debt vis-à-vis the Central Bank.
This will contribute to strengthen the Central Bank’s weak foreign exchange reserves.
Looking forward, saving part of the oil resources would also help to alleviate a likely
appreciation of the exchange rate that could adversely affect the competitiveness of the nonoil sector. Indeed, there are increasing signs that other factors are already affecting
Mauritania’s competitiveness and hindering the development of important sectors of the
economy, including the fishing sector. These include the limited capacity of the national
electricity company and the enforcement of the international oil price pass-through
mechanism. My authorities will continue to work closely with the IMF and the World Bank
to discuss the best possible use of oil resources with the objective to promote growth and
fight poverty.
On the structural front, the government, is preparing the introduction of a foreign
exchange market, scheduled for end-2006. The authorities have defined a timetable for the
introduction of the foreign exchange market that takes into account the projected
improvement in foreign exchange reserves. My authorities believe that a minimum of 2
months of import cover would be necessary to launch this market on a sound and credible
basis. Also essential for the start of the foreign exchange market are the current efforts by my
authorities to repay private sector external arrears. Moreover, the requirement to surrender to
the Central Bank part of the foreign exchange proceeds from fishery exports will also be
phased out gradually, as foreign exchange reserves improve, and will be eliminated before
the new foreign exchange market is operational. However, the Central Bank intends –at least
in its early stages–, to monitor real exchange rate movements, notably to avoid a potentially
rapid appreciation of the national currency resulting from large inflows of capital associated
with oil- and, other mining-related activities that could adversely impact the competitiveness
of the non-oil sector. A close monitoring of the exchange rate by the Central Bank will also
be needed since demand of foreign currency by market participants will most likely exceed
supply, for a certain period of time. This underscores the need to put in place appropriate
liquidity management instruments at the Central Bank.
My authorities have been associated to the current negotiations between the EU and
ECOWAS, on a new Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA). The discussions are set in the
broader context of the revision of the trade regime between the EU and ACP countries within
the 2000 Cotonou Agreement. Both parties, EU and ACP countries, are required to put in
place a WTO-compatible alternative to these agreements, by 2008. My authorities are aware
of the risks involved (reciprocity) but also note the advantages associated to the EPA
(potential increase in EU assistance). They will monitor carefully the potential impact on
Mauritania’s economy of the changes that would result from these negotiations.

4

III.

Economic Prospects and Challenges

Mauritania’s economic prospects are encouraging. Notwithstanding a temporary
slowdown in the volume of oil produced –compared to the initial target of 75,000 barrels per
day–, international oil prices remain high and the recent revision of the production sharing
contracts with Woodside will further increase substantially Mauritania’s oil revenues for
2006.
Debt relief under the MDRI –highly anticipated by the Mauritanian population–, will
also provide needed resources to assist the authorities in their financial efforts to reduce
poverty and accelerate progress towards achieving the MDGs.
The national iron ore company (SNIM) plans to increase substantially its investments
in the medium-term, against the backdrop of rising iron ore prices. Copper and gold
production have also started in 2006. However, prospects in the fishing sector remain
uncertain, with the expiration of the fishing agreement with the EU on July 31, 2006. In case
Mauritania does not reach an agreement with the EU by that date, my authorities have
considered alternative solutions that they have shared with staff. They intend notably to
launch international tenders of fishing licenses to compensate for the potential loss in EU
revenues.
How to best manage the abundant resources expected in the coming years, is one of
the most important challenges that my authorities will face. Capacity remains limited and the
risks associated with the rapid rise in foreign exchange revenues on the competitiveness of
the economy are high. My authorities are aware of these risks and will continue to work
closely with the IMF and the World Bank to discuss possible ways to alleviate them. They
agree that saving oil resources is essential to mitigate these risks. They are also committed to
use part of these resources to accelerate poverty reduction and achieve more rapidly the
MDGs. In this regard, they are completing their second PRSP –which is at an advanced
stage–, covering the period 2006-10, through a broad-based participatory process. The new
PRSP redefines Mauritania’s development objectives through 2015 –target date of the
MDGs–, and takes into account the substantial increase in projected foreign exchange
inflows, and their use in the fight against poverty.
Other challenges include the need to diversify the economy away from its narrow
dependence on a few exports commodities, and reduce its vulnerability to potential shocks,
including the decline in world commodity prices that could severely affect the economy.
Avoiding a new debt build-up, following MDRI debt relief, is also crucial. Accordingly, my
authorities will develop a medium-term debt management strategy. While they acknowledge
that the responsibility of a sound debt management policy is ultimately in their hands, advice
and technical assistance from the Fund and other partners is essential. Also in this context,
they will pursue their efforts to reach agreements with all bilateral creditors that would

5

provide debt relief on terms comparable to the one provided by Mauritania’s Paris Club
creditors HIPC debt relief. They have asked the IMF to assist them in solving the issues
raised in the staff report.
Conclusion
It is my authorities’ hope that the satisfactory implementation of the SMP, by
end-June 2006 –to which they remain firmly committed–, and the rapid progress made in
implementing key reforms, will pave the way soon, to a new PRGF-supported program. Such
an arrangement would help consolidate the important achievements made so far under the
SMP.
Mauritania’s resources prospects remain good and my authorities will continue to
implement a prudent management of oil revenues. But the low level of foreign exchange
reserves expected to endure a few more years, along with the fragile current transition
towards good governance and transparency, and the country’s vulnerability to climatic and
price commodity shocks, still deserves the financial support of the IMF and the international
community.
In light of the authorities’ compliance with the Board’s recommendations, the
remedial actions taken and the strong policy performance under the SMP, I would like to
request the support of the Board for a declaration of Mauritania’s qualification for debt relief
under the MDRI.
Finally, my authorities also request that the Executive Board grant them an extension
of the current exchange restrictions under Article VIII, Section 2 (a), until October 31, 2006.
The currently weak foreign exchange reserves make it difficult to eliminate foreign exchange
rationing for the time being. Foreign exchange rationing will, however, be eliminated by
end-October 2006 with the improvement of Mauritania’s foreign exchange reserves.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Mauritania
On June 21, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Mauritania.1
Background
The Mauritanian transition authorities, in office since the regime change in August 2005,
implemented an impressive policy shift toward transparency and good governance.
They have decided to fully cooperate on the data issues that had plagued the relations
with the Fund since early 2004 and revised most economic and financial data that had
been provided to the Fund since 1992. The revised data show substantially looser
macroeconomic fiscal and monetary policies, and lower official reserve accumulation
than previously reported to the Fund. The long-lasting provision of erroneous data in the
past led to misinformed policy advice, which proved costly for the country.2
The new authorities swiftly embarked on a course of macroeconomic stabilization and
reforms. They banned the previous practices of off-budget spending and aligned the
fiscal stance with the tight monetary stance adopted by the Central Bank of Mauritania
(BCM) since mid-2004, founded on its no government deficit financing policy. As a
result, inflation returned to single-digit levels in the last quarter of 2005 and Mauritania’s
external position—which has also benefited from improving terms of trade since 2005—
started to strengthen.
In February 2006, Mauritania became an exporter of crude oil from an offshore field,
with daily production averaging 54,000 barrels over the past three months. The oil
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.
2

In addition, because of misreporting data to the Fund under the 1999–2002 PRGF arrangement,
Mauritania repaid to the Fund on April 26 and June 12 two noncomplying disbursements which had
been made in June and December 2002 (see press release No. 06/64).

- 2investment-related activity helped maintain real growth in 2005 above 5 percent and,
with the arrival of oil production, real growth is expected to attain nearly 20 percent in
2006. Non-oil real GDP growth (projected at 6½ percent) will be supported by new
mining activity (copper and gold) and a substantial increase in public investment.
Mauritania's improved external position would allow for a buildup of international
reserves to nearly 11 ⁄2 months of imports at end-2006.
The authorities have launched a staff-monitored program (SMP) covering the first half of
2006, to maintain the disinflation and fiscal consolidation momentum and implement key
reforms in the areas of data transparency, oil revenue management, and public
expenditure management. The SMP is firmly on track. Fiscal and monetary aggregates
were well within the end-March 2006 targets and all structural indicators have been
realized. Under the program, Mauritania proceeded with a timely closure of the 2005
supplementary budget, reduced domestic payment arrears, initiated a monthly reporting
of the central government financial operations based on reconciled Treasury and BCM
data, and adopted a functional classification of expenditure enabling the identification
and tracking of poverty-reducing spending. The authorities also made steps toward
establishing an efficient and transparent management of oil revenues, through
adherence to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and the creation of the
National Hydrocarbon Revenue Fund (FNRH), which is now operational. Further steps
are expected, including the publication of the production sharing contracts, quarterly
reports on production and exports, and the certified FNRH statements, which shall be
audited on a regular basis by a reputable international firm. Satisfactory implementation
of the SMP is expected to pave the way for a new PRGF-supported program.
Mauritania has implemented all the remedial actions requested to qualify for the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), including the resolution of the data issues, six
months of satisfactory macroeconomic performance, and implementation of the remedial
actions in budget formulation, execution, and reporting. Mauritania’s debt relief from the
IMF, the World Bank’s International Development Association, and the African
Development Fund of the African Development Bank, would amount to about US$400
million in net present value (NPV) terms, representing about 36.5 percent of the
estimated NPV of public external debt at end-2006. The purpose of the MDRI is to
accelerate eligible countries’ progress towards the Millennium Development Goals by
cancelling their debt to the above-mentioned creditors, and by ensuring that the
corresponding resources are allocated to poverty reduction.
The authorities have decided to take advantage of the strong fiscal and external outlook
for 2006 to further consolidate public finances and liberalize the foreign exchange
system. The expected oil revenue and the maintenance of fiscal discipline are estimated
to result in an overall fiscal surplus of some 10 percent of non-oil GDP, to be largely
channeled toward the reduction of domestic government debt and payment arrears. The
BCM is expected to remove the remaining restrictions under Article VIII of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement and to allow for larger flexibility in exchange rate determination
through the launching of an interbank currency auction market.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the substantial progress achieved in recent
months by the Mauritanian authorities in improving macroeconomic policies, budget
formulation, and governance and transparency, and in resolving the data issues that
had undermined relations with the Fund. They viewed these steps, as well as
Mauritania’s full and timely repayment of the two noncomplying disbursements under
the 1999–2002 PRGF arrangement, as essential building blocks for the close
cooperation between Mauritania and the international community that will be needed to
exploit fully Mauritania’s improved growth and development prospects. In the period
ahead, the authorities should focus on consolidating macroeconomic stability and
strengthening the external position through prudent budgetary use of new oil revenue,
while avoiding recourse to central bank budget financing.
Directors underscored that tight and well coordinated fiscal and monetary policies
will need to be at the center of efforts to consolidate the macroeconomic stabilization
and achieve the ambitious official reserves and disinflation objectives set for 2006. In
this regard, they endorsed the authorities’ plan to adhere to the original budgetary
spending ceilings despite higher-than-budgeted oil revenue, while using the oil revenue
for the reduction of domestic debt. Directors urged the authorities to provide a durable
solution for the two parastatals in need of rehabilitation without jeopardizing the 2006
fiscal objectives.
Directors were encouraged by improvements in public expenditure management.
They welcomed the timeliness and accuracy of public finance reporting based on the
Treasury records and their regular reconciliation with the central bank data. Directors
strongly endorsed the preparation of a medium-term expenditure framework ahead of
the budget preparation cycle, and underscored the importance of sustaining the
momentum of recent reforms by enhancing competition in the public procurement
system and by further tightening expenditure controls, including through the planned
computerization of the spending authorization circuit.
Directors welcomed the recent tightening of monetary policy, noting that the
interest rate increases had strengthened the central bank’s credibility in pursuing price
stability. They recommended careful monitoring of international and domestic price
pressures to control the risks to the authorities’ disinflation objectives. Directors also
recommended the development of alternative policy instruments to facilitate more active
liquidity management.
Directors underscored that a well-prepared move toward a more flexible
exchange rate policy would help contain inflationary pressures, particularly in light of the
improved external outlook. They supported the authorities’ planned steps toward the
introduction of foreign exchange auctions, which will eliminate the foreign exchange
rationing system and ensure free access to foreign exchange for current international
transactions.

- 4Directors noted the implementation of all remedial actions for Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI) qualification, and agreed that Mauritania now qualifies for debt
relief under the MDRI. They welcomed the authorities’ plan to develop a medium-term
debt management strategy. Directors urged the authorities to avoid accumulating new
non-concessional external debt, and non-Paris Club creditors to conclude the remaining
bilateral agreements. They noted that adequate monitoring mechanisms are in place to
safeguard the use of MDRI resources, and that the introduction of the new functional
classification of expenditure will enhance the targeting and tracking of poverty reducing
outlays.
Directors encouraged the authorities to build on the progress achieved in
ensuring sound and transparent management of oil revenues, including through the
implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and the national
hydrocarbon revenue fund. Directors stressed the importance of proper and timely
reporting and auditing mechanisms, including through the appointment of independent
and reputable auditors, and welcomed the planned publication of oil production, sales,
and revenue data.
Directors emphasized that the medium-term framework should focus on
preserving macroeconomic stability and on a prudent use of oil revenue, thereby
allowing Mauritania to realize its growth and poverty reduction objectives. They
endorsed the authorities’ efforts to develop a sustainable poverty reduction strategy for
2006–10 centered on the market-based development of labor-intensive industries in
which Mauritania enjoys comparative advantage. Directors noted that enhancing
productivity in the non-oil sectors and safeguarding their competitiveness will require
improvements in the business climate, efficient public investments, prudent wage
policies, and an open trade policy. They also called on the authorities to strengthen the
financial sector regulatory framework, and commended the authorities for the steps
taken toward establishing a comprehensive AML/CFT framework.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote
transparency of the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies.
