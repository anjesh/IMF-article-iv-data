STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
FIFTH REVIEW UNDER THE THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT
UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY AND REQUEST
FOR MODIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA

KEY ISSUES
Context: Since the last Article IV Consultation in 2012, notable progress has been
achieved to enhance macroeconomic stability, underpinned by the Fund-supported
program. However, continued progress could be tested as the country faces a more
challenging environment, due to increasing social and political tensions and frequent
strikes in the run-up to the 2015 elections. Moreover, recent political developments
reinforce uncertainties surrounding external budget support.
Program: The Executive Board approved the three-year arrangement under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) on January 27, 2012, with a total access of SDR 30 million.
The first, second, third, and fourth reviews were completed on July 27, 2012, February
14, 2013, September 6, 2013, and February 28, 2014, respectively. For the fifth review, all
end-March performance criteria were observed, but fiscal revenues underperformed in
the first quarter of 2014 requiring corrective fiscal measures (about 1 percent of GDP on
an annual basis). Satisfactory progress has been made on structural reforms, albeit with
some delays.
Outlook and risks: The medium-term macroeconomic outlook is challenging. The
principal near-term risk is an intensification of election-related uncertainty, economic
disruptions and violence, which would affect investment and growth. Governance issues
or delays in making measurable progress in public financial management (PFM) reforms,
and heightening of political tensions could curtail donor support. Reintegrating
repatriated refugees is likely to add to unemployment pressures, increase demand for
public services, and exacerbate social conflict over access to land.
Staff Views: The staff recommends the completion of the fifth review under the ECF
arrangement, setting of revised performance criteria and indicative targets for
September–December 2014, and disbursement of SDR 5 million. The authorities have
consented to the publication of this report following the completion of the review.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM
IMPLEMENTATION

MEFP ¶ 2

1.
The social and political situation is punctuated by uncertainty, in part owing to the
pending determination of whether the President will run for a third term. On the social front, unions
are pressuring the government for wage increases ahead of the May 2015 presidential elections.
2.
The pace of economic recovery picked up, but with increased risks to the outlook
(Tables 1–5).


Growth and inflation. Real GDP growth is projected to improve slightly to 4.7 percent in 2014
supported by agriculture, particularly a rebound in coffee production and construction of major
infrastructure projects. Headline inflation decelerated to 3.5 percent (y-o-y) in May and the
outlook remains favorable owing to lower projected international food and fuel prices.
Preliminary trade data through end-May indicate buoyant growth of export and imports in
volume terms.



Fiscal performance in the first quarter of 2014 was challenging. This in part reflected the
non-disbursement of one tranche of budget support in late 2013 that led to outstanding
obligations (0.4 percent of GDP), but which were subsequently paid in early 2014. In addition,
the combined effects of the alignment of corporate income tax rates with those of the East
African Community (EAC) and the elimination of the one percent minimum tax in the event of
corporate losses, led to revenue shortfalls of about one percent of GDP on an annual basis. 1 A
number of large tax payers (about a third, or 70 companies) reported losses.



Monetary conditions remain stable. With the improvement in liquidity conditions, the central
bank reduced its policy rate by about 200 basis points since December 2013 to 10.5 percent in
March 2014. Declining inflation contributed to driving real interest rates into positive territory.
Growth in broad money decelerated to 9.2 percent (y-o-y) at end-March 2014, while growth in
credit to the private sector remained subdued but is projected to grow at about 11 percent in
the year. The banking sector remains adequately capitalized and profitable although nonperforming loans (NPLs) have picked up (Table 8).



Greater exchange rate flexibility helped the economy adjust to external shocks. The
Burundi franc depreciated by a cumulative 22 percent against the US dollar since 2011 but has
remained broadly stable since early 2013. Gross international reserves stood at 3.5 months of
imports at end-2013. The real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by about 8 percent in
the first quarter of 2014 relative to the first quarter of 2013.

1

The law reduced the corporate tax rate (from 35 percent to 30 percent), eliminated the previously levied 1 percent
minimum tax on companies’ sales revenues in the event of losses, and the withholding tax on imports (4 percent).

3.
The response to past IMF advice has been broadly satisfactory. Under the authorities’
program, Burundi has maintained macroeconomic stability. Fiscal adjustment in the face of declining
budget support and tighter monetary policy in response to the food and fuel shocks have reduced
inflation to single digits and stabilized the exchange rate. Macrocritical reforms in the coffee and
electricity sectors have progressed, while improvements in the business climate have been
noteworthy. However, weaknesses in revenue mobilization persist and warrant a redoubling of
efforts. The Fund continues to support the authorities’ reform efforts through policy advice and
technical assistance.
4.
Program implementation has been challenging.
MEFP Tables I.1 and I.2
Most end-December indicative targets were met except
domestic assets of the central bank, domestic financing of the government, and reserve money. At
end-March, all performance criteria and indicative targets were observed, except the indicative
targets on fiscal revenues and that on reserve money. The latter was missed on account of the
bunching of donor disbursements in the first quarter of the year, which led to higher-thanprogrammed net foreign assets of the central bank. Fiscal revenue underperformed relative to the
program due to the impact of the 2013 income law (¶2). Satisfactory progress was made in the
implementation of structural reforms albeit with delays based on technical reasons (Text Table 1).
The structural benchmark related to the debt law was rescheduled owing to delays in identifying a
consultant, who has prepared a draft law for the authorities’ consideration in early June. The
benchmark related to the audit of arrears on extra-budgetary spending proved to be more
resource-intensive than anticipated; additional resources have been allocated to the Audit Court to
complete it by end-November.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
5.
The macroeconomic outlook remains difficult. Real GDP growth is expected to improve
over the medium term on the back of solid agricultural and construction activity, including the
implementation of large hydroelectric projects. Further integration with the EAC is expected to spur
investment in the tourism, wholesale and retail sectors, as well as in finance and telecommunications.
Headline inflation is expected to decline to around 7 percent by end-2014 and should stabilize over
the medium term in line with lower projected international food and fuel prices. Major floods that
occurred earlier in the year and which damaged major transport routes, could contribute to an uptick
in inflation in the months ahead. The

6.
Risks to the outlook remain elevated. A deterioration of the political
MEFP ¶ 3
and security situation, a further decline in donor support, a worsening in the
terms of trade, or a protracted period of slower growth in advanced and emerging economies could
cause a slowdown in growth, reform implementation, and social unrest. While multilateral donors
continue to provide budget support, albeit with stronger conditionality, bilateral donors continue to
engage through project grants and performance-based sectoral budget support (Annex I).2 The
authorities agreed with staff’s views on the outlook and noted that should these risks materialize,
there would be limited fiscal space for countercyclical policies. However, they noted that greater
exchange rate flexibility would be essential to respond to external shocks.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Policy discussions focused on a mix of near term program issues, and critical medium-term challenges.
In the near term, sustaining revenue mobilization is critical to keep the program on track and to
respond to contingencies in the run-up to the May 2015 elections. Over the medium term, policy
advice concentrated on measures to enhance more inclusive growth, including through decisive policy
actions to create fiscal space to mitigate risks. Additional efforts are needed to improve productivity,
foster financial inclusion, and strengthen public institutions.

The EU has now linked budget support to political governance, encompassing progress in the areas of rule of law
and human rights.

A. Expanding Fiscal Space and Mitigating Risks
7.
The authorities adopted swift corrective measures to address revenue shortfalls that
emerged during the first quarter (¶2). These measures were geared towards offsetting revenue
losses associated with the alignment of corporate tax rates in the EAC and to bolster the mediumterm fiscal framework in light of the erosion of the revenue base. The measures comprised
dividends, the reintroduction of the one percent minimum turnover tax, tax on telecoms and
withholding taxes on imports, petroleum products and beverages, and eliminating exemptions of
VAT on imports. Staff encouraged the authorities to build additional fiscal space through the
recovery of arrears from large taxpayers, additional telecoms licenses, and better control of
exemptions.3 While one-off telecoms receipts have helped mitigate some of the shortfalls, fiscal
revenues remain structurally weak over the medium term. The authorities underscored that the
measures would help them respond to

8.
The adoption of measures required a rethinking of the authorities’ “Doing Business”
strategy. Tensions have emerged in balancing the medium-term objectives of growth and
employment through providing incentives to the private sector with those of revenue mobilization.
The exemption of VAT on imports, poor follow-up on firms to whom incentives were accorded, and
the misuse of certificates granted through the investment regime to procure goods and services
locally without paying VAT, have eroded the tax base (Country Report 13/288). Staff underscored
that while simplifying Doing Business procedures were necessary to attract investors, a recent survey
by the International Finance Corporation on EAC countries, highlighted that investors ranked, rule of
law, reliable electricity supply, access to credit and to markets more highly than exemptions.
9.
Preserving medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability
MEFP ¶20, ¶25
remain key objectives under the program. To this end, the fiscal
anchor comprises a zero limit on non concessional external public borrowing and a gradually
declining path for the domestic-debt-to-GDP ratio. An update of the debt sustainability analysis
(DSA) in January 2014 shows some improvements, but confirms that Burundi remains at high risk of

debt distress.5 The DSA suggests that Burundi has limited borrowing space, and that loans should
continue to be highly concessional given its narrow export base.6 Moreover, the heavy reliance on
donor support (50 percent of the budget), aid volatility, reduced fiscal space resulting from a
declining tax-to-GDP ratio and demographic pressures are key sources of fiscal risks (Box 1). Risks
arising from the wage bill appear to be moderate and further measures are envisaged to strengthen
controls (September benchmark). The recent repatriation of refugees (48,000) from neighboring
countries in addition to a rapid population growth of 3 percent per annum continue to place sizable
pressures on the delivery of public services. The authorities shared the staff’s assessment, committed
to ensure that the revenue authority is adequately resourced, and have undertaken a number of
reforms to ensure that the health care program is better targeted and funded. Staff reiterated the
importance of developing an overarching

Sound public financial management (PFM) remains a
MEFP ¶22, ¶23, ¶32
cornerstone of the program that aims to improve financial
accountability, transparency, and the efficient delivery of public services. Significant progress
has been achieved in implementing the PFM roadmap with a view to strengthen institutional
capacity through technical assistance (TA) and the reorganization of administrative functions (endDecember benchmark). Main progress areas include: (i) the nomination of expenditure commitment
controllers for key ministries representing nearly 80 percent of government expenditures; (ii) the
timely production of the monthly and annual aggregate balance of accounts, with quality improving
progressively; (iii) strengthening the institutional framework of cash management and the treasury
single account at the central bank; and (iv) the training of more than 15 trainers and 175 staff in the
main areas of PFM. Nevertheless, further TA will address remaining weaknesses in migration to the
new system of delegating payment orders to the ministry level, strengthening the capacity of staff in
accounting, and improving the functioning of the information system (September benchmark). The

authorities also reiterated their commitment to preserve pro-poor spending and to ensure the
continued success of key safety-net programs
(Box 4).

B. Improving the Transmission of Monetary Policy and Allowing Greater
Exchange Rate Flexibility

MEFP ¶26
11.
The authorities agreed to continue to gear monetary policy toward
stabilizing inflation expectations. Monetary policy has gradually eased with inflation falling to
single digits. Inflation declined significantly since its peak in March 2012 and in line with regional
trends, as the food and fuel shock dissipated. Core inflation also appears to be declining, suggesting
that the second round effects from previous inflationary episodes are broadly contained. The
projected decline in international food and fuel prices should contribute to an easing of inflationary
pressures. However, policy slippages and recourse to central bank financing may reverse recent
gains. Staff also emphasized the importance of enhancing the monetary transmission mechanism,
which calls for the faster implementation of ongoing reforms tied to improving liquidity
management and forecasting, deepening financial markets, and strengthening market-based
instruments in line with Fund TA advice.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURUNDI

Box 1. Fiscal Risks in Burundi
Fiscal risks refer to the possibility that unexpected events adversely impact an already
established fiscal framework. Among others, categories of fiscal risks encompass
macroeconomic volatility, foreign aid uncertainty, debt sustainability, state guarantees, Public
Private Partnerships (PPPs), policy slippages and natural disasters. Staff is strengthening its
analysis on the sources, magnitude, and reporting of fiscal risks in Burundi.
Burundi faces a number of risks given its limited fiscal space. Total revenues decreased from
15.3 percent of GDP in 2011 to 13.3 percent of GDP in 2013 in part because of external shocks
and policy-induced slippages. Budget support, the most fungible component of aid flows, fell
from 5 percent of GDP in 2010 to 2 percent of GDP at end 2013. The economy is also vulnerable
to external shocks given its narrow export base and to natural disasters which have picked up in
frequency. A rapidly increasing population and the massive influx of refugees place pressure on
public services. Although fiscal policy remained prudent in past electoral cycles, unions are
clamoring for wage increases in the run-up to the 2015 presidential elections. To date, fiscal risks
arising from the wage bill have been contained as recruitment has been limited to the health and
education sectors and to replacing retirees.
In the absence of better targeting, unfunded social mandates are a source of fiscal risks.
While the abolition of fees for health services for children under 5 years and pregnant women
substantially improved social inclusion (Box 4), the Medical Assistance Program (CAM) is not fully
funded and could become unsustainable as the government would increasingly be unable to
reimburse hospitals for services provided.
Contingent liabilities have emerged owing to weakness in PFM. These include BIF 90 billion
(1.9 percent of GDP) in extra budgetary spending from previous years. Others include liabilities
arising from the Medical Assistance Program. The deployment of expenditure controllers in line
ministries is expected to strengthen controls, while modifications to the health care program and
adequate transfers (MEFP ¶22) should mitigate these risks.
PPPs and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) entail moderate risks which are not fully
accounted for in the budget. Recent reforms at REGIDESO, the state-owned electricity company
have improved its finances and helped mitigate fiscal risks (Box 3). The national
telecommunications company ONATEL is on a more sustainable footing due to the recently
implemented fiber optic project. Given the large infrastructure gap, the authorities are increasingly
looking to PPPs to address development needs. The World Bank is currently helping the
authorities design an overarching legal framework to manage PPPs, in particular with respect to
the electricity and mining sectors.

C. Improving Competitiveness and Allowing Greater Exchange

MEFP ¶27

Rate Flexibility
12.
The exchange rate remains an important tool that allows the economy to adjust to
external shocks. Ongoing fiscal adjustment, in line with more realistic available financing, has
placed less pressure on the exchange rate. Staff underscored the importance of allowing the
exchange rate to respond to underlying fundamentals and stressed the importance of greater
flexibility to protect external stability. Burundi’s external vulnerabilities have worsened over time
due to its narrow export base and strong dependence on external donor support, despite
improvements in its business environment.7 The large current account deficits have been financed
by project grants, concessional loans, and foreign direct investment. Moreover, productivity relative
to trading partners has declined over time. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment
which points to some overvaluation and there is scope to improve Burundi’s competitiveness
including through greater exchange rate flexibility (Box 2).
13.
Burundi’s economy remains highly vulnerable to shocks, due to its narrow export
base and dependence on donors’ support. While reserve adequacy may be above the traditional
indicator of 3 months of imports, the level of coverage has declined in the wake of the recent food
and fuel shocks. 8 Staff underlined the importance for Burundi to maintain adequate reserves to
address inevitable shocks.

D. Safeguarding Financial Sector Soundness

MEFP ¶10, ¶11, ¶28

14.
Further improvements in financial intermediation are needed to support the growth
agenda. At about 15 percent of GDP, credit to the private sector remains well below the average for
LICs and Sub-Saharan Africa. This reflects a broad range of factors, including weaknesses in the legal
and institutional framework, the fragile security situation, and limited competition among banks.
Recent encouraging developments include, the increasing penetration of EAC banks, which augurs
well for boosting competition, financial innovation, and access to finance, with positive effects on
growth and poverty reduction. Staff encouraged the central bank to focus on creating an enabling
infrastructure and environment for banks to lend. The authorities indicated that reforms such as the
establishment of a credit bureau, collateral registry, enhancing the supervision of microfinance
institutions, and implementing regulatory changes to facilitate leasing, should improve financial
intermediation (Annex III).
15.
The banking sector remains stable, but NPLs have picked up in recent months (Table 8).
Banks are adequately capitalized, profitable, and liquid. The repatriation of coffee export revenues in
2013, donor inflows, and the entry of regional banks with access to cross-border financing,

Using the Fund reserve adequacy framework, staff estimates the minimum level of adequate reserves for Burundi at
the equivalent of 3.5–4 months of imports.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURUNDI

contributed to an improvement in liquidity conditions. 9 The pickup in NPLs in part reflects the
harmonization of the definition of NPLs in line with international standards, extra-budgetary arrears
that are currently being audited (end-November benchmark), and the inefficient recovery of
collateral that is constrained by lengthy legal procedures and weak judicial enforcement of creditor
rights. While banks appear to be relatively well-provisioned, the increase in NPLs has adversely
affected both their profitability and their ability to extend credit. Staff underscored the importance
of strictly monitoring capital and liquidity, and the need to intensify efforts to arrest the
deterioration in asset quality. Staff also expressed the view that: (i) supervisors should be vigilant to
ensure that banks continue to proactively recognize and provision against NPLs and ensure that
capital and liquidity levels provide appropriate buffers; and (ii) concrete actions are needed to ease
collateral execution, reduce delays in the legal process, and timely payment of suppliers are also
essential. The authorities concurred with staff regarding the underlying causes of rising NPLs and
the need to reduce their level. Notwithstanding, they stressed that the banking system was well
capitalized but recognized the scope for more aggressive recovery of collateral despite social
sensitivities associated with foreclosures.

Burundi gradually adjusted to the 201112 food and fuel shock. The nominal
exchange rate depreciated by some 22
percent since 2011 to adjust to a cumulative
41 percent deterioration in the terms of
trade. The current level of the exchange rate
appears to be slightly overvalued by about 8
percent (Figure2.1).1 An initial assessment of
reserve adequacy showed that ideal
coverage ranges between 3.5–4 months of
imports but this is about one month’s less
coverage prior to the food and fuel shocks.
Absent greater exchange rate flexibility,
Burundi may need to raise reserve coverage
given its risks to large external shocks.

Productivity vis-à-vis trading partners fell
sharply in the last decade. Burundi’s
relative productivity fell further by a
cumulative 2.5 percent during 2011–13
(Figure 2.2). This in part reflects a trend
decline in coffee production linked to poor
husbandry, land fragmentation, high
population density.

The central bank took appropriate measures to safeguard the
soundness of the financial system. Based on recommendations from recent IMF technical
assistance missions, the authorities took measures including: (i) more frequent reporting to the
central bank on rolled-over loans ; (ii) the harmonization of the definition of NPLs in line with
international standards; (iii) calculation of liquidity ratios based on local currency deposits (currently
the ratio includes foreign deposits); and (iv) a change in the legal framework to allow the central
bank to swiftly intervene in troubled banks to prevent and to contain emerging crises. The central
bank has stepped up surveillance of pan-African banks through the conduct of joint inspections with
home-country supervisors.

Despite respectable growth in recent years, progress on

has been elusive. After years of sluggish growth, higher and less volatile growth since 2000 led to a
slight increase in the GDP per capita but fell short of meaningfully reducing pervasive poverty (Text

The authorities are moving forward with reforms to improve the business climate.
Improving the business environment has been a priority since 2011, when Burundi was ranked third
from the bottom in the World Bank's Doing Business report. Burundi climbed 17 places to be ranked
140th out of 189 economies in the Doing Business report for 2014 through adopting a number of
reforms that made it easier to establish businesses, acquiring construction permits, and property

10

This is illustrated by the steep decline in the contribution of the primary sector to GDP without a decline in the
share of the population dependent on primary sector activities, over 80 percent of the population.

11

In 2009, the AfDB (2009) estimated that transport costs account for 30 percent of import prices and as much as 40
percent of export prices for agricultural products in Burundi.

Only about 5 percent of the population has access to electricity.

registration.13 Notwithstanding this progress, the authorities recognized the need to redouble efforts
to improve governance and to safeguard creditor rights.
19.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to the EAC integration process. This is
proceeding on several fronts. It encompasses, the harmonization of laws, monetary and fiscal
policies, ease of doing business, the elimination of non-tariff barriers, and the complimentarity of
large infrastructure projects. Joint large infrastructure projects, which include the construction of
hydroelectric dams with Rwanda and Tanzania in addition to improving the major road networks
and implementing one-stop border posts. Benefits have accrued through cross-border investments
in financial services and labor mobility in the tourism sector.

PROGRAM ISSUES
20.
The program is on track. All end-March performance criteria were met. Two structural
benchmarks were delayed for technical reasons. Two indicative targets on gross fiscal revenue and
reserve money were missed. The auditing of extra budgetary spending was delayed owing to
inadequately resourcing the Court of Auditors but this has now been addressed (Text Table 1). The
benchmark on submitting the new law on debt management could not be met due to delays in
recruiting a legal consultant and is rescheduled for end-September. The program also includes
benchmarks in the areas of tax policy and public financial management (MEFP, Table I.2). Revised
performance criteria and indicative targets for September–December 2014 are proposed for net
foreign assets and net domestic assets of the central bank and net domestic financing of the
government, with the existing adjusters to deal with aid volatility, as well as for gross fiscal revenue
and reserve money. Other continuous performance criteria maintain zero ceilings on (i) short term
external debt of the government; and (ii) accumulation of external payments arrears of the
government. End-September and end-December indicative targets are proposed for government
fiscal revenue, domestic arrears accumulation, reserve money, and pro-poor spending.
21.
The authorities are making progress in implementing the recommendations from the
recent safeguards assessment that was conducted in 2012. The coordination between the
Ministry of Finance and the central bank is being strengthened based on regular meetings between
the leadership of both institutions. However, further efforts are needed to address remaining control
weaknesses in the fiscal accounts relating to government payments, including a framework to
monitor the implementation of recommendations from the special audits commissioned by the
central bank. Delays in external disbursements and revenue shortfalls have invariably resulted in
recourse to central bank financing. Staff stressed that strengthening revenue mobilization would be
crucial for increasing fiscal space to withstand these events and reduce recourse to central bank
financing.

13

Doing business indicators however should be interpreted with caution due to a limited number of respondents, a
limited geographical coverage, and standardized assumptions on business constraints and information availability.

Box 3. Burundi Electricity Sector Developments
Access to reliable sources of power remains a key constraint to growth. Improvements
in energy supply are identified as an important pillar of the country’s second poverty
reduction strategy, which aims to increase growth through sustainable economic
transformation. Less than 5 percent of the population has access to power, mostly in and
around the city of Bujumbura. Power cuts are frequent, especially in the dry season.
Several initiatives designed to increase the supply of power have been undertaken in
recent years. Six hydropower projects at various stages of construction and financing,
including the 48MW Jiji-Mulembwe financed by the European Union, World Bank, African
Development Bank and European Investment Bank on concessional terms, are set to
increase the country’s capacity to more than 150MW by 2018. Reforms at the state-run
utility company have improved corporate governance and placed its finances on a more
sustainable footing. Tariffs were increased in 2012 by about 70 percent, while a successful
pre-paid metering system helped reduce payment delinquency. A couple of leased diesel
generators were brought on line in 2013 to help ease the country’s energy gap, albeit at a
high cost.
Despite these positive developments, about 35 percent of the projected demand for
electricity will remain unmet over the next decade (Figure 3.1).1 Current demand and
supply trends still point to a growing energy deficit during 2014–25. As the updating and
rehabilitating of the distribution network and the electrification of the countryside will only
be done gradually, it is expected that about 70 percent of the new power will be absorbed
by the country’s underdeveloped industrial sector. For Burundi to be fully able to exploit its
significant nickel reserves, an additional 150MW of power generation capacity will be
needed. To this end, the World Bank is currently helping the authorities develop a sound
PPP framework.

22.
Burundi’s capacity to repay the Fund is adequate. Obligations to the Fund based on
existing and prospective credit, measured in relation to official reserves or exports of goods and
services, do not show solvency or liquidity risks (Table 6).
23.
The program is subject to several risks (¶5 and ¶6). These arise from the risk of fiscal
slippage in the run-up to the 2015 Presidential elections despite a broad-based consensus by key
stakeholders on the need for corrective measures. The tail risk of a sharp uptick in international food
and oil prices could result in policy reversal regarding recent increases in petroleum product prices
and the reinstatement of taxes on food products. Governance issues or the failure to make
measurable progress in PFM reforms could curtail donor support. Reintegrating repatriated refugees
is likely to add to unemployment, increase demand for public services, and could increase social
conflict over access to land.
24.
Progress on poverty reduction has been mixed. As reflected in the recent annual progress
report (2013) achieving higher growth proved difficult in the face of large food and fuel shocks and
inadequate financial resources. In particular, revenue mobilization has proven to be challenging, and
when combined with aid volatility, constrained the implementation of a sustainable medium-term
expenditure framework. A limited supply of electricity punctuated by frequent blackouts, stymied
growth and proved insufficient to put a major dent in poverty. Notwithstanding, access to basic
services improved. Primary school enrolment has reached almost 100 percent with achievement
rates rising appreciably. Social protection programs in the health and education sectors have borne
fruit (Box 4). The authorities continue to pursue policies aimed at developing critical infrastructure,
the modernization of the agricultural sector including through privatization of coffee, promoting
tourism, and greater financial inclusion in order to boost medium-term growth.
25.
The low statistical capacity limits the government’s ability to
MEFP ¶35, ¶36
develop sound economic and social policies (Informational Annex).
Weak data sources hamper the compilation of timely and reliable national accounts. The quality of
balance of payments estimates is undermined by limited resources and weak basic data on virtually
all components. The narrow geographical coverage of the consumer price index limits its
representativeness and ability to accurately reflect inflation trends.14 The authorities plan to enhance
the production and dissemination of statistics, in particular those related to national accounts and
balance of payments. Measures include better resource endowments, conducting surveys
(agriculture, household living conditions, FDI), and reinvigorating the National Statistical Strategy
adopted in 2010.

14

A new consumer price index using weights derived from a 2008 household budget survey has been introduced in
December 2013.

Box 4. Spotlight on Quick Wins
Burundi has undertaken several programs aimed at improving social protection that have
been deemed successful. Despite being ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world,
Burundi has implemented reforms to improve the health and education sectors. Very limited fiscal
space makes the prioritization of programs and efficient targeting essential.
Labor-intensive public works programs (PWPs) have been implemented to raise the
incomes and consumption of the most vulnerable. PWPs are frequently used to smooth the
consumption of vulnerable households during lean seasons through temporary periods of
employment. PWPs take the form of water and land conservation works and soil productivity
investments that are frequently donor-financed.
The health program has improved access to health care services for the most vulnerable. In
2006, the government abolished fees for health services for children under 5 years and pregnant
women. Subsequently, free services were expanded to include vaccinations and the treatment of
illnesses such as HIV/AIDS,

social assistance mechanisms.
The utilization of health services increased dramatically. Children protected by insecticidetreated bed nets increased by almost 15 percent during the period 2010–13, while consultations
and hospital admissions for children under five years also rose. The number of births delivered in
health facilities improved considerably (Table).
The education program boosted enrolment. The main measure comprised the abolition of
primary school fees since 2005 which was supplemented by donor contributions. School feeding
provided jointly by the government and the World Food Program covers about 10 percent of
primary school students. Net enrolment in primary school rose from 59.8 percent to 95.4 percent
in 2013 while completion rates rose to about 68 percent. Gender parity at the primary level is
within reach.

STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Performance under the ECF arrangement was broadly satisfactory under challenging
circumstances. All program PCs were observed. However, the authorities’ ability to deepen reforms
has been tested by weak capacity, policy-induced slippages, and aid volatility.
27.
Risks to the outlook remain elevated in the run-up to the 2015 Presidential elections.
Staff stressed the need to build additional fiscal space in order to respond to contingencies.
28.
Continued implementation of revenue reforms is critical to the program’s success. In
the context of declining budget support and a rapidly growing population, revenue collection
should be stepped up to permit greater financing of public investments critical to growth and
poverty reduction. Buttressing revenues hinges on implementing durable measures, enhancing tax
administration, and rationalizing discretionary exemptions.
29.
Sound public financial management remains a cornerstone of the program that aims
to improve financial accountability and transparency. Building on progress made thus far, there
is a need to address remaining weaknesses in migration to the new system of delegating payment
orders to the ministry level, strengthening the capacity of staff in accounting, and improving the
functioning of the information system.
30.
Strengthening debt management is key to preserving debt sustainability. Debt
sustainability remains the anchor underpinning medium-term fiscal policy. Given the high risk of
debt distress and low institutional capacity, the budget should continue to rely on grants and highly
concessional external financing. The authorities are encouraged to expedite the adoption of the new
debt law that would provide an overarching framework for effective debt management and policy.
31.
Monetary policy should continue to be geared toward stabilizing inflation
expectations. Although inflation declined significantly in recent months, a potential fiscal
deterioration financed by recourse to central bank financing could reignite inflation and reverse
recent gains. Any change in the monetary stance to support growth should proceed gradually until
the decline in inflation becomes sustained.
32.
Greater exchange rate flexibility will be an important tool in rebalancing the policy
mix. The authorities are encouraged to permit greater exchange rate flexibility to facilitate external
adjustment, enhance external competitiveness and to safeguard foreign reserves.
33.
Staff encouraged the authorities to continue progress on the structural reform
agenda. Key reforms center on improving the business environment and physical infrastructure,
strengthening social protection, deepening financial intermediation and inclusion, and EAC
integration.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURUNDI

34.
Based on program performance and the authorities’ efforts to address program
slippages, staff recommends completion of the fifth review under the ECF and the setting of
revised performance criteria and indicative targets for September–December 2014, and structural
benchmarks for 2014.
35.
Further improvements to data quality are crucial for informed policy making. While
adequate for surveillance, the absence of timely and reliable data significantly hampers the conduct
of economic policy. The authorities are encouraged to accelerate and expand efforts to increase
data coverage and quality, particularly in the areas of balance of payments and national accounts.
The capacity of the national statistical agency should continue to be strengthened, supported by
technical assistance from the Fund and other development partners.
36.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation takes place within 24 months,
subject to the decision on consultation cycles (Decision No. 14747– (10/96), September 28,
2010) as amended.

Annex II. Impediments to Growth1
Impediments to growth are legion and include geography, fast population growth, high population
density, limited electricity supply, and high transportation costs. Although total factor productivity
has stagnated, new sources of growth are envisaged from regional integration within the East
African Community, tourism, mining and financial services sectors. Expanding non-traditional
exports is key to reducing vulnerabilities to external shocks. But this is conditional in part on the
expansion of electricity supply to which only about five percent of the population has access.

A. Background
1.
Burundi is a landlocked country with poor infrastructure, and boasts one of the
highest population densities in the world. The workforce is mostly undereducated and
agrarian, and typically works in the country’s large informal sector. Burundi is prone to external
shocks, natural disasters, and the influx of refugees from conflicts in neighboring countries.2
About 50 percent of the budget is financed by donor assistance, while coffee and tea account for
about 80 percent of exports. Approximately 80 percent of the population lives below the poverty
line defined at 1.25US$/day.
2.
Significant economic progress has been achieved since the Arusha Peace Accord
(2000), but Burundi remains fragile. At about 3 percent/year, Burundi has one of the highest
population growth rates in the world. In recent years, real GDP has picked up following the 2000
peace agreement, in part because of the peace dividend, and has now risen to its 1970s levels
(Annex II. Figure 1). The pickup in real GDP
Figure 1 : Burundi: Real GDP Per Capita, (1970=100)

both the secondary and tertiary sectors
(Annex II. Figure 2). In the tertiary sector,

120

B. Is Productivity Growth Sufficient To Reduce Poverty?
3.
Total factor productivity (TFP) in Burundi has stagnated. A combination of past poor
macroeconomic management and civil strife significantly depleted the country’s productive base.
As a result, TFP growth hovered around zero in the last two decades (Annex II. Figure 3),
especially considering the large population displacements that occurred during the 1994–2005
war period. Productivity grew sharply in the years following the peace agreement when the
country renewed its partnership with the international community which yielded important aid
inflows. On the other hand, Burundi underperformed both its neighbors Rwanda and Uganda,
which experienced an increase in TFP since the mid-nineties.

Burundi’s economy remains largely agrarian. About 90 percent of the population
depends on agriculture for their living. Despite the fact that the country boasts some of
the world’s most fertile soil, value added in
agriculture remains amongst the lowest in

the verge of a permanent food crisis.4

5.
Coffee and tea dominate agricultural production and exports. Burundi is endowed
with exceptional agricultural conditions to produce high-quality, high-value coffee. About
800,000 households grow coffee for a living. The sector has been underperforming in the last
decade and witnessed declining production levels and quality over time.5 Production remains
volatile given changing climatic conditions and less than optimal use of fertilizers. Local coffee
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) estimate the sector’s potential production at about
60,000 tons/year with ideal climatic, tree maintenance, and fertilizer use. At current production
levels of about 18,000 tons per year, the production gap represents a 2 percentage points of
GDP loss as well as an important loss of potential foreign exchange earnings.
6.
Low productivity and high population growth imply that Burundi is unlikely to
reduce poverty significantly. With an estimated 80 percent of the population living below the
poverty line6, Burundi is unlikely to meet any of the UN Millennium Development Goals by 2015. 7
Despite recent improvements in health and education outcomes following the implementation of
school feeding and maternal health programs, Burundi currently still ranks 178th out of 186
countries on the UN Human Development Index. The official unemployment rate is around

11 percent8, but a large amount of workers remain underemployed in the informal sector. A
rapidly increasing population density, coupled to a heavily skewed population pyramid, where
two thirds of the population is less than 25 years of age suggest that the development of formal
employment opportunities will be critical for the country’s future economic and social stability
(Annex II. Figure 5).

Burundi development outcomes continue to underperform those of Rwanda, a
country with which it shares similar characteristics and experience (Table 1). Both countries
are landlocked, inhabited by similar ethnic groups with a shared history, and emerged from a
major civil conflict in the early 2000’s. Since the end of the conflict period, Rwanda received twice
as much official aid in the last 20 years compared to Burundi, which may in part explain higher
economic growth and better development outcomes.

Burundi needs to expand its export base to mitigate vulnerabilities to external

led to worsening external vulnerabilities in that

Burundi achieved significant progress
in improving its business environment in recent years. The country improved from 177 in
2011 to 140 at end-2014 on the Doing Business Index, but still lags behind other countries in the
region (Figure 7). Despite several improvements in the areas of securing construction permits,
registering a property, and starting a business, accessing to credit, safeguarding creditor rights
and accessing reliable electricity supply continue to stymie the emergence of nontraditional
exports.9 Moreover, the perception of corruption is entrenched. Finally, as a landlocked country,
Burundi still suffers from poor transport and logistical links to regional ports in Tanzania and
Kenya. As a result, administrative costs to import a 20 feet container in Burundi are among the
highest in the region.10

Doing business indicators however should be interpreted with caution due to a limited number of respondents,
a limited geographical coverage, and standardized assumptions on business constraints and information
availability.

The availability of energy remains a binding constraint to growth. Only 5 percent of
the population has access to power, one of the lowest access levels in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Seventy-two percent of businesses cite unreliable electricity supply as being one of the main
impediments for doing business in the country despite the expansion in electricity supply by
15MW to 55MW since 2012. Only about 10 percent of the country’s hydropower potential is
developed. 11 Six projects at various stages of construction and financing are currently being
developed, which should help triple production capacity to 154Mw in 2018, provided that the
financing need of $681 million is supplied by donors on concessional terms.

D. Forging Ahead
11.
Burundi boasts significant mining and some oil and gas resources. The country
possesses an estimated 200 million tons of exploitable nickel—about 5 percent of world
reserves—making it one of the world’s ten largest undeveloped nickel deposits. The
development of this resource would require significant infrastructure investments in the road and
energy sectors, for which the development of a coherent PPP framework will be essential. A new
mining code has been adopted by parliament, while several foreign companies are now
exploring nearby Lake Tanganyika for possible oil and gas deposits.
12.
Improving productivity in the agriculture sector, including coffee and tea
production, remains key to increase growth and reduce poverty in Burundi. Given the
importance of the sector in reducing poverty, a more productive agriculture sector could help
reduce economic fragility. The country’s 2012–17 agricultural investment plans to increase
productivity in the sector and improve food security. With a more productive sector, import
substitution of food products could also help reduce vulnerabilities to supply shocks and food
insecurity.
11

See February 2012 IMF Country Report No. 12/28.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

BURUNDI

13.
Improvements in macroeconomic management and regional integration are key to
Burundi’s economic transformation. Greater reliance on domestic revenues would reduce
reliance on donor support and mitigate the impact of aid volatility. Policy induced slippages have
resulted in the loss of 1.5 percentage points of GDP in revenues since 2012 while direct budget
support has declined by 3 percentage points of GDP to 2 percent since 2010. Consequently,
domestically financed public investment and propoor spending have invariably suffered during
fiscal adjustment. “Quick win” social programs such as the school feeding and free health care for
pregnant women need to be safeguarded to ensure inclusiveness and buy in by the population
for the authorities’ poverty reduction and growth strategy. Burundi has already begun to benefit
from cross-border flows into the tourism, manufacturing and banking sectors arising from
integration in the EAC. More needs to be done to reduce nontariff barriers and to improve
infrastructure to increase access and to lower transportation costs.

Annex III. Deepening Burundi’s Financial Intermediation
and Inclusion1
Despite improvements in recent years, financial intermediation remains weak and access to financial
services by firms and households limited, undermining their potential contribution to economic growth
and poverty reduction. Looking forward, there is a need for concerted efforts to remove both economywide and banking sector–specific impediments to financial deepening and the maintaining of financial
stability. Policy actions could include: (i) strengthening the regulatory framework and collateral and
provisioning requirements; (ii) improving financial literacy and entrepreneurial skills; (iii) introducing
insurance mechanisms and developing credit guarantee instruments to hedge risks, while supporting
execution of collateral on bad loans and improving the credit culture; and (iv) developing diversified
non-banking financial institutions including microfinance institutions.

A. Financial Sector
1.
Burundi has a small financial sector with banks playing a dominant role. The sector
consists of commercial banks and includes some formal nonbank financial institutions, mainly
development banks and a growing microfinance network. The insurance and pension sector is
underdeveloped, which is an impediment to resource mobilization and reducing maturity
mismatches. Banks dominate the financial sector in terms of assets but play a limited role in
financial inclusion.

Structure of the Banking Sector
2.
The banking sector in Burundi is small, highly concentrated, and focused on basic
operations (ANNEX III, Table 1). The total assets of the 10 banks comprising the sector amount
to some US$824 million (30 percent of GDP), and the capital of the largest bank is barely US$20
million. The three largest banks, the Banque de Crédit de Bujumbura (BCB), the Banque Commerciale
du Burundi (BANCOBU), and the Interbank Burundi (IBB) carry a market share of about 65 percent,
and account for 69 percent of deposits and 67 of credit allocated in 2013. Banking operations are
limited to taking deposits and granting very short-term loans to a very narrow client base: large
companies, wholesale and retail trade, and the coffee business. Services to individuals and to small
and medium-sized enterprises (SME) are expanding at only a slow pace. There is very little use of
payment cards, and telephone banking and electronic banking services are still under discussion.
The use of documentary credits is held back by the insistence on cash settlement of imports.
3.
The domestic banking sector has been developing significant linkages with the outside
world and at the same time it is becoming more closely integrated into the EAC region.
Following the installation of the pan-African banking groups Bank of Africa and EcoBank, three
banking groups based in other member countries of the EAC have opened subsidiaries. In addition,
the Nigerian banking group Access Bank has purchased a controlling interest (87.5 percent) in a

Efficiency and Profitability of the Banking Sector
4.
Banking sector credit to the economy
has been persistently below regional levels
(ANNEX III, Figure 1). Domestic credit from the
banking sector represented 23 percent of per
year GDP on average, which is about a third of
the average for Sub-Saharan Africa (70 percent
of GDP). The credit to the private sector is even
smaller. At about 15 percent of GDP, it
represents less than one-third of the average
ratio for Sub-Saharan Africa (59 percent of GDP).

Banks allocate relatively more credit to the central government than in the rest of
Sub- Saharan Africa. Bank credit to the government represented about 38 percent of total credit
on average during 1995—2013, compared to 25 percent in the rest of Africa. The government's cash
management problems are having a heavy impact on the banks’ liquidity and on the quality of their
loan portfolios. The state plays a preponderant role in the economy, as it is the largest consumer of
goods and services. Consequently, payment delays to contractors and suppliers have severe
repercussions on the cash balances, and even on the solvency, of its suppliers, and hence on the
regularity with which they repay their loans. The relatively high share of credit to the government
also gives rise to capital misallocation and crowds out the private sector. In turn, the capital
misallocation may explain in part low total factor productivity (see Annex II). According to the World
Bank’s Doing Business report, Burundi firms identify the limited access finance as a major constraint,
which hinders firms’ growth and investment.

Credit to the economy does not reflect Burundi’s development priorities as articulated
in the government’s poverty reduction strategy, both in terms of sectoral allocation and
terms structure.


The bulk of credit accrues to services, while too little credit goes to agriculture and
industry (ANNEX III, Figure 2). This contrast with the risk taken in lending (as measured by the
NPLs rate), which is the highest for trade. In 2013, agriculture received less than ½ percent of
total credit, down from over 2 percent in the 1980s and early 1990s. At the same time,
agriculture still accounts for over one-third of GDP and remains the mainstay of the economy,
employing more than 80 percent of Burundi's population, notably in the cultivation of coffee
and tea. The deterioration in credit allocation is even steeper for industry, with a share in total
credit declining from an average of 16 percent in the 1980s and early 1990s to 6 percent in
2013. In contrast, trade, which represents



The term structure of allocated credit is characterized by the predominance of short-term
credit. This contrasts with the risk taken in lending, which is the highest for short-term lending
(ANNEX III, Figure 3). This is not conducive to resource mobilization for long-term development
projects. The share of short-term credit in total domestic credit averaged 65 percent during 2005
－13. At the same time, long-term credit

7.
The low share of credit allocated to agriculture and industry may be explained by the
structure of these sectors, their low productivity and high level of uncertainty. For agriculture:
(i) most agricultural activities are in the informal sector which is typically cut off from modern
financial services; (ii) the lack of collateral and the high cost of loans to informal economic activities;
(iii) vulnerability to weather shocks is high because agriculture is mainly rain-fed; and (iv) the
rudimentary production technologies render agricultural production highly uncertain. The low
proportion of credit to industry may be explained by low profitability, in addition to uncertainty. The
low demand for credit in industry can be explained by: (i) a still weak business environment; (ii) high
transport costs and unreliable energy supply, which increase production costs, reducing profitability
and the return on investment; and (iii) the mismatch between the needs of the industrial sector for
long-term loans and banks’ lending capacity and preferences for short-term lending.
8.
The banking sector in Burundi appears to be profitable despite existing institutional
and structural constraints. The average return on equity ratio stands at 8.2 percent in 2013, with
returns as high as 20.6 percent in larger banks.. This good performance does not seem to reflect real
economic improvements as shown by the still moderate growth performance and high poverty
incidence. This outcome could reflect the high concentration and low competition. The three dominant banks control the banking sector and implicitly divide up the market, without having to
compete to attract clients. Banks extract rents by using deposits and savings, which are poorly
remunerated, to lend at very high rates that do not reflect the cost of these funds. There is a
persistently high spread between the lending and deposit interest rates (ANNEX III, Figure 4). While
risk remains significant in lending activities,
Figure 4: Interest Rates and Spreads, 1987−2013
these spreads may reflect the lack of
competition and is synonymous with rent
extraction. High rates of return on equity may
also reflect of the under-capitalization of
some commercial banks. Profitability and the
solvency may also be overstated due to the
classification of NPLs2 and the arbitrary
approach to the weighting of liabilities to
banks and to the state, which could lead to an
underestimation of the real risks to which the
banks are exposed (MCM report 2012).3

much higher for the three largest commercial banks. According to resilience tests of the banking
sector based on 2008 (November) data, a decline in the quality of debts owed by the five largest
debtors of the banking sector could reduce the solvency ratios of 4 out of 7 commercial banks
below the legal minimum (IMF and World Bank, 2009).

B. Financial Inclusion
Current Situation
10.
The level of financial inclusion in Burundi is low relative to Sub-Saharan Africa and low
income countries. While the supply of formal financial services has become relatively more
diversified and the number of access points has increased, the first national survey (BRB, 2012)
shows that only one adult out of eight has an account in a formal financial institution and that only
3 percent of adult population have access to credit (ANNEX III, Table 2). With only 7 percent of adult
access to formal financial services, Burundi also lags behind the other EAC members, where the
same indicator stood at 17, 20, 33, and 42, for Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, and Kenya, respectively. It
is possible to distinguish two groups: (i) on the one hand, the salaried workers in the formal sectormostly well-paid educated men living in urban areas, who represent the privileged clientele of both
banks and micro-finance institutions (MFIs); (ii) on the other hand, the workers in the informal
sector, largely the majority of the active population, living in rural areas, with low literacy and
income bordering the poverty line. Most of the latter group are excluded from the formal financial
system and have a poor knowledge of the formal financial services currently offered.
11.
The low level of financial inclusion in Burundi is related to socio-economic and
financial system factors (ANNEX III, Figure 5). Socio-economic factors include monetary poverty,
with the monthly income of more than 60 percent of the population estimated at less than BUF
25,000 (about $20) and low level of literacy (40 percent are illiterate), especially in rural areas where
a majority of the rural population depends on agriculture. Factors related to the financial system
include the long distance from the access points, the high minimum deposit required to open an
account and guarantees required for granting credit. Other factors relate to the fact that loan
products offered by the banks and MFIs do not meet the needs of farmers, merchants, and other
operators in the informal sector.
12.
There are also a number of other contributing factors, which include: (i) a high
concentration of points of service within the capital, Bujumbura and limited access outside the
capital; (ii) low level of financial education among Burundi’s population; and (iii) low level of
awareness of financial institutions. The long distance between service points and the lack of and
costliness of motorized transportation are important factors that hinder access to financial services.
The population uses informal services more frequently than those offered by formal financial
institutions, in terms of saving, borrowing and transferring money. There are also demographic
differences in account ownership, with the rate of ownership of accounts varying widely across
different social and economic categories. Figure 5 (ANNEX III), which depicts the percentage of
adults holding an account at a formal financial institution according to gender, level of education,
age, and urban/rural residence, shows that Burundi stands well below SSA and LICs averages.

Microfinance, a Relatively New Phenomenon
13.
MFIs have been growing rapidly in recent years and are key players in providing
financial services to the lower to mid-income segment of the population, particularly in rural
areas. MFIs’ total savings are about at par with total deposit in the banking system, while
outstanding loans (about 2 percent of GDP) represent 11 percent of domestic credit by the banking
sector. Compared with 2007, outstanding loans from and deposits in MFIs increased by about 255
percent and 108 percent, respectively albeit from a low base (ANNEX III, Table 3). The factors
explaining the increase in the demand for microfinance services include: (i) the increase in the cost
of living and the deterioration of purchasing power due to the war and the economic crisis have
made it more difficult for a large segment of the population to survive on regular wage incomes;
and (ii) the increasing difficulty to access formal banking services. From this perspective, the
development of microfinance can be interpreted as an attempt to fill a vacuum in financial
intermediation.
14.
Further developments in microfinance hinges on enhancing the regulatory framework
for MFIs, building their capacity, and securing stable resources. The ministry of finance adopted
the microfinance law in 2006, with the objective protecting savers and borrowers while minimizing
risk taking by MFIs. Enhanced regulations and capacity building of MFIs, including by providing
experts with proven field experience, would help mitigate risks that may emerge from strong growth
of MFIs. This will also help MFIs better manage risks through efficient credit assessment and
stronger loan recovery mechanisms. The declining donor support could further strain loanable
resources, forcing MFIs to both ration credit and charge high interest rates, hence making it difficult
to achieve sufficient penetration to low income groups.

C. Conclusion and Main Recommendations
15.
Notwithstanding improvements in recent years, the financial system remains shallow
and contributes little to growth and poverty reduction, financial inclusion indicators remain
below regional averages. To improve financial intermediation and achieve the authorities target of
boosting the inclusion rate to 27 percent by 2015, consideration should be given to the following:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

BURUNDI



advance regional EAC integration to boost the harmonization of monetary and supervisory
policies, while addressing a comprehensive financial sector reforms in the context of the
development and integration of capital markets in EAC;



enhance use of mobile banking, which has just been introduced in Burundi to expand access.
This has produced remarkable results in other African countries such as Kenya and South Africa;



ensure proper risk-based supervision of both bank and nonbank financial intermediaries to
safeguard financial stability;



address weaknesses in the legal and regulatory framework to ensure efficient enforcement of
the contracts in cases of debtor default; and



establish credit insurance schemes such as an agricultural credit guarantee/support scheme to
ensure farmers’ access to agricultural credit. These schemes prove successful in Nigeria and
other African countries. Continue improvements to the business environment by addressing
remaining challenges, which include: (i) getting credit; trading across borders; (ii) getting
electricity; (iii) resolving insolvency; and (iv) dealing with construction permits.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
Bujumbura, July 21, 2014
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C., 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
1.
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved on January 27,
2012, a new three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for the Republic of
Burundi. This arrangement supports our medium term program and aims to consolidate the process
of macroeconomic stability, accelerate growth and reduce poverty. In accordance with this
arrangement, the Government of Burundi has considered, with the help of a mission of the IMF, the
implementation of the program for the fifth review under the arrangement. This review focused on
the implementation of the program during the period from October 1st 2013 to March 31st, 2014, as
well as on the prospects and economic and financial to measures implemented in 2014.
2.
Burundi remains vulnerable to the persistent effects of external shocks from commodity
prices and the decrease in the tax effort which has been ongoing for more than two years.
Moreover, in this pre-election period, social and political tensions may develop, which, coupled with
additional external shocks, could undermine the significant progress made towards macroeconomic
stabilization in recent years. For this reason, we have stepped up efforts to mobilize additional
revenues, including exceptional revenue measures, which could help in responding to potential
contingencies related to the upcoming elections.
3.
The strengthening of tax administration will compliment the measures included in a July
2014 supplementary budget to compensate for revenue losses arising from the harmonization of
the corporate tax regime with that of the East African Community. The strengthening of expenditure
controls in the first quarter of 2014 helped mitigate the effects of these shortfalls and contributed to
the satisfactory execution of the program at end March 2014. All quantitative criteria have been met
except the indicative targets on fiscal revenues and reserve money, as well as some structural
benchmarks, including the indicative target pro-poor expenditures, which were protected from the
effects of compression of expenditures and from the delay in the disbursement of budget support.
The Government remains firmly committed to the continued implementation of the program, which
should help preserve the viability of public finances and debt and boost economic growth over the
medium term. To this end, it will maintain prudent fiscal and monetary policies to help anchor
inflation expectations inflation at levels consistent with price stability.
4.
With regard to the significant progress in the implementation of the program supported by
the ECF arrangement, the Government is seeking the conclusion of the fifth review, the setting of

new performance criteria and indicative criteria for September 30, 2014 and December, 31, 2014 and
the sixth disbursement of 5 million SDR from the IMF.
5.
The Government believes that the policies set forth in the attached Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) are adequate to achieve the objectives of its program, but it
will take any further measures that may become appropriate for this purpose. The Government will
consult with the Fund on the adoption of these measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies
contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund's policies on such consultation.
6.
The Government will communicate to the IMF all the information necessary to ensure the
implementation and regular monitoring of the program. This information, as well as the follow-up
modalities related to the implementation of the program as well as the quantitative targets and
structural benchmarks outlined in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), are also
attached to this letter. The sixth Review on September 2014 performance criteria will be completed
no later than January 31, 2015.
7.
The Burundian authorities wish to make this letter available to the public along with the
attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU) as well as the IMF staff report on the 5th review. We therefore authorize their
publication and posting on the IMF website, subject to Executive Board approval. These documents
will also be posted on the official websites of the Burundian government.

Attachment I. Amendments to the Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies
A. Introduction
1.
Burundi adopted an economic and financial program supported by an arrangement with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) to consolidate economic
and political gains, promote inclusive economic growth, curb inflation, and strengthen policies
designed to combat endemic poverty. This Memorandum supplements the December 2011,
July 2012, January 2013, August 2013, and December 2013 versions. It reports on the
implementation of the program’s quantitative targets and structural benchmarks at end-March 2014
and defines the economic policies and reforms the government intends to implement in the second
half of 2014 and in 2015 to achieve the objectives of its economic and financial program. The
program measures and objectives are consistent with the Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy
Paper (PRSP-II).
2.
Burundi remains vulnerable to the lingering effects of external shocks associated with
commodity prices and the observed decline in the tax effort over the course of more than two years.
Social and political tensions might arise during this pre-election period. The combined effects of
these external shocks and the risk of social and political tensions could undermine the substantial
progress made towards macroeconomic stability. Moreover, the effects of public finances and the
external position resulting from the deteriorating terms of trade and a drop in direct budget support
are compounded by the insufficient mobilization of domestic resources, particularly due to the
narrow tax base. Burundi therefore continues to be forced to seek support from technical and
financial partners to complete the transformation of its economy and strengthen its political
institutions.
3.
The Burundi development partners conference held in Geneva in October 2012 provided a
forum for the government to apprise its partners of the considerable advances Burundi has made,
notably with regard to good governance, peace consolidation, and improved public access to basic
social services. In the wake of the Geneva conference, the government organized two sectoral
conferences in July and October 2013. The target sectors are in line with the main pillars of the
PRSP-II and pertain to: (i) transport infrastructure and information and communications
technologies (ICT); (ii) energy; (iii) private-sector and tourism development; (iv) governance, rule of
law, and gender; (v) education; (vi) health; and (vii) the environment, water, and sanitation. The
government is aware of how much remains to be done in these areas. This is why the authorities
have sought continued political support and additional financial assistance to promote sustainable
economic growth, curb unemployment, and reduce endemic poverty.

B. Economic Developments and Implementation Of The Economic Program
in 2013 and in The First Quarter of 2014
4.
Macroeconomic developments remain broadly in line with program objectives. GDP growth
saw a slight uptick from 4 percent in 2012 to 4.5 percent in 2013, a trend that is expected to
continue in 2014 owing to the rebound in agricultural production, particularly coffee, and in
infrastructure investments, notably fiber optics, transport, and hydroelectric dams. Inflation dropped
sharply from 12 percent year-on-year at end-2012 to 9 percent at end-2013, and then to 3.5 percent
at end-May 2014, driven by favorable developments in international petroleum product and food
prices (and the resumption of agricultural production).
5.
The external position remains fragile, as the external current account deficit (including
transfers) weakened substantially, reaching 20.5 percent of GDP compared to 18.5 percent in 2012,
despite efforts to mitigate the effects of the deteriorating terms of trade. Imports declined by about
0.2 percent, while exports fell sharply by roughly 31.9 percent, largely reflecting lower coffee
exports. Official foreign exchange reserves increased slightly to the equivalent of 3.4 months of
imports at end-2013.
6.
During 2013 and in the first quarter of 2014, better liquidity conditions led to a shift in
monetary policy. The Central Bank of Burundi (BRB) was able to cut its intervention rate by 200 basis
points to bring it down to 10.5 percent in March 2014, with lower inflation contributing to positive
real interest rates. Money supply growth slowed and fell to 9.2 percent year-on-year at end-March
2014, while growth of credit to the private sector was very modest, falling to 2.2 percent. The
Monetary Policy Committee published its 2014 first quarter report, along with a monetary policy
statement publicly announcing the monetary authority’s intentions for the future. This innovation
enhances the transparency and credibility of the monetary policy. Following the BRB’s interventions
to dampen volatility in 2013, the Burundian franc remained relatively stable.
7.
Budget execution in 2013 was broadly in line with program objectives. The improvement
observed in mobilizing domestic resources with the adoption of corrective measures designed to
offset the revenue losses posted in the first half of the year translated into roughly BIF 522.3 billion
in tax revenues at end-December 2013, a 6-percent increase from 2012; by comparison, nominal
GDP growth was 16 percent. This improvement was driven by the recovery in economic activity, as
evidenced by the strong rise in the value added tax (VAT) and by the gradual resumption of taxes on
petroleum products. At end-December 2013, the overall fiscal deficit (cash basis, including non-HIPC
grants) was estimated at around 1.7 percent of GDP. The tax pressure declinedd to 12.4 percent of
GDP, primarily as a result of the continued suspension of excise duties on petroleum products
during the first half of the year. In the first quarter of 2014, the full effect of the measures to
harmonize the Burundian tax system with that of member countries of the East African Community
was amplified by loss statements issued by more than a fifth of the large taxpayers (following
elimination of the minimum tax) and shortcomings in tax administration, resulting in a shortfall
equivalent to 0.4 percent of GDP. Annualized, this deterioration would lead to a decline in the tax
effort and, consequently, in the domestic financing requirement of 1 percent of GDP, furthering the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

BURUNDI

erosion of gains accumulated by the Burundian Revenue Office (OBR) in its first three years. Wages
and salaries, and investment spending financed with own resources were contained to offset the
slight increases in spending on materials and transfers.
8.
The downward trend in the wage bill relative to GDP continued and was at 7 percent of GDP
in 2013, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points of GDP from 2012. The roll-out of the payroll software
(OPEN PRH) and the adoption of a unified registration procedure for civil servants cleared up the
civil service database and payroll system by virtually eliminating duplicates and ghost records. The
new OPEN PRH system also considerably reduced payroll processing times. Extended software
access will guarantee better management of the payroll, which is one of the largest government
budget items (end-September benchmark).
9.
Program execution in the first quarter of 2014 was satisfactory overall. All the quantitative
performance criteria at end-March were met. However, the indicative targets for tax revenues and
the monetary base failed to be attained. Furthermore, the implementation of structural measures
lagged due mainly to delays in obtaining the required technical assistance. The audit of
extrabudgetary arrears carried out by the Audit Office has begun and is expected to be completed
by the end of the year. With respect to the law on debt management, the recommendations
stemming from the IMF’s technical assistance were conveyed to the authorities in May and taken
into consideration in the draft law, which will be submitted to Parliament before end-September
(end-September benchmark). Lastly, significant progress was made in strengthening public financial
management. Thus, as part of the efforts to put in place the government’s rationalized expenditure
chain (chaîne rationalisée de dépense), the Minister of Finance issued an order that will allow
ministries and other institutions to engage expenditures where expenditures controllers are present.
In addition, an integrated public financial management software package was purchased and is
being installed. It will enable online monitoring of all budgetary transactions, the introduction of
credits for payment of government obligations, and the compilation of the government flow-offunds table (TOFE). The software package is a “living” tool, interconnecting with any other systems
that monitor government operations or the government’s position, particularly the revenue chain
(chaîne recettes).
10.
The central bank continues to implement projects for the modernization of the financial
sector, one of the components of the proposed financial sector development (PSD). To that end, it is
working on: (1) strengthening supervision of banks, nonbank financial institutions, and microfinance
institutions; (2) modernizing payments systems (ACH/RTGS, e-money and central securities
depository) through a more robust IT infrastructure; and (3) making use of new information and
communications technologies (NICT) by the banking system more widespread, and modernizing of
the payments system and or its associated legal and institutional framework. Much headway has
been made in these areas. The law on the National payment system was finalized and introduced in
the legislative agenda while the interbank electronic payment agreement protocol is currently being
reviewed for signature by the parties involved.
11.
As regards bank supervision, directives on business continuity management were adopted
and transmitted by the BRB to the banking sector with firm instructions for their implementation by
56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURUNDI

June 30, 2014. In their cooperation with the regulators of parent foreign banks (Ecobank Burundi,
FinBank, DTB Burundi, KCB Bank Burundi, and CRDB Bank Burundi), BRB supervisors have already
taken part in joint inspection missions with Central Bank of Kenya supervisors during on-site
inspections of the KCB and the DTB, parent banks of KCB Bank Burundi and DTB Burundi,
respectively. Moreover, Central Bank of Nigeria supervisors carried out an inspection mission of
FinBank, a subsidiary of Access Bank, in December 2012 together with BRB supervisors.
12.
The draft banking law, on which the IMF and the National Bank of Belgium had made
remarks, was also commented on by the industry. This law will also constitute a legal framework for
mobile banking and microfinance activities. A draft regulation on payments systems and another on
commercial agents in bank operations and payment services are being finalized to expand the legal
framework of payments systems. A draft proposed to amend the decree governing microfinance
institutions has been developed. These three instruments will be published following the enactment
of the amended banking law from which they originate.
13.
In accordance with the recommendations on safeguards, the BRB continues to submit a
report on reserve management to its Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. To this end, a schedule
of regular meetings has been prepared to ensure gradual implementation of the recommended
safeguards.
14.
In the coffee sector, the government is relying on support from the World Bank to boost
productivity, while pursuing the program to privatize washing stations. The government recognizes
the preponderant role the private sector should play in the coffee sector as part of its strategy to
boost production and minimize the cyclical effects of coffee production.
15.
Government reforms to make the business climate more appealing to private investors
continue. Substantial progress has been made in eliminating constraints related to: (i) business startups; (ii) the issuance of building permits; (iii) property transfers; and (iv) regional trade, which no
longer pose an obstacle to entrepreneurship. Owing to government’s efforts to improve the
business climate, Burundi is ranked among the 29 most reform-oriented countries in the Doing
Business 2014 report, rising 37 spots from 177th to 140th in the 2011 and 2014 rankings,
respectively.

C. Economic and Political Outlook for 2014
Macroeconomic framework
16.
The economic outlook for Burundi remains challenging. GDP growth is expected to climb in
the medium term, driven by a recovery in agricultural activity and construction, particularly for
hydroelectric projects. Integration within the East African Community should spur investment in the
tourism, wholesale and retail, and financial sectors and in telecommunications.
17.
GDP growth should thus rise to 4.7 percent in 2014 compared to 4.5 percent in 2013, due to
the rebound in coffee production and infrastructure works, namely the rehabilitation of roads
damaged by rain and the construction of hydroelectric dams. Inflation, measured by the household

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

BURUNDI

consumer price index, is expected to fall to 7.5 percent and stabilize at around 6 percent as an
annual average in the medium term, buoyed by a prudent monetary policy and the projected drop
in international food and petroleum product prices. The current account deficit of the balance of
payments should improve slightly to settle at roughly 21 percent of GDP as a result of the rebound
in coffee exports, and should continue to improve in the medium term owing to higher exports and
a weaker expansion of imports, which had been driven by humanitarian aid these past few years. A
slight improvement in official foreign exchange reserves is expected and should reach the equivalent
of 3.6 months of imports, a reflection of the limited BRB interventions on the foreign exchange
market.

Fiscal policy
18.
The prudent fiscal policy conducted in recent years led to an improved fiscal position, with
the reduction of the deficit in the basic primary balance in response to lower budget support and a
contraction in the deficit from 5.8 percent of GDP in 2011 to 3.5 percent in 2013. The meagre fiscal
space too often led to budget adjustments at the expense of investment spending in order to
mitigate the effects of exogenous shocks. Capital expenditure remains precarious and tied to project
grants, while execution continues to be highly dependent on the pace of disbursements of budget
support.
19.
Total government revenues and expenditures are expected to reach 27.6 and 29.9 percent of
GDP, respectively. The overall fiscal balance deficit (cash basis, including grants) should be contained
at 1.7 percent of GDP. Thus, pro-poor spending will continue to grow to about 9.5 percent of GDP
without jeopardizing fiscal consolidation, and the wage bill will be brought under control.
20.
Total (non-grant) budget revenue is forecasted to be FBu 648.8.2 billion, compared to
FBu 571.6 billion in 2013. To reach this target, the July 2014 supplementary budget introduced new
tax measures to generate additional revenues equivalent to about 1 percentage point of GDP and to
put an end to the decline in the tax effort that has been ongoing since 2012. These measures
focussed on the reinstatement of the minimum tax for companies that post an operating loss, the
collection and remittance of VAT on beverages and petroleum products through withholdings (at
the producer end), the exclusion of sole proprietorships from the investment code, the elimination
of the VAT exemption for investors under the investment code, the treatment of tax credits to make
them applicable solely to class zero goods and to bring the rate down from 37 to 30 percent, and
the collection of a lump sum of 4 percent of the CIF value on the imports of companies not listed as
major taxpayers. These measures, coupled with windfall revenues expected from mobile phone
companies and the expected outcome of efforts to strengthen tax administration, particularly with
respect to the collection of outstanding balances, will protect expenditure priorities and place
government finances in a less precarious position in the run-up to the 2015 election. In response to
the government’s request, the IMF sent a technical assistance mission to Bujumbura in the second
half of July to support the authorities in developing a code on excise duties in order to increase
revenue mobilization.

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURUNDI

21.
Total expenditure could reach FBu 1428.9.1 billion in 2014, an increase of 7.8 percent. This
rise, following that of 5.1 percent expected in 2013, is in keeping with the requirements to develop
economic and social infrastructure. The wage bill is expected to be FBu 322.3 billion, or 6.7 percent
of GDP, meeting the human resources needs of the key education, health, and agricultural sectors.
Investment spending financed with own resources is expected to total FBu 99.9 billion, or about 2.0
percent of GDP as in 2013.
22.
In the health sector, the government will continue the policy of providing free healthcare for
children under 5 years of age and covering the costs of childbirth. The rate of assisted childbirth was
assessed at 72 percent in 2013. The government policy to control population growth was
implemented, beginning with the approach of community-based distribution of contraceptives. In
2013, contraceptive use increased by 28 percent. Additional infrastructure investments are planned
to meet the growing demand for health services. The government will continue to give priority to
the hiring of medical personnel in a context of wage bill stabilization. These measures will contribute
to higher quality medical care. The health insurance program, which gives vulnerable segments of
the population access to health services, is becoming increasingly successful. To ensure its longterm viability, the government has embarked on its reform to better target beneficiaries and to
enhance its complementarity with other medical insurance plans, particularly care for indigents
provided by the Ministry of Solidarity, community-based mutual health insurance plans, medical
coverage for civil servants, and private medical insurance.
23.
In the education sector, the government will continue its successful program of providing
free primary school education, which includes free meals for students served by school cafeterias.
During the 2012/2013 academic year, the primary school completion rate increased to 68 percent
and the percentage of students repeating a year dropped by 29.4 percent. The government also
plans to build new classrooms and hire teachers to reduce the teacher–student ratio.
24.
In the agricultural sector, the government, in close collaboration with technical and financial
partners, plans to improve productivity in order to (i) combat the high cost of living, (ii) eliminate
food insecurity, and (iii) increase coffee production while improving its quality so as to promote the
label “Burundi coffee” on international markets. Accordingly, the government has developed and is
implementing a program encouraging the use of fertilizer by rural producers. The purpose of this
program is to achieve significant increases in agricultural productivity, thereby contributing to the
fulfillment of objectives under the National Agricultural and Livestock Investment Plan (Plan
National d’Investissement Agricole et de l’Elevage).
25.
Aware of the fragility of the country’s external position, the government will continue with a
prudent debt policy to avoid over-indebtedness and therefore intends to request funds in the form
of grants or highly concessional loans with a grant element of at least 50 percent, sufficient to cover
its financing requirements. The proposed law on debt, prepared with IMF technical assistance, will
be tabled in Parliament during the October 2014 session and will provide an effective framework to
guide the debt policy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

Monetary and exchange rate policies
26.
The BRB continues to modernize the conduct of monetary policy, which will continue to be
guided by the pursuit of price stability. To enhance the effectiveness of the policy, the BRB strives to
build its capacity to forecast inflation and analyze the autonomous factors influencing liquidity. The
observed deceleration of inflation enabled the BRB to gradually ease monetary policy in order to
inject the economy with the resources it needs to function, without reigniting inflationary pressures.
To that end, the BRB has requested technical assistance from the IMF in order to build its capacity to
design and implement monetary policy, with a particular focus on identifying instruments that
increase the effectiveness of interest rates and other BRB signals.
27.
The exchange rate policy is conducted in a context of weak foreign exchange inflows and
greater demand for imports. To ensure the effectiveness of the exchange rate policy, the BRB is
pursuing its active market-making policy for the foreign exchange interbank market to ensure, with
the required flexibility, that the exchange rate remains consistent with the fundamentals of the
economy in order to maintain external stability.
28.
The BRB is aware of the great importance of monitoring the financial system to bolster its
soundness. To that end, it requested technical assistance from the IMF’s Monetary and Capital
Markets Department. Fund support came in the form of short-term missions. This mission should
significantly reinforce the financial system monitoring mechanism, particularly the BRB’s bank
supervision unit. The BRB is also receiving technical assistance from the U.S. Department of the
Treasury in the area of financial stability.

Structural measures
29.
Some progress has been made in strengthening public financial management but the
government is still facing major challenges, which it is striving to overcome with support from
technical and financial partners. To permanently reverse the decline in the mobilization of revenues
relative to GDP, the government decided to make available to the revenue authority (OBR) the
resources it needs to strengthen its capacity to carry out its mission and give greater impetus to the
Tax Policy Directorate. Both units have already undertaken to implement the key recommendations
made by the IMF technical assistance mission in terms of tax policy and administration, including
establishing an interface between the ministry of finance and OBR (end-December benchmark).
30.
The Government adopted the first texts defining the renewed framework for the
implementation of the organic law relative to public finance. The Minister of Finance signed the
Ordinance which defines the legal regime applicable to public accountants and that establishes an
audit capacity relating to budget management which will help pursue further reforms, such as the
delegation of the commitment of expenditure, in acceptable conditions of safety, effectiveness and
efficiency. An ordinance will be issued to facilitate the audit of managerial capacity (September
benchmark) and the issuance of a decree governing the organizational chart of the financial
directorate (end-December benchmark). Aware of its prior engagements relative to the successful
implementation of these reforms and to the continuous improvement of budgetary discipline, the
Government also committed to the standardization and to the strengthening of budget

60

BURUNDI

management structures in ministries and other institutions through the adoption of a decree on the
establishment of a financial and administrative divisions within these institutions (DAF).
31.
The audit of extrabudgetary arrears by the Audit Office was finally initiated, with the results
expected at end-2014. The Ministry of Finance earmarked FBu 100 million to enable the Audit Office
to carry out this task.
32.
In the context of efforts to implement the rationalized expenditure chain following the
ministerial capacity audit conducted by the Audit Office, expenditure commitment will be delegated
within the ministries responsible for health, education, and agriculture by the end of the year while
the function of expenditure controllers shall be disabled. To make their work more effective, the
government has decided, with support from such partners as the AfDB and the Netherlands, and in
close consultation with World Bank and Fund staff, to speed up modernization of the public financial
management system (SIGEFI). More specifically, the government purchased an integrated public
financial management software package to enable secure online monitoring of all budgetary
transactions, the allocation of appropriations after the budget vote, and the issuance of daily
accounting reports (journées comptables) for Treasury settlement balances. The software can also
be used to automatically create the TOFE. The SIGEFI will continue to generate budget execution
monitoring data while the package, which already includes existing SIGEFI databases, is installed.
The software package is a “living” tool and will be interconnected with other expenditure chains,
particularly those relating to the wages and salaries of civil servants, and the computerized revenue
tracking system.

D. Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy Paper
33.
The first review of implementation of the poverty reduction strategy (CSLP II) which was
published in December 2013 highlights the persistent challenges having marked the year 2012. It
stresses that the transformation of the transformation of the Burundian economy is slower-thanenvisaged because of the weak performances of the main sectors driving growth and the delays
recorded in putting in place supporting infrastructures. For this purpose, it is recommended to
expedite reforms aimed at: (1) improving the productivity of the cash crops, in particular coffee; (2) a
rational exploitation of the mining resources; (3) enhancing the business climate and the
competitiveness of companies operating in Burundi; and (4) continuation of energy-related
programs, transport and information technology (IT).
34.
The preparation of the second progress report for 2013 started in June 2014. Thanks to the
support of the World Bank, the Minimum Basket of Care (MBC) Survey provided new data, the
exploitation of which will allow carrying out an analysis of the vulnerability profile, which constitutes
one of the key indicators of the evolution of the socio-economic indicators of the CSLP. In addition,
it is envisaged to update the poverty line through new information resulting from the survey of
households’ living conditions, which includes modules relating to employment, informal sector,
social protection and the labor force. The next step will be to measure the evolution of this
phenomenon whose estimates go back to 2006.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61

BURUNDI

35.
To improve the production of statistics, the ISTEEBU started to establish a system for
compiling provisional national accounts, with support from AFRITAC Center, and plans to finalize
this activity before the end of 2014. In addition, it also plans to set up, with support from AFRITAC
Centre, a system of quarterly national accounts, to improve the production of its national accounts
and to meet the users’ needs. The update of the base year is one of the activities contributing to this
improvement. Moreover, the ISTEEBU has just conducted a national survey on the households’ living
conditions. The results of this survey will make it possible to update a number of indicators
necessary for the compilation of national accounts. An agricultural survey is also ongoing.
36.
To enhance the production of balance of payments data, the BRB carried out, in
collaboration with the ISTEEBU and the Investment Promotion Agency (API) a foreign direct
investment survey in 2013. It also carries out, in collaboration with the ISTEEBU, an annual survey of
cross-border trade. The collection of data on transport fees of goods at the OBR should be effective
before the end-2014. Moreover, two projects are being studied which relate to the training of
commercial banks on the geographical distribution of international transactions, which would allow
compilation of regional balance of payments of the ECA and the data on insurance premium from
insurance companies.

E. Program Monitoring
37.
Semiannual monitoring of the program by the IMF Executive Board will continue, based on
the quantitative monitoring indicators and structural benchmarks set out in Tables 1 and 2. These
indicators are defined in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). The
semiannual reviews will be based on the data at end-March and end-September. The sixth program
review will be based on the performance criteria for end-September 2014. To ensure the success of
the program, the authorities agree to take all the steps necessary to meet the quantitative targets
and structural benchmarks on which understandings were reached with the IMF.

Attachment II. Amendments to the Technical Memorandum
of Understanding
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding covers the agreements on monitoring
implementation of the program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) Arrangement. It
sets out the definitions of program variables to monitor implementation of the program and the
reporting requirements for the government of Burundi and the Bank of the Republic of Burundi
(BRB). It defines quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and applicable adjustors.

A.

Quantitative Program Targets

Quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets
2.
The quantitative performance criteria for the program as shown in the MEFP are as
follows:


net foreign assets of the BRB (floor);



net domestic assets of the BRB (ceiling);



net domestic financing of the government (ceiling);



external payment arrears of the government (ceiling, continuous);



stock of short-term external debt (maturity of less than one year) of the government (ceiling,
continuous); and new nonconcessional external debt contracted or guaranteed by the
government or the BRB (ceiling, continuous).

3.

The quantitative indicative targets for the program, shown in the MEFP, are as follows:



gross fiscal revenue (floor);



accumulation of domestic arrears (ceiling);



reserve money (ceiling), and



pro-poor spending (floor).

Definitions and measurement
4.
The net foreign assets of the BRB are defined as the difference between (i) gross official
reserves (valued at market prices) and other claims; and (ii) foreign exchange liabilities to
nonresident entities (including the use of Fund resources, and liabilities arising from the use of
any SDR allocation). The gross official reserves of the BRB are defined as those foreign assets that
are liquid and freely available to the BRB.

The net domestic assets of the BRB are defined as the difference between (i) reserve
money, comprising currency in circulation, reserves of commercial banks, and other deposits held
at the BRB; and (ii) net foreign assets of the BRB.
6.
The government’s gross fiscal revenue is defined as the revenue appearing in the TOFE
and includes all tax and non-tax revenue in the national budget, before deduction of tax refunds
generated during the year, particularly accumulated VAT credits.

Adjustor for changes in the compulsory reserves coefficients
7.
The ceiling on net domestic assets of the BRB will be adjusted symmetrically for any
change in the compulsory reserves coefficient applied to deposits in commercial banks by the
amount of the new coefficient minus that stipulated in the program, multiplied by bank deposits
subject to compulsory reserves. The rate stipulated in the program is currently 3 percent.
8.
Net domestic financing of the government is defined as the change in (i) outstanding
loans, advances, and other credit to the government from the BRB and all of Burundi’s
commercial banks; (ii) plus the stock of all government securities held by the nonbank public
denominated in Burundi francs, including that held by nonresidents; (iii) less government
deposits held in the BRB or in Burundi’s commercial banks. The coverage of government is
defined as central government and any other special funds or operations that are part of the
budgetary process or have a direct impact on the government’s financial position.
9.
The stock of external payment arrears of the government for program monitoring
purposes is defined as the end-of-period amount of external debt service due and not paid
within the grace period defined by a creditor, including contractual and late interest, for which a
clearance agreement is not in place or for which arrears are not reschedulable. For arrears to
exist, a creditor must claim payment of amounts due and not paid. Amounts in dispute are not
considered arrears. Arrears for which a clearance framework has been agreed with the creditor or
which are subject to rescheduling or restructuring are not considered arrears for program
monitoring purposes. Program arrears would include any debt service due under such
agreements that have not been paid.

Definition of debt
10.
The program includes a ceiling on new nonconcessional external debt contracted or
guaranteed by the government or the BRB. For the purpose of this program, external debt is
defined as all debt contracted in a currency other than the Burundian Franc. This performance
criterion applies to the contracting or guaranteeing by the government, local governments, the
BRB and REGIDESO of new nonconcessional external debt (as specified below) with an original
maturity of one year or more, including commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value
has not been received (including leases). The coverage of government is defined as central
government and any other special funds or operations that are part of the budgetary process or
have a direct impact on the government’s financial position. Debt contracted by state-owned
enterprises is included in the overall ceiling, if guaranteed by the government.

11.
For program purposes, the definition of debt is set out in Executive Board Decision
No. 12274, Point 9, as revised on August 31, 2009 (Decision No. 14416-(09/91)).
a) For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a
current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the
provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires
the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or
services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or
interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the
primary ones being as follows:
12.
(i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are
equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds,
and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as
repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);
13.
(ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are
provided; and
14.
(iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the
right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total
expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the
purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease
payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding those payments
that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9 (a) above, arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual
obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is
not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to
debt.
15.
The grant element of debt is the difference between the present value (PV) of debt and
its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at
the time of contracting is calculated by discounting the future stream of payments of debt
service due on this debt. The calculation of concessionality will take into account all aspects of
the loan agreement, including maturity, grace period, payment schedule, upfront commissions,
and management fees. The discount rate used for this purpose is 5 percent.
16.
The stock of short-term external debt with a maturity of less than one year owed by the
government is to remain at zero under the program. The coverage of government is defined as
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

BURUNDI

central government and any other special funds or operations that are part of the budgetary
process or have a direct impact on the government’s financial position. Normal import credits are
excluded from this ceiling. Loans with an initial maturity, as recorded in the original loan
agreement, of one year or more are considered medium-term or long-term loans. This
performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt, adopted August 24, 2000, but also to
commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received (including leases).
Excluded from this performance criterion are rescheduling arrangements, borrowing from the
IMF, and any Burundi franc-denominated treasury securities held by nonresidents. As of
September 2007, the stock of short-term debt outstanding was nil.
17.
Consistent with the PRSP, the authorities’ definition of pro-poor spending is based on
three criteria: (i) social character of spending, based on the administrative classification of
spending (this includes “social services” spending and part of “general services” and “economic
services” spending if it has a social character component); (ii) consistency with one of the four
PRSP pillars; and (iii) pro-poor investment spending, financed by donors.
18.
The accumulation of domestic arrears is measured by the accumulation of non-executed
payment orders older than 60 days.

External financial assistance adjustor
19.
The program provides for adjusters to allow higher than expected external assistance to
be spent (with a cap) and shortfall of external assistance to be financed domestically (with a cap).
20.
Any financing excess up to US$40 million will be spent on expenditure priorities defined
in the PRSP. The floor on the stock of net foreign assets of the BRB will be adjusted upward, and
the ceilings on the net domestic assets of the BRB and on net domestic financing to the
government will be adjusted downward to accommodate 100 percent of any financing excess
above US$40 million.
21.
The floor on the stock of net foreign assets of the BRB will be adjusted downward, and
the ceilings on the net domestic assets of the BRB and on net domestic financing to the
government will be adjusted upward to accommodate a financing shortfall up to a maximum of
US$40 million. External financial assistance will be converted to Burundi francs using the
program-specified BIF/US$ exchange rate. The program exchange rate for end-September 2014
is 1,550 and at end-December 2014 is 1,560.2.
22.
External financial assistance (measured in US$) is defined to include the following:
(i) nonproject loans and grants to the budget (including payments made through the multidonor trust fund managed by the World Bank for current debt service to multilaterals); plus
(ii) debt relief on current maturities; minus (iii) any cash payments for external arrears clearance
operations. Donor disbursements into blocked accounts for the purpose of clearing arrears will
not be considered foreign assistance for program monitoring purposes.

Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country qualifies for
assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at the
decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance committed
at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as defined in
footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of pre-agreed key
structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).

Safeguards Assessments
While initial action has been taken to improve the financial autonomy of the central bank, the
update safeguards assessment of the Banque de la République du Burundi (BRB), completed in July
2012 in the context of the current ECF arrangement, identified some vulnerabilities and concluded

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

3

BURUNDI

that governance arrangements require significant strengthening namely Board and Audit Committee
oversights of foreign exchange reserves and audit mechanisms respectively, and that control
weaknesses in the fiscal accounts relating to government payments remain to be addressed. Against
these findings, the assessment recommended (i) continuing the special audits of government
transactions, and (ii) enhancing oversight and accountability measures. The (BRB) has started to
address those vulnerabilities. An international audit firm was recruited to (i) conduct a special audit
of large disbursements on behalf of the government processed by the BRB during
June 30, 2011–March 31, 2012, (ii) evaluate the implementation of the new decree on public
expenditures management, and (iii) ascertain the status of implementation of earlier special audit
recommendations. The audit findings indicated ongoing control weaknesses that need to be
addressed, including the lack of supporting documents of certain transactions and the partial
implementation of the decree establishing the General Regulation on Government Budget
Management. The audit report saw the need to integrate into existing procedures, a requirement to
analyze risks in terms of the parties involved in the execution of payments, both at the level of the
Ministry of Finance and the central bank, to ensure that only transactions with supporting
documentation are executed. It also emphasized the importance of: (i) improving information on the
nature of transactions and on the beneficiary of transfer orders to facilitate an initial risk analysis; (iii)
requiring formal and written procedures in dealings with the Ministry of Finance to ensure that all
accounts go through the normal public spending liquidation channels; (iv) requesting all institutions
receiving periodical transfers to their accounts to justify how the previous transfer was used and to
provide a utilization program for the transfer requested; and (v) improving the filing system at the
Ministry of Finance to ensure that all transactions can be checked against the documentary
justification supporting them. The submission of a report on reserves operation to the Board of the
BRB was agreed as an additional program measure for 2013.
Exchange Arrangements

While the de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, the de facto exchange rate arrangement
has been reclassified to a stabilized arrangement against the dollar, the intervention currency. After
depreciating by a cumulative 22 percent against the US dollar since 2011 in the face of the food of
fuel shocks, the Burundi franc has remained stable following a bout of volatility in early 2013. The
central bank intervened through foreign exchange sales to reverse the depreciation. It also replaced
the foreign exchange auction with an inter bank market.
On March 31, 2014, the official exchange rate was BIF 1544.56 to the US dollar. In 2003 the central
bank eliminated most remaining exchange restrictions on current international transactions and
delegated authority to commercial banks to approve standard transactions. In early 2004, the
surrender requirement was lowered to 50 percent and in early 2005 it was eliminated. Most external
arrears to bilateral and multilateral creditors were cleared by the end of 2005. In December 2006 the
government published a new foreign exchange regulation, the Foreign Exchange Regulation of 2006
that liberalized access to foreign exchange for current transactions and removed one multiple

4 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURUNDI

currency practice. In June 2010, the government replaced the Foreign Exchange Regulation of 2006
with the Exchange Regulation of 2010. The new regulation became operational in July 2010.
Burundi has availed itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV since it joined the Fund in
1962 but no longer maintains any exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices that relate to
that article. It does have one multiple currency practice that is inconsistent with Article VIII, Section
2(a): the exchange rate used for government transactions differ by more than 2 percent from market
exchange rates. Burundi maintains certain foreign exchange restrictions for security reasons and has
notified the Fund of those restrictions in the past pursuant to Decision 144-(52/51).

Article IV Consultation
In accordance with Decision No. 14747-(10/96), adopted September 28, 2010, Burundi is on the
24-month Article IV cycle. The 2012 Article IV consultation was completed by the Executive Board on
July 27, 2012 (IMF Country Report No. 12/226), along with the first review under the ECF
arrangement.
In concluding the 2012 consultation, Executive Directors commended the Burundian authorities for
progress in implementing their Fund-supported economic program in a difficult post-conflict
environment. However, Directors considered that the external and internal risks weighing on the
outlook called for a faster pace of fiscal and structural reforms, and encouraged the authorities to
persist in their prudent approach to macroeconomic management.

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
GROUP (JUNE 2014)
Burundi has been a member of the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group since the group was
founded in 1964. AfDB grant and loan operations with the country were interrupted by the outbreak
of civil strife in 1993. On July 19, 2004, the AfDB Boards approved general policy guidelines to help
post conflict countries clear their arrears and created a facility, the PCCF, initially funded with about
SDR 100 million in AfDB funds, to provide financial assistance to qualifying countries. The policy
guidelines call for a three-way burden-sharing formula among the country, donors, and the PCCF.
On October 27, 2004, the AfDB Boards endorsed an arrears clearance proposal for Burundi whereby
the balance of arrears was settled with the help of donors and the PCCF before the decision point
for the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
On April 21, 2009, under the enhanced framework of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative, the Board of Directors of AfDB approved AfDB’s share of the HIPC debt relief in an amount
equivalent to USD 150,200,000 in Net Present Value (NPV) terms as of the end of 2004. The Board of
Directors also approved Burundi’s qualification for debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI), in an amount of US$ 15.38 million, (UA 10.48 million), in nominal terms.
The 2012-2016 Burundi Country Strategy Paper (CSP) was approved by the Board in January 2012. It
analyzes the development perspectives and challenges facing the country and identifies the role the
Bank can play, in close collaboration with the Government of Burundi (GoB) and development
partners, in supporting the country to meet its development objectives; as articulated in the CSLPP-II
and Burundi Vision 2025. The CSLP-II was prepared by the GoB in a participatory manner including
civil society and the private sector and with support by the development partners. The AfDB funded
several analytical studies that fed the CSLP-II. The strategy emphasizes selectivity and
complementarity between the two pillars, namely strengthening state institutions and infrastructure
improvements. The selection of these pillars is consistent with the Bank’s comparative advantage in
the infrastructure sector, as well as its value-added in the area of sector reforms, good governance
and institutional capacity building. It also provides incentives for private sector development by
ensuring the build-up of a necessary business climate and infrastructure; with the overall objective
of promoting growth and inclusive development. The Board of Directors of the Bank approved the
CSP MTR in June 2014. The two pillars will be maintained for the remaining period (2014-2016) with
notably the budgetary and institutional support programs and projects in transport/energy sectors.
The Bank ongoing portfolio comprises eight (14) national operations for a total UA 110.44 million.
The road sector accounts for 67% of the portfolio, followed by multi-sector (Economic Reform
Support and Institutional Capacity Building) (17%). There are six (10) active multinational operations
for UA 146,80 million, mostly in the road sector (60%).The first disbursement (7 million UA) of the
fifth phase of Burundi’s “Economic Reform Programme s” (PARE V, total amount is UA 12 million UA)
has been disbursed in 2012. The second disbursement is planned in fourth quarter of 2014 once the
remaining two conditions are met (report on the audit of public procurement and the amendment

of the new investment code). In 2014, the Bank approved two projects in energy sector: Rusumo
Hydropower multinational program for a total amount of UA 16.70 and Jiji Murembwe Hydropower
for an amount of UA 14.34. The Bank is also undertaking several analytical studies including
microfinance and poverty reduction in Burundi and relationship between growth and employment.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Burundi—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of June 2014
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provided to the Fund have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper
surveillance. The most serious shortcomings affect national accounts and balance of payments
statistics. Insufficient funding, staffing shortages and lack of equipment, along with coordination
difficulties among responsible institutions, hinder the timely production and dissemination of
macroeconomic statistics.
National accounts: The national statistical office (ISTEEBU) has implemented a new series of annual
national accounts (ANA) in November 2011, with the support of the Observatoire économique et
statistique d'Afrique Subsaharienne (Afristat), the African Development Bank (AfDB) and AFRITAC
Central. The revisions included improved data sources, a change in the base year from 1996 to 2005,
and updated compilation methodologies (based on the 1993 System of National Accounts). Under
the new data, nominal national incomes have been revised up by an average of 36 percent during
2005–08, while the average real growth rate for these years is about 1.5 percentage point higher
than earlier estimated. ANA are available for the period 2005-2010. A system of provisional ANA has
been implemented so that the ANA for 2011-13 should be released before 2015; and the agency will
produce and release data for the 1997-2004 period thereafter. The ISTEEBU plans to rebase its GDP
on 2014 once the estimates for 2011-14 become available with a methodology that will make better
use of producer prices, wage and agricultural data. It has also embarked on the implementation of
Quarterly National Accounts with the assistance of AFRITAC Central.
Price statistics: The ISTEEBU produces and disseminates a monthly consumer price index (CPI) for
the capital city, Bujumbura. The CPI is based on the methodology recommended by the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). The reference period for prices is December
2013, while weights are based on the 2008 household survey. The basket selected for the calculation
of the CPI contains 163 products, broken down into 12 consumer functions. The ISTEEBU is planning
to revise CPI weights based on a survey on household consumption that should be completed and
released in late 2014. The revised CPI methodology will also include price developments in the
country’s major cities and towns.
Government finance statistics: Burundi has benefitted from technical assistance (TA) provided by
the World Bank and Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department in the areas of public financial management
information systems and public expenditure management; and training provided by the Fund’s
Statistics Department (STA) in the compilation of government finance statistics. Nevertheless,
government finance statistics (GFS) continue to suffer from weaknesses in coverage, accuracy,
consistency, and timeliness. Burundi has accepted to participate in the GFS module under the
Enhanced Data Dissemination Initiative (EDDI) project for Africa funded by the United Kingdom
Department for International Development (DFID). The GFS module has as its main objective
improving the quality and dissemination of fiscal statistics using the guidelines of the Government
Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). The support under the module consists mostly of a
series of TA missions that started in 2011 and will continue until 2015. Recent TA shows the need to

11

BURUNDI

improve the quality of public debt data. In 2013, Burundi started reporting GFS data for the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.
Monetary and financial statistics: The monetary and financial statistics are now compiled
following the recommended methodologies of the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual
(2000), and are broadly adequate for both surveillance and harmonization with the monetary
statistics of other East African Community member countries.
Transactions with the IMF are reflected incorrectly—the amount of loans received from the IMF
differs from the Fund records, misrepresenting foreign liabilities of the central bank. STA informed
the central bank of the issue, the resolution of which is pending. Because of the current payment
system, there are differences between the central bank and other depository corporations (ODC)
records. Normally, transactions between the central bank and ODC show up in ODC balance sheet
with one-day lag that affects other items (net) (OIN) in the Depository Corporations survey. The
liabilities of three banks in liquidation are shown in the central bank balance sheet; however, the
information on these banks is not included in the summary of ODC data.
Financial sector surveillance: Burundi currently reports a set of financial soundness indicators (FSIs)
using its own methodology; but an IMF FSI mission visited Burundi in April 2014 and the authorities
have agreed by end July 2014 to provide a complete set of data for the 12 core FSIs as well as 11
encouraged indicators compiled following the recommended methodologies of the IMF’s Financial
Sector Indicators Compilation Guide. However, credit cooperatives and microfinance organizations
will not be covered because of data collection issues and because these institutions represent less
than 5 percent of the assets of the financial system.
External sector statistics: Annual balance of payments and international investment position
statistics are compiled by the Banque de la République du Burundi (BRB) according to the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). However, severe coverage and measurement
difficulties impart a high degree of uncertainty to external sector statistics and surveillance. For
example, there are significant divergences with other sources on imports and exports. Also, donor
inflows are not appropriately recorded. A balance of payments reconciliation committee does not
exist to cross check data from various sources (central bank, customs, and national institute of
statistics). Measurement of capital and financial account transactions relies on Burundi’s
International Transaction Reporting System, which is known to have incomplete coverage. Further
actions are required to improve the accuracy and reliability of external sector data.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Fifth Review Under Extended Credit Facility
Arrangement, Approves US$7.6 Million Disbursement, and Concludes 2014 Article IV
Consultation with Burundi
On August 25, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed
the fifth review of Burundi’s economic performance under a three-year program supported by
the IMF’s Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement, and also concluded the 2014 Article IV
Consultation1 with Burundi. The completion of the fifth review enables the immediate release
of an amount equivalent to SDR 5 million (about US$7.6 million), bringing total disbursements
under the arrangement to an amount equivalent to SDR 25 million (about US$38.1 million).
In completing the fifth review, the Executive Board also approved the authorities’ requests for
a modification of performance criteria and indicative targets for September–December 2014 for
net foreign assets and net domestic assets of the central bank and net domestic financing of the
government, as well as for gross fiscal revenue and reserve money.
The three-year ECF arrangement in the amount equivalent to SDR 30 million (about US$ 45.7
million) was approved by the Executive Board on January 27, 2012 (see Press Release 12/35).
Following the Executive Board's discussion on Burundi, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair issued the following statement:
“Burundi has made satisfactory progress under the ECF-supported program. Economic growth
is expected to pick up to about 4.7 percent in 2014, while inflation has been declining aided by
moderating international food and fuel prices and stable monetary conditions. However, the
medium-term economic outlook remains difficult, with downside risks arising from political
uncertainties ahead of the 2015 elections, vulnerabilities to external shocks given Burundi’s
narrow export base, and the large influx of refugees.
“Revenue slippages that emerged in the first quarter of the year were addressed through
corrective measures which formed the basis for a revised budget that was adopted by

2

parliament. Sustaining revenue mobilization, enhancing tax administration, and rationalizing
discretionary exemptions are critical to the success of the economic program.
“Monetary policy should continue to focus on stabilizing inflation expectations. While
underlying inflation has declined in recent months, a potential fiscal deterioration financed by
recourse to central bank financing could reignite inflation and reverse recent gains.
“Debt sustainability remains the anchor underpinning medium-term fiscal policy. Burundi
continues to be at high risk of debt distress, therefore, it is important to rely mainly on grants
and highly concessional loans. The new debt law will provide an overarching framework for
effective public debt management and policy.”
The Executive Board also completed the 2014 Article IV consultation.
The economic recovery continues to gain momentum in the aftermath of the recent food and
fuel shocks. In 2013, real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth picked up to an estimated
4.5 percent, underpinned by the agriculture and construction sectors as well as the
implementation of major infrastructure projects. Inflation decelerated to 8 percent at year end,
supported by favorable international food and fuel prices, fiscal consolidation, and stable
monetary conditions. The implementation of swift corrective measures in mid-2013 helped
remedy revenue slippages and, together with a relative containment of expenditure, helped
contain the overall deficit at 1.6 percent of GDP in line with the authorities’ economic program
supported by the ECF. Gross international reserves stood at 3.4 months of imports at end-2013.
The macroeconomic outlook is expected to improve in 2014 and in the medium term but
remains subject to various risks. Real GDP growth is projected to improve slightly to 4.7
percent in 2014 and is expected to improve further over the medium term on the back of solid
agricultural and construction activity, including the implementation of large hydroelectric
projects. Deeper integration with the East African Community (EAC) is expected to spur
investment in the tourism, wholesale and retail sectors, as well as in finance and
telecommunications. Inflation should stabilize to single digits over the medium term in line
with lower projected international food and fuel prices. The fiscal position is expected to
improve over the medium term on the backdrop of durable revenue-enhancing measures and
prudent spending policy. The current account deficit is projected to narrow to about 17 percent
of GDP in 2014, as coffee exports rebound, and improve over the medium term reflecting
higher exports and moderate growth in imports following earlier surges associated with
humanitarian assistance. Greater exchange rate flexibility would help shore up international
reserves to more comfortable levels. Key risks to the outlook include: (1) a deterioration of the
political and security situation; (2) a further decline in donor support; (3) a worsening in the
terms of trade; and (4) a protracted period of slower growth in advanced and emerging
economies.

Executive Board Assessment1
Executive Directors noted that performance under the ECF had been satisfactory under
challenging circumstances. Directors welcomed the adoption of corrective measures to address
revenue shortfalls and to bolster revenues over the medium term.
Directors agreed that sustaining revenue mobilization efforts are critical to the success of the
program. They underscored the need to step up revenue collection in order to respond to
contingencies in the run-up to the 2015 Presidential elections, safeguard pro-poor spending, and
to address the rising demand for public services from a rapidly growing population. They
welcomed efforts to reform tax exemptions to mitigate the erosion of the revenue base while
simplifying procedures associated with doing business.
Directors underscored the need to strengthen public financial and debt management to mitigate
fiscal risks. They welcomed the progress made in implementing the public financial
management strategy and encouraged the authorities to address outstanding weaknesses. To
preserve debt sustainability, Burundi should continue to rely mainly on grants and highly
concessional loans in light of its high risk of debt distress.
Directors stressed that monetary policy should continue to focus on stabilizing inflation
expectations and welcomed the notable deceleration of inflation in recent months. Going
forward, they encouraged the authorities to enhancing monetary transmission mechanism.
Directors noted that the exchange rate remains an important tool in facilitating external
adjustment, enhancing external competitiveness and safeguarding foreign reserves.
Directors underscored the importance of deeper structural reforms to foster stronger and
sustainable growth and to reduce poverty. They highlighted that reforms priorities should focus
on improving competitiveness and the business climate, and addressing infrastructure gaps,
including increasing energy supply. Directors concurred that enhancing financial
intermediation, while maintaining financial stability, will be critical to facilitate credit to the
private sector and support growth.
Directors encouraged the authorities to accelerate and expand efforts to increase data coverage
and improve quality, to better inform policy making.

IMF Country Report 14/83.

Statement by Mr. Saho, Executive Director for Burundi
August 25, 2014
On behalf of my Burundian authorities, I thank the Board and Management of the Fund for their
continued support to Burundi. The Fund-supported program has significantly assisted in the
achievement of macroeconomic stability and moderate growth in Burundi. The authorities also
appreciate the candid and constructive policy advice they receive from the Fund Staff. The close
dialogue and mutual understanding which characterized the fifth ECF program review and the
Article IV consultation are well reflected in the staff report.

Background
The Government of Burundi is implementing the ECF program under severe domestic and
external challenges. While progress is notable in the restoration of macroeconomic stability,
social development and improvement in the business environment, the implementation of the
program in line with the goals of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSPII) remain
unimpressive due to declining donor budget support and limited fiscal space for development
financing. The Burundian economy is vulnerable to domestic shocks stemming from vagaries of
weather and the lingering effects of external shocks associated with unstable commodity prices,
which have led to the continuous deterioration in the terms of trade. The huge infrastructure
gaps, especially in energy supply, together with a small private sector, are key impediments to
high economic growth that is necessary to reduce poverty.
Against this background, the authorities have intensified their efforts to maintain
macroeconomic stability, promote private sector development, and foster regional economic
integration in the East African Community (EAC), while keeping the ECF program on track. To
help complement their reform efforts, and catalyze external support, the authorities are
requesting Executive Directors’ support to conclude the 2014 article IV consultation, complete
the fifth ECF review and set new performance criteria and indicative targets for SeptemberDecember 2014.

Program performance
The program is broadly on track. At end March 2014, all performance criteria and indicative
targets were met, except for the indicative targets on fiscal revenue and reserve money. Fiscal
revenue underperformed relative to the program target due to the impact of the 2013 income
tax law, the EAC tax harmonization exercise and weak tax administration. Satisfactory progress
was made in the implementation of structural reforms albeit with delays. The structural
benchmarks relating to the debt law and audit of arrears on extra-budgetary spending have been
rescheduled.

Recent economic developments
Economic developments remain broadly in line with the ECF program. GDP growth

2
increased from 4 percent in 2012 to 4.5 percent in 2013. It is expected that real GDP growth will
improve slightly to 4.7 percent in 2014. Headline inflation decelerated sharply from 9 percent at
end–2013 to 3.5 percent at end–May 2014, due to favorable developments in international
petroleum and food prices. In 2013, the current account deficit widened reaching 20.5 percent of
GDP compared to 18.5 percent in 2012.
On the fiscal front, domestic revenue collection weakened in the first quarter of 2014. The
revenue underperformance reflected shortcomings in tax administration, the harmonization of
the Burundian tax system with that of EAC and the losses declared by some large taxpayers
under the existing tax law.
With respect to monetary policy, the authorities have made efforts to deepen policy
credibility and strengthen the transmission mechanism. In this regard, the Monetary Policy
Committee has begun publishing its quarterly reports and publicly announcing the monetary
authorities’ policy intentions.

Policies for the remainder of 2014 and beyond
Going forward, the authorities are committed to anchor policies toward maintaining
macroeconomic stability and deepening structural reforms to promote high and inclusive
growth. In this regard, they will continue to enhance and strengthen fiscal and monetary policies
in line with the ECF program objectives. With regard to structural reforms, the authorities are
committed to ensuring that the efforts in improving the economy’s investment climate are
sustained. Meanwhile, Burundi has moved up from being ranked at the bottom three to 140th
out of 189 countries in the World Bank’s Doing Business report in 2014.

Fiscal policy
The authorities are committed to the implementation of prudent fiscal policy in order to achieve
sustainable and inclusive growth. Efforts will be made to further improve and strengthen
domestic revenue mobilization especially given declining budget support.
With regard to public spending, the authorities will focus more on social services such as health
and education, without neglecting critical expenditure on infrastructure development, especially
in the energy sector. My authorities will continue, with technical assistance from the IMF, to
strengthen their public finance management system.
Following the underperformance in domestic revenue collection, the authorities have
implemented corrective measures in the July 2014 supplementary budget to increase revenue
mobilization. It is expected that such measures will generate additional revenue equivalent to
about 1 percent of GDP. In addition, more resources will be allocated to the Burundian Revenue
Authority to strengthen tax administration.

3
Debt policy
The authorities are committed to debt sustainability. In this regard, they are working to improve
and strengthen the debt management system. The new law on debt prepared with IMF technical
assistance will be submitted to the Parliament in September 2014. The government will also
maintain a prudent debt management policy and rely as much as possible on grants and highly
concessional loans to finance capital intensive projects. However, given the very high
concessionality threshold under the program, access to financial resources to meet development
financing needs is expected to be very limited.

Monetary and exchange rate policies
The achievement of macroeconomic stability will continue to guide the authorities’ stance on
monetary and exchange rate policies. To achieve this objective, the Bank of Republic of Burundi
(BRB) is committed to developing technical capacity to forecast inflation and enhancing the
effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.
On exchange rate policy, the BRB is pursuing an active market-making policy to develop an
interbank foreign exchange market to ensure that the exchange rate remains flexible and
consistent with the fundamentals of the economy, while maintaining external competitiveness.

Financial sector policy
The authorities aim to improve financial intermediation to support growth while maintaining
financial stability. Credit to the private sector has been low mainly because of a weak legal and
institutional framework, an uncertain economic environment, limited competition among banks
and modest financial innovation. To mitigate some of these constraints, the authorities are in the
process of establishing a credit bureau and a collateral registry, enhancing the supervision of
microfinance institutions, and implementing regulatory changes to facilitate leasing finance.
Given the surge in nonperforming loans, the BRB is gearing to improve and strengthen bank
supervision with IMF technical assistance.

Conclusion
My Burundian authorities are committed to keeping the ECF program on track despite the
challenging environment. They are aware that macroeconomic stability remains a key
requirement for sustainable and inclusive growth. In this regard, the authorities are committed to
implementing prudent fiscal and monetary policies while safeguarding economic transformation
in line with the PRSPII. At the same time, they are committed to deepening structural reforms to
enhance the business environment, and improve economic productivity.
The implementation of the PRSPII, focused on economic transformation, remains a challenge due
to several constraints including energy shortages. Although, the authorities are striving to
address this issue in the medium to long term, currently, the problem remains acute and is
hampering the efforts to enhance growth and reduce poverty. The authorities will continue
