EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Iraq’s economic situation in recent years has been very difficult, mainly due to the
deterioration in security, but progress was made in strengthening macroeconomic
management while structural reforms continued. The insecurity hampered investment,
keeping oil production and economic growth low. Shortages of key commodities contributed
to sharply rising inflation in 2006. Following an intensified policy effort, in particular by
appreciating the exchange rate, inflation came down markedly during the first part of 2007.
Official fuel prices were increased to regional levels and progress was made in modernizing
public financial management, strengthening central bank safeguards, and banking sector
reform. Iraq continues to make progress in resolving debt to official and private creditors.
Together with the completion of the fifth review under the Stand-By Arrangement, the
authorities have requested a three-month extension of the arrangement, to keep a policy
framework in place during discussions for an envisaged successor arrangement.
Iraq’s economic prospects for 2007 and beyond depend critically on the security
situation. Provided the envisaged investments in the oil sector are realized, a gradual
expansion of oil production is achievable. Given the current favorable world oil price
projections, the medium-term outlook is promising. However, there are significant downside
risks, including from volatile oil prices, and the political and security situation.
Iraq’s key challenges are to increase economic growth and further reduce inflation.
This requires: (i) increasing investment, especially in the oil sector; (ii) continuing
macroeconomic policies to bring inflation down; and (iii) moving ahead with priority
structural reforms.
●
The 2007 budget allows for an ambitious investment program but sustained
efforts are needed to increase the project implementation rate. Current spending,
including on wages and pensions, needs to be strictly contained to maintain fiscal
sustainability. It is crucial that the pension law amendments be enacted soon.
●
The authorities intend to allow the dinar to gradually appreciate in the coming
months, while the pace of appreciation will be adjusted and monetary policy will be tightened if
inflation remains high. It is also important that the government actively supports private fuel
imports to reduce shortages.
●
The authorities are aware of the need to accelerate structural reforms. Their
priorities are to: (i) broaden the coverage of the Financial Management Information System;
(ii) develop a medium-term strategy to modernize the tax system and strengthen tax
administration; (iii) further improve CBI internal controls and accounting; (iv) move ahead
with banking sector reform; and (v) establish a new legislative framework for the oil sector.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Iraq’s last Article IV consultation was concluded on August 1, 2005, the first
Article IV consultation in 25 years. The authorities indicated that they have drawn in their
policy making on the Fund’s advice, in particular with regard to the need to containing
inflation and phasing out government subsidies on petroleum products.
2.
A Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) for Iraq was approved on December 23, 2005 in
an amount equivalent to 40 percent of quota (SDR 475.4 million). The arrangement
originally ran through March 22, 2007, but was extended on March 12, 2007 to
September 28, 2007. The first and second reviews of the arrangement were completed on
August 2, 2006, and the third and fourth reviews were concluded on March 12, 2007. The
SBA supported a program aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability, paving the way for
sustainable growth, and achieving external debt sustainability. Iraq continues to treat the
SBA as precautionary.
3.
The Paris Club agreed on November 21, 2004 to a debt reduction for Iraq,
equivalent to 80 percent in net present value (NPV) terms, to be achieved in three
stages. The first and second stages each comprised a 30 percent debt reduction in NPV terms
and went into effect in November 2004 and in December 2005 (following approval of the
SBA), respectively. The final stage will comprise an additional 20 percent debt reduction,
and depends on completion by end-December 2008 of the final review of the third year of
one or more upper credit tranche arrangements with the Fund.
4.
The International Compact with Iraq (ICI) was formally endorsed by the
international community on May 3, 2007, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The ICI aims to
put in place a medium-term framework for political, security and economic reforms. The
Fund’s main contribution to the ICI is through preparation of the medium-term
macroeconomic framework of the SBA-supported program.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Political and Security Environment
5.
Iraq’s first constitutional government since the fall of the Saddam Hussein
regime was approved by the Council of Representatives (COR) on May 20, 2006,
following elections on December 15, 2005. While there have been political tensions within
the coalition government, the prime minister and key ministers have kept their positions. The
political consensus was, however, undermined by the resignation of six ministers from the
Al-Sadr movement in April 2007.

6
6.
The security
situation deteriorated in
2006. Despite the
implementation of a new
security plan in 2007, Iraq
continues to suffer serious
security problems. This has
further worsened living
conditions, adversely
affected economic activity,
and induced the emigration
of professionals and skilled
labor.

B. Social and Human Development
7.
Living conditions in Iraq have further deteriorated in recent years. The 2004
United Nations Development Program survey of living conditions shows Iraq’s poor scores
on the Millennium Development Goals, and reports widespread malnutrition, low primary
school enrollment, and high child mortality. Although the survey has not since been updated,
the results from the 2007 Iraq Poll provide indications of further deterioration in living
conditions (Box 1).
8.
Large numbers of people have been displaced. The United Nations’ refugee agency
estimates that over 4 million Iraqis are displaced, including some 1.9 million inside Iraq and
over 2 million in neighboring countries. The economic and social costs are significant, with
many professionals leaving the country.1 The large numbers of refugees are putting a strain
on Iraq’s neighboring countries (Syria has 1.2 million refugees, and Jordan about 750,000
refugees), where the inflows are causing supply bottlenecks and rising real estate prices.
C. Institutional and Administrative Capacity
9.
Iraq has made progress with data provision, but weaknesses remain. The data on
the oil sector is generally adequate and timely, but there is little information on non-oil
economic activity and on the balance of payments. The CBI balance sheet and consumer
price data are available with relatively short lags but do not cover the Kurdish region.
Recently, the CBI started producing a monetary survey, which also excludes the Kurdish
region. Incomplete data on letters of credit issued by the Trade Bank of Iraq to finance
government imports hampers the assessment of the fiscal stance.

The Iraqi Medical Association, for example, estimates that at least one-third of the country's 40,000 doctors
have fled to Jordan, Syria, and other countries.

Box 1. Quality of Life
The quality of life in Iraq has deteriorated in the last two years. When asked to indicate “how things
are going in their lives these days?” 60 percent of respondents in the 2007 Iraq Poll answered “very bad” or
“quite bad”, compared to 29 percent in 2004 and 20051. More than three quarters of Iraqis say that jobs are
hard to find, which supports the official under-employment estimates ranging from 30 to 50 percent. The
availability of clean water, medical care, and basic goods and services have, after some improvement in
2005, all deteriorated. Three out of five Iraqis consider the conditions of local schools to be bad, more than
twice as many as in 2004.
The worsening security situation is perceived as the driving factor behind the deteriorating living
conditions. When asked about the “biggest single problem facing Iraq” more than half of the respondents
to the 2007 Iraq Poll mentioned security, followed by political and military issues (26 percent), social
issues (12 percent), and economic issues (9 percent).

1/ The 2007 survey was commissioned by a consortium of international media outlets and 2,000
people across all 18 provinces in Iraq were questioned in February/March 2007 by an independent
opinion research company. The same survey was conducted in 2004 and 2005.

10.
The International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB) mandate to audit
and oversee the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI; Box 2) was extended through
December 2007.2 Meanwhile, the Council of Ministers approved the establishment of the
Committee of Financial Experts (COFE) in October 2006, to be chaired by the president of
the Board of Supreme Audit. The newly established COFE is working in parallel with the
IAMB to smooth the transition of responsibilities from the IAMB to COFE once the IAMB’s
mandate expires.

8

Box 2. The Development Fund for Iraq
The DFI was established in May 2003 pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1483. The DFI was
tasked with holding the proceeds of Iraq’s oil exports, as well as the remaining balances from the UN Oil-forFood Program and other frozen Iraqi funds. Disbursements from the DFI must be used for the benefit of the
Iraqi people. The DFI consists of bank accounts held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the CBI.
On May 18, 2007, the U.S. President continued for one year the protections against claims available to the
DFI in the U.S..
According to UN Security Council Resolution 1483, the IAMB is to act as an audit and oversight body
for the DFI. UN Security Council Resolution 1723 extended the IAMB mandate until end-December 2007.
The formal transfer of functions from the IAMB to the COFE is expected to take place at UN headquarters in
December 2007.
Oil exports receipts are the main inflow in the DFI (over 95 percent of total). Other amounts accruing to
the DFI are from returned Letters of Credit and interest earned on overnight deposits and U.S. T- Bill
holdings, as well as surplus funds from the UN Oil For Food Program and transfers by UN member states of
previously frozen funds of the Iraqi government.
The DFI is the main source for budgetary financing. For import financing, revenues from the DFI are
channeled through the Trade Bank of Iraq. To finance domestic spending, the Ministry of Finance credits the
CBI’s dollar account from the DFI (thereby increasing the CBI’s gross reserves), while receiving dinars in its
account at the CBI in Baghdad.

11.
Despite the adverse security situation, progress was made in the delivery of
technical assistance (TA). In the monetary and banking area, Fund TA has resulted in:
(i) the production of a monetary survey; (ii) replacing an obsolete paper-based system with
modern electronic payment systems; (iii) improving banking supervision; and (iv) initiating
the restructuring of the two largest state-owned banks. On the fiscal side, Fund TA has
helped to design a Chart of Accounts and implement the financial management information
system (FMIS). Fund TA in statistics, mostly in the form of training, has significantly
improved the quality and coverage of fiscal, monetary and balance of payments data.
III. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
12.
The economy has not grown as fast as was expected at the time of the last Article
IV consultation, although progress has been made in strengthening macroeconomic
management and in implementing structural reforms. The prevailing insecurity has
seriously hampered reconstruction and investment, which resulted in lower-than-foreseen oil
production and hence slower economic growth.3 It has also worsened shortages of key

For example, in the 2005 Article IV consultation, oil production was projected at 2.4 million barrels per day
(mbpd) in 2006 whereas the outcome was 2.0 mbpd.

9
commodities, contributing to rising inflation in 2006. The low implementation rate of the
government’s investment program resulted in large fiscal and external surpluses, with the
balance in the DFI standing at $8.6 billion at end-2006. The CBI gross international reserves
increased to $18.7 billion at end-2006 (almost 6 months of import cover).
13.
Following a decline in oil production and real GDP in 2005, economic growth is
estimated at 6¼ percent in 2006. Oil production increased slightly to 2 million barrels per
day (mbpd) in 2006, but

remained well below the 2.3

estimated to have increased by
7½ percent in 2006. Non-oil investment is also being adversely affected by the prevailing
security situation.
14.
Inflation reached worrisome levels in 2006, but came down markedly during
February through June. Annual consumer price inflation increased to 66½ percent in
January 2007 from 31½ percent at end-2005, reflecting shortages of key commodities,
primarily fuel. Core inflation

instead to have been
accommodated by the pervasive cash dollarization. Following an intensified policy effort to
bring inflation under control, the annual inflation rate declined to 38 percent in May 2007;
core inflation decreased to 21 percent in May. Fuel shortages reportedly declined somewhat
in the first months of the year, contributing to the narrowing of the gap between headline and
core inflation. In June, however, fuel shortages worsened again and headline inflation
increased to 46 percent; core inflation continued to decline to 19 percent.

Following a fiscal
surplus of 11 percent of GDP in
2005, the fiscal outturn for
2006 showed yet another
sizable surplus of almost
12 percent of GDP, largely due
to underspending.5 The surplus
resulted in an accumulation of
balances in the DFI of

deposits at the CBI of ID 755

levels since then.4

Cash sales of dollars at auctions are considered to be a key indicator of dollarization. Dollar sales for bank
transfers largely represent the financing of imports and the increasingly important remittances to Iraqi refugees
abroad.

The final 2006 fiscal accounts have not yet been completed, mainly due to the damage caused by the recent

billion, while almost ID 950 billion of outstanding Treasury bills were redeemed. Preliminary
information for the first quarter of 2007 indicates continued underspending resulting in a
fiscal surplus, due to a shortfall in investment and partly also to the late adoption of the
budget. However, budget execution is reported to have accelerated in April/May.
17.
Progress in structural reforms has been made, despite the lack of security and
capacity constraints:
•

Important steps have been taken toward reducing subsidies, with several rounds of
price increases for domestic petroleum products bringing these prices in line with
those in other oil-exporting countries in the region. A recently promulgated law
permitting the private importation of fuel products is expected to improve the
domestic supply of these products and help reduce black market fuel prices. However,
negotiations are still ongoing on a new legal framework for the oil sector.

•

The government is also working to modernize public financial management, and the
chart of accounts and budget classification are being brought in line with the GFSM
2001 within a cash accounting framework. On the other hand, the new pension law
has yet to be amended in order to make it fiscally sustainable. The census of public
service employees has started but will likely not be completed by the end of the year.

•

The CBI is now using a modern real time gross settlement system and an automatic
clearing house. Preparations for the restructuring of the two largest state-owned banks
are underway. An audit of the CBI end-2006 net international reserves and the interim
audit report of its 2006 financial statements have been completed. Also, the CBI’s
capital was raised to the statutory level.

18.
Iraq has resolved most of its debt to Paris Club creditors, but progress in
resolving debt to non-Paris Club official creditors has been limited. The authorities have
signed bilateral agreements with all Paris Club creditors, except Russia, and nine (out of
more than 30) non-Paris Club creditors. Six of these nine creditors (Czech Republic,
Hungary, Indonesia, Malaysia, Romania, and South Africa) provided debt reduction
comparable to the terms of the Paris Club agreement, while three others (Cyprus, Malta, and
Slovak Republic) provided 100 percent reduction.6 In addition, the authorities have received
confirmations from 20 countries that they do not have any claims on Iraq.
19.
A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) was established in March 2007 to provide
single securitization of restructured debt to official creditors. The SPV would issue

The total debt to non-Paris Club official creditors is estimated at $67.7 billion, of which bilateral agreements
have been signed for an amount of $3.4 billion. The bulk of unresolved debt (more than 80 percent) is to the
Gulf countries and China.

12
U.S. dollar-denominated notes in exchange for, and secured by, rights under bilateral
agreements between one or more sovereign creditors and Iraq. The Paris Club has indicated
that the establishment of the SPV does not raise any issue in terms of comparability of
treatment among creditors. The scheme of the SPV does not preclude individual Paris Club
member countries to participate as long as the Paris Club concurs.
20.
Iraq has resolved most private creditors’ claims through debt and cash
exchanges. By mid-2007, Iraq had settled more than $19.7 billion claims submitted by
private creditors. Almost two-third of the remaining claims were withdrawn or cancelled
during the process of reconciliation and settlement. Most of the unresolved claims (about
4 percent of total claims) are being reconciled with claims that are being settled as part of the
liquidation of the London branch of Rafidain Bank.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
21.
The discussions were characterized by broad agreement between the authorities
and staff on the key economic challenges facing Iraq and the policies needed to address
them. The authorities agreed that decisive actions are required to: (i) increase investment,
especially in the oil sector; (ii) bring inflation down further; and (iii) move ahead with
priority structural reforms.
22.
The authorities remain strongly committed to the program supported by the
SBA. In the attached third Supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
(SMEFP-3) they outline their plans for the remainder of the program period.
A. Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks
23.
Iraq’s economic prospects for 2007 and beyond depend critically on the security
situation. The authorities acknowledged that present circumstances constrain their ability to
increase the rate of implementation of their investment program, including importantly in the
oil sector. As a result, oil production would increase only gradually over the next few years.
For 2007, oil production could reach close to 2.1 mbpd. With non-oil output continuing to
grow moderately, real GDP growth is projected at about 6 percent in 2007. Over the medium
term, output growth is projected to average some 6¾ percent in 2008–09; assuming progress
is made in resolving the security problems, economic growth could increase to about
10 percent thereafter. Inflation is targeted to come down to about 30 percent by end-2007,
reflecting the combined effects of the policy actions taken by the CBI, the strict control of
government current spending, and the start of private imports of fuel products. The increase
in government investments should only have a limited impact on inflation, given its high
import content. From 2009 on, inflation is expected to gradually fall to single digit levels.

24.
The fiscal situation remains vulnerable to declines in oil prices. With the current
favorable world oil price outlook and assuming a gradual increase in oil production and
export volumes, the overall fiscal position would be sustainable. The government will need
to continue to restrain current spending in order to allow for sufficient investment and
security outlays, especially in view of the expected reduction in foreign grants starting in
2008 and sizable amortization payments of the rescheduled debt beginning in 2011. The
balance of the DFI is projected to fall to a very low level during 2007–11 to absorb the
projected fiscal deficits, leaving no room for fiscal slippage.
25.
Iraq’s medium-term balance of payments and debt outlook remain heavily
dependent on crude oil exports. The current account balance is expected to deteriorate in
2007 and remain in sizable deficit

26.
The unsettled security situation and possible terms of trade shocks continue to
pose serious risks to the outlook. The economy remains extremely vulnerable to the
country’s security problems, which impede investment, inhibit private economic activity, and
hamper implementation of the structural reform agenda. In the event that investment and
production in the oil sector cannot be increased as projected, lower oil revenue would result

14
in higher fiscal deficits and sizable financing gaps from 2008. Absent access to significant
external borrowing, spending cuts would be necessary and unavoidable. The debt
sustainability analysis indicates that Iraq’s external debt remains also vulnerable to negative
oil price and production shocks (Appendix I).
B. Fiscal Policy and Related Measures
27.
The 2007 budget allows for an ambitious investment program, while
maintaining overall fiscal sustainability (SMEFP-3,¶8–10). The authorities indicated that
they have already taken a number of administrative measures to increase the execution rate of
investment projects, including accelerating cabinet approval of large projects and shortening
the procurement period. However, they considered that, given the gestation period of new
projects and the unsettled security situation, the impact of these measures in the short term
will be limited. At the same time, they were determined to keep current spending, notably on
wages and pensions, within budget to make room for public investment and security outlays,
and to avoid putting excessive demand pressures on Iraq’s small non-oil economy. Taking
account of the effect of a further appreciation on oil revenues, the overall fiscal deficit would
be kept below 10 percent of GDP in 2007.
28.
The authorities were committed to continue the phased adjustment of official
fuel prices (SMEFP-3,¶13 and Box 3). Domestic fuel prices were raised on July 1, broadly
in line with the program. The increase should avoid the emergence of explicit budgetary
subsidies, except for a small subsidy on kerosene. With fuel prices now equal to or above
regional averages, the authorities indicated that they will consider developing a rule–based
mechanism for setting domestic fuel prices in the future.
29.
To reduce fuel shortages, the authorities have issued about 20 licenses to private
importers (SMEFP-3, ¶12). They indicated that private imports in the Kurdish region have
begun, but that the security situation in other parts of the country remains a deterrent for
private sector involvement. The authorities also pointed out that they will take further steps
to facilitate private sector imports of petroleum products, including by making storage
facilities and pump stations available to private operators. The government will continue to
put at the disposal of the State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) a revolving credit with a
ceiling of ID 400 billion to finance its imports of fuel products.
30.
The government has begun to develop a medium-term tax reform strategy with
technical assistance from international partners, including the Fund (SMEFP-3,¶18).
The authorities explained that they aim to modernize the tax system to improve revenue
collection without placing undue burdens on the economy. They are considering the
introduction of a sales-tax as a precursor to a value-added tax, and aim to strengthen the tax
and customs administration.

15

Box 3. Iraq: Official Fuel Price Adjustments
Despite initial political resistance, Iraq has made significant adjustments to official fuel prices in the
past 18 months. Before the first adjustments, in December 2005, fuel prices were extremely low, even by
regional standards, with regular gasoline selling in Baghdad for about 3 U.S. dollar cents per liter, and less
than half of that outside the capital. In March and June 2007, the prices of regular and premium gasoline and
diesel were increased to a level exceeding the regional average. Prices for regular gasoline are now 32 U.S.
dollar cents per liter, while prices for premium gasoline largely reflect the actual import cost. With a view to
reduce smuggling, the price differentials of premium gasoline between Iraq and its direct neighbors Iran and
Kuwait were eliminated, while the price differentials with Syria and Jordan were reduced from more than
ninety to less than fifty percent.
The fiscal gains of the fuel price adjustments are substantial. The main objective of the price adjustments
is to gradually eliminate budgetary subsidies, and shift resources towards much needed investments in the oil
sector, healthcare, education, and security spending. In 2004, the net budget subsidy for fuel imports was
ID 4.8 billion (12¾ percent of GDP). By 2006, the price adjustments had reduced this subsidy to ID 3.2
billion (4½ percent of GDP). In the 2007 budget, explicit subsidies for fuel imports have been eliminated,
except for a small subsidy for kerosene imports, mostly used by the poor for cooking. These developments
were largely in line with the Fund staff recommendations at the time of the previous Article IV consultation
and the target set under the SBA.

31.
The authorities underlined that they attach high priority to improving public
financial management. They were determined to complete the remaining steps needed to
conform the chart of accounts and budget classification with the GFSM 2001, within a cash
accounting framework, shortly (SMEFP-3, ¶14). The authorities also indicated that they have
started using the Financial Management Information System (FMIS) on a trial basis since
January 2007. Staff agreed that the existing legacy system should continue to be used by
spending agencies in parallel until the FMIS is fully operational and tested. At the same time,
the coverage of the FMIS is being expanded to spending units not yet connected.
32.
The authorities explained that the census of public service employees turned out
to be more time-consuming than initially foreseen (SMEFP-3,¶16). They pointed out that
the census is linked to the preparations for setting up a computerized payroll to better control

16
the wage bill, and that the security situation has resulted in unexpected delays. However, the
preparations for the census have been completed and the census questionnaires have been
sent to most relevant government agencies. The data collection phase of the census is
expected to be completed by end-November.
33.
The authorities indicated that they are actively seeking to have the amendments
to the new pension law enacted by the CoR as soon as possible (SMEFP-3,¶15). The new
pension law that was passed in November 2005 is fiscally unsustainable over the medium
term. The amendments, once enacted, will provide for a gradual reduction of replacement
rates to sustainable levels and zero indexation in 2007, in line with earlier understandings
with Fund staff. The authorities also indicated that progress is being made in streamlining the
social safety net (SMEFP-3,¶17).
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
34.
The CBI will continue to manage the exchange rate with a view to reducing
inflation and reversing dollarization, and monetary policy will be further tightened, if
the inflation situation required this (SMEFP-3,¶11). While the recent appreciation of the
dinar has been successful in helping to reverse dollarization and contain inflationary
pressures, the authorities agreed that inflation needs to be further reduced. To this end, they
are committed to allow the exchange rate to appreciate gradually in the coming months,
while closely monitoring the effects of this policy and adjusting the pace of appreciation as
needed.
35.
The authorities intend to maintain the link of the dinar to the dollar. In the
absence of an effective monetary transmission mechanism and indirect monetary policy
instruments, the CBI will continue relying on the exchange rate as the principal nominal
anchor for the economy. While the exchange rate will remain the main policy instrument, it
will be backed up, as needed, by adjustments in the policy interest rate.

Due to data limitations and many structural changes in the economy, it is not
possible to estimate the equilibrium

17
equilibrium real exchange rate. With the nominal exchange rate fixed to the dollar for most
of the past two years, the adjustment of the real exchange rate to its new equilibrium was
reflected in persistent high core inflation. With the policy of allowing the exchange rate to
appreciate and the subsequent drop in inflation, the undervaluation of the exchange rate has
been significantly reduced. Nevertheless, the real exchange rate likely remains somewhat
undervalued as core inflation is still high. Therefore, the authorities agreed that the nominal
exchange rate should appreciate further, which should also help to contain inflationary
expectations. This policy of gradual appreciation is believed to have a minimal impact on
competitiveness, given that Iraq’s main export commodity is oil, and that to achieve lasting
gains in competitiveness it is essential to improve security and implement productivity
enhancing structural reforms.
37.
Iraq continues to maintain a liberal exchange regime. The authorities confirmed
that in practice there are no restrictions on current and capital transactions as long as
underlying transactions are supported by valid documentation. However, it remains unclear
whether Iraq maintains exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction as the review of
exchange regulations by staff is ongoing. As part of this review, the authorities have
submitted exchange regulations and recently provided clarifications requested by staff.
38.
The CBI’s external audit firm, Ernst and Young (E&Y), has issued in July an
interim audit report of the CBI 2006 financial statements summarizing control
weaknesses and recommending remedial measures (SMEFP-3,¶19). The CBI has
indicated its commitment to addressing all of E&Y’s audit observations during the course of
this year, so that improvements as far as possible would be reflected in the 2007 financial
accounts.
39.
The CBI has made some progress in addressing the concerns raised by staff and
E&Y in the interim safeguards assessment report (ISAR) and the audit of 2005 CBI
financial accounts (SMEFP-3,¶20). The CBI Board has adopted a timetable that envisages
full implementation of International Financial Reporting System (IFRS) as the CBI’s
financial reporting framework by end-2009, and the capital of the CBI was increased to the
statutory level of ID 100 billion in February 2007. Furthermore, the CBI indicated to staff
that work is underway in addressing the lack of proper accounting records maintained by the
CBI, and in establishing adequate control procedures for reserves management.
D. Financial Sector Reform
40.
The authorities indicated that they continue to expand the coverage of the new
payment system (SMEFP-3,¶21). The CBI will continue to encourage banks to connect to
the real time gross settlement payment system and the automated clearing house, and
expected to cover most banks by end-2007.
41.

the CBI and the ministry of finance for the restructuring of the two largest state-owned

18

Box 4. Banking Sector
Iraq’s banking sector comprises seven state-owned banks (SOBs) and 22 private banks as of end2006. Their consolidated assets totaled about $26 billion (or 51 percent of GDP). The SOBs account for
90 percent of the banking sector total assets (70 percent for Rafidain and Rasheed banks alone). The
credit culture is poor with very little extension of credit to the private sector and an asset composition
heavily tilted toward government securities. Very few banks offer loans with more than one year
maturity as most banks lack the expertise to offer appropriate credit facilities or assess risks.
Financial intermediation in Iraq is weak. The total loans portfolio of the banks was only $2.2 billion
(4 percent of GDP) at end-2006, mostly in the form of overdrafts, despite the fact that credit to the
private sector more than doubled in 2006. Total deposits in the banking sector were $12.9 billion
(26 percent of GDP). Compared to some other countries in the region the deposit base and loan portfolio
of Iraqi banks is small.

improved over the past two years, including as a result of the technical assistance provided by the
Fund, which has encouraged the CBI to move from a rule-based to a risk-based system.

banks are being implemented (SMEFP-3,¶22). As a first step, an international auditor has
been selected to conduct operational and financial audits of both banks that are expected to
be completed by early 2008. The restructuring of the remaining state-owned banks will be
initiated later this year, in line with the approach adopted with Rasheed and Rafidain banks.
42.
The CBI issued implementing regulations for the 2004 Anti- Money Laundering
(AML) law in September 2006. A new AML office was set up within the CBI to implement
these new regulations.

19
E. Other Structural Issues
43.
Negotiations on a new legal framework for the oil sector are ongoing (SMEFP-3,
¶23). The authorities emphasized their commitment to develop a competitive and transparent
hydrocarbon sector. The envisaged legal framework is provided by four draft laws, which in
addition to the draft hydrocarbon law, include three accompanying draft laws pertaining to
reestablishing the Iraq National Oil Company, reorganizing the ministry of oil, and setting
the parameters for revenue distribution and intragovernmental fiscal relations.
44.
The authorities attached great importance to enhancing transparency and
fighting corruption in the oil sector (SMEFP-3,¶24). Oil meters at the Basra export
terminal have become operational for the most part. However, the work on the
implementation of a comprehensive country-wide metering system is still underway. The
authorities intend to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. As a first step, the
ministry of oil will start, during the second half of the year, to publish oil-related data on its
website.
45.
The authorities are in the process of rehabilitating commercially viable stateowned enterprises (SMEFP-3,¶25). They indicated that so far about 21 public enterprises
have been selected, notably in the cement, textile, pharmaceutical, and petrochemical sectors.
These enterprises have submitted a business plan to Rasheed and Rafidain banks to obtain
financing for starting operations.
46.
The new investment law still needs an operational framework (SMEFP-3,¶26 and
Box 5). The authorities indicated that they are working to set up the National Investment
Commission, which would develop and monitor the implementation of investment policies
and regulations to attract investments. They are also seeking to establish national and
regional one-stop agencies that would be in charge of issuing investment licenses.

Box 5. The New Investment Law
In November 2006, the Presidential Council issued a new investment law, which covers all areas of investment
except those in banking, insurance, and the extraction and production of oil and gas, which are covered by
separate laws. The new law promotes equal treatment for investors regardless of nationality and stipulates the
establishment of national and regional investment commissions. The commissions will develop and monitor the
implementation of investment policies and regulations, and establish one-stop agencies at the national and
regional levels to approve investments. The law also specifies the rights (e.g., leasing the land up to 50 years
renewable), benefits, and obligations for investors.
The new investment law provides various tax holidays to promote investment. For example, an investment
project may be exempted from taxes for a period of 10 years after the commercial operation starts. Also,
imported assets for the project would be exempted from customs duties, provided that they are brought into Iraq
within three years from the date of granting the investment license.

20
47.
Iraq continues to maintain an open trade regime and has made significant
progress in the process of WTO accession. The authorities intended to maintain the
5 percent custom duty (reconstruction levy) on imports, while reducing its numerous
exemptions. However, the security situation and capacity constraints have hampered
effective customs administration. The Working Party on Iraq’s WTO accession met for the
first time in Geneva in May 2007, and started the process of accession negotiations.
Subsequently, the Iraqi delegation met bilaterally with representatives of more than ten WTO
members, and has been invited to submit initial offers to advance their market access
negotiations on goods and services.
48.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to resolving the remaining external
claims (SMEFP-3,¶28). Official contacts have been established with key creditor countries in
the Gulf region and China, and the process of debt negotiation and reconciliation is ongoing.
The authorities hoped that the SPV for debt securitization would facilitate the negotiations
with other official creditors. They also expected that the liquidation of the London branch of
Rafidain Bank could be completed by end-2007, enabling them to complete the resolution of
all private claims.
V. PROGRAM MONITORING AND FINANCING ASSURANCES
49.
All quantitative performance criteria set for end-March 2007 were met, but
there have been slippages in structural conditionality (Tables 7 and 8). The measures set
as structural performance criteria for end-May and end-June are expected to be implemented
partially or with delay. As a result, waivers are sought for the following performance criteria
(LOI, ¶4):
•

The audit of CBI net international reserves data was completed on time but the
interim audit report of the CBI 2006 financial accounts has been delayed and was
completed on July 15.

•

The adoption of a fully detailed budget classification and chart of accounts in line
with the IMF’s GFSM 2001 within a cash accounting framework is expected shortly.7

•

The census of public service employees, while in progress, was not completed by
end-June as planned. This is mainly due to the prevailing security situation, and the
fact that it is linked to the preparation for setting up a computerized payroll.

50.
The authorities have requested an extension of the SBA until December 28, 2007,
in order to keep a policy framework in place during the discussions for a successor
arrangement they intend to seek (LOI, ¶3). The authorities have also requested a waiver of
7

Progress was hampered by the kidnapping of an external consultant in May.

21
applicability for all the end-June quantitative performance criteria. Data to verify
performance against these targets will not be available by the time of the Board discussion
(scheduled for August 1).
51.
The program will continue to be monitored through quantitative and structural
performance criteria. In light of the authorities’ request to extend the SBA by three months
to December 2007, they requested the establishment of the quantitative performance criteria
proposed in the SMEFP-3 for end-September. The authorities requested that the structural
performance criterion on completion of the census of all public service employees be
redefined and rescheduled to completion of the data collection for the census of all public
service employees by end-November 2007. They also requested that the penultimate
purchase linked to the fifth review and the last purchase available upon observance of the
end-June 2007 performance criteria be rephased, while leaving total access under the
arrangement unchanged (Table 10). In case there remain arrears to private creditors by the
end of the program period, a financing assurances review will be undertaken.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
52.
Iraq’s economic situation in recent years has been very difficult because of the
unsettled political situation and the deterioration in security in 2006. Reconstruction and
investment have proceeded at a slow pace, thereby keeping oil production low and
hampering economic growth. Shortages of key commodities have contributed to sharply
rising inflation in 2006.
53.
Under these circumstances, staff commends the authorities for having
strengthened their economic policies and for having made progress in structural
reforms. In particular, the authorities have successfully intensified their policy response to
bring the dangerously high inflation on a downward path, and have increased fuel prices to
regional levels. Steps have also been taken to increase public investment, which is key to
boosting growth and generating sufficient revenues to maintain fiscal sustainability. Despite
delays caused by the lack of security and serious capacity constraints, structural reforms
continued.
54.
The main economic challenges facing the Iraqi authorities are to increase
economic growth and further reduce inflation. This requires: (i) taking measures to speed
up reconstruction and increase investment, especially in the oil sector; (ii) continuing
macroeconomic policies to bring inflation further down; and (iii) pressing ahead with priority
structural reforms.
55.
Much remains to be done to advance the reconstruction of Iraq’s economy over
the medium term. Rebuilding infrastructure and reversing the decline in living conditions
will depend critically on progress in establishing a broad-based political consensus and
especially on improving security. Implementation of the investment program will also require

22
judicious management of the country’s available resources by ensuring that these are used for
priority investment projects and by containing current spending.
56.
It is extremely important that the authorities succeed in increasing investment in
the oil sector. This will depend critically on improving security. The staff believes that a
gradual expansion of crude oil production is achievable, provided the protection of oil
installations is reinforced and the envisaged investments in the sector are effectively realized.
In this regard, staff welcomes the measures taken by the government to increase the
implementation rate of its investment program, and urges it to take additional measures if
needed.
57.
On this basis, and given the current favorable world oil price projections, the
medium-term outlook for Iraq is promising. However, since available resources (mainly
expected oil revenues, domestic revenues, assets held in the Development Fund for Iraq, and
some remaining external grants) will be limited in the next few years, fiscal prudence is of
utmost importance. This is essential, as there are significant downside risks, including from
volatile world oil prices, and the political and security situation.
58.
Staff welcomes the government’s commitment to keep current spending in 2007
within the budget limits and seek to maintain fiscal sustainability over the medium
term. This will require resisting undue spending pressures and strictly containing the wage
bill, pensions, and transfers. It remains crucial that the pension law amendments be enacted
soon to ensure the long-run fiscal sustainability of the pension system. Staff welcomes the
recent increase in official fuel prices, which will enable the government to continue avoiding
direct subsidies on fuel products, except for kerosene. The expansion of the new social safety
net and ongoing rationalization of the Public Distribution System are also encouraging.
59.
Staff supports the decision of the CBI to continue allowing the gradual
appreciation of the dinar through end-2007. This policy should contribute to reducing
inflation and dollarization, and help correct for any modest undervaluation of the exchange
rate in light of Iraq’s favorable terms of trade. However, data and analytical limitations
prevent confident estimation of the equilibrium real exchange rate in Iraq. The CBI should
keep a close watch on inflationary developments, and be ready to increase the pace of
appreciation and tighten monetary conditions further if inflation deviates from its downward
path and dollarization is not reduced as expected. The government can further assist the fight
against inflation by restraining public spending pressures on the small non-oil economy and
by stepping up its efforts to reduce shortages, notably by supporting private sector fuel
imports.
60.
Concerted efforts are needed to implement priority structural reforms as
expeditiously as circumstances permit. Following the modernization of the chart of
accounts and budget classification, the authorities should broaden the coverage of the FMIS.
Staff encourages the authorities to modernize and streamline the tax system with a view to

23
expanding the tax base and improving incentives for economic activity. It is also important to
press ahead with the restructuring of the banking system, in order to enhance the banks’ role
in financing new investments. The efforts to rehabilitate viable public enterprises on a
commercial basis are welcome; however, any government financial support should be
efficient and fully reflected in the budget. In view of Iraq’s large investment needs to
increase oil production, a new legislative framework for the hydrocarbon sector should be put
in place as soon as possible.
61.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to maintain open trade and investment
regimes, and supports their efforts to secure WTO accession. While keeping the present
low import tariff (reconstruction levy), it is important to increase revenues by scaling down
exemptions and strengthening the customs administration. The new investment law provides
an important framework to attract much-needed foreign investment, although the numerous
tax holidays seem excessive. Staff encourages the authorities to establish the National
Investment Commission as soon as possible.
62.
Staff also welcomes the authorities’ intention to establish a liberal exchange
regime and is in the process of examining additional information provided by the authorities
to determine whether or not any exchange restrictions exist that might fall under Fund
jurisdiction. Staff urges the authorities to remove any such restrictions, and encourages them
to subsequently accept the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4.
63.
Staff urges the authorities to improve the transparency and accountability of
public financial management and step up their fight against corruption, which hurts the
economy and undermines the credibility of their reform program. Staff underscores the need
to put in place a comprehensive oil metering system and encourages the authorities to follow
up on their intention to join the EITI.
64.
Staff welcomes the steps taken in the central bank safeguards area and urges the
CBI to address all recommendations of the ISAR and the interim audit report on its
2006 financial statements. Satisfactory progress in this area will be important in securing a
successor arrangement.
65.
Staff urges the authorities to continue their efforts to conclude debt agreements
with the remaining official and private creditors. However, despite good faith efforts by
the authorities, the process of resolving Iraq’s debt to non-Paris Club official creditors
remains slow.
66.
Staff underscores the importance of further improving the statistical database,
notably as regards real sector data, the balance of payments, and public finances.
67.
Staff recommends that the fifth review under the SBA be completed. In view of
the authorities’ commitment to the program, and the policies and measures described in the
third SMEFP, staff supports the authorities’ request for: (i) a waiver of applicability of end-

24
June quantitative performance criteria; (ii) waivers for the nonobservance of the end-May
and end-June structural performance criteria; (iii) an extension of the SBA through
December 28, 2007, and the rephasing of purchases under the SBA; (iv) the establishment of
quantitative performance criteria for end-September 2007; and (v) the setting of a new
structural performance criterion (relating to the census of public sector employees) for endNovember 2007.
68.
Staff supports the completion of the financing assurances review. Staff believes
that Iraq is making best efforts to reach bilateral agreements on its arrears to official nonParis Club creditors and that the authorities have been negotiating in good faith to resolve the
remaining arrears to private creditors, consistent with the Fund’s policy on lending into
arrears.
69.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held according to the provisions
applying to countries with Fund arrangements.

APPENDIX I: IRAQ—EXTERNAL DEBT OUTLOOK
1.
Iraq has received substantial debt reduction from official and private creditors, but the
amount of external debt remains large. By assuming that debt reduction comparable to the
Paris Club agreement is applied to non-Paris Club creditor’s claims, the latest estimates of
external debt indicate that the stock of debt was $69 billion (220 percent of GDP) at end2005 and $55 billion (111 percent of GDP) at end-2006. Without the third stage of debt
reduction, external debt would increase to about $62 billion (about 55 percent of GDP) by
2012. The third stage reduction (expected in 2008) would further reduce Iraq’s external debt
to about $36 billion (32 percent of GDP) by 2012 (Appendix, Table 1).1 The medium term
projections assume that new debt disbursement is mostly from multilateral creditors and
Japan.
2.
Under the program scenario, Iraq’s external debt remains vulnerable to a negative oil
shock, particularly when Iraq will start repaying the debt to official creditors. Based on the
Paris Club agreement in 2004, the repayment of the remaining debt stock would start in
2011; the interest payments accrued during 2005–10 are mostly capitalized. The debt service
would be relatively small until 2010 before it increases to about 10 percent of exports in
2011. Simulations for two oil shocks (a production shock that keeps oil production constant
at 2.0 mbpd in 2007–08 followed by a gradual production increase of 0.2 mbpd per year, and
a price shock that lowers the oil export price by $4.5 per barrel (equivalent to one standard
deviation) during 2008–12) show that Iraq would require significant borrowing from
international markets to close the financing gaps (Appendix, Table 2).

1

The third stage of debt reduction would be contingent on Iraq completing the final review of the third year of
upper credit tranche arrangements with the Fund.

1/ The assumptions made in this table are for purposes of illustration and discussion only. While the process of Iraq’s debt reconciliation
is ongoing, the IMF has had to base its analysis on information that may include as yet unreconciled data. Such use of data by the IMF does not
amount to a recognition or denial of any particular claims. The estimates of the debt stock may differ from those in the IMF Country Report No. 07/115 to
incorporate the latest results of debt reconciliation and settlement.
2/ Assumes debt reduction comparable to the Paris Club agreement in 2004.
3/ Assumes that by end 2007 all debt to private creditors would be settled by debt and cash exchanges.
4/ Includes new debt and arrears related to fuel imports from Turkey in 2006. The projections assume that new debt disbursement is mostly
from multilateral creditors and Japan.
5/ Debt service is actual amount paid, including repayment of arrears to Turkey.
6/ Assumes precautionary SBA during 2005–08.

ATTACHMENT I
Baghdad, July 17, 2007
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
The Executive Board of the IMF approved a request for a Stand-By Arrangement
(SBA) for Iraq on December 23, 2005. The first and second reviews under the SBA were
completed on August 2, 2006, and the third and fourth reviews were completed on March 12,
2007. To allow more time to reach the objectives and complete the reforms under the SBA,
the period of the arrangement was extended to September 28, 2007.
2.
Despite the implementation of a new security plan in recent months, the security
situation remains difficult. Nevertheless, we managed to make further progress in
implementing our economic program supported by the SBA. Inflation, which rose to
worrisome heights in 2006, has started to abate but additional actions are needed to bring it
down further as described in the attached third Supplementary Memorandum of Economic
and Financial Policies (SMEFP).
3.
In order to keep a policy framework in place during discussions for an envisaged
successor arrangement, we request an extension of the current SBA by three months to
December 28, 2007. Completion of the final review of three years of implementation of
upper credit tranche Fund arrangements by end-December 2008, will allow us to benefit from
the last stage of the 2004 Paris Club debt reduction agreement. We intend to continue to treat
the SBA as precautionary (i.e., we do not intend to make the purchases under the SBA that
will become available after observance of its performance criteria and completion of the fifth
review).
4.
Iraq has met all quantitative performance criteria set for end-March 2007. The
structural performance criterion on completion by May 31, 2007 of an audit of the net
international reserves of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) was met, and the interim audit report
of the CBI 2006 financial accounts was completed on July 15. The structural performance
criterion for end-June, 2007 on adopting a chart of accounts and budget classification in line
with the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manuel 2001, and the structural performance
criterion on completion of a census of all public service employees by end-June 2007 were,
however, missed.

40
5.
On the basis of corrective actions being undertaken as specified in the third SMEFP,
we would like to request waivers for the nonobservance of these performance criteria, and
completion of the fifth review under the SBA. We also request a waiver of applicability of
end-June quantitative performance criteria and establishment of the quantitative performance
criteria proposed in the third SMEFP for end-September 2007, as well as the rescheduling
and redefinition of the missed performance criterion on completion of the census of all public
service employees, as described in the third SMEFP.
6.
In the period ahead, we shall strive to implement our investment program to increase
oil-production, reduce inflation further, maintain a sustainable fiscal stance, and undertake
reforms needed to spur the non-oil economy. We will continue to refrain from explicit
budgetary subsidies on fuel products (except kerosene), as agreed under the program. To this
end, we have raised the domestic prices of regular and blended gasoline and diesel as of July
1, 2007, as specified in the third SMEFP. We are paying special attention to the measures
needed to facilitate private sector imports of gasoline. We will also make every effort to have
the amendments to the pension law, as agreed with Fund staff, passed by the Council of
Representatives as soon as possible.
7.
We believe that the policies and measures set forth in the attached memorandum will
allow achieving the objectives under the SBA. However, we stand ready to take any
additional measures that may be needed to ensure that the program remains on track. We will
consult with Fund staff on adoption of such measures in advance of revisions to the policies
contained in the third SMEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultation.
We will provide the Fund with such information as it requests on policy implementation and
achievement of program objectives. We consent to the publication of this letter, the third
SMEFP, the attached Addendum to the Technical Memorandum of Understanding, and the
staff report on the 2007 Article IV consultation and the fifth review under the SBA.
8.
Finally, we wish to thank the Fund for its support of Iraq’s economic program under
these difficult circumstances. We look forward to continue our engagement with the Fund
through the regular Article IV consultation process and technical assistance. We will also
seek a successor to the present arrangement, for which we intend to initiate negotiations in
the fall, to achieve macro-economic stability, continue our economic reform program, and
reach the third and last stage of the 2004 Paris Club debt reduction agreement.
Sincerely yours,

ATTACHMENT II: IRAQ—THIRD SUPPLEMENTARY MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND
FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2007
July 17, 2007

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum supplements the Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies for 2005–06 (MEFP) and the first and second supplements thereto, annexed to our
letters dated December 6, 2005, July 15, 2006, and February 23, 2007, respectively. It
describes additional economic objectives and policies agreed in the context of the fifth and
final review under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). Policies and unfulfilled commitments
specified in the MEFP and previous supplements continue to be part of the program.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS UNDER THE STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT
2.
Macroeconomic stability came under pressure in 2006 with the pronounced
deterioration in the security situation but decisive policy actions since mid-November have
put inflation on a downward path. The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) has tightened its monetary
policy stance and allowed the exchange rate to appreciate, while the Government of Iraq
(GoI) has kept its spending under control. Also, we have taken measures to reduce fuel
shortages. As a result, annual consumer price inflation has come down to 46 percent in June,
after reaching about 66 percent in January 2007. The core inflation rate (excluding fuel and
transportation) has come down to 19 percent.
3.
Lower-than-expected crude oil production has continued to suppress real GDP
growth. Economic growth is estimated at 6¼ percent in 2006, compared to 10½ percent
projected at the outset of the program. Security, technical, and other difficulties in
undertaking the necessary investments kept average oil output at 2 million barrels per day
(mbpd), below the target of 2.3 mbpd. Although crude oil production recovered in March and
April, it averaged only 1.9 mpbd in the first four months of 2007. Based on indicators for the
production of cement, fertilizer, and electricity the non-oil real GDP growth rate is estimated
at 7½ percent in 2006. Non-oil real GDP growth is expected to continue at a rate of 5 percent
in 2007.
4.
The GoI has run a fiscal surplus through March 2007 because of continued
underspending but budget execution accelerated in April. Oil revenue was broadly on target,
with lower-than-projected production volumes compensated by higher-than-expected prices.
Revenues of oil-related state owned enterprises were in line with full cost recovery of fuel
imports. The mechanism of funding fuel imports through a revolving credit to the Ministry of
Oil (MoO) has worked well, although the disbursement from the Ministry of Finance (MoF)
exceeded the indicative target. The indicative target for kerosene was exceeded by a small
margin. Non-oil revenue was in line with developments in the tax base.

42
5.
The CBI has gradually appreciated the exchange rate to a level of ID 1,250 per dollar
at end-June 2007, a 15 percent appreciation since mid-November 2006. Net international
reserves continued to grow and reached a level of $19.7 billion at end-April 2007. The CBI
also raised its policy interest rate in two steps to 20 percent as of early January this year.
6.
All quantitative performance criteria set for end-March 2007 were met (Table 1). The
structural performance criterion set for end-May on completing a final audit of the CBI net
international reserves as at December 31, 2006, was met and the structural performance
criterion on completing the interim audit report of the CBI 2006 financial accounts was also
met albeit with a delay. However, the structural performance criteria set for end-June 2007
on completion of a census of all public sector service employees (central government and
military), and on adoption of a fully detailed budget classification and chart of accounts in
line with the IMF’s GFSM 2001, within a cash accounting framework, were missed
(Table 2).
III. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES IN 2007
7.
The GoI’s main macroeconomic policy objectives continue to be maintaining fiscal
sustainability, further reducing inflation, and accelerating oil sector and other reforms to
increase economic growth.
8.
In the implementation of the 2007 budget, we are focusing on the need to increase
investment, notably in the oil sector, which is key to achieving our growth objective and
generating sufficient revenues to maintain fiscal sustainability. We have already taken a
number of measures to increase the implementation rate of investment projects. In particular,
the cabinet sub-committee on investment has accelerated the approval of large investment
projects; the procurement period has been reduced from 60-90 days to no more than 30 days;
the thresholds for projects that can be approved at the line-ministry or governorate level has
been raised significantly; and budget allocations are being made available to the line
ministries on a timely basis. In light of the gestation period of new investment projects in the
oil sector and the continued unsettled security situation, however, we expect average crude
oil production in 2007 to increase to 2.1 mbpd.1
9.
The GoI will continue keeping current spending within the 2007 budget limits. To
this end, we will continue resisting undue wage and pension increases and bonuses, and
strictly limit hiring, including in public enterprises, in order to keep the wage bill within the
budgeted amount. Direct subsidies on fuel products will be avoided (except for a small
subsidy for kerosene).
10.
These policies, and taking account of the effect of a further appreciation of the
exchange rate on oil revenues, should keep the overall government budget deficit below
10 percent of GDP. In case of a sizable shortfall of oil revenues or the need to reallocate
capital expenditure, we intend, in consultation with Fund staff, to submit a supplementary
budget to the Council of Representatives (CoR), in order to adjust government spending and
1

Projects in the oil sector include the rehabilitation of 120–150 oil wells in the South.

43
keep the overall deficit in line with the level targeted in the 2007 budget. By the end of 2007,
we aim to hold the equivalent of about ID 6 trillion in assets in the Development Fund for
Iraq (DFI). To keep the option of domestic financing of the deficit open and maintain a
market indicator for interest rates, we will step up the bi-weekly issuance of treasury bills to
ID 150–200 billion.
11.
We are committed to achieving a further reduction of inflation through the
appropriate management of the exchange rate. The CBI will continue to allow the exchange
rate to appreciate gradually in the coming months. We will closely monitor the effect of this
policy on the dollarization of the economy and inflation, and will adjust the pace of
appreciation as needed. While we consider the exchange rate the CBI’s main policy
instrument to bring down inflation, we will also stand ready to further increase the CBI’s
policy interest rate, if the inflationary situation requires this. The government will continue to
support the anti-inflation policies of the CBI by avoiding to put excessive demand pressures
on the economy and by taking further measures to reduce commodity shortages, in particular
of fuel products.
12.
The GoI will take further steps to facilitate private sector imports of petroleum
products. We have issued some 20 licenses to private importers of fuel products and expect
to issue more in the coming months. We will continue to make available to the private sector
storage facilities and pump stations, and will respond promptly to any impediments to the
importation of fuel products by the private sector. While private imports in the Kurdish
region have begun, the security situation in other parts of the country remains a deterrent for
getting the private sector involved in the importation of fuel products.
13.
We have raised the domestic prices of fuel products to eliminate direct budgetary
subsidies, except for a small subsidy on kerosene (Table 3). A further adjustment was made
as of July 1 to bring domestic fuel prices closer to the regional average. By that date, regular
gasoline was priced at ID 400 per liter, blended gasoline at ID 450 per liter, and diesel at
ID 400 per liter. The State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) will continue to use the
revolving credit with a ceiling of ID 400 billion provided by the MoF to finance its imports
of fuel products. The GoI is willing to consider developing a rule–based mechanism for
setting domestic fuel prices in the future. In the coming months we will seek technical
assistance on the design and implementation of such a mechanism.
14.
The GoI is determined to adopt soon a new chart of accounts and budget
classification that is consistent with the Fund’s GFSM 2001, within a cash accounting
framework (structural performance criterion for end-June 2007). The MoF has started using
the Financial Management Information System (FMIS) on a trial basis in January 2007 but
the existing legacy system will continue to be used by spending agencies in parallel for the
time being. The MoF has also adopted a plan to increase coverage of spending units not yet
connected to the FMIS, which is currently being implemented. We are also working on
entering opening balances and budget transfers in the FMIS and are reviewing the accuracy
of the system’s output. In order to supplement the functionality offered by the existing FMIS,
we are in the process of developing user requirements for a purchasing and a budget module.

44
15.
We are actively seeking to have the amendments to the new pension law enacted by
the CoR as soon as possible. The amendments provide for a gradual reduction of replacement
rates to fiscally sustainable levels and zero indexation in 2007, in line with earlier
understanding with Fund staff. An extra-budgetary pension fund will be created, which will
receive all pension contributions but will only pay out to new pensioners, while the budget
will continue to be responsible for paying existing pensioners. These changes allow the
pension outlays to stay within the budgeted envelope for 2007. We are committed to
managing the extrabudgetary fund in a transparent manner, in line with international best
practices, and will seek technical assistance from the IMF and the World Bank in this area.
16.
The census for public sector employees (structural performance criterion for end-June
2007) has not yet been completed. This project turned out more complicated and timeconsuming than initially foreseen as it is linked to the preparations for setting up a
computerized government payroll. Also, the security situation has caused unexpected delays,
in particular by disrupting the operations of the MoF Information Technology Department.
Nevertheless, the preparations for the census have been completed and the census
questionnaires have been sent to most relevant government agencies. We envisage to
complete the data collection phase of the census (i.e., the completed questionnaires have been
received back from the government agencies) by end-November 2007.
17.
We are making progress in implementing the new Social Safety Net. To date more
than 1 million families have been identified and received cash payments (of up to $80 per
month) under the program. This year, we aim to extend coverage to 1.5 million families. We
remain committed to further rationalizing the Public Distribution System and have taken
some measures in that regard. As a start, we have cancelled eligibility for support of some of
the most well-off individuals (ministers, members of the CoR, and others).
18.
We are developing a medium-term tax reform strategy. To this end, we have set up a
Tax Policy Unit at the MoF and we are receiving technical assistance from international
partners, including the IMF. We aim to develop a strategy that will equip Iraq with a tax
system that significantly improves revenue collection while at the same time is conducive for
economic development. Our tax strategy will cover the oil sector, personal and non-oil
corporate income, and consumption taxes, as well as measures to strengthen the tax and
customs administrations. We are considering to introduce a sales-tax as a precursor to a value
added tax.
19.
Ernst and Young (E&Y) has finalized the audit of the net international reserves data
reported to the Fund as of December 31, 2006 (including a full count by the auditor of gold
and foreign exchange holdings at the CBI) on May 20. It has also issued an interim audit
report of the 2006 CBI financial statements in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing on July 15. However, we missed the target date by a few weeks (performance
criterion for end-May 2007). We intend to implement in full all recommendations provided
in the final audit report of the 2006 CBI financial statements during the course of this year.
The capital of the CBI was increased to the statutory level of ID 100 billion in late February
(structural benchmark for end-December 2006).

45
20.
We continue to address key concerns raised in the interim safeguards assessment
report and the management letters from E&Y. The CBI Board recently adopted a timetable
for full implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards as the CBI’s financial
reporting framework by end-2009 (structural benchmark for March 31, 2007). We are also
taking steps to improve the quality of our accounting records and accounting control
procedures, while work is underway to improve foreign reserves management by developing
a foreign reserves management policy and investment guidelines (structural benchmarks for
June 30, 2007).
21.
We continue to make progress in expanding the coverage of the real time gross
settlement payment system and the automated clearing house. Currently 10 commercial
banks’ headquarters and the MoF are connected to the CBI; we expect to cover most banks
by the end of the year.
22.
We have taken important steps towards the restructuring of Rafidain and Rasheed
banks. The memoranda of understanding for operational restructuring of both state-owned
banks, and a financial restructuring of Rasheed bank were approved by the economic
committee of the Council of Ministers in March 2007.2 The setting-up by the CBI of the
secretariat of the Restructuring Oversight Committee has been completed. An international
auditor has been selected in early June to conduct an operational and financial audit of both
banks and will be appointed shortly (structural benchmark for end-April 2007). The audits
will start soon thereafter and are expected to be completed by early 2008. Work has also
begun on the reconciliation of the foreign debt held by both banks and the cleaning up of the
banks’ large suspense accounts. Later this year, we will initiate, in consultation with the IMF
and the World Bank, the restructuring of the other four smaller state-owned banks in line
with the approach adopted with regard to Rasheed and Rafidain banks.
23.
The GoI will continue its efforts towards developing a competitive and transparent
hydrocarbon sector. Draft hydrocarbon legislation will be submitted to the CoR when final
agreement between all concerned parties has been reached, possibly in the next few months.
The envisaged legislative package includes a draft oil and gas law to regulate the sector, a
draft law to reestablish the Iraq National Oil Company, a draft law reorganizing the MoO,
and a draft financial management law on the sharing of oil revenues.
24.
We are committed to step up our efforts to enhancing transparency and fighting
corruption in the oil sector. In this regard, the installation of meters at the Basra export
terminal has been completed. These meters are for the most part operational but some of
them still need to be certified. The comprehensive metering project with Shell and British
Petroleum is underway. We are committed to joining the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative. The MoO will start publishing on its website information on production, export,
and processing of crude oil in the next few months.

2

Financial restructuring (involving a recapitalization) of Rafidain bank will await the settlement of claims
lodged against its London branch.

46
25.
In order to promote economic activity, we have initiated a rehabilitation program for
viable public enterprises, notably in the cement, textile, pharmaceutical, and petrochemical
sectors. As a first step, we have encouraged 21 public enterprises to submit a business plan to
Rasheed and Rafidain banks, in order to obtain financing to restart activities on a purely
commercial basis. Any future government support that may be needed will be modest in size
and for a limited period only; such support will be fully included in the government budget.
26.
In November 2006, a new investment law was adopted that aims to encourage
investment and promote equal treatment for domestic and foreign investors. We are now in
the process of setting up the National Investment Commission that will develop and monitor
the implementation of investment policies and regulations, and establish one-stop agencies at
the national and regional levels to issue investment licenses.
27.
We are committed to preserving open trade policies. We will maintain the 5 percent
import duty (reconstruction levy), while significantly reducing the number of exemptions to
increase customs revenue. In May 2007, the Working Party on Iraq's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) met in Geneva and started the process of accession negotiations.
We will continue our efforts to secure the accession as soon as possible.
28.
We will continue to work toward resolving outstanding external claims. Bilateral
agreements with all Paris Club creditors, except Russia, and with nine non-Paris Club official
creditors have been signed. Official contacts with key creditor countries in the Gulf region
and China have been made, and the technical process of debt reconciliation is ongoing. A
Special Purpose Vehicle has been established to facilitate official creditors desiring to
securitize their claims, while avoiding the emergence of a multiplicity of different
securitizations. Most of the remaining claims of private creditors are in the process of
reconciliation with claims that are being settled as part of the liquidation of the London
branch of Rafidain Bank. We expect the liquidation to be completed by end-2007, enabling
us to complete the resolution of all private claims.
29.
As part of the ongoing review of Iraq’s exchange system by IMF staff, we have
submitted additional exchange regulations and provided requested clarifications. We have
also issued new regulations to apply the Anti Money Laundering (AML) Law and set up a
new AML office within the CBI to implement the regulations.
30.
The newly established Committee of Financial Experts (COFE) is fully operational,
and is expected to continue the work of the International Advisory and Monitoring Board
(IAMB) once it is dissolved. We are closely involving the COFE in the IAMB's regular work
to provide it with relevant training prior to the eventual expiration of the IAMB mandate at
the end of 2007. The mandate for the DFI expires at the end of this year. We hope to extend
the DFI, with help from the international community, for another two years until end-2009.
Meanwhile, the immunity of the DFI accounts held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York has been extended for a year through May 22, 2008.

47
31.
With the help of the international community we have launched an International
Compact for Iraq (ICI) to spearhead a process of comprehensive political, security, and
economic reform. The macroeconomic component of the ICI is consistent with the program
under the SBA.
32.
We appreciate the technical assistance received from the IMF, and hope to continue
receiving such assistance in the areas of bank restructuring, banking supervision, monetary
policy operations, reserves management, development of secondary markets, tax policy, tax
and customs administration reform, public financial management, and statistics. We would
also like to receive Fund technical assistance to implement the safeguards recommendations.
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING
33.
In light of our request to extend the current SBA by three months, we would also like
that the remaining two purchases under the arrangement be rephased accordingly and that the
last purchase will be available upon observance of the end-September 2007 performance
criteria.
34.
Macroeconomic policy performance will continue to be monitored through quarterly
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets. The quantitative performance criteria
under the original program will remain unchanged, and additional performance criteria have
been set for end-September, as specified in Table 1. The missed structural performance
criterion on completion of the census of all public service employees has been rescheduled
and redefined, as specified in Table 2. We remain committed to submitting data to the Fund
within the time lags agreed upon in the MEFP and its supplements.
35.
The Technical Memorandum of Understanding is modified in the manner described
in the attached addendum.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Iraq
On August 1, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Iraq.1
Background
The last Article IV consultation with Iraq was the first one in 25 years and was concluded on
August 1, 2005. A Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) was approved by the Executive Board on
December 23, 2005 in support of an economic program covering through March 22, 2007,
which was later extended through September 28, 2007. The SBA-supported program
underscores the authorities’ commitment to stabilize macro-economic conditions in Iraq, while at
the same time implement structural reforms to pave the way for sustainable economic growth.
Under the program the authorities have taken measures needed to achieve macro-economic
stability. Despite an unsettled political situation, capacity constraints, and the deterioration in
security in 2006, progress has been made in implementing structural reforms, although much
remains to be done.
Economic growth has been slower than expected at the time of the last Article IV consultation,
mainly because the expected expansion of oil production has not materialized. Following a
decline in oil production and real GDP in 2005, economic growth is estimated at 6¼ percent in
2006. Average annual crude oil production has remained at about 2 million barrels per day
since 2004. Annual consumer price inflation increased to almost 65 percent at end-2006 from
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
31½ percent at end-2005 mainly due to supply bottlenecks, in particular of fuel products. Core
inflation (excluding fuel and transportation) remained high at about 32 percent. Following policy
efforts to bring inflation under control and some easing of fuel shortages, inflation has since
then declined to 46 percent in June 2007, and core inflation has decreased to 19 percent.
Since November 2006 the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) has allowed the exchange rate of the Iraqi
dinar to appreciate by 15 percent and raised its policy interest rates in two steps to 20 percent.
In addition to reducing inflation, these policies have also had some success in de-dollarizing the
economy and increasing the demand for dinars. The CBI gross international reserves increased
to $18.7 billion at end-2006 (almost 6 months of import cover).
Following a fiscal surplus of 11 percent of GDP in 2005, the fiscal outturn for 2006 showed a
surplus of almost 12 percent. This outcome is partly the result of underspending on investment
reconstruction projects, including in the oil sector. The surpluses contributed to an accumulation
of balances in the Development Fund of Iraq to a level of $8.6 billion at end-2006.
Progress in implementing the structural reforms has been made. Official fuel prices have been
increased to levels in other oil-exporting countries in the region, and private sector importation
of fuel products has been liberalized. Negotiations on a new legal framework for the oil sector
are ongoing. An interim audit of the CBI’s 2006 financial statements and an audit of its net
international reserves have been finalized. Progress has also been made in developing the
financial system with the introduction of a payments clearing system and a Real Time Gross
Settlement system. The process of restructuring Iraq’s two largest state-owned banks has
started. The Ministry of Finance has adopted a new chart of accounts and budget classification,
but completion of a census of all public service employees has proven more time-consuming
than foreseen and is still underway.
The Paris Club agreed on November 21, 2004 to a debt reduction for Iraq, equivalent to 80
percent in net present value (NPV) terms, to be achieved in three stages. The first and second
stages each comprised a 30 percent debt reduction in NPV terms and went into effect in
November 2004 and in December 2005 (following approval of the SBA), respectively. The final
stage will comprise an additional 20 percent debt reduction, and depends on completion by endDecember 2008 of the final review of the third year of one or more upper credit tranche
arrangements with the Fund. Iraq continues to make progress in resolving debt to official and
private creditors.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the Iraqi authorities for keeping their economic program on track by
strengthening economic policies and making progress in structural reforms, despite an unsettled
political situation and a very difficult security environment. They noted, however, that the
expansion of oil production is lagging, and that inflation, while on a downward path, remains
high, reflecting in large part continued shortages, notably of fuel products. Directors considered
that Iraq’s economic prospects hinge critically on an improvement in the security situation.

3
Directors encouraged the authorities to take measures to speed up reconstruction and increase
investment, especially in the oil sector. To that effect, they welcomed measures adopted by the
authorities to increase the implementation rate of the public investment program, and urged
them to take additional measures, if needed, and to strengthen the protection of oil installations.
Directors commended the government’s commitment to pursue a prudent fiscal policy by
keeping current spending in 2007 within the budget limits and to maintain fiscal sustainability
over the medium term. They supported the authorities’ decision to resist undue spending
pressures and to strictly contain the wage and pension bill, as well as transfers. Directors
encouraged the authorities to enact as soon as possible amendments to the new pension law to
ensure the fiscal sustainability of the pension system.
Directors welcomed the increase in official fuel prices to regional levels. This will enable the
government to continue avoiding direct subsidies on fuel products, except for kerosene. They
were encouraged by the authorities’ intention to consider developing a rule–based mechanism
for setting domestic fuel prices in the future, which would prevent the re-emergence of
budgetary subsidies, help fight corruption, and free up resources for much needed investment
spending.
Directors were encouraged by the reduction in inflation. They generally supported the policy of
the CBI to continue allowing the gradual appreciation of the dinar through end-2007. This would
contribute to further reducing inflation and de-dollarizing the economy. Directors called on the
CBI to stand ready to accelerate the pace of appreciation and tighten monetary conditions
further if inflation deviates from its downward path and dollarization is not reduced as expected.
Key to fighting inflation would be to continue restraining public spending pressures and stepping
up efforts to reduce shortages, especially by actively supporting private sector fuel imports.
Directors stressed the need to implement priority structural reforms as expeditiously as
circumstances permit. They encouraged the authorities to broaden the coverage of the
Financial Management Information System, modernize and streamline the tax system with a
view to expanding the tax base and improving incentives for economic activity, and to press
ahead with the restructuring of the banking system so as to increase financial intermediation,
especially for the private sector. Directors also welcomed the government’s efforts to
rehabilitate viable public enterprises on a commercial basis, while underscoring that any
government financial support should be efficient and fully reflected in the budget.
Directors urged the authorities to improve the transparency and accountability of public financial
management and step up their fight against corruption. They were encouraged by the
authorities’ intention to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and implement a
comprehensive oil metering system as soon as possible.
Directors underscored the need to put in place a new legislative framework for the hydrocarbon
sector as soon as possible, which, along with an improvement in the security situation, would
help strengthen the investment environment to significantly increase oil production.

4
Directors welcomed the steps taken in strengthening financial safeguards at the central bank.
They urged the CBI to step up its efforts to address all the recommendations of the Fund’s
interim safeguards assessment report, as well as the Ernst & Young interim 2006 audit report.
Directors commended the authorities’ intention to maintain an open trade regime. They
supported the authorities’ efforts to secure World Trade Organization accession. While keeping
the present low import tariff, Directors stressed the importance of increasing revenues by
scaling down exemptions and strengthening the customs administration.
Directors commended the authorities for the new investment law, which provides an important
framework for attracting much-needed foreign investment. They encouraged the authorities to
establish the National Investment Commission as soon as possible.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to conclude debt agreements with the remaining
official and private creditors. They urged the government and those official creditors still to
provide debt relief to conclude debt agreements expeditiously.
Directors stressed the critical need to further improve the statistical database.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fifth Review and Review of Financing Assurances
under Iraq's Stand-By Arrangement, and Approves Three-Month Extension of the
Arrangement to December 2007
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the fifth
review of Iraq's performance under its economic program supported by a Stand-By
Arrangement and a financing assurances review under the Arrangement. The Stand-By
Arrangement is being treated as precautionary by the Iraqi authorities, and no purchase is
planned.
The Stand-By Arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 475.36 million (about US727.4
million) was approved on December 23, 2005 (see Press Release No. 05/307). In completing
the review, the Executive Board also approved the authorities' request for a three-month
extension of the Arrangement through December 28, 2007.
The Board also approved the authorities request for the waivers of the non-observance of the
structural performance criteria on the interim audit of the Central Bank of Iraq’s 2006
financial statements, on completing a census of all public service employees (central
government and military), and on the adoption of a fully detailed budget classification and
chart of accounts, and request for waivers of the applicability of the June 30, 2007
quantitative performance criteria under the Arrangement.
The Executive Board also concluded the Article IV Consultation with Iraq.
Following the Executive Board's discussion of Iraq, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Despite a persistently difficult security environment, the Iraqi authorities have taken
important measures to keep their economic program on track. However, the expansion of oil
production is lagging and inflation, while on a downward path, remains high reflecting in
large part shortages associated with the security situation, notably of fuel products. A
turnaround hinges critically on an improvement in the security situation.

2

“Measures to speed up reconstruction and increase investment, especially in the oil sector,
are needed. The measures adopted by the authorities to increase the implementation rate of
the public investment program are encouraging. Enhancing the protection of oil installations
is also important.
“The government is showing a commendable commitment to pursue a prudent fiscal policy,
by keeping current spending in 2007 within the budget limits and by seeking to maintain
fiscal sustainability over the medium term. It remains essential to amend the new pension law
in order to ensure fiscal sustainability of the pension system.
“The recent increase in official fuel prices to regional levels is an important step in the right
direction. The authorities are considering the development of a rule–based mechanism for
setting domestic fuel prices in the future, which should prevent the re-emergence of
budgetary subsidies (except for kerosene), help fight corruption, and free up resources for
much-needed investment spending.
“Inflation has come down, reflecting the appropriate policy actions taken by the Central Bank
of Iraq (CBI). The CBI will need, however, to continue its tight monetary and exchange rate
policies to further reduce inflation and de-dollarize the economy. The government should
also help to fight inflation by restraining public spending pressures and by stepping up efforts
to reduce shortages, notably by actively supporting private sector fuel imports.
“Structural reforms remain the cornerstone of the reconstruction process. However, much
remains to be done and the pace of implementation needs to be stepped up. Key actions
include the broadening of the coverage of the Financial Management Information System,
and modernizing and streamlining the tax system. The government is committed to
restructuring the largest two state-owned banks and to rehabilitate viable public enterprises
on a commercial basis.
“Transparency needs to be enhanced and corruption to be brought under control, in order to
reinforce the credibility of the government’s reform program. In this connection, it is
important to put in place a comprehensive oil metering system as soon as possible.
“Unlocking Iraq’s oil wealth requires advancing the enactment of a new legislative
framework for the hydrocarbon sector, in view of the large investments needed to increase oil
production.
“The CBI has taken steps to strengthen CBI safeguards area. The CBI should continue its
efforts to address all the recommendations of the Fund’s interim safeguard assessment report,
as well as the Ernst & Young interim 2006 audit report.
“Good progress has been made in settling arrears with the remaining official and private
creditors. However, further progress is needed towards resolving non-Paris Club official
claims,” Mr. Kato said.

Statement by A. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Iraq
August 1, 2007

1.
The Iraqi authorities would like to express their deep appreciation for the Fund’s
Executive Board, Management, and Staff, for their ongoing support under difficult
circumstances. They are particularly grateful for staff’s continued contributions to the
formulation of sound economic policies in Iraq. The excellent advice and technical assistance
delivered under the framework of the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) continue to afford a
coherent context for the elaboration of a consistent set of policies, aimed at rebuilding the
foundations for macroeconomic stability and promoting economic development. The
authorities remain strongly committed to the program, whose objectives they view as clearly
beneficial to Iraq.
2.
Improvement on security remains, however, a prerequisite for the ability of the Iraqi
government to effectively implement its policies. The marked deterioration in the security
situation in 2006 has unfortunately undermined the prospects of continued economic
improvement, notably with regard to two fundamental indicators of macroeconomic stability:
growth and inflation. Indeed, the violent conflict severely hampered the implementation of
budgeted investment projects, particularly in the oil sector, thereby slowing down growth.
Moreover, the shortages of key commodities gave rise to the sharp rise in inflation.
3.
Notwithstanding the security situation and severe capacity constraints—exacerbated
by the emigration of professionals and skilled labor—the authorities have achieved major
strides in enhancing their economic policies while advancing their structural agenda. They
have adopted decisive policy measures to bring down inflation and have raised fuel prices to
regional levels. And to the extent possible, they have also introduced vigorous steps to
increase public investment. At the same time, bold measures have been taken to advance
structural reforms in the monetary and fiscal areas, while negotiations on a new legal
framework to develop a competitive and transparent hydrocarbon sector are ongoing. In an
effort to enhance transparency and fight corruption in the oil sector, the authorities are also
committed to joining the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. They have initiated a
rehabilitation program for viable public enterprises and are striving at developing an
operational framework for the recently adopted investment law. Iraq has also made
significant progress in the process of WTO accession. Notwithstanding these favorable
developments, the authorities are well aware of the challenges facing the reconstruction of a
sustainable macroeconomic environment over the medium-term. Accordingly, they stand
ready to take any additional measures that will enhance economic growth prospects and help
in further reducing inflationary pressures.

2

Fiscal Sector Policies and Reforms
4.
Oil production and export volumes in 2006 have been lower than anticipated under
the program, due to the inability to expand capacity. Higher oil prices however more than
compensated for the lower output, resulting in oil revenues slightly above the budgeted
levels, and triggering a slight overperformance in overall revenue. Expenditures, on the other
hand, have been substantially lower than planned, essentially due to much lower than
anticipated investment spending related to the deteriorating security conditions. The fiscal
outturn in 2006 was therefore very strong and contributed to a sharp increase in the
accumulation of foreign exchange resources in the Development Fund for Iraq.
5.
The authorities are aware that medium-term growth prospects hinge on the capacity to
increase investment in infrastructure, notably in the oil sector, which is key to generating
sufficient revenues to maintain fiscal sustainability. The implementation of the 2007 budget
is therefore geared toward the need to increase investment, mainly in the oil sector. The
authorities have also adopted a series of measures to increase the implementation rate of
investment projects, including accelerating the approval of large investment projects and
reducing the procurement period. However, considering the effect of a further dinar
appreciation on oil revenues, the authorities are well aware that they need to further control
current expenditures going forward, to be able to fund the needed infrastructure investments
as well as to follow through on their commitments relating to security and the social sector.
Current spending this year will therefore be kept within the 2007 budget limits, without the
need for a supplementary budget. The authorities will continue resisting undue pressures on
the wage bill.
6.
The government has continued to pursue the process of realigning domestic fuel
prices with regional levels, in line with the program. Except for a small subsidy for kerosene,
direct subsidies on fuel products will therefore be avoided in 2007. At this stage, the
authorities are willing to consider developing a rule–based mechanism for setting domestic
fuel prices in the future, and will seek technical assistance in this regard. The authorities have
also adopted measures to reduce fuel shortages by promoting the implementation of the 2006
law authorizing the private import of petroleum products. Private sector imports have so far
been limited to the Kurdish region due to the security conditions prevailing in the rest of the
country. So far, the authorities have issued about 20 licenses to private importers and will
take further steps to encourage private sector imports, including making storage facilities and
pump stations available to private operators.
7.
Considerable effort is being devoted to advancing fiscal reforms. The government is
making every effort to ensure that amendments to the new pension law are enacted by the
Council of Representatives as soon as possible. The amendments provide for a gradual
reduction of replacement rates to fiscally sustainable levels and zero indexation in 2007, in

3

line with earlier understanding with Fund staff. Envisaged changes would allow the pension
outlays to stay within the budgeted envelope for 2007. The extrabudgetary pension fund will
be managed transparently in line with best practices, and the authorities will seek technical
assistance from the Fund and the World Bank in this respect. Furthermore, the government
has made progress in implementing the new Social Safety Net. More than 1 million poor
families have received in 2006 cash payments under the program, and the coverage is
expected to increase to 1.5 million families this year. At the same time, efforts to rationalize
the Public Distribution System are ongoing, starting with a narrowing of the eligibility
criteria.
8.
A medium-term tax reform strategy aimed at modernizing the tax system to enhance
non-oil revenue collection has been initiated. The authorities are considering introducing a
sales-tax as a precursor to a value added tax, and aim at strengthening the tax and customs
administration. Further efforts to improve public financial management are under way,
including completion of the remaining steps needed to conform the chart of accounts and
budget classification with the GFSM 2001. At the same time, coverage of the recently
operationalized Financial Management Information System is being expanded to new
spending units.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies and Reforms
9.
Decisive and mutually reinforcing policy measures have, since November 2007,
contributed to curbing inflation. The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) has tightened its monetary
stance by raising its policy interest rate in two steps to 20 percent. It has also allowed the
exchange rate to appreciate by some 14 percent. These measures, alongside the increases in
domestic fuel prices, efforts to reduce fuel shortages, and continued fiscal restraint,
succeeded in containing inflationary pressures. Annual consumer price inflation declined to
46 percent in June 2007 after having peaked at about 66 percent in January 2007, while the
annual core inflation rate has dropped to 19 percent in June, compared to 32 percent at end2006. At the same time, cash dollarization declined and the demand for dinars picked-up,
pointing to increased confidence in the monetary stance of the CBI. This is evidenced by the
expansion in the dinar currency in circulation and the noticeable substitution, at the daily
foreign exchange auctions, in favor of transfers within the banking system instead of cash
sales of dollars.

The authorities acknowledge that inflation needs to be further reduced and are
committed to further monetary tightening if needed. However, as discussed at previous
occasions, inflation is essentially supply-driven, as it is intrinsically linked to the security
situation and to the resulting shortage of key commodities. Without a clear improvement on
this front, it would be difficult to see significant progress in disinflation. Nevertheless, to
signal its firm commitment to reducing inflation, the CBI is planning to allow the exchange

rate to gradually appreciate by 1 percent per month until end-2007, while closely monitoring
the effects of this policy. While the exchange rate is the main policy instrument for the CBI
to bring down inflation, it stands ready to consider further increasing the policy interest rate,
if needed.

The CBI continues to address concerns raised in the interim safeguards assessment
report and the 2005 audit of CBI. The CBI Board has recently adopted a timetable for full
implementation of International Financial Reporting System as the CBI’s financial reporting
framework by end-2009. Moreover, the capital of the CBI was increased to the statutory level
of ID 100 billion in February 2007. The CBI is also taking steps to improve the quality of its
accounting records and control procedures, and in establishing adequate control procedures
for reserves management. Important progress was achieved in terms of payment systems
reforms and the CBI is now in the process of expanding the coverage of the real time gross
settlement payment system and the automated clearing house.

The effectiveness of monetary policy in Iraq continues to be hampered by the
weakness of the monetary transmission channels due to an inefficient banking sector. A
restructuring of the sector is therefore a major objective of the authorities and should play an
important role in the development of the Iraqi economy. Important steps have been taken
towards the restructuring of the two largest state-owned banks, Rafidain and Rasheed. The
economic committee of the Council of Ministers approved in March 2007 the memoranda of
understanding for the operational restructuring of both state-owned banks, and a financial
restructuring of Rasheed bank. An international auditor has been selected to conduct these
audits, which are expected to be completed by early 2008. Later this year, the authorities
intend to initiate, in consultation with the IMF and the World Bank, the restructuring of the
other four smaller state-owned banks, in line with the approach adopted with regard to
Rasheed and Rafidain banks.
Debt Restructuring
13.
The authorities are making best efforts in trying to reach agreements with remaining
official creditors, including Gulf countries and China, and the technical process of debt
negotiation and reconciliation is ongoing. A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) has been
established to securitize the debt held by private and public creditors, which would help
create liquidity for Iraqi debt. The authorities hope that the SPV for debt securitization would
facilitate the negotiations with other official creditors. Most of the remaining claims of
private creditors are in the process of reconciliation with claims that are being settled as part
of the liquidation of the London branch of Rafidain Bank. The authorities expect the
liquidation to be completed by end-2007, enabling them to complete the resolution of all
private claims.

Performance Under the SBA
14.
Despite the adverse circumstances, Iraq continues to make clear progress in
implementing the SBA. While the persistently unsettled security situation has caused delays
in the implementation of some structural performance criteria (PC) under the SBA, all
quantitative PCs set for end-March 2007 were met. On the basis of corrective actions being
undertaken as specified in the Supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies (SMEFP) for 2007, the authorities would like to request waivers for the
nonobservance of these performance criteria, and completion of the fifth review under the
SBA. They also request a waiver of applicability of end-June quantitative performance
criteria and establishment of the quantitative performance criteria proposed in the SMEFP for
end-September 2007, as well as the rescheduling and redefinition of the missed performance
criterion on completion of the census of all public service employees, as described in the
SMEFP. In order to ensure continuity in the policy framework during discussions for an
envisaged successor arrangement, they also request an extension of the current SBA by three
months to December 28, 2007. They intend to continue to treat the SBA as precautionary.
The Iraqi authorities remain fully committed to the implementation of the arrangement,
which has served Iraq well, providing cohesion to the policy framework while anchoring and
furthering progress towards macroeconomic stability. Moreover, the SBA-supported program
will continue to provide the macroeconomic framework for the International Compact with
Iraq, which was initiated with the help of the United Nations and formally endorsed by the
international community in May 2007, with an aim at putting in place a medium-term
framework for political, security and economic reforms.
