CYPRUS
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2006 Consultation with Cyprus
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Anthony Boote
January 11, 2007
Executive Summary
Background: The economic outlook is favorable, and euro adoption in 2008 is within Cyprus’s
grasp. Economic growth has rebounded (3½ –4 percent) from a lull in 2002–03. Inflation has
recently receded, reflecting euro appreciation and lower oil prices, but remains the one
Maastricht criterion that requires continued vigilance. The fiscal deficit was cut sharply to
under 2½ percent of GDP in 2005 and an estimated 1.9 percent of GDP in 2006.
Policy issues
•

The key short-term objective is to ensure smooth euro adoption in 2008. The authorities
intend to keep policies aligned with the Maastricht criteria and allay concerns about the
rounding up of prices during conversion. It will be important to keep inflation in check by
encouraging wage moderation and securing greater fiscal consolidation than envisaged in
the 2007 budget.

•

Effecting high-quality fiscal adjustment in the medium term will depend on the ability to
rationalize, prioritize, and control public expenditure, including investment. The authorities
plan to introduce a medium-term budget framework and a proper legal framework and
institutional setting for PPPs, both important steps.

•

Pension reform is urgent and is on the government agenda. Besides raising the retirement
age back to 65, periodic automatic adjustments should be built in to ensure that the system
keeps up with demographic trends. The planned National Health Insurance System will
likely require user fees and means testing to limit potential abuse and cost increases.

•

Supervisors are appropriately closely monitoring credit and house price developments to
contain risks to the financial sector. The supervision of cooperative credit institutions
should be unified with that of commercial banks.

•

Sustaining growth requires further structural reform to safeguard external competitiveness.
The authorities emphasize progress already made and the importance of human capital and
R&D, and stress their commitment to promote domestic competition. The staff supports
these objectives and argues also for a redesigned wage setting mechanism.

I. INTRODUCTION1
1.
As the easternmost country in the EU, Cyprus is well placed to emerge as a
gateway to the East and a hub of business operations in the region. The thriving Cypriot
economy is testimony to the government’s implementation of reforms and pursuit of prudent
policies, in line with Fund advice (text table). The goal of adopting the euro has galvanized
the collective will to place the fiscal accounts on a strong footing and reform the economy.
However, success in the euro area will require safeguarding external competitiveness and
confronting medium-term challenges.
Cyprus: Response to Previous Fund Advice
Policy Area

Staff Recommendation in Previous Article IV Consultations

Fiscal Policy

Pursue fiscal adjustment, including through expenditure
containment; reform health care and pension systems to mitigate the
fiscal impact of demographic transition; adopt an explicit mediumterm fiscal framework.

The fiscal deficit was cut sharply to under 2 percent of GDP in 2006. A
medium-term fiscal framework, shaped by Fund advice, will be fully
implemented in the 2008 budget. Steps have also been taken to address
aging-related expenditure pressures, but further pension reform is needed.

Monitor the financial system's exposure to the real estate market;
ensure effective supervision of the cooperative sector; consolidate
supervisory functions.

The authorities have been monitoring financial market developments closely.
Some financial sector reforms were implemented, including increasing the
capital base of cooperative credit institutions (CCIs). The coordination among
supervisory bodies has been enhanced, but there is room for further
improvement by unifying the supervision of CCIs and commercial banks.

Financial Sector

Reform the wage-setting mechanism to reduce real wage rigidities;
Structural Policies enhance competitivenss, including through corporate governance
reform in public enterprises and privatization

Implementation

Backward-looking wage indexation remains entrenched. By contrast, progress
has been made in liberalizing the air travel, electricity, and
telecommunications sectors, but key product markets are still dominated by
state-owned incumbents.

II. ECONOMIC BACKGROUND

Inflation has slowed. The moderation (to around 2 percent) in 2004−05 was driven
by (i) the waning impact of previous tax rate hikes related to the EU harmonization of
minimum tax rates; (ii) a decline in the excise tax rate on cars in late 2003; (iii) increased
competition in the telecommunications and air transportation sectors; and (iv) on the external
side, euro appreciation. More recently, 12-month HICP inflation increased through the first
seven months of 2006, but then declined rapidly to 1.5 percent in December, reflecting lower
oil prices and euro appreciation. The November 2006 reduction in excise taxes on cars is
expected to exercise further moderating influence.
2

Still, these remain high and averaged about 4 percent in 2004–06. See Michael and others (2005) for an
assessment of the impact of foreign workers on wages.

The fiscal deficit was cut in half to under 2½ percent of GDP in 2003–05 (Table 3
and Figure 2). As a result, in July 2006, Cyprus became the first new EU member to have its
excessive deficit procedure abrogated. Data through September 2006 suggest that the deficit
was on track to fall under 2 percent of GDP

contributed to future tax base widening. Fiscal
adjustment also benefited from tight expenditure control, which has combined moderation in
public sector wage increases with ceilings on the growth of public consumption and
investment expenditures.
6.
Rising energy costs (text table) and robust domestic demand have led to a
widening of the current account deficit in 2004–06, to over 6 percent of GDP (Figure 3
Cyprus: Impact of Oil Prices on the Current Account Balance, 2004–06

and recorded robust growth
in 2005-06. Pressure on export margins continued (text table), though less so than earlier in
the decade. Recent declines in competitiveness—as the real exchange rate has appreciated—
have contributed to the decline in the export market share of goods, but services exports have
held their ground (Figure 4). The surplus in the services balance (as a share of GDP) was
little changed in 2004–06, as a sluggish tourism sector was offset by some improvement in
the nontourism services balance.

Subsequently, preliminary data in mid-December suggested that the fiscal deficit could decline further. Staff
will review these data and a supplement to the staff report will be issued as needed.

Despite all parties’ stated interest, a solution to the Cyprus problem remains
elusive. A divided Cyprus entered the EU in 2004 after the failure of the “Annan Plan” for
reunification. Following a two-year hiatus in face-to-face talks, the leaders of the Greek
Cypriot (G/C) and Turkish Cypriot (T/C) communities agreed in July 2006 to hold “technical
discussions.” These talks were intended to improve the day-to-day lives of all Cypriots, build
mutual confidence, and prepare for a comprehensive political settlement of the Cyprus
problem, but they have yet to bear fruit. In this difficult setting, staff has not been in a
position to deliver nonfinancial Fund assistance, such as TA, to the T/C community, as
suggested by Directors in concluding the 2004 Article IV consultation.

These data do not account for intra-island differences in purchasing power and possibly a sizable informal
sector in the areas not under the effective control of the government.

8
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Cyprus continues to converge to euro area income levels and, by vigorously tackling fiscal
imbalances, stands on the doorstep of EMU. The key objective now is to ensure that euro
adoption proceeds smoothly, which requires maintaining low inflation and safeguarding
fiscal consolidation. Besides addressing the fiscal costs of aging and other medium-term
risks to the budget, sustaining economic growth and competitiveness requires continued
efforts to strengthen the financial sector and implement structural reforms.

energy-related cost pressures, while the reduction in
excise duties for cars would also hold down inflation
in 2007, although it would have a smaller effect than the 2003 tax cuts and would be partially
offset by the need to align VAT rates with EU directives.
10.
Risks to this outlook appear balanced. Declining oil prices were seen as boosting
economic activity. The opening of Turkish ports to Cypriot vessels (text table), the prospects
of which remain uncertain, could provide a further

Subsequent to the discussions, the EU partially suspended EU accession negotiations with Turkey in response

Cyprus, the island remained exposed to regional geopolitical tensions.
B. Adopting the Euro
11.
Cyprus is well placed to benefit from euro adoption. The economy already
benefited from lower interest rates and the removal of barriers to the free flow of goods and
services, capital, and labor; the introduction of the euro would provide additional benefits by
further reducing transaction costs and, possibly, long-run interest rates.
The economy is becoming more integrated with the EU.

The authorities aim to enter the euro area on January 1, 2008 and plan to submit
their euro-adoption petition in early 2007. The recent track record of delivering on the
fiscal front, as well as broad compliance with Maastricht criteria in 2005 (text table) helped
reduce uncertainty about the timing of euro adoption (Figure 5). The authorities expect
Cyprus to be assessed against the Maastricht criteria in the first half of 2007, and, subject to a
positive assessment, the Cypriot pound exchange rate would be locked in as of mid-2007,
with the lock-in rate being determined in line with the relevant Treaty provisions.

The authorities pointed to various studies suggesting that the exchange rate was
broadly in line with its equilibrium level.7 Mindful of uncertainties in estimating the
equilibrium real exchange rate, the mission agreed that the exchange rate appeared to be
broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 1). However, it underscored the need to enhance
productivity since there was little scope for any further loss of external competitiveness, and
given that any such losses would be particularly difficult to recoup once in the euro zone.
Also, staff’s external debt sustainability analysis suggests that the current account deficit in
the baseline scenario (based essentially on the authorities’ Convergence Program) needs to be
narrowed substantially to stabilize the external debt position (Table 5).
14.
The key short-term policy priority is therefore to ensure a smooth changeover to
the euro. A number of committees devoted to the task have been established, and draft laws
to reform the institutional framework for monetary policy are expected to be adopted in
early 2007. The mission supported the authorities’ euro adoption plan, but noted the need to
contain inflationary pressures and assuage the public’s concern that prices might be rounded
up when converted into euros. In welcoming the planned dual display of prices, it noted that
vigorous domestic competition would be the most effective way to discipline retailers.
Furthermore, to ensure that inflation remained in check, the mission called for continued
wage moderation and faster fiscal consolidation than envisaged by the authorities.

Box 1. External Competitiveness
The Cypriot economy has coped well with declines in price and cost competitiveness since the early 1990s.
Aside from the 2002-03 slump, economic growth has been robust, labor markets operate close to full employment,
and strong FDI inflows indicate profitable business opportunities.
In part, this reflects the fact that the recent appreciation in the REER reversed earlier gains. Moreover, the
rate of appreciation appears to be moderating. The ULC-based REER
130
130
suggests more appreciation, owing to strong real wage increases

Estimates of the equilibrium exchange rate for the Cyprus pound
suggest that the REER is broadly in line with its equilibrium
level. Pattichis and others (2005) estimated that the Cyprus pound’s
exchange rate was slightly undervalued relative to its equilibrium rate
in 2000. Since then, the REER of the pound has appreciated by about
15 percent. However, some of this appreciation reflects income
convergence with the euro area, including Balassa-Samuelson effects,
and exchange rate movements of the euro against other currencies.
Kyriacou and Papageorgiou (2005) also concluded that the pound
was in line with economic fundamentals in 2004.

In terms of business competitiveness, Cyprus compares favorably to most new member countries, but not with
the rest of Europe (Figure 6).

C. Safeguarding Fiscal Consolidation
15.
The 2007 budget targets a further reduction in the fiscal deficit (to 1.6 percent of
GDP), though at a slower pace than recently. The authorities noted that, in a break with
the past, the budget was free of one-off measures and focused on current expenditure
adjustment. On the meager increase in the primary surplus, they noted that cost containment
efforts would be partially offset by an increase in (other) transfers, primarily of a social
nature. They also noted the need to offset the net effect on the budget of the termination of
EU budgetary transfers amounting to 0.4 percent of GDP from 2007 onward. The mission
stressed that more consolidation than foreseen in the budget was essential to safeguard the
moderation of inflation, and that this could be achieved by avoiding supplementary budgets
(rigorously applying the provision on this in the 2007 budget) and strengthening expenditure
control mechanisms to observe budget limits.

16.
The Convergence Program (CP) targets fiscal balance by 2010. The bulk of this
adjustment is planned to result from reductions in current spending associated with
expenditure containment measures already in place (text table). The CP envisages lowering
the public debt to 46 percent of GDP by 2010; the staff’s debt sustainability analysis suggests
that debt projections are sensitive to certain shocks (Table 7 and Figure 7). The mission
supported the authorities’ medium-term fiscal consolidation plan, and stressed the
importance of reining in current expenditures as a means to high-quality adjustment.
17.
The authorities are phasing in a medium-term budget framework (MTBF).
Some elements were already included in the 2007 budget, notably the submission of 2007–09
budgets for line ministries and the prohibition of supplementary budgets, except in a national
emergency. The MTBF, envisaged to be fully operational for the 2008 budget, will include a
rolling three-year horizon and an institutional framework—shaped by advice from the Fund’s
Fiscal Affairs Department earlier in 2006—linking the medium-term targets to the annual
budgetary process. The MTBF would establish expenditure ceilings for line ministries, and
the National Lisbon Program (NLP) would govern the final allocation of expenditures,
including the investment budget.
18.
The authorities have halted an ambitious public investment plan, envisaged to be
carried out as a public-private partnership (PPP). With the exception of a few projects
already underway, all new projects in the public investment pipeline were recently suspended
(text table). The authorities noted that time was needed to introduce a proper legal framework

13
for PPPs and the associated institutional reforms, including a gateway process (Table 6) and
the creation of a dedicated PPP unit responsible for ex ante cost-benefit analyses and valuefor-money assessments. Besides

The fiscal consequences of aging are the main
threat to the long-run sustainability of fiscal accounts.
Gains in life expectancy and declines in fertility will give
rise to an aging population (Figure 8). As the dependency
ratio increases, public pension spending is projected to
rise nearly 13 percent of GDP by 2050 (text table). In the
absence of pension reform or complementary fiscal
measures, the consequence would be an explosive
increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio.8

Long-run debt will explode.

20.
The authorities are formulating a two-staged strategy to meet this challenge. The
first wave of reforms includes tightening pension eligibility requirements—including those
for a pension at age 63—increasing social security contributions, and reducing the
supplementary pension relative to the basic pension. The second wave would further increase
contribution rates and introduce additional parametric reforms.
21.
The mission stressed that, given the magnitude of the challenge, there was no
alternative to deeper reforms of the social security system. Specifically, it called for:
•

Raising the effective retirement age back to 65 years for all employees.9 Early
retirement should be addressed in an actuarially neutral manner, with only limited
exceptions made for particularly strenuous occupations.

•

Switching the indexation of all benefits to consumer prices from wages, which would
contain pension expenditures; the authorities expressed concern, however, that it
would increase poverty among pensioners.

•

Introducing an explicit mechanism of periodic adjustments in the retirement age
and/or pension benefits to automatically ensure the sustainability of the system in
light of demographic changes.

The mission also noted the need to improve the alignment of pension benefits in the public
sector with those in the private sector; staff estimates the former to be about 80 percent
higher in net present value terms.

The share of nonperforming loans (NPLs) is declining but remains high by
international standards (Table 9 and Figure 9). The authorities attributed the high stock of
bad debt to the drawn-out legal foreclosure process, typically lasting some ten years, and
noted that, had there been a more rapid write-off of loans already provisioned for, the ratio of
NPLs would have dropped substantially. They agreed that modernizing the foreclosure
process, as envisaged in legislation already submitted to parliament, is critical. The mission
also argued for more rapid write off by commercial banks, but the authorities noted that, in
practice, write offs were uncollectible, despite a formal legal claim.
26.
Financial sector supervision has improved significantly, but challenges remain.
Commercial banks, cooperative credit institutions, stock markets, and insurance companies
are supervised by four distinct entities. The authorities noted the progress made in improving
the coordination among supervisors, and concurred that there was further scope to take
advantage of economies of scale. The Fund’s Assessment of Financial Sector Supervision
Report (AFSSR) found that, although supervision and regulation in the commercial banking
sector were strong and complied with international standards, the supervision of cooperative
credit institutions and of the insurance market needed to be strengthened.10 The authorities
explained that the identified shortcomings were being addressed (Table 10), but
acknowledged that weaknesses remained in the insurance-market supervision, where severe
resource constraints had virtually ruled out on-site inspections. The mission stressed that it
was key to ensure that supervisors had clear objectives and responsibilities, operational
independence, and adequate resources. The authorities intended to promptly address the
resource deficiency in insurance supervision and complete an FSAP in time for the next
Article IV consultation.

implementation would be strengthened by a

However, several long-standing rigidities remain. In particular, the mission
reiterated its concerns in the following areas:
•

Widespread backward-looking COLAs and seniority-based rules governing salary
increases in the public sector have introduced real-wage rigidities and increased
wages beyond productivity gains. While staff argued that eliminating these would be
preferable, removing energy costs and changes in VAT from the COLA adjustment
would partially remove this rigidity. The authorities acknowledged the limitations of
COLAs, but noted that real wage increases had moderated recently. They also argued
that COLAs had helped smooth labor relations.

•

and energy, although some progress has been made in opening these sectors

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL

29.
Substantial progress in addressing macroeconomic imbalances and reforming
the economy has placed Cyprus at the doorstep of EMU. The economic outlook is strong:
economic growth is picking up and continues to outstrip that of the EU; inflation, while
bearing watching, is receding with lower oil prices and a strong euro; fiscal consolidation is
poised to continue; and the real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
30.
Ensuring continued observance of the Maastricht criteria and a smooth adoption
of the euro will lay the groundwork for continued growth. Cyprus is well placed to
benefit from euro adoption as planned in 2008. Adopting the euro can augment the benefits
of EU membership by lowering transaction costs and stimulating investment through lower
long-run interest rates. Macroeconomic policies should continue to be directed to ensure

18
observance of the Maastricht criteria, especially with regard to inflation, via fiscal and wage
restraint. Moreover, there is a need to allay the public’s apprehension regarding the potential
for abuse in converting prices into euros. The planned dual display of prices should be
complemented by policies fostering vigorous domestic competition to curb potential abuses.
31.
Spending limits in the 2007 budget need to be strictly observed, and higher-thanexpected revenues should be saved. Stronger adjustment in 2007 is needed to safeguard
against a reemergence of inflation and represent a strong step toward medium-term
consolidation. The intention to balance the budget in 2010 is appropriate; adjustment should
focus on high-quality fiscal measures, in particular by keeping current expenditures in check.
In this connection, the ban on supplementary budgets should be strictly observed.
32.
The planned Medium Term Budget Framework will provide the institutional
arrangements needed to rationalize, prioritize, and control public expenditure. The
implementation of the MTBF is welcome, especially as it is a key element of a broader
reform to strengthen financial management, including that of public investment. In this
regard, the suspension of the ambitious pipeline of public investment is appropriate, until a
proper legal framework and institutional setting for PPPs are in place. It is critical that costbenefit analysis guide project selection, and that value-for-money considerations determine
how projects will be procured.
33.
In the long run, fiscal sustainability hinges on implementing reforms to the
pension system and relieving aging-related pressures on public expenditure. Deep
reforms are needed to catch up, and keep up, with demographic developments. The
authorities’ plans to address aging-related pressures are welcome, and the challenge now is to
move from diagnosis to action. Measures to increase the effective retirement age back to
65 years and periodic automatic adjustments would ensure that the pension system does not
fall behind demographic trends again. Also, switching pension indexation to prices from
wages can help to contain costs and, by setting the stage for lower taxes than otherwise
possible, protect net-of-tax pension benefits. Phasing in reforms and grandfathering the rights
of employees are desirable, but feasible only if reforms are put in place promptly. The
National Health Insurance System should also be adjusted, including by establishing user
fees, to limit abuse and ensure that expenditures remain manageable.
34.
Although commercial banks are profitable and well capitalized, credit and house
price developments need to be closely monitored to contain financial sector risks.
Prompted by EU accession and, more broadly, by worldwide developments, the financial
sector has undergone a substantial transformation in recent years. The rationalization of the
cooperative banking sector is welcome, as it will serve to strengthen its capital base.
Although the authorities’ continued monitoring of financial market developments is
reassuring, prudential measures to control risks in the banking sector may need to be
revisited if the pace of credit expansion does not abate. The recent proposals to change the

19
legislation and regulations to accelerate the lengthy foreclosure process should be adopted as
soon as possible.
35.
Some aspects of financial supervision should be strengthened. Economies of scale
and potential gains from combining the experience of supervisors point to the desirability of
unifying the supervision of commercial banks and cooperative credit institutions. Irrespective
of the institutional framework, supervisors should have clear responsibilities and objectives,
operational independence, professional staff, and adequate resources. The latter holds in
particular for the Superintendent for Insurance to be in a position to conduct on site
inspections. The decision to complete an FSAP in time for the next Article IV consultation is
welcome.
36.
In the end, reaping the opportunities available to Cyprus will depend on its
ability to sustain economic growth. There is little scope for further competitiveness losses,
and continuing to implement the National Lisbon Program will be central to Cyprus’s
success in EMU. Continued real wage increases point to the urgency of complementing
reforms with a redesign of the wage-setting system to promote an alignment of real wage
growth with productivity developments. Continuing to enhance domestic competition in key
markets, either by privatizing state-owned firms or exposing them to vigorous competition,
would further boost productivity. In this regard, the Commission for the Protection of
Competition should be provided with adequate resources, and legislation to further its
investigative capacity adopted promptly.
37.

It is recommended that the Article IV consultation remain on a 24-month cycle.

e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on
GDP deflator).

1/ Data for 2001-04 are for banks compiled on a domestic consolidation basis while the ratio of
regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets and the ratio of regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted
assets are compiled on a cross-border and cross sector for all domestically-incorporated banks basis;
do not include the cooperative credit institutions and the former International Banking Units. Data for
2005 are for deposit takers compiled on a domestically-controlled, cross-border consolidation basis; do
not include the cooperative credit institutions and foreign controlled banks. In 2005, on a cross-border
and cross-sector consolidation basis for all domestically-incorporated deposit takers, which exclude the
cooperative credit institutions but include the former International Banking Units, the ratio of regulatory
capital to risk-weighted assets was 13,4 percent, and the ratio of regulatory capital to risk–weighted
assets was 13,4 percent, and the ratio of regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 10,2
percent.
2/ The numbers are not fully comparable over time, because the threshold for classifying loans as nonperforming was changed from 9 months in arrears to 6 months in 2005. The threshold was further
reduced to 3 months in 2006. In addition, only data for 2005 are compiled according to the methodology
and specifications provided in the IMF “Compilation Guide on Financial Soundness Indicators.” The
recent decline in nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios reflects repayments and write-offs of NPLs as well as
denominator effects (growth in capital/loans).

The ASDCS, the Cooperative Central Bank (CCB), the Cooperative
Computer Society, the Pancyprian Cooperative Confederation, and the
Audit Office of Cooperative Societies closely coordinate their activities.
Several committees and work groups have been set up for particular
subjects. The work of the different groups and committees is coordinated
and monitored by a Committee consisting of the heads, or their
representatives, of each of the above instituions.
A Staff Restructuring Plan was prepared by the Public Administration and
Personnel Service in cooperation with the ASDCS and was approved by
the House of Representatives in July 2005. The Plan provides for a new
organisational structure, recruitment of additional staff, upgrading of entry
requirements through differentiation of schemes of service, upgrading of
posts, etc. The implementation of this plan will increase the total number of
the permanent staff employed today from 36 to 57. In October 2006, two
promotions and one recruitment took place at top management posts
(Assistants to the Commissioner). Moreover, there are now four vacancies
for high level posts (directly under the posts of Commissioner’s Assistants)
in progress for recruitment. Finally, the vacancies for 20 officers are
published in the official gazette of the Republic. Applications have been
sent to the ASDCS for appropriate evaluation and selection. The incoming
staff will mainly reinforce and strengthen the supervisory capacity of the
ASDCS.
(a) A draft regulative decision regarding the permissible activities has been
prepared and is now pending for approval by the Committee of the
ASDCS. (b) The prohibition for the use of the term ‘Cooperative Credit
Institution’ has been included in an amending bill which is being prepared
by the ASDCS.
A draft regulative decision has been prepared and will soon be forwarded
to the Committee of the ASDCS for approval.

The on going procedure of recruiting of additional qualified staff (see CP
1.2 above) and the ASDCS’s continuous effort in organizing
training/educational programs for its staff are enhancing the ASDCS’s
supervisory capacity. An EU Twinning Light Program (under the transitional
fund of 2005), entitled «Technical Assistance for the Effective Supervision
of Cooperative Credit Institutions», is being implementeed.
A project is underway for the full computerization of the ASDCS in direct
connection with the Cooperative Computer Society’s central server which
provides computer services to most CCIs. A part of it concerning the
issues of administrative and statistical data as well as issues and some
reports necessary during on site and off site supervision has been
provisionally completed and is currently under testing. Most of the CCIs
are connected (and those that are not will soon be connected) through the
central server of the Cooperative Computer Society, thus providing up-todate, comprehensive reporting to the ASDCS.

CP 7 Credit Policies. Strengthen supervisory capacity. Enhance the
supervisors’ capacity to evaluate loan policies.

CP 8 Loan Evaluation. Strengthen supervisory capacity. Provide for additional
prudential reporting

A draft regulatory decision has been prepared and will soon be forwarded
to the Committee of the ASDCS for approval.
An article regarding the connected lending has been included in an
amending bill which is being prepared by the ASDCS.

Training programs and seminars both in Cyprus and abroad have been
attended by ASDCS’s staff members.

CP 9 Large Exposure Limits. Strengthen supervisory capacity.

CP 10 Connected Lending. Strengthen supervisory capacity. Facilities to
connected persons should not be granted on terms more favorable than those
used in the normal course of business.

CP 12 market Risks. Adjust and develop expertise to supervise new risks.

The construction of monitoring and early warning systems is one of the
goals of the above computerization project and of the twinning light
program (see CP 7 above).

The Commissioner’s directive regarding the mandatory semi-annual
reporting of CCI’s compliance with CAD II is going to be finalized prior to
the issue of any license to an authorized cooperative credit institution, i.e.
by 31/12/2007, at the latest. The implementation of this directive is directly
related with the time of implementation of the provisions of Basel II.

The Authorities' Response

CP 6 Capital Adequacy. Mandatory semi-annual reporting on each CCI’s
compliance with capital requirements regime.

Recommended Actions

This information (regarding mainly interest rate risks) is currently available
to the management of the CCIs and is shared with the ASDCS when
required, through its on site supervision and off site monitoring. Direct
access will be granted to ASDCS when the project of prudential reporting
is completed (see CP8 above)
Promising results are reached from the on going efforts to encourage
mergers of the CCIs that favor critical mass, economies of scale and their
organizational capabilities (including internal controls). The total number of
CCIs was reduced from 361 at end-2004 to 347 at end-2005 and to 305 in
September 2006. It is expected that the number will be reduced to
approximately 275 by the end of 2006 and to approximately 150 by the end
of 2007.
All CCIs have already appointed a Compliance Officer. A Guidance note
was issued by ASDCS on 16/5/2005 which is in line with the CBC’s
Guidance note to the commercial banks. After the recent publication of the
MONEYVAL Report, an amending guidance note will be issued in
accordance with the recommendations of the report and in cooperation
with the CBC.
The recruitment of additional staff (see CP 1.2), the continuous training of
the current and new staff, and the completion of the computerization
project (see CP8) will greatly assist in strengthening of the ASDCS’s
supervisory capacity.
A draft regulatory decision has been prepared and will soon be forwarded
to the Committee of the ASDCS for approval.

The ASDCS has accelerated direct connection to the central server and
the use of information provided by those CCIs that are and will be
connected through the central server of the Cooperative Computer Society
(see CP 8 above).
Recruitment of addition staff is in progress (see CP 1.2 above).

CP 14 Internal Controls. Strengthen supervisory capacity. Undertake efforts to
encourage mergers favoring critical mass and organizational capabilities of
CCIs

CP 15 Money Laundering. Update guidance note.

CP 16 On-site and Off-site Supervision. Strengthen supervisory capacity.

CP 17 Bank Management Contact. Impose mandatory and timely
communication of material changes in activities and adverse developments.

CP 18 Off-site Supervision. Strengthen supervisory capacity. Accelerate direct
connection to central data server.

CP 19 Validation of Supervisory Information. Strengthen supervisory capacity.

The Authorities' Response

CP 13 Other Risks. Strengthen supervisory capacity. Organize accelerated
access to centralized reporting system regarding interest rate risk.

ANNEX I. CYPRUS: FUND RELATIONS
As of November 30, 2006
Mission: Nicosia, October 25-November 6, 2006. The concluding statement of the mission is
available at http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2006/110606.htm.
Staff team: Mr. Hoffmaister (head), Mr. Jafarov, and Ms. Hassine (all EUR).1
Country interlocutors: Minister of Finance Sarris, Central Bank Governor Christodoulou, and
other senior officials; Mr. Christofides (OED) attended the meetings.
Fund relations: Cyprus is on a 24-month cycle, and the previous Article IV consultation was
concluded in October 2004; there was a staff visit in December 2005 to discuss economic
developments and euro adoption. Cyprus has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections
2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current transactions.
Outreach: The mission met with members of parliament, business, labor, as well as the
academic community. A press conference was held at the end of the mission, and an unofficial
transcript of the question and answers session is available at
http://www.centralbank.gov.cy/media/pdf/NPANG_ANSWERS081106.pdf.
Statistical issues: The data in this report refer only to the government-controlled areas, except
where otherwise noted. These statistics are generally of good quality and are adequate for
surveillance, though some improvements are needed (Annex II): www.mof.gov.cy/mof/CyStat,
www.centralbank.gov.cy. The authorities intend to subscribe to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard by 2008. Statistics for the areas not under the effective control of the government of
the Republic of Cyprus are thought to be weak: www.devplan.org.
Publication: The authorities have agreed to publish the staff report.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangements: In June 1992, the peg of the Cyprus pound
changed from a broad basket of currencies to the ECU. The central rate was set at
ECU 1.7086 per £C with a margin of +2.25 percent. On January 1, 1999, the euro
replaced the ECU as the basis of the peg. In August 2001, the fluctuation margins
increased to +15 percent, but the central rate remained unchanged. Subject to certain
limitations, including a limit on spreads between buying and selling rates, authorized
dealers (banks) are free to determine and quote their own buying and selling rates.
Effective from May 2, 2005, Cyprus has participated in ERM2.
VIII. Article IV Consultation: The last Article IV consultation mission took place
during October 18–29, 2004, and the staff report (CR/05/107, 3/22/05) was discussed
by the Executive Board on February 18, 2005.
IX.
Assessment of the Offshore Financial Sector: In March-April 2005, the IMF
undertook a Module 2 assessment under the policy described in Offshore––Financial
Centers-The Assessment Program––A Progress Report and the Future of the Program,
including assessments of compliance with the Basel Core Principles for Effective
Banking Supervision, of the observance of the Insurance Core Principles, and on the
implementation of IOSCO Objectives and Principles of Security Regulations. The
Cypriot authorities have agreed to publishing the assessments.

XII. Exchange Restrictions: Cyprus is an Article VIII member and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. It maintains measures
adopted for security reasons, which the authorities are in the process of notifying the
Fund for approval in accordance with Decision 144.
XIII. Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT):
The legal provisions and supervisory arrangements for AML/CFT were found to be
satisfactory by the Council of Europe’s MONEYVAL Committee in February 2006. The
authorities intend to implement the recommendations of this evaluation in the first six
months of 2007. Furthermore, the authorities plan to change the existing laws and regulations
in line with the requirements of European Union’s Third Money Laundering Directive, which
is due for implementation by Member States by 15 December, 2007, and of the (new)
Council of Europe’s Convention on money laundering and terrorist financing.

ANNEX II. CYPRUS: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Cyprus has an open publication policy and its statistical data are generally of a high quality
and adequate frequency. A large amount of information is available through the internet,
including press statements as well as data from the Statistical Service and the Central Bank of
Cyprus.
Although Cyprus has not yet subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS),
format and requirements for most data broadly observe the general provisions of the standard.
However, some data series are only available with long time lags, and advance-release
calendars are not disseminated to users.
National accounts data are disseminated on the internet site of the Ministry of Finance with
consistent series from 1995 onwards. Data in volume for national accounts were revised to
reflect changes in recording the production of Financial intermediation services indirectly
measured (FISIM). Also, a chain-link methodology was introduced with 2000 as a new base
year. Quarterly real GDP growth rates are published with a few months delay; annual
national accounts are published with up to five months delay. The Ministry of Finance also
disseminates monthly economic indicators, notably on trade flows, tourism arrivals, and
industrial production with a lag of a couple of months for most indicators. Since January
1999, the consumer price index has been compiled according to the EU definition
(Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices - HICP) used to assess compliance with Maastricht
treaty requirements.
Balance of payments statistics are presented in the format specified by Eurostat in Balance
of Payments Vade Mecum, which is based on the IMF Balance of Payments Manual, fifth
edition (BPM5). From 2002 onwards, the BOP statistics have been compiled using the BPM5
definition of residency. Trade statistics are available on a monthly basis with a lag of about
three months; current account statistics are available on a quarterly basis, with a lag of about
four months. While the data are generally of good quality, some concerns remain regarding
coverage of data (including the International Investment Position) and timeliness and
transparency of revisions.
Fiscal data for the central government are of good quality and coverage. Monthly fiscal data
are generally of high quality, but not published on a timely basis. Consolidated general
government accounts exist from 1998 and are published on the internet on an annual and
quarterly basis, with a lag of several months.
Monetary and financial statistics are disseminated on a timely basis. Tables with monetary
authority and commercial bank balance sheets, together with interest rate and other relevant
information, are available with a lag of about one month.

Statement by Yuri G. Yakusha, Alternate Executive Director for Cyprus
and Charalambos Christofides, Advisor to Executive Director
January 26, 2007
General remarks
The Cypriot authorities welcome the staff's positive assessment of the economy and
helpful recommendations, which they broadly share. The authorities also wish to thank the
staff for their continuing engagement, including the provision of significant technical
assistance, which has been both well targeted and extremely productive.
Indeed, Cyprus continues to converge toward euro-area incomes, and the authorities
are confident that Cyprus will join EMU and adopt the euro as its currency on
January 1, 2008 as planned. Macroeconomic policies, traditionally sound and generally
characterized by fiscal and monetary rectitude, have more recently been strongly geared
toward not only ensuring a smooth EMU accession, but also to making participation in the
broader European project a success. In terms of the Maastricht criteria, the aim is not merely
to meet them, but whenever possible to out-perform them in a sustainable manner. And,
finally, while ensuring that Cyprus itself is a contributor to the European economy as well as
a beneficiary, that visible benefits should be available to the average Cypriot citizen, who has
been willing to accept a faster pace of change and the need to adapt to an ever more
competitive environment.
The real economy—performance, outlook, productivity, and structural reforms
The economy has continued to recover, with a near 4 percent GDP growth rate
approaching what is currently estimated to be a sustainable level. The economy has adapted
well considering that it had to weather a number of negative, and fairly persistent, shocks.
These included not only the oil price shock, which has affected Cyprus significantly given its
dependence on imported energy, but also a series of regional shocks spanning several years
that affected tourism. The most recent of these shocks, although short-lived, occurred during
the busiest tourist months only last summer. Cyprus received well-deserved accolades for its
provision of humanitarian support to the expatriates fleeing Lebanon, support which Cyprus
itself mainly financed, yet potential foreign visitors saw news items of clogged ports,
crowded airports, and filled hotel units.
Despite the rise in the growth rate, inflation has remained muted, ending the year at
only 1.5 percent, with some intra-year volatility attributed not only to oil price developments
but also to changes in indirect tax rates mandated by Cyprus' EU responsibilities, and the
need to address tax distortions between used cars (whose taxes were already reduced) and
new cars (whose taxes had remained high, until they were lowered last November). In terms
of the Maastricht inflation criterion, which is of course only a projection at this point, the
authorities expect that the Cypriot inflation rate will remain comfortably below the projected

2

threshold. Of course, an assessment of inflation performance should also focus on its longerterm sustainability. On this score, it is clear that Cyprus has followed strong anti-inflation
policies for many years now. It has been able to maintain the peg of the Cyprus pound within
a narrow (informal) band since June, 1992, while competitiveness is assessed by all available
studies as being adequate. Given also that there is continuing strong productivity growth,
moderate wage growth, and prudent policies, there should thus be little question that Cyprus
will (barring some unforeseen developments) meet the inflation criterion.
The external current account deficit has widened to around 6 percent of GDP, to a
significant extent reflecting oil price developments. Over the medium term, however, it is
expected to ebb to 4 percent of GDP, as a number of transitory developments abate, most
notably oil prices and a recent increase in the income outflows from foreign firms. FDI
inflows, on the other hand, have increased substantially, easing the economy’s external
financing needs. Thankfully, the tourist sector has started to recover, expanding moderately
in terms of revenue, despite a small decline in arrivals. Another encouraging development
has been the rise in the exports of services, as Cyprus continues to make progress in
becoming a regional business hub. The shipping services sector has been especially strong, as
staff data show, with Cyprus developing valuable expertise in this area, serving a large
Cypriot-flagged commercial fleet. In this regard, the continuing Turkish refusal to allow such
ships to use Turkish ports, despite Turkey's EU obligations in this matter, is having a
negative economic impact on Cyprus, by holding back a very dynamic export sector.
The economy has continued to generate not only growth, but jobs. Cyprus' labor
market is very open and reasonably flexible, especially in the private and SME sectors (there
is a part that includes semi-governmental and financial sector organizations where workers
have strong job security and enjoy a number of privileges). Indeed, over the years the labor
market has been so strong as to require a significant importation of foreign labor, currently
comprising about 16 percent of the total labor force, while ensuring a very low
unemployment rate (between 3.5-5 percent depending on the definition). The opening up of
the “green-line” has allowed Turkish Cypriots who wish to do so to work and to take
advantage of health, social insurance, and other amenities in the government-controlled
areas, and in fact they have done so in large numbers: Turkish Cypriots constitute almost
1 percent of the labor force in the areas under the effective control of the Republic of Cyprus.
Another testament to the strength and flexibility of the labor market has been Cyprus'
welcoming of the recent accession of Bulgaria and Romania into the EU. Cyprus did not
place any restrictions on the working opportunities of their citizens in Cyprus.
The disadvantages of the COLA mechanism, which a series of Fund missions have
singled out for criticism, have so far remained mainly hypothetical. On the other hand, its
contribution to maintaining labor peace has been quite real. Other mechanisms (including
sectoral wage differentiation in collective agreements) have acted to help maintain the

3

flexibility of the labor market to adapt to shocks. Overall wage growth has consequently been
moderate, running at a nominal rate of 4-6 percent on an economy-wide basis, i.e., including
both domestic and foreign workers.
Finally, turning to the economic outlook for 2007 and beyond, prospects remain
favorable. GDP growth should remain close to potential growth, sustained by employment
growth in the 1.5-2 percent range, a capital investment contribution between 1-1.5 percent,
and TFP of 1.5 percent. Since there still remains considerable room before actual output
reaches potential output (estimates are for a closing of the gap by 2010) there should be no
immediate impediment or inflationary pressure that by itself could choke off the continuing
recovery.
A number of structural measures and other developments should help underpin this
forecast, especially in support of productivity growth. Ongoing infrastructural investments
have opened up communication between cities, significantly reducing commuting time. To
address a recurring water shortage, the government is reconsidering investments in two new
desalination plants. Cyprus, in the context also of the Lisbon strategy, which has received
considerable attention and support by governmental and civil society circles, is planning a
significant increase in the share of GDP devoted to R&D. On public services and utilities,
although no privatization is currently being contemplated, action has been ongoing to
improve competition. Legislation is pending to enhance the powers of the Commission for
the Protection of Competition. In telecommunications, the private sector already enjoys a
significant and rising share in mobile telephony. On tourism, there are plans being developed
to help upgrade the offerings, through such efforts as building marinas and golf courses, and
attracting more traffic from professional conventions. For Cyprus Airways, actions have
already been taken to reduce staffing and other costs so as to help make the company more
competitive. Although Cyprus had until recently been lagging in terms of internet adoption
rates, there has been a very rapid increase in the share of households with internet access. If
the experience of other countries is any guide, a more widespread adoption has the potential
to eventually further boost productivity.
Monetary policy and the financial sector
The Central Bank of Cyprus (CBoC) will remain focused on containing inflation and
keeping the economy on track for EMU accession and the locking of the parity between the
Cyprus pound and the euro at around mid-2007. The CBoC has already proved its readiness
to be ahead of the curve if necessary, including by changing the policy interest rates by a full
100 basis in one step (once in the upwards, and once in the downwards, direction) since
2004. Most recently, on September 1 the CBoC raised interest rates by 25 basis points to
counteract inflationary pressures and strong credit expansion, while on another occasion it
left rates unchanged despite a reduction of 25 basis points by the ECB, thereby further
increasing the interest rate differential. Finally, a harmonization took place between the

4

operational framework of the CBoC and euro area practices on September 1, 2006. The bid
rate is now being used on the main financing operations as the basis for the pricing of credit
institutions instead of the Lombard rate that was previously used, which had the effect of
increasing the bid rate on the main refinancing operations by 125 basis points. The net effect
is that there is now a 100 basis point interest rate differential between the Cyprus pound and
the euro at the short end. All in all, there should be strong confidence in the ability of the
CBoC to continue to successfully manage monetary conditions.
The authorities are fully committed to their plans to adopt the euro on January 1,
2008, decided collectively by the Council of Ministers. The adoption of the euro as the
currency of the country is a much broader issue, and the authorities have been actively
preparing at various levels, together with civil society. The authorities have been working on
the large range of laws that will have to be adapted, and have been participating actively on a
public relations campaign. The authorities have made a number of statements in support of
euro adoption and to assuage public fears that euro adoption will lead to an inflationary blip
as (it is claimed) merchants take advantage and “round prices up.” During the mission, the
Staff was also helpful in presenting data showing that in other countries that adopted the euro
inflation was not significantly higher, although selected items of frequent use did see some
upward pressures, which may have contributed to the inaccurate perception that euro
adoption is linked with higher inflation. Interest rates and spreads have naturally benefited,
with Cyprus able to borrow abroad at favorable rates. Most of the remaining very small
premium is attributed to a liquidity rather than a credit risk premium, and is expected to
decline as the market of primary dealers for government paper starts to operate.
The financial sector is generally healthy, and has been restructuring fairly strongly as
competition has increased and EU accession has changed the playing field. Higher
profitability has allowed for improved provisioning against NPLs—which it should be noted
appear higher than they would under international recording practices. Banks are reluctant to
write off loans which have already been provided for before all lengthy legal measures
against the borrowers concerned are exhausted and, specifically, due to the long time
required under the present legal and judicial arrangements, to foreclose property mortgaged
in favor of banks. Already a controlling interest has been acquired in the second largest
commercial bank by a foreign (Greek) concern, with the two subsequently merging;
meanwhile, interest in the largest commercial bank has been expressed by two foreign (again,
Greek) concerns. The cooperative sector has been under both competitive pressure on
housing loans from commercial banks and regulatory pressure to improve capitalization, so
merger activity has been increasing there as well (though within the cooperative sector at
present). The staff have made sensible recommendations in this area, which are shared by the
authorities, drawing also upon a recently concluded Detailed Assessment of Standards and
Codes for Banking Supervision, Insurance Supervision, and Securities Regulation. The
authorities have been working to implement the specific recommendations of that

5

assessment, including to increase the staff available to the Insurance Supervisor to enable her
to perform on-site inspections.
Fiscal policy
The pace of fiscal consolidation has been very fast, with a more than halving of the
deficit between 2003 and 2005, resulting in Cyprus being the first country to have its
excessive deficit procedure abrogated by the EU. A well thought-out set of measures,
including expenditure restraint as counseled by the staff, has contributed to this result. The
public sector employment growth has been kept low, the real wage growth component was
set at zero for two consecutive years, and public procurement and investment were kept
under tight control. Some of these measures did have a one-off character (at least partially),
such as the tax amnesty during 2004-05. However, they were at least successful in raising
revenue and, by broadening the tax base, may be having a more lasting beneficial impact. In
any case, they were a necessary step towards bringing more of the economy into the tax net.
There is also a consistent plan of supportive measures for 2007. Public sector real
(basic) wages are planned to rise by only 1 percent (following zero percent growth during
2004-05 and 2 percent during 2006). Public sector employment growth is to be limited to
1 percent per year (below economy-wide employment growth), and current expenditure
growth will be contained to below nominal GDP growth. On the revenue side, continued
efforts to improve tax administration are planned. Overall, most of the expected adjustment
between 2007 and 2010 will come from the expenditure side. The cyclically adjusted
structural balance will, in fact, even during 2007, be fairly restrictive, with the decline
between 2006 and 2007 in the pace of fiscal consolidation relative to earlier mostly explained
(other than by cyclical effects) by the abatement of one-off measures. One should also note
that the provision of compensating grants through the EU budget will be terminated in 2006,
where it accounted for 0.4 percent of GDP, which also affects the degree of fiscal adjustment
effected between 2006 and 2007.
According to data just received, the authorities are now in a position to announce that
the fiscal year 2006 has ended with a general government deficit of around 1.5% of GDP,
compared to the Convergence Program target of 1.9% of GDP. This of course could have
implications for the target for 2007. For now, the target will remain unchanged, however, if
the favorable revenue performance can be sustained, the authorities, also in view of the
requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, stand ready to revise the target appropriately.
For the medium-term, the challenge remains to maintain the good performance and to reach
the Medium-Term Objective, of close to balance, by 2009-10, so as to put the debt-to-GDP
ratio on a distinct downward path.

6

The longer-term fiscal and demographic challenge
Everyone agrees that there do remain important fiscal challenges over the mediumand longer-term. There are 4 pillars to the authorities’ strategy for meeting these challenges:
(1) utilize the medium term budget framework (MTBF) to institutionalize expenditure rules,
while increasing both accountability and independence for line ministries vs. quantified
targets; (2) align social welfare spending better with need; (3) strengthen the modernization
of the public sector; and (4) further improve tax collection by tackling tax evasion and
improving tax administration.
The Fund has been instrumental in this process. With very targeted and helpful
technical assistance from the Fund, the authorities have worked to implement a medium term
budget framework, to be fully operational from 2008. Some elements have already started
being implemented. Further TA by the Fund on the implementation of the MTBF will be
very useful in helping achieve these aims, ensuring that the resulting framework is solid and
transparent. By helping to avoid the need for supplementary budgets, the MTBF will further
help reduce wasteful year-end spending.
Also, the risk that public-private partnerships (PPPs) could act to weaken expenditure
control and possibly add unquantified contingent risks to the public finances should be
averted permanently. Again, with Fund technical assistance, a draft legal framework was
developed, and institutional mechanisms are being devised to act as gatekeepers, to ensure
that the risks are quantified and manageable, and to stop low economic return projects from
going ahead.
The biggest long-term challenge is the demographic shock and its possible impact on
the social security system. Staff's work on this topic was appreciated by the authorities and
other interested parts of the public, and helped raise awareness of the scale of the problem.
On a technical level, while of course being consistent with recent work in the economic
literature, the main driver of the results is that a drop in the fertility rate to 1.5 (a relatively
recent development in Cyprus, and in fact a situation that is among the better ones within
Europe) is maintained into the indefinite future, implying an ultimate dire impact on
population. Clearly, measures to address this situation need to be taken. The authorities have
prepared a set of measures intended to be taken in two stages to address the problem. In
terms of the staff's suggestions, there are reservations mainly on the political sensitivity
regarding how fast the retirement age can indeed be raised, and on the proposal to link
pension benefits to inflation only. As experience in other countries has shown, the danger in
the latter is that social security benefits over time become mere welfare benefits, covering
less and less of retirement need, and significantly raising the poverty rate among the elderly.
Hence more thought needs to be given to this problem, including perhaps on measures to
help address the fertility problem more directly taking account of Cyprus' circumstances
(rather than accepting it parametrically—France, for instance, has been successful in

7

introducing measures to reverse the decline in its fertility rate). With public debt expected to
continue to decline rapidly (eventually falling below 50 percent of GDP before beginning to
rise under the demographic pressures) there fortunately is some room to further refine and
implement policies to address this problem.
Issues relating to the reunification of Cyprus
The Government of Cyprus has been actively looking for ways to aid the Turkish
Cypriot community. Over the years, a significant amount of aid has been directed toward
them by the Government. Looking forward, this is likely to continue and under the right
conditions to include EU Funds. Of course, these activities must take place in ways that
promote the ultimate reunification of Cyprus, and must not be in a form that could provide
international cover or recognition (even by implication) to the occupation regime in the areas
of the Republic of Cyprus not under the effective control of the Government of the Republic
of Cyprus.
Regarding the role of the IMF, the authorities have been cooperative with Fund staff
in their efforts to contact Turkish Cypriot technocrats with a view to find ways to provide
non-financial assistance, under the conditions mentioned in the previous paragraph, through
such activities as collecting information on economic developments in the areas of the
Republic of Cyprus not under the effective control of the Government of the Republic of
Cyprus, and receiving training from the Fund. Even though no such assistance has been
agreed upon so far, the authorities will continue to support the staff in their efforts to find a
solution that satisfies both the needs of the Turkish Cypriot community and the sensitivities
of the Cypriot authorities.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Cyprus
On January 26, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Cyprus.1
Background
Economic activity has recovered from a relatively weak performance in 2002–03. Declines
in interest rates and strong capital inflows associated with Cyprus’s accession to the
European Union in May 2004 spurred growth in private consumption and investment, while
recovering tourist receipts reduced the external drag on the economy. These developments
were reflected in tight labor market conditions and continued progress toward real
convergence with the euro area.
Inflation has slowed, reflecting changes in tax rates, increased competition in the wake of
EU accession-related reforms, and global developments. Most recently, inflation went up
somewhat in the first half of 2006, but then declined rapidly to a year-on-year rate of
1.5 percent in December. These developments were largely driven by variation in oil prices
and movements of the euro—and the Cypriot pound that is fixed to it— against other
currencies.
Before the latest deceleration in inflation, the Central Bank of Cyprus increased interest
rates by 25 bps on September 1. This rate hike followed three consecutive cuts (totaling
125 bps) in 2005, which had been made in response to strong capital inflows related to
Cyprus’s participation in ERM2 in May, 2005. Although interest rate differentials against the
euro have fallen significantly, the exchange rate continues to trade close to the (unofficial)
upper band.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

The fiscal deficit was cut in half to under 2½ percent of GDP in 2003–05. As a result, in
July 2006, Cyprus became the first new member of the EU to have its excessive deficit
procedure abrogated. Further fiscal adjustment is in store in 2006, with the deficit projected
to fall below 2 percent of GDP. Initially, fiscal consolidation relied on one-off measures, but
the adjustment has also benefited from tight expenditure control, combining moderation in
public sector wage increases and expenditure ceilings on public consumption and
investment. In the long run, aging challenges fiscal sustainability.
Rising energy costs and robust domestic demand have led to a widening of the external
current account deficit in 2004–06. Non-energy imports surged in 2004—prompted by a
sharp increase in investment and a reduction in excise duties—and recorded robust growth
in 2005–06. Pressure on export margins continued but less so than earlier in the decade.
Recent declines in competitiveness—as the real exchange rate has appreciated—have
contributed to the fall in the export share of goods, but services exports have held their
ground.
The economy is experiencing rapid credit growth and brisk house price increases. Total
credit to the private sector accelerated recently, with mortgage lending leading the
expansion.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the Cypriot authorities’ substantial progress in addressing
macroeconomic imbalances and reforming the economy. Inflation has receded, the fiscal
deficit was cut sharply, and the economy has continued to recover, raising living standards
in Cyprus closer to those in the rest of the EU and placing the economy at the doorstep of
the EMU. Directors noted that continued observance of the Maastricht criteria, in particular
the inflation criterion, and a smooth adoption of the euro will lay the groundwork for
sustained growth going forward. This will require both fiscal and wage restraint, along with
policies fostering domestic competition and continued vigilance of monetary policy.
Directors welcomed the favorable fiscal outturn in 2006 and the focus on durable fiscal
measures in the 2007 budget. They encouraged the authorities to remain ambitious in their
fiscal adjustment efforts to safeguard against inflation risks by observing spending limits,
avoiding supplementary budgets and saving any higher-than-envisaged revenues.
Directors supported the authorities’ intention to balance the budget by 2010 and stressed
that high-quality fiscal adjustment should be ensured by keeping current expenditure in
check. They welcomed the planned full implementation of a medium-term budget framework
in 2008, as it would provide a strong institutional framework to rationalize, prioritize, and
control public expenditure. Directors considered the suspension of the ambitious public
investment program to be appropriate to allow the authorities to put in place a proper legal
framework and institutional setting for private-public-partnerships. These actions will help
bring economic considerations to bear on the selection and procurement of public
investment projects.

Directors stressed that long-run fiscal sustainability hinges on mitigating the aging-related
pressures on public expenditure. They called on the authorities to implement pension
reforms that would allow the social security system to deal with adverse demographic
trends, noting that prompt action would allow a more gradual phasing in of reforms and
grandfathering of the rights of employees. Directors noted the need to avert rising health
care costs when the National Health Insurance System is introduced in 2008 and
encouraged the authorities to consider adequate incentives to this end, such as user fees.
Turning to the financial sector, Directors noted that commercial banks are profitable and
well capitalized. Nonetheless, non-performing loans, while declining, remain high. Rapid
credit growth and brisk house price increases could become sources of risk, and the
authorities should stand ready to take appropriate measures if the pace of credit growth
does not abate and risks increase. Directors welcomed improvements in financial sector
supervision, while encouraging steps to consolidate the supervision of commercial banks
and cooperative credit institutions. Irrespective of the institutional framework, supervisors
should have clear responsibilities and objectives, operational independence, professional
staff, and adequate resources. Directors encouraged the early adoption of legislation and
regulations to accelerate the lengthy foreclosure process and welcomed the authorities’
intention of completing an Financial Sector Assessment Program in time for the next
Article IV consultation.
Directors stressed the importance of safeguarding external competitiveness to sustain
economic growth. While recognizing that the current wage-setting process has helped
smoothen labor relations, Directors concurred that continued high real wage increases point
to the need to move towards a mechanism that would better align real wage increases with
productivity developments. Directors welcomed progress in opening the
telecommunications and energy sectors, and saw scope for further progress to enhance
competition in these markets.
Directors encouraged continued efforts towards reaching an agreement on a framework
under which Fund technical assistance could be provided to the Turkish Cypriot community
in the non-government-controlled areas of the Republic of Cyprus. In this respect, several
Directors welcomed the pragmatic approach adopted by the Cypriot authorities.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to subscribe to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard by 2008.
