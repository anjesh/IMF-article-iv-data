I. SUMMARY AND STAFF APPRAISAL
The nascent economic recovery, underpinned by significant improvements in policies in 2009, remains
very fragile. The previously implemented liberalization of prices, goods markets, and foreign exchange
transactions would support economic activity in 2010. Significant improvements in tax policy and
administration have increased available fiscal space. However, rapid unsustainable government
expenditure growth, including of wages, a large reduction in capital inflows because of increased
uncertainty about the indigenization process, and exuberant credit growth have negatively affected the
macroeconomic outlook and intensified external and banking system vulnerabilities.
In light of these vulnerabilities, policies need to be strengthened to sustain the economic recovery:
The approved 2010 budgetary expenditures would need to be curtailed by about 3 percent of GDP to
return to a path toward medium-term fiscal and external sustainability and reduce the economy’s
vulnerability to shocks. This would also help maintain a fiscal reserve of at least $250 million of SDR
holdings (2 months of expenditures). Although reaching consensus on the recommended fiscal
measures is a major political challenge, delaying their implementation could increase the social and
economic costs of the future necessary adjustment.
The key fiscal challenge is to reduce the wage bill relative to revenues in 2010 and beyond to leave
sufficient fiscal space for urgent infrastructure upkeep expenses (e.g., electricity, water, and
sanitation), maintain competitiveness, and prevent an unsustainable buildup of domestic expenditure
arrears. The recent payroll audit presents an opportunity to eliminate ghost workers, and political
support needs to be forged for additional measures for 2010 and the medium term to further reduce the
wage bill.
To address increasing systemic vulnerabilities in the banking system, urgent measures need to be
implemented: (i) improving Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governance, and downsizing and
restructuring it; (ii) reducing banks’ exposure to the financially distressed RBZ; (iii) containing credit
and liquidity risks; and (iv) discontinuing moral suasion on banks to lend to specific sectors. The
authorities’ stated intentions to implement these recommendations need to be followed through with
speedy implementation.
The multi-currency system would serve Zimbabwe well during its intended lifespan (2010–12). The
Zimbabwe dollar can be reintroduced as sole legal tender only once a track record of sound policies is
established and a credible central bank governance framework focused on price stability is adopted.
Sound macroeconomic policies, a significant improvement in the business climate, in particular
regarding enforcement of property rights and labor legislation, and debt relief are essential for moving
toward external and domestic stability. Zimbabwe is in debt distress, and the debt overhang cannot be
resolved without debt relief even if policies are improved and mineral extraction is increased. The
government needs to reach consensus on a resolution strategy for external debt arrears and to improve
relations with the international community, whose support would be vital for obtaining debt relief and
rebuilding the Zimbabwe economy.

4
II. FRAGILE RECOVERY FOLLOWING A DECADE OF ECONOMIC DECLINE
1.
Following a decade of economic decline and hyperinflation during 2007–08,
policies improved significantly in 2009. The multi-currency system adopted in early 2009
helped restore price stability, restart financial intermediation, and impose fiscal discipline by
precluding the option of budget deficit monetization. Following implementation of many
Fund technical assistance (TA) recommendations, budget revenue increased significantly,
which helped finance improved delivery of public services, while the fiscal position was
broadly balanced in 2009. Price and exchange system liberalization improved allocation of
resources and availability of goods in the domestic markets. In response to better policies,
short-term capital inflows and FDI increased in 2009, providing financing for a widening
current account deficit. These positive steps supported a nascent economic recovery
(Figures 1–2 and Tables 1–5).
2.
The humanitarian situation is also improving. Most schools and hospitals have
been re-opened. Owing to good

3.
However, significant challenges remain unaddressed and some previous staff
recommendations have not been implemented. Recent large wage increases, a poor
financial position of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), rising vulnerabilities in the banking
system, weak governance, particularly at the RBZ, growing weaknesses in the business
climate, and a precarious external position (Figure 3 and Table 2) are threatening the
economic recovery and progress in poverty reduction. In light of these challenges, the
consultation discussions focused on the following issues:


Creating sufficient fiscal space for growth- and socially-oriented spending while
moving toward fiscal sustainability;



Safeguarding financial sector stability in the multi-currency regime;



Moving toward external stability and sustainable growth.

III. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK
A. Outlook on Unchanged Policies
4.
The macroeconomic outlook for 2010 on unchanged policies is daunting. The
previously implemented liberalization of prices, goods markets, and foreign exchange
transactions would support economic growth. However, continued political tensions and
increased uncertainties regarding implementation of the Indigenization and Empowerment
Act are causing a significant decrease in private capital inflows. As a result, the external
current account deficit would be forced to adjust to 23 percent of GDP in 2010, from
30 percent in 2009, and banks’ foreign assets—their main source of liquidity—would
decline. The projected current account adjustment would lead to a sharp slowdown in import
growth (Table 2). Consequently, real GDP growth would decelerate to about 2 percent in
2010 from 4 percent in 2009 (Table 1). The unsustainable wage-driven fiscal expansion,
financed by drawing down part of Zimbabwe’s SDR holdings, would increase the
vulnerability of the external position and set the stage for an abrupt and potentially
destabilizing contraction in nonwage expenditures and imports in 2011 (Tables 2–3).
5.
Short-term risks are skewed to the downside: (i) potential liquidity or solvency
problems in a fragile banking system, as a result of the balance of payments-induced
reduction in its foreign assets, with a high negative impact on economic activity, budget
revenues, and social conditions; (ii) drought with significant negative spillover effects on
food security, economic growth, and banking system stability; and (iii) possible breakdowns
of public infrastructure with a negative impact on key industries. At the same time, higherthan-expected donor financing, as well as possible additional export and budget receipts from
diamonds, represent upside potential.
6.
The medium-term outlook is bleak in the absence of significant improvement in
policies. The illustrative baseline scenario assumes that there would be limited direct donor
budget support and structural reforms would advance slowly, reducing the country’s
attractiveness to domestic and foreign investors. Zimbabwe would remain highly dependent
on large humanitarian assistance (about $600 million per year). The tightening of the external
financing constraint projected for 2010 would continue into the medium term. Consequently
imports and investment would be compressed, and economic growth would remain anemic
(Figure 4). The current account deficit would need to adjust from 23 percent of GDP in 2010
to less than 15 percent over the medium term. The tight balance of payments position would
also restrict the scope for a further increase in financial intermediation.

B. Active Policy Scenario
7.
The macroeconomic outlook could significantly improve if policies are
strengthened. For the economy to grow at 4 to 5 percent in 2010 and the medium term,
budgetary expenditures need to be reoriented toward growth- and socially-oriented projects,
the business climate improved, wage costs contained, and the financial system strengthened
(see specific staff recommendations below). The active policy scenario does not account for
the possible impact of debt relief, which, if realized, would unlock access to fresh
International Financial Institutions’ (IFI) financing, strengthen growth potential, and
accelerate progress in moving toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals.

9
Authorities views
8.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff assessment of the outlook and risks
under the unchanged policy scenario. They also stressed that they would seek to build
domestic political consensus for the implementation of key staff recommendations under the
active policy scenario to improve prospects for economic growth and poverty reduction. The
authorities also indicated that donor financial support could be significantly higher than
projected by staff under the active policy scenario, thereby helping the economy to grow
faster.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Creating Sufficient Fiscal Space for Growth- and Socially-Oriented Spending While
Moving Toward Fiscal Sustainability
Background
9.
Counting on a significant increase in donor financing and budget revenue, the
approved 2010 budget ramped up both wages and capital expenditures. However, large
donor financing of capital expenditures is unlikely. Staff also project a revenue shortfall of
about $100 million (2 percent of GDP), despite implementation of many Fund TA
recommendations in tax policy and administration, because of the projected deterioration in
the outlook for 2010. As a result, large employment costs, including wages, benefits, and
pensions (68 percent of budget revenue), would crowd out a sizeable share of planned capital
expenditures. Staff also project a cash budget deficit of about $235 million (4.5 percent of
GDP) largely financed by drawing down part of Zimbabwe’s SDR holdings ($210 million).1
Further accumulation of expenditure arrears is also highly likely.
10.
The recent increase in the wage bill has significant adverse macroeconomic
implications. Although the government would be able to improve living standards and
morale of 230,000 civil servants, many urgent infrastructure projects critical for economic
recovery and poverty reduction would remain under-financed in 2010. Moreover, large
government wage increases have had a signaling impact on private sector wages and a direct
impact on nontradable prices, in particular rents. These factors, in turn, have increased
pressures on private sector employers, local governments, and SOEs to grant higher wages,
which some of them have not been able to afford in recent months owing to low productivity.

1

Contrary to staff advice to refrain from using nonconcessional SDR-related funds because of Zimbabwe’s
low-income status, debt distress, and paucity of international reserves, the authorities have converted an
equivalent of $150 million from the country’s SDR holdings under the 2009 general SDR allocation ($410
million) and have started to use these resources for budget financing. An additional conversion of an equivalent
of $60 million is authorized under the budget.

10
11.
The medium-term fiscal position is clearly unsustainable. The government’s
medium-term budget estimates contain overly optimistic assumptions on revenue and donor
financing, inflating expectations about possible expenditure levels, including wages. In the
illustrative unchanged policy scenario, based on the staff’s lower revenue and grant forecast
for 2011–15, the targeted increase in employment costs to $1.1 billion (20 percent of GDP
and 74 percent of revenues) in 2011 would largely crowd out budgeted capital expenditures
and compress budgeted nonwage current expenses (Figure 5), leading to accumulation of
large expenditure arrears and increasing the risk of use of the remaining SDR allocation
($200 million projected at end-2010) which is assumed to be saved in the budget.

Staff recommendations
12.
The government needs to return to cash budgeting2 from the second quarter of
2010 to maintain external and domestic stability and preserve the remaining reserve
cushion (about $250 million or 2 months of expenditures as of end-February 2010). To this
end, cash expenditures would need to be curtailed by about 3 percent of GDP compared with
the approved budget. It would be preferable to reduce the wage bill by about 1 percent of
GDP, including through the elimination of ghost workers based on the recently completed
payroll audit and a reduction in the number of contractual employees, with the rest of
adjustment coming from low-priority capital (e.g., cars, furniture, acquisition of buildings,
lending to banks) and current (e.g., travel) spending. However, sufficient resources would
need to be allocated to urgent infrastructure maintenance expenses, noncompressible current
overhead expenses, and elimination of expenditure arrears ($41 million at end-February).
The government could also seek additional donor support for socially important projects to
reduce the risk of deterioration in the humanitarian situation.

In 2010, budget vulnerabilities could be reduced
by (i) adopting a contingency plan for expenditure
reductions in case of revenue shortfalls; and (ii) sustaining
the public sector reform momentum with World Bank TA
(e.g., strengthening the financial position and management
of SOEs and public financial management (PFM) systems).
The government also needs to review pricing and billing
practices and costs in major utilities to ensure cost-effective
service delivery. These efforts would help address concerns
about the high cost of living.

14.
In the medium term, re-orienting expenditures toward investment and social
programs with World Bank advice would help support growth and poverty reduction.3
Additional fiscal space needs to be created by (i) mobilizing additional revenues with further
Fund TA (1.5–2.0 percent of GDP); and (ii) limiting employment costs to 15.5 percent of
GDP in 2011 and further to 13 percent of GDP in 2015 through further downsizing and wage
increases below nominal GDP growth for most grades. It would also be prudent to maintain
fiscal reserves at about 2 months of expenditures in light of significant risks facing the
economy.
Authorities’ views
15.
The authorities agreed that the fiscal deficit should be reduced in 2010 in order to
restrain unsustainable domestic demand growth and save the remaining SDR holdings
($250 million) as part of fiscal reserves. The government will seek to refrain from additional
withdrawals of SDR holdings in 2010, but officials indicated that unexpected expenditure
pressures could arise (e.g., food shortages) making the achievement of this objective difficult.
16.
Regarding revenues, the authorities shared staff concerns about possible revenue
shortfalls in 2010. The government will seek to mobilize additional revenues from exports of
diamonds. However, the authorities acknowledged that ensuring compliance with the
Kimberley process may take time, thereby delaying inflows of revenues from this source.
Some officials were also optimistic that the active policy scenario would materialize, and
therefore higher revenue could be mobilized compared to the unchanged policy scenario.
17.
Regarding expenditures in 2010, the authorities indicated that the burden of
adjustment would most likely fall on nonwage expenditures. Under significant political
pressure from civil service labor unions and security forces, the government had to offer
sufficiently large wage increases in 2010 to ensure social peace and delivery of essential
services in the education sector. Nevertheless, the government intends to eliminate ghost
3

13
workers to be identified during the on-going civil service payroll audit, which could bring
some savings already in 2010. With respect to nonwage expenditures, the authorities
recognized political difficulties in reducing low-priority expenditures, including foreign
travel, purchases of cars, furniture, and the acquisition of buildings. The authorities, however,
argued that they would be able to contain nonwage current expenditures by planning monthly
cash flow carefully to avoid accumulating new expenditure arrears during the year.
18.
The authorities recognized that the key medium-term challenge is to reduce the wage
bill relative to revenue in order to leave sufficient fiscal space for growth- and sociallyoriented spending. They stated that the wage bill projections included in the medium-term
budget framework did not represent firm commitments nor did they reflect possible wage
bill-reduction measures (e.g., a further downsizing after elimination of ghost workers) for
which the government intends to build broad public support. The authorities were also more
optimistic on prospects for budget revenues than staff. As a result, they expected to reduce
the wage bill-to-revenue ratio quickly without large reductions in the wage bill-to-GDP ratio.
In addition, the government has set up high-level committees to formulate recommendations
to reduce the cost of living, including a rationalization of utility tariffs and better
management of public utilities. Containing increases in the cost of living would strengthen
the government’s bargaining position with labor unions.
B. Safeguarding Financial Sector Stability in the Multi-Currency Regime
Background
19.
With the adoption of the multi-currency system, banking deposits tripled and
lending increased six-fold between March and December 2009. This rapid balance sheet
expansion, which was in part driven by moral suasion on banks to lend to agriculture,
supported economic activity but also contributed to a significant increase in the current
account deficit in 2009 and rising banking system vulnerabilities. While officially reported
aggregate banking soundness indicators do not raise major red flags (Table 6), they mask
vulnerabilities specific to a fully dollarized banking system experiencing rapid credit growth,
as well as a significant variation in prudential indicators across individual banks.
20.
The banking system is facing increasing risks in a number of areas (Table 7).
Counterparty and credit risk is medium to high due to a significant exposure to the
financially distressed RBZ (about 70 percent of banks’ capital), the drought-prone
agricultural sector (20 percent of the loan portfolios), and the exuberant credit growth. The
projected economic slowdown would lead to a significant increase in nonperforming loans.
Liquidity risk is high, as structural liquidity pressures could arise due to the deteriorating
balance of payments position potentially causing a reduction in banks’ foreign assets. The
banking system is also ill-equipped to deal with temporary liquidity shocks with no lender of
last resort, the unavailability of the statutory reserves deposited at the RBZ (see below),
virtually no interbank lending, and a level of country risk that precludes liquidity support

14
from abroad. In this regard, it is of concern that credit expansion is taking place at the
expense of prudent liquidity management at some large banks, especially those whose
liquidity ratios were below the prudent level of 25 percent at end-December 2009. Solvency
risk is high as a possible compounding of the liquidity and credit risks, as well as the banking
system’s difficulties in generating positive incomes, could lead to a rapid erosion of capital.
21.
Serious governance problems remain at the RBZ whose balance sheet has
continued to deteriorate. The RBZ’s governing board is not operating, the RBZ did not
have an approved budget in 2009, external auditors reported serious weaknesses in internal
controls and financial reporting, and comprehensive monetary statistics have not been
published since early 2008. Without appropriate oversight, the RBZ used the international
reserves backing the statutory reserves of banks ($80 million)4 and sold shares from its
portfolio of securities at the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange ($38 million) to finance its activities
during January 2009–March 2010, including operating expenses, quasi-fiscal activities, and
repayments of debt to selected creditors. Parliament passed amendments to the RBZ Act,
envisaging stronger accountability requirements. However, these amendments do not reflect
a number of Fund TA recommendations, including the appointment of a nonexecutive
chairman of the supervisory Board, greater central bank operational independence,
transitional provisions relevant for the multi-currency system, or the prohibition of
government financing.
22.
The government considers the multi-currency regime a temporary arrangement
that will be maintained during 2010–12, while a debate on various medium-term
options for alternative currency regimes is continuing within the government. The
authorities are revising exchange controls regulations to increase their transparency and are
considering options for resolving the issue of small change and the poor quality of banknotes.
Staff recommendations
23.
Stepping up supervisory efforts would help ensure that the banking system can
withstand the projected deterioration in the balance of payments position and a
possible intensification of credit risk. Implementing a liquidity requirement of 25 to
30 percent, which should be elevated for banks with weak liquidity management practices,
would help contain liquidity risk. The liquidity requirement should exclude, but not
extinguish, any claims on the RBZ, until the resolution of the RBZ’s negative equity position
(see below). In addition, efforts to identify banks with weak underwriting skills should be
intensified and remedial actions monitored. Moral suasion on banks to lend to specific
4

The statutory reserve requirement of 10 percent of deposits, excluding government’s and SOEs’ deposits, was
implemented on February 1, 2009. From February 1, 2010, the end-January 2010 stock of deposits is still
subject to the 10 percent requirement, while any increase in the stock of deposits is subject to a 2.5 percent
requirement.

15
sectors needs to be discontinued and there should not be a perception of possible regulatory
forbearance in case banks implement government-prioritized lending.
24.
The existing resolution framework should be applied to ensure an orderly exit of
non-viable banks. In this regard, using public funds to bail out insolvent banks is not an
option given the unavailability of sufficient funds to deal with a systemic problem. Crisis
management and contingency planning also need to be strengthened.
25.
Reducing banks’ exposure to the financially distressed RBZ would help mitigate
risks facing the banking system. Specifically, a dedicated RBZ’s nostro account backing
banks’ deposits to the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) account should be established
and its balance published daily. The existing 2.5 percent statutory reserve requirement on
new deposits should be abolished. Following disposal of the RBZ’s noncore assets under
appropriate governing board supervision, the mobilized resources could be used to refund
banks’ statutory reserves on pre-March 2010 deposits. The resolution of the remaining
banks’ claims on the RBZ would need to be undertaken as part of the overall resolution
framework for the RBZ’s liabilities (see below).
26.
Establishing effective oversight over the RBZ would strengthen the credibility of
the multi-currency system. Key measures include (i) appointment of an RBZ governing
board; (ii) approval of a downsized, fully funded RBZ budget; (iii) bifurcation of the RBZ
balance sheet to isolate noncore assets and liabilities from those that are essential for
performing RBZ core functions; and (iv) adoption of a resolution framework for overdue
liabilities and transparent disposal of noncore assets. The Fund could provide TA in these
areas after an effective RBZ governing board is appointed.
27.
The multi-currency regime could continue to serve Zimbabwe well during
2010–12, while further improvements could be made to its functioning. Specifically, the
on-going work on new exchange control regulations is welcome and further advice will be
provided to ensure that new regulations improve existing regulations in the areas of
transparency of authorization procedures and internal consistency. Moreover, the supply of
coins could be improved with assistance from South Africa. However, minting local coins
would be counterproductive until RBZ governance issues are fully resolved and its financial
position is strengthened.
28.
Options for a future currency regime include full official dollarization with the
U.S. dollar or the rand, accession to the rand Common Monetary Area, and in the
longer term, a currency board arrangement or intermediate regimes. The Zimbabwe
dollar can be reintroduced as sole legal tender only once a track record of sound policies is

16
established and a credible central bank governance framework focused on price stability is
adopted and enacted.5
Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff assessment of the risks facing the
banking system. They also indicated that they would implement a liquid asset requirement of
25 percent and ring-fence the RTGS account at the RBZ in the near future. The RBZ would
also consider abolishing the 2.5 percent statutory reserve requirement once sufficient
resources have been mobilized from the disposal of its noncore assets.
30.
The authorities attached the highest importance to a speedy resolution of governance
problems at the RBZ. They were confident that an RBZ governing Board would be appointed
soon and it would quickly take appropriate actions to address governance weaknesses. The
authorities also agreed that the RBZ should be downsized and its balance sheet bifurcated
under RBZ Board supervision, and they requested Fund TA in these areas.
31.
The authorities are committed to maintaining the multi-currency system until end2012. They also indicated that beyond 2012 options involving some form of official
dollarization, including a possibility of a closer monetary cooperation with neighboring
countries, would be more realistic, as many pre-conditions for the re-introduction of the
Zimbabwe dollar outlined by the staff were not likely to be in place by 2012. The authorities
would narrow the list of possible options in the second half of 2010 and request further Fund
TA on these issues.
C. Moving toward External Stability and Sustainable Growth
Background
32.
The external position is clearly unsustainable, with external debt projected at
151 percent of GDP by 2015, with 104 percent of GDP in arrears (Supplement). The
economy performs poorly in terms of competitiveness whether it is measured by governance,
investment climate, the quality of infrastructure, or price/wage indicators.6 Even if the
authorities implemented the staff policy recommendations, the debt-overhang cannot be
resolved without debt relief (see the active policy medium-term scenario).
33.
There is a debate in Zimbabwe on whether the country’s mineral wealth can be
used to resolve external debt arrears. Staff estimate that at end-2009, Zimbabwe’s net
foreign asset (NFA) position, including the net present value of future mineral receipts under
5

See DP/10/03, Chapter 2 “Choosing a Monetary Regime.”

6

See DP/10/03, Chapter 3 “Assessing Competitiveness and External Sustainability in Zimbabwe.”

17
an optimistic scenario for the extraction of high-value minerals, is significantly negative, in
the order of 63 percent of GDP (Figure 6). Just maintaining this high level of the negative
NFA would require generating nonmineral primary external current account surpluses
whereas this balance now stands in deficit at over 35 percent of GDP. Closing such a large
gap without debt relief is not feasible in the foreseeable future, even if the challenges with
competitiveness and the business climate are addressed without further delays.

Staff recommendations
34.
To support economic growth and exports, the government would need to forge
political consensus on key structural reforms:


The regulations under the Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act need to be
reviewed to ensure that empowerment of the indigenous population does not conflict
with the government’s other objectives of attracting foreign direct investment and
ensuring equitable and transparent distribution of wealth.



A resolution of land ownership issues needs to be expedited to ensure security of land
tenure and enable the agricultural sector to undertake long-term investment.



Measures need to be taken to increase labor market flexibility, including with regard
to wage levels, which is essential for sustainability of the multi-currency system.

35.
Sound policies and debt relief in the context of a comprehensive arrears clearance
strategy (FO/DIS/09/100) agreed on among the government coalition partners and with
official creditors would help achieve external and growth sustainability, as well as increase
benefits associated with mineral wealth provided it is managed transparently.
36.
A Staff Monitored Program (SMP) would be a stepping stone toward debt relief
and new IFI lending. To make progress toward an SMP, economic policies need to be
strengthened, in particular in the areas of RBZ governance, reporting and financial
management, and public sector wages, while donors’ indications of support for an eventual
Fund financial arrangement (which itself requires, among other things, that arrears to official
creditors, including $1.4 billion to IFIs, are cleared or programmed to be cleared) would also
need to be secured.
Authorities’ views
37.
The authorities agreed that the country was in debt distress. Following intense debate
within the government on possible use of mineral wealth to resolve external debt arrears,
consensus is emerging among key government officials that mineral wealth alone would not
be sufficient to achieve debt sustainability. As a result, the government is working on a
comprehensive “hybrid” strategy involving both a request for debt relief under the HIPC
Initiative to resolve external payments arrears and use of fresh IFI financing and mineral
wealth to achieve sustainable development. The authorities also expressed strong interest in
an SMP. In this regard, they will seek to strengthen policies and data reporting, as well as
improve relations with the international community. The authorities agreed that making
timely quarterly payments to the Fund and increasing them over time, as the payment
capacity improves, will strengthen the credibility of their commitment to normalizing
relations with the Fund.
38.
The authorities acknowledged significant structural issues hampering competitiveness
and growth. Government officials are debating in the Cabinet possible revisions to
indigenization regulations to provide sufficient assurances to current and potential investors.
Pending this debate, the regulations were suspended on April 13, 2010. Regarding land
ownership, the authorities plan to undertake, in the coming months, a land audit as the first
step toward finding a solution for security of land tenure. The government also intends to
review wage setting practices in SOEs and municipalities to stop the accumulation of wage
arrears and help align wages with productivity. In addition, the authorities intend to examine
labor legislation to identify steps that need to be undertaken to ensure that companies are not
forced to award wages incompatible with productivity by arbitration courts.
V. CONCLUSION
39.
The government urgently needs to forge political consensus for addressing
significant policy challenges to support the fragile economic recovery. Key staff
recomendations include (i) returning to cash budgeting and reducing the wage bill;
(ii) containing rapidly rising risks to the banking system through a reduction of banks’

19
exposure to the financially distress RBZ and stepped up prudential measures;
(iii) strengthening RBZ governance and downsizing it; and (iv) implementing key structural
measures, including with respect to enforcement of property rights, security of land tenure,
and wage flexibility. Although reaching consensus on the recommended measures is a major
political challenge, speedy implementation of the recommendations is essential for reducing
significant macrofinancial vulnerabilities and avoiding higher costs of a forced delayed
adjustment.

Table 7. Zimbabwe: Vulnerabilities and Risks in the Banking System
Vulnerabilities

1. The Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe (RBZ) is in
financial distress and
suffers from weak
governance.

Trigger Events and their
Likelihood in the next 1-3
years

Trigger Event
a. Banks will not be able to
obtain a refund of their
statutory reserves, for which
they are entitled in case of a
possible decline in their
deposits, because these
reserves are not backed by
international reserves.
b. The RBZ may not be able to
return banks’ RTGS funds.
The RTGS account was
backed by international
reserves at mid-March
2010, but the backing could
fall short of 100 percent, as
RBZ governance remains
weak.
Likelihood: High
 The governance issues are
long-standing and are
unlikely to be fully resolved
quickly under the recently
enacted amendments to the
RBZ Act.
 There is not any plan in
place for downsizing the
RBZ to limit its operating
expenses. Nor is there a
strategy for resolving RBZ’s
overdue liabilities.
 The RBZ could continue
quasi-fiscal operations.
 Gross income is virtually
zero.

Overall Level of Concern
Expected Impact on Financial
Stability if Events are
Realized
(high, medium or low)
High
 Failure to refund statutory
reserves, when required,
may lead to loss of
confidence in the banking
system, resulting in
possible bank runs and
contagion with spreading
liquidity problems. Bank
runs may lead otherwise
solvent banks to experience
large losses, as they
struggle to mobilize less
liquid assets to meet
liquidity needs. These
losses could quickly erode
the capital position of still
weakly capitalized banks.
 An inability of the RBZ to
return RTGS funds to banks
may lead to loss of
confidence in the payments
system, discouraging its
use (which negatively
affects economic activity)
and possibly to liquidity
problems in banks, which
cannot make payment on
behalf of their customers.
This may lead to a general
loss of confidence in the
banking system, with
possibly severe effects on
the fragile macroeconomic
situation.

28

Vulnerabilities

Trigger Events and their
Likelihood in the next 1-3 years

2. There is no lender of last
resort or interbank market
for the banking system,
exposing banks to
increased liquidity risk.

Trigger Event
Rapid credit growth has been
raising the loan-to-deposit ratio to
levels where some banks may
start to face liquidity constraints.
Unexpected liquidity shocks could
be difficult for these banks to
manage without a lender of last
resort.

3. The banking system is
weakly capitalized with
capital consisting mostly
of revalued bank
premises, which is not
readily available to meet
unexpected losses.

Likelihood: Medium
 The absence of a lender of last
resort or interbank market
complicates liquidity
management for banks.
 The liquid asset-to-short-term
liabilities ratio of some banks
dropped quickly over the
course of 2009.
Trigger Event
Banks do not have sufficient
capital or cannot make the capital
they hold quickly available to meet
unexpected losses from loan or
other assets, including claims on
the RBZ.
Likelihood: Medium
 Banks are weakly capitalized,
with significant exposure to the
financially distressed RBZ
which is now counted toward
capital (70 percent of banks’
capital).
.
 The RBZ has required banks
to increase their minimum
capital and most banks have
met the first required tranche
in 2009Q4, indicating some
ability of the banking system to
raise additional capital.
However, this ability may have
been undermined by increased
uncertainties about the
indigenization process.

Overall Level of Concern
Expected Impact on Financial
Stability if Events are
Realized
(high, medium or low)
High
 Liquidity problems in one or
a few banks may lead to
bank runs, and contagion to
other banks, resulting in a
general loss of confidence
in the banking system.
Bank runs may lead
otherwise solvent banks to
experience large losses as
they struggle to mobilize
less liquid assets to meet
liquidity needs. These
losses could quickly erode
the capital position of still
weakly capitalized banks.

High
 If banks are unable to use
their existing (notional)
capital base to meet losses
and are unable to raise
additional capital, they may
be forced into bankruptcy.
Failure of one or more
banks may lead to a general
loss of confidence in the
banking system, with
adverse effects on the
fragile macroeconomic
situation.

29
Table 7 (concluded). Zimbabwe: Vulnerabilities and Risks in the Banking System
Vulnerabilities

4. Rapid credit growth in a
banking system with
possibly eroded
underwriting skills
creates heightened
credit risks.

5. The external position is
precarious.

Trigger Events and their
Likelihood in the next 1-3 years

Trigger Event
There is a sharp rise in nonperforming loans.
Likelihood: Medium
 The long history of high- and
hyper-inflation is likely to have
eroded loan underwriting skills in
banks.
 While reported aggregate NPLs
remain low, this is likely mostly a
reflection of the immaturity of the
loan portfolio, a possible lack of
experience in correctly
assessing loan quality, and
potentially hidden evergreening
of mostly short-term loans.
 High credit growth is usually
strongly correlated with future
increases in NPLs.
 Strong credit growth is in part
attributable to moral suasion to
lend to drought-prone
agriculture.
Trigger Event
Balance of payments pressure
forces a contraction in banks’ liquid
foreign assets under the multicurrency system, leading to liquidity
difficulties in the banking system.
Likelihood: High
 Under the multi-currency
system, balance of payments
pressure leads to an outflow of
funds (i.e., nostro accounts and
cash in vaults) from banks.
 With high credit growth and
concomitant domestic creation of
U.S. dollar-denominated
deposits, the above factor may
lead to liquidity shortages for
banks.
 The banking system is unlikely
to be able to borrow abroad to
resolve these liquidity issues.

Overall Level of Concern
Expected Impact on Financial
Stability if Events are Realized
(high, medium or low)
Medium
 A sharp increase in
nonperforming loans would
impact profitability by lowering
interest income and requiring
loan provisioning. Weakly
capitalized banks would have
difficulty to withstand significant
loan losses.
 Failure of one or more banks
could lead to a general loss of
confidence in the banking
system, with negative effects on
the fragile macroeconomic
situation.

High
 Without a domestic currency or
a lender of last resort, a
systemic liquidity shortage may
lead to bank runs and a general
loss of confidence in the
banking system, further
exacerbating the demand for
liquidity.
 Faced with a systemic liquidity
shortage, banks are likely to
respond with a sharp
curtailment of credit, with a
strong contractionary effect on
economic activity.
 Knock-on effects of the
economic contraction through
rising NPLs would exacerbate
the effects on the financial
sector.

VII. Implementation of HIPC Initiative: Not Applicable
VIII. Implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI): Not Applicable
IX. Application of Remedial Measures under the Arrears Strategy
Zimbabwe has been in continuous arrears to the Fund since February 2001. On September 24, 2001, the
Executive Board declared Zimbabwe ineligible to use the general resources of the Fund and removed it
from the list of PRGT-eligible countries. On June 13, 2002, the Board issued a declaration of noncooperation with respect to Zimbabwe and suspended all technical assistance to the country. On June 6,
2003, the Board suspended Zimbabwe’s voting and related rights in the Fund. A complaint with respect to
compulsory withdrawal was issued on February 6, 2004. The Executive Board considered the complaint
on July 7, 2004, on February 15, 2005, and again on September 9, 2005 and decided to postpone the
recommendation on Zimbabwe’s compulsory withdrawal from the Fund to the Board of Governors so as
to give more time for Zimbabwe to improve cooperation with the Fund. On February 15, 2006, Zimbabwe
fully settled its arrears to the General Resources Account. As a consequence, the Managing Director
withdrew his complaint for compulsory withdrawal. However, the Executive Board decided not to restore
Zimbabwe’s voting and related rights, nor did it terminate Zimbabwe’s ineligibility to use the general
resources of the Fund. The Executive Board kept in place the decisions taken to address Zimbabwe’s
arrears to the PRGT Trust—the declaration of noncooperation, the suspension of technical assistance, and
the removal of Zimbabwe from the list of PRGT-eligible countries. Zimbabwe’s arrears to the PRGT
Trust remain, amounting to SDR 89.3 million (US$137 million) as of March 31, 2010. On May 4, 2009,
the Executive Board lifted the suspension of technical assistance to Zimbabwe in the following areas:
(i) tax policy and administration, (ii) payments system, (iii) lender-of-last resort and banking supervision,
(iv) central banking governance and accounting (EBS/09/55). The last review of Zimbabwe’s overdue
financial obligations to the PRGT Trust was completed in August 2009 (EBS/09/131, 8/27/2009), and the
Executive Board decided the Fund should continue its technical assistance in targeted areas but that the
other measures to address Zimbabwe’s arrears to the PRGT Trust should remain in place. On February 19,
2010, the Executive Board restored Zimbabwe’s voting rights and its eligibility for general resources.

4
B. Nonfinancial Relations
X. Exchange Arrangement
Zimbabwe’s exchange system has been significantly liberalized and exchange rates have been
unified. Apart from one remaining exchange restriction subject to IMF jurisdiction arising from
unsettled balances under an inoperative bilateral payments agreement with Malaysia, payments and
transfers for current international transactions can now be effected without restriction.
Since 2009, Zimbabwe has adopted hard currencies for transactions (i.e., multi-currency regime)
with the U.S. dollar as principal currency; and use of the Zimbabwe dollar as domestic currency
was discontinued over the period 2010–12. The de facto exchange regime is classified as exchange
arrangement with no separate legal tender.
XI. Article IV Consultation
Zimbabwe is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The Executive Board discussed the staff
report for the 2009 consultation on May 4, 2009.
XII. Technical Assistance
2009 MCM mission on payments systems, lender-of-last resort operations and banking
supervision, and central banking governance and accounting

APPENDIX III. ZIMBABWE—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of April, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. There are
serious shortcomings in all major datasets. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) needs to
rebuild its capacity and acquire new equipment. All technical assistance from the Fund was
suspended on June 13, 2002, when the Executive Board issued a declaration of
noncooperation regarding Zimbabwe. On May 4, 2009, the Executive Board lifted the
suspension of technical assistance in targeted areas, including assistance in some areas of
monetary and fiscal statistics. Data on employment and wages are no longer published, and a
new labor force and child labor survey will be needed to revive the publication of
comprehensive labor statistics.
National Accounts: The most recent publication of national accounts data includes
developments until 2008 in Zimbabwe dollars and U.S. dollars and uses 1990 as the base
year for constant prices. The production of national accounts is constrained by both
insufficient input data, limited by low survey response rates, and insufficient processing and
other resource capacity. Benchmark data for industrial production are based on a survey
made in 1999 and services are based on a survey made in 1981. The last income,
consumption, and expenditure survey of any reasonable quality was made in 2001 (a survey
made in 2007/08 collected data that is distorted due to hyperinflation). At the same time,
some input data, for example a recent agriculture and livestock survey, remains unprocessed
due to insufficient capacity. Staff has produced provisional estimates of value added in U.S.
dollars for 2009 based on a sector-by-sector production approach. The authorities are
reviewing the staff’s estimates and plan to produce official estimates in the near future.
Price statistics: The CSO published a new consumer price index (CPI) based on prices in
U.S. dollars, with December 2008 as the base, for the first time on March 24, 2009.
Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) does not report on fiscal
developments at the general government level, including local governments and all other
government units. Reporting of government finance statistics for the central government has
improved significantly over the past twelve months. The MoF collects data on revenue and
expenditure, which are published on its website on a bi-annual basis, along with budget
statements. The MoF is in the process of reconciling its data on external debt, in particular
interest payments on principal and arrears, with external creditors.

7

Monetary statistics: The RBZ produces monthly monetary and financial statistics with an
irregular lag of three to six months. The quality of the data has deteriorated substantially over
the years because of previous hyperinflation and the transition to accounting in U.S. dollars,
weak accounting practices, and quasi-fiscal activities. The auditors provided an adverse
opinion of the 2008 RBZ financial statement based on two observations: the
hyperinflationary environment in 2008 and failures within the RBZ’s financial reporting
systems that is, inability to account for foreign currency purchases and internal control
deficiencies. MCM technical assistance in 2009 and the Article IV missions in 2009 and
2010 made recommendations on central bank accounting and the compilation of net
international reserves data, including identification of encumbered assets, and the need to
ensure completeness of foreign currency liabilities. The authorities provided data based on
these recommendations. The RBZ has not published comprehensive monetary statistics since
April 2008.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments and external debt statistics are subject to a
number of data issues. Labor income and workers’ remittances do not include estimates of
cash and in-kind transfers from Zimbabweans working abroad. Interest payments are not
reconciled with creditors’ records and do not contain accrued interest on overdue financial
obligations. Current and capital transfers to nongovernmental organizations and to the
government are not fully reconciled with donors’ data. The financial account is incomplete,
as it does not record substantial transactions in assets that are reported by central banks that
are members of the Bank for International Settlements. The RBZ’s initial submission of
flows and stocks of gross international reserves and its net foreign assets position often
require substantial adjustments. Exceptional financing does not fully capture the flow of
overdue financial obligations. External sector data are reported to the staff irregularly with
significant delays.
II. Data Standards and Quality
General Data Dissemination System

participant.
III. Reporting to STA
Zimbabwe does not report balance of payments statistics to STA for redissemination in the
International Financial Statistics or the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. No
monetary or fiscal data are currently reported to STA for publication in the International
Financial Statistics, and annual fiscal data are also not reported for inclusion in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. National accounts data have not been reported
since 2005 and no data are being reported for the new CPI.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
ZIMBABWE
Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by African and Strategic Policy and Review Departments
Approved by Sharmini Coorey and Dominique Desruelle
April 29, 2010
1.
Zimbabwe is in arrears to most of its creditors. At the end of 2009, total publicand publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt1 amounted to US$6.9 billion or 157 percent of GDP, of
which 102 percent of GDP was in arrears. About 90 percent of total PPG debt is mediumand long-term debt and about 90 percent of total PPG is owed to official creditors.
Zimbabwe’s overdue financial obligations to IFIs include the World Bank (US$731 million),
African Development Bank (US$483 million), and the IMF (US$140 million).
2.
Zimbabwe’s debt sustainability analysis (DSA) is subject to important caveats.
The authorities are reconciling their debt stock and debt service data with individual
creditors, but this process has not been completed. As a result, this DSA is based on
nonreconciled debt numbers and staff estimates of accrued interest and penalties on arrears.
In addition to data deficiencies, making medium- and long-term projections is complicated
by the country’s poor long-term policy track record and significant uncertainties regarding
policy direction. In light of these factors, the results of this exercise should be treated as
highly tentative.
3.
Zimbabwe is clearly in debt distress. If current policies continue and donor
financing is largely confined to humanitarian assistance in the medium term (Box), the large
debt stock would remain unresolved and arrears would continue to build up. While most debt
ratios are projected to decline gradually, they would remain at unsustainable levels over the
medium and long term. Historical sensitivity analysis shows that most debt ratios are
projected to increase over the long term from current unsustainable levels, reflecting the
impact of negative economic trends during the last decade.
1

Staff estimates of the stock of external PPG medium- and long-term debt include: (i) external PPG mediumand long-term debt based on original maturities; (ii) domestic foreign currency-denominated debt; (iii) arrears
on initial principal and interest obligations; and (iv) estimated accrued penalties on arrears. The projected use of
the SDR allocation of $210 million is not included in external debt, but related net interest charges are included
in debt service and present value calculations.

2

Public and publicly guaranteed external debt sustainability
4.
The baseline scenario assumes a more pessimistic outlook compared with the
previous DSA (IMF Country Report No.09/139). A weakening of macroeconomic policy
discipline and the structural reform momentum has worsened prospects for real GDP and
export growth, as well as the ability of the country to attract foreign investment and donor
financing. Annual real GDP growth is now projected to average at 1.5 percent for the period
2010–15 and at about 3.0 percent during 2016–30 (Box). The non-interest external current
account deficit is projected to fall from 16 percent of GDP in 2010 to 6 percent in 2015,
mainly as a result of the projected drying up of private capital inflows and concomitant
import compression. External financing gaps would remain over the long term, and they are
assumed to be financed by continued buildup of external payments arrears.
5.
In the baseline scenario, at end-2009, PPG external debt indicators exceed thresholds
for LICs that are considered poor performers.2 These ratios are projected to continue to
exceed corresponding thresholds by a large margin, and decline only gradually over the long
term.
Box. Key medium-term macroeconomic assumptions for the DSA:


Real GDP is projected to grow at 1.5 to 3 percent in the medium and long term.
Economic growth, in particular in key export-oriented sectors, including mining,
manufacturing, and agriculture, would be constrained by persistent infrastructure
bottlenecks, relatively high wage costs, and continued problems with the business
climate hampering investment.



Donor support is assumed to be largely confined to humanitarian assistance.



FDI, portfolio investment, and private sector borrowing would remain limited in the
medium and long term.



Import growth would be constrained by sluggish export performance and low
capital inflows and nonhumanitarian official financing.



Owing to lack of access to foreign and domestic financing, the government is
projected to run balanced budgets on a cash basis in the medium and long term,
but the stock of domestic payments arrears would increase. Given the current
policy of allocating significant budgetary resources to wages and no scope for a
significant revenue-to-GDP ratio increase, essential infrastructure projects would
remain underfinanced.

2

Zimbabwe is treated as a weak policy performer for the purpose of this LIC DSA. The policy-based thresholds
for the present value (PV) of PPG external debt are as follows: 200 percent of revenue; 100 percent of exports;
and 30 percent of GDP.

3

6.
The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that Zimbabwe’s already precarious
external debt situation could get even worse. Due to the poor macroeconomic performance
during the past decade, historical analysis suggests that external debt indicators could
increase rapidly (rather than gradually decline) in the medium to long term compared with
the baseline scenario.
Public debt sustainability
7.
The baseline scenario assumes limited progress in fiscal policy implementation.
Budget revenue is projected to remain at around 26 percent of GDP over the medium to long
term. The wage bill will continue to claim a large share of total revenue, leaving virtually no
room for growth-enhancing capital expenditures.
8.
The initial public domestic debt level is low, but it is expected to increase in the
medium term. Local currency-denominated domestic debt was fully repaid in January 2009.
The RBZ’s foreign currency-denominated domestic debt (which forms part of total domestic
public debt for the purpose of this DSA) is estimated at $419 million (10 percent of GDP)
and government domestic payments arrears at $48 million (1.2 percent of GDP) at endDecember 2009. The projected continued accumulation of government domestic payments
arrears over the medium term drives the increase in the stock of domestic public debt.
9.
Zimbabwe’s overall public debt is unsustainable. The initial high level of external
public debt and relatively high scheduled debt service payments, along with the inability to
generate primary surplus or achieve higher real GDP growth, would result in the persistence
of public debt ratio above sustainable levels. Public debt is estimated to gradually decline
from 157 percent of GDP in 2009 to about 119 percent of GDP in 2020. The present value of
the debt-to-revenue ratio is projected to remain at about 400 to 500 percent through 2020.
The debt service-to-revenue ratio is projected to decline to about 30 percent by 2020.
Conclusion
Zimbabwe is in debt distress, which is compounded by unresolved economic policy
challenges. Achieving debt sustainability would require a significant strengthening of
economic policies and an improvement of relations with the international community whose
support is essential for securing debt relief.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 25, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Zimbabwe
On May 17, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Zimbabwe.1
Background
As a result of significant improvements in policies, real gross domestic product (GDP) is
estimated to have grown by about 4 percent in 2009, following a contraction of about 14
percent in 2008. Strong growth was reported in manufacturing and services. The
officially reported 12-month consumer price index (CPI) in U.S. dollar terms declined by
about 8 percent in December 2009.
The humanitarian situation has improved. Most schools and hospitals have been reopened. Owing to good rainfall and positive effects of better policies in 2009, food
security improved. Incidence of cholera has declined. In 2009, donors provided
significant off-budget financing for social services and humanitarian assistance (about
US$540 million, or 12 percent of GDP) to help fill some of the gap left by severely
constrained fiscal resources.
The government broadly adhered to cash budgeting in 2009. Budget revenue and
grants increased from less than 4 percent of GDP during hyperinflation in 2008 to an
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

estimated 22 percent of GDP (US$975 million) in 2009, mainly on account of indirect
taxes. The improved revenue performance is attributable to the stabilization of prices
and strong tax policy and administration measures (1.3 percent of GDP), which were
largely implemented following IMF technical assistance advice. Budgetary cash
expenditures––21 percent of GDP (US$920 million)—were skewed toward employment
costs (53 percent of revenue), as the government transformed a uniform US$100 per
month allowance into wages and implemented large differentiated wage and pension
increases on July 1, 2009. As a result, capital expenditures only accounted for 1 percent
of GDP and many social programs remained underfunded. The government has
strengthened its public financial management system with World Bank assistance.
The multi-currency regime helped promote financial intermediation. Deposits with banks
tripled between end-March and end-December 2009, and banks’ loan portfolios grew
six-fold (although from a very low base). Strong credit growth supported the nascent
economic recovery, but it also contributed to a widening current account deficit and
rising vulnerabilities in the banking system.
Serious governance problems have remained at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ).
Accounting and internal controls are weak, and there was no approved budget for RBZ
operations in 2009. The RBZ’s quasi-fiscal activities amounted to 0.5 percent of GDP,
substantial resources were used for debt repayments to selected creditors, and its
arrears on operating expenses increased significantly in 2009. However, the
appointment of an RBZ Board on May 3, 2010 is a step toward resolving RBZ
governance issues and refocusing its activities on its core functions under the multicurrency regime.
The external position remains precarious. Volatile short-term capital inflows and external
payment arrears financed the current account deficit that is estimated to have widened
to 30 percent of GDP in 2009, from 24 percent in 2008. Significant capacity constraints,
in part related to a weak business climate, depressed export earnings in 2009, while
rapidly increasing domestic credit and capital inflows, as well as higher humanitarian aid,
financed increased import demand. The external debt continued to grow mainly as a
consequence of new payment arrears and interest and penalty charges on existing
payment arrears, but new private sector short-term borrowing also added to the external
debt estimated at US$7.1 billion (162 percent of GDP) by end-2009.
The outlook for 2010 is highly uncertain. Large budgetary wage increases crowding out
growth-oriented expenditures, a significant slowdown in private capital inflows because
of increased uncertainties about the indigenization process, and strong credit growth
have intensified external and banking system vulnerabilities. In the absence of timely
corrective policy measures, economic growth would slow down significantly in 2010 and
risks in the banking system would continue to rise.

3
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the recent improvement in Zimbabwe’s macroeconomic
performance and humanitarian conditions following a decade of economic decline and
high inflation. To solidify these gains, as well as to reduce the significant external and
financial vulnerabilities, it will be critical that the authorities undertake decisive policy
measures.
Directors agreed that the main fiscal challenge is to create sufficient space for social
and developmental expenditure. They strongly encouraged the authorities to return to
cash budgeting, and reduce the wage bill and other low-priority expenditures. Directors
welcomed the significant improvement in revenue performance and emphasized that
additional revenue measures would be necessary. They also urged the authorities to
refrain from further use of nonconcessional special drawing rights (SDR)-related funds
for budget financing and to save Zimbabwe’s SDR holdings as part of the country’s
international reserves.
Directors expressed concern about the increasing systemic vulnerabilities in the banking
system. Addressing the governance weaknesses of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is
crucial for achieving banking system stability. In this regard, Directors welcomed the
recent appointment of the RBZ governing Board, which should oversee a strengthening
of RBZ governance and implementation of its downsizing and restructuring. Directors
called for stepping up prudential supervision to contain credit and liquidity risks in the
banking system and cautioned against moral suasion on banks to lend to specific
sectors.
Directors considered that the multi-currency system would serve Zimbabwe well in the
coming years. They agreed that the Zimbabwe dollar can be reintroduced as sole legal
tender only after a track record of sound policies is established and a central bank
governance framework with a focus on price stability is adopted.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intentions to improve the business climate. They
emphasized the importance of enforcing property rights and maintaining the rule of law,
ensuring security of land tenure, and increasing the flexibility of the labor market, in
particular with respect to wage levels. Sustained progress in these areas is essential for
improving competitiveness, boosting private sector investment, and increasing growth
potential.
Directors agreed that Zimbabwe is in debt distress. Sound policies and good
governance will be critical to pave the way for eventual debt relief and access to donor
financing. In this context, Directors strongly encouraged the authorities to improve their
cooperation with the Fund on policies and payments. Most Directors supported the
continuation of the Fund’s technical assistance in targeted areas. Many Directors were
of the view that a Staff Monitored Program (SMP) could help establish a track record of

4
sound policies. Some Directors, however, stressed that the authorities must
demonstrate clear progress in economic policies and data reporting before an SMP
could be considered.
Directors noted Zimbabwe’s significant deficiencies in the quality and timeliness of data
reporting, which are in large part explained by capacity constraints. They underscored
the need for rapidly improving macroeconomic statistics with Fund technical assistance.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

May 17, 2010
The Zimbabwean authorities thank the Executive Board for restoring the country’s voting
and related rights on February 19, 2010. Zimbabwe has benefited from the targeted Technical
Assistance (TA), following the Board decision of May 4, 2009 to lift the suspension of TA in
targeted areas. The country has embarked on a path of economic recovery following the
implementation of liberalization measures including removal of price controls and adoption
of multi-currency regime. The country posted a much stronger economic growth performance
of 5.1 percent compared to a projection of 4.7 percent in 2009. Hyperinflation dropped from
231 million percent in 2008 to -7.7 percent in 2009. However, economic recovery remains
fragile. The country continues to face several challenges, including political and governance
issues, high debt-overhang, resource constraints, limited institutional capacity, large external
current account deficit, as well as weaknesses in the business environment.
While the authorities recognize staff’s concern regarding Zimbabwe’s overdue financial
obligations to the PRGT, undermined by inadequate progress in the implementation of fiscal
consolidation, they have embarked on several fronts to address the associated challenges. The
authorities have reviewed salaries but note that, given the relatively high wages in
neighboring countries, pressures to raise wages have remained unabated. There is clearly an
urgent need to strengthen fiscal policy—including the relatively high public sector wage bill
as the economy emerges from a near total collapse—in order to crowd in capital investment
and not jeopardize economic recovery and the prospects for satisfactory growth. The
authorities are already prioritizing and managing expenditures to ring fence revenues for
development capital projects and programs. A cap has been placed on the current wage bill
while additional measures are being considered to enhance revenues, including receipts from
diamond exports and a reform of income taxes.
On the expenditure side, recruitment in non-critical vacant positions has been frozen, and a
review of both labor laws and related institutional arrangements will be expedited to link
wages to labor productivity. Moreover, a civil service audit has been undertaken and the
report, which is expected by end-May 2010, will be availed to the public in July 2010. The
aim of the audit is to improve public service delivery and eliminate ghost workers. A high
level committee has also been set up to formulate recommendations to reduce the cost of
living, including rationalizing utility tariffs and improving the management of public utilities.
The authorities introduced cash budgeting to contain the budget deficit and they would like to
underscore their commitment to this approach. The accumulation of domestic arrears pertains
to 2009 and 2010 utilities bills, challenges relating to procurement lags between delivery of
goods and services and verification of receipts, and the difficulties that the authorities are
encountering in executing the cash budget. While donors have provided significant offbudget financing for social services and humanitarian assistance to help finance the deficit,
they have so far lagged behind in meeting their budget support commitments, resulting in
delays in implementing several capital projects and the shift of resources to prevent costly
postponements. The authorities’ ability to attain cash budgeting has further been impaired by

2
the global financial and economic turmoil that has impacted adversely the already meager
export receipts and government revenues.
After very careful deliberation, the authorities decided to use the only viable source of
financing, their SDR allocation, to meet urgent humanitarian needs and focused spending to
rehabilitate the agriculture sector, essential infrastructure, and support ongoing projects.
While the authorities are aware of the need to rebuild reserves, the shock to the Zimbabwe
economy, the extent of humanitarian needs and the urgency to start rehabilitating the
economy could have only been mitigated through the partial use of the SDR allocations. The
authorities did not take the decision to use their SDR allocation lightly and this should not be
seen as weak fiscal policy implementation.
To strengthen public finance management and reduce the risks for emergency resources, the
authorities have passed supportive Public Finance Management and Audit Acts to ensure
improved accountability and oversight of the use of public resources, as well as to promote
good governance. The new Public Finance Management Act aims at closing loopholes in
public finance management and gives confidence to stakeholders. Moreover, it should help in
matching expenditures with available resources. Moving the process further, Fund TA could
help enhance cash management efforts by public enterprises and local
government/authorities.
Further actions to enhance growth include introduction of regulations under the
Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act aimed at correcting imbalances by creating
room for greater participation of the local people in all sectors of the economy. However,
implementation of the Act has been put on hold to facilitate Cabinet discussion of
amendments to the regulations in order to ensure that the country remains attractive for
foreign direct investment.
The authorities regret that staff felt there is weakened cooperation with the Fund. Substantial
advances have been made by the authorities in implementing TA recommendations on the
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governance and accounting. Reform of the RBZ is
currently underway with the establishment of a new Board on May 3, 2010 as a step towards
refocusing the bank to its core functions and addressing the challenges it faces. The new
Board is tasked with devising a strategy for right-sizing the RBZ’s huge staff compliment,
and restoring its operational viability as lender of last resort. Moreover, the Board is tasked to
deal with issues of disposing the bank’s quasi-fiscal assets and operations, and putting in
place committees for monetary policy and audit. The authorities are coming up with
legislation that will address the RBZ indebtedness through a RBZ debt reconstruction bill.
The Ministry of Finance will continue making budgetary allocations to the RBZ in a bid to
restore its viability. With most of its monetary functions “crippled”, the bank is committed to
focus on other functions, including financial sector oversight and overseeing the national
payments system. This is an area where the authorities would welcome Fund TA and
consider that the newly instituted Board should be given sufficient time to perform.
In the area of fiscal policy, the authorities have implemented most of the TA
recommendations that could be done immediately. This has resulted in a significant

3
improvement in revenue performance. Other recommendations are being considered in the
context of the overall medium-term adjustment framework. In this regard, the authorities are
working very closely with the IMF, World Bank, and the African Development Bank.
Zimbabwe is in debt distress. The authorities recognize that the debt-overhang cannot be
resolved without debt relief from the international community, including from the IMF. They
are developing a debt relief and arrears clearance strategy and have taken initial steps, with
the support of the African Development Bank, to engage the services of a debt consultant.
Further help was received from the UK’s Department for International Development (DfID)
and Macroeconomic and Financial Management Institute of Eastern and Southern Africa
(MEFMI) in the areas of debt management and debt sustainability analysis. A Debt
Management office is being set up to undertake debt management and risk analysis,
settlements and management of the debt information system, and assist in the mobilization of
resources.
Regarding arrears to the Fund, it should be recalled that due to the cash flow difficulties, the
authorities developed a quarterly payment plan of US$l00,000 towards clearance of the
PRGT arrears in 2009, with emphasis to give priority to increasing such payments as
resources become available. This commitment was welcomed by the IMF Executive Board in
April 2009. In line with the commitment, the authorities have paid slightly more,
demonstrating their clear intent to cooperate fully with the Fund and their commitment to
resolve the issue of arrears. The authorities will continue making timely quarterly payments
and increasing the amount with improvements in payment capacity.
In order to address the many challenges, the authorities have devised a three year macroeconomic policy and budget framework for 2010-2012 (Short Term Emergency Recovery
Program II) aimed at enhancing growth, competiveness and poverty reduction. In this regard,
the authorities consider a Staff Monitored Program (SMP) as an instrument for advancing
their reform efforts and as a critical step towards debt relief. This would also aid in
strengthening policies and ameliorating the difficult relationship with the international
community. In the context of an SMP, the authorities would continue their efforts to improve
data reporting with appropriate TA from the Fund.
In conclusion, the authorities consider an SMP to be an appropriate framework for addressing
the issues raised in the 2010 Article IV consultations and request Board support in this
direction. They welcome continued cordial working relationship with the Fund.
