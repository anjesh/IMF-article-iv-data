Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2011 Consultation with Montenegro
Approved by Adam Bennett and Tom Dorsey

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Since independence in 2006, the Montenegrin economy has gone from boom to bust and is only now
beginning to recover. Missteps were made during the run-up to the crisis, but the authorities are now
working to put the economy on a sounder footing. The 2011 Article IV discussions focused on:


Avoiding a relapse into recession. The recovery is fragile and the policy arsenal has not been
replenished. In the short run, policies must aim at restoring the health of the banking system,
and removing impediments to restructuring the economy and deleveraging.



Anchoring potential growth on a sustainable path. A strategy centered on enabling private
sector-led growth, a smaller government, and deregulation, which would all serve to improve
competitiveness, is the prerequisite.



Securing the economy’s resilience by building policy buffers. The lack of fiscal space, in
particular, at the onset of the crisis severely restricted the authorities’ room for maneuver in
dealing with it. The crisis proved that large capital and liquidity buffers and sizeable
government assets are required.

The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the economic situation and the key policy
recommendations.
Montenegro does not issue its own currency, but has been using the euro as legal tender since 2002,
and has accepted the obligations under Article VIII. Montenegro maintains an exchange
system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions, except with respect to pre-1992 blocked foreign currency savings accounts and
restrictions maintained for security purposes that have not been notified to the Fund.
The staff team comprising Messrs. Bell (head), Castro, and Stepanyan (all EUR), Lundback (MCM)
and Zeng (FAD) visited Podgorica from February 9–23, 2011. Mr. Tomic (Advisor to the Executive
Director) joined the discussions. The mission met with Prime Minister Luksic, Minister of Finance
Katnic, Central Bank Governor Zugic, other Ministers and senior officials, as well as representatives
of the Parliament, financial and business sectors, academia, and trade unions.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Since its independence in 2006, Montenegro has experienced an economic and
financial roller coaster ride. The country’s abundant potential attracted large capital
inflows, an increasing share of which were debt creating. With expectations of rising living
standards, the inflows helped fuel a domestic demand boom. Wealth effects made real estate
lending and absorption booms mutually reinforcing, and overstretched the nascent financial
sector’s ability to guard against risks. The economy began to overheat and then, as
elsewhere, the inflows juddered to a halt. The result was a sharp decline in output (Tables 1
and 2).

The boom/bust cycle overwhelmed the policy framework. Huge vulnerabilities
were accumulated during the boom when the authorities did not take the opportunity to
sufficiently strengthen policy buffers. With policy space exhausted at the beginning of the
crisis, the authorities were forced to adopt unconventional policies to mitigate its effects.


Unilateral euroization generally imported inappropriate monetary conditions.
During the boom the Central Bank of Montenegro (CBM) raised the cost of credit
through higher reserve requirements and tightened supervisory and prudential
standards, but credit growth was hardly

Fiscal reserves were not sufficient. The
early surpluses largely reflected
temporarily buoyant tax collections from
high imports. Initially, they were placed in
the domestic banking system, thereby
enabling further credit extension. Then at
the peak of the boom period, the fiscal
stance relaxed (through tax cuts and public
sector wage increases), leading to a
structural fiscal deficit of some 6 percent
of GDP in 2008. The remaining fiscal
buffers were quickly exhausted in the
crisis, while large loan guarantees to the
aluminum and steel companies created
substantial new contingent liabilities. By
2009 public and publicly guaranteed debt
had risen to nearly 55 percent of GDP.

Some key structural reform priorities were not addressed. Despite progress in
some areas, excessively restrictive employment protections and an unduly rigid
centralized collective bargaining system remained in place. This contributed to fast
wage growth, limited the flexibility of the corporate sector, and stifled new hiring,
thereby raising unemployment. Privatization occurred later than elsewhere in Eastern
Europe, and in consequence the interest of bidders was more limited. The large
industrial sector legacy enterprises were sold to smaller investors who lost access to
new financing during the global crisis, forcing the government to retake a significant
equity stake in the aluminum plant in exchange for extending loan guarantees. The
electricity company was sold into a thin market in 2009.

3.
The global crisis thus exerted heavy blows upon the economy. In addition to the
deposit run, the sudden stop in capital inflows also dried up financing for corporates just as
the prices of their key export products began to fall sharply. With the very large contractions
in industry and construction (Figure 2), the decline in GDP (6 percent) would have been even
worse but for the ability of the tourism sector to mostly withstand the downturn.
4.
A tentative recovery is now taking hold. A good tourism season was followed by
resumed metal production, while heavy rains in the region boosted electricity production and
exports. After contracting for almost two years, industry began to grow again in the second
half of 2010. Nevertheless, industrial production at end-2010 was still considerably below

6
of its pre-crisis peak. Expected large-scale infrastructure FDI has so far not materialized and
construction activity remains depressed. Overall 2010 GDP growth is estimated at
1.1 percent, keeping output below its 2008 level (Figure 3).
5.
The needed rebalancing of the economy has now begun. Inflation and wage
growth decelerated sharply and the current account deficit halved to around 26 percent of
GDP (Figure 4). While most of the adjustment in 2010 was due to a weather related boost in
electricity exports and rebounding metals production, the nascent adjustment in costs has also
improved competitiveness. The improved fundamentals have also contributed to the
September 2010 debut Eurobond issuance of €200 million, subsequent spread tightening, and
a further €180 million issuance in April 2011.

6.
The new government is intent on fast reform progress towards EU integration.
In granting of candidate status to Montenegro in fall 2010, the EU called for greater political
reform efforts. An end-2010 government reshuffle promoted the Minister of Finance to
Prime Minister and strengthened pro-reform forces. The government aims to commence
membership negotiations still in 2011.

For the near term, key risks are tilted to the downside, inter alia:



External environment, the key source of shocks for an open and small economy.
Should there be another sudden stop, the still very large external imbalances are at
risk of disruptive adjustment. Renewed sovereign and banking stress in the euro-area
periphery could undermine confidence and financing, while more competitive
Mediterranean neighbors could increase competition for tourists. Privatizations could
prove more difficult.



Reform fatigue and legacy structural problems. Bank restructuring has been uneven,
leaving some banks in difficult positions, with potentially adverse implications for
intermediation and confidence. The needed household deleveraging could also turn
disruptive. The restructuring of heavy industry could run into further problems;
already intermittent production stoppages are standing in the way of supplying
buoyant global commodity demand, and even current production levels may not be
sustained. The political context for continued reform and adjustment could also
become more difficult, given the recent decline in incomes.

9.
Avoiding a relapse into recession will thus require strengthening the health of
the banking system and removing impediments to restructuring the economy.

8
B. Medium-term External Rebalancing
10.
It was agreed that FDI holds the key to re-launching growth. In order to benefit
from the recovery in global capital flows, Montenegro must swiftly redress any impediments
to investment (Annex I). FDI should also be complemented by heightened domestic
flexibility and cost competitiveness in order to avoid renewed overheating pressures and to
help provide the spark for domestic investment, notably in labor-intensive SMEs.
11.
FDI will also be essential for external rebalancing. While there is a need to boost
cost competitiveness, it was agreed that leaving rebalancing to macroeconomic policies
alone—which in Montenegro’s case would largely amount to engineering an internal
devaluation via fiscal and incomes policies—would require an excessive degree of domestic
adjustment, if such policies were not accompanied by productivity- and capacity enhancing
investment. This is also a reflection of the small size of the economy, as only a handful of
projects—which do not have to be large in absolute terms—can drastically alter economic
prospects. Thus, the current account in any given period may not be a reliable indicator for
such economies, which is also reflected in the inconclusive CGER assessment (Box 1)1. Still,
staff suggested it would be prudent to consider the real exchange rate to be somewhat
overvalued. While not taking a view on the level of the real exchange rate, the authorities
stressed that their policy focus on structural reform and fiscal consolidation would improve
competitiveness in any event.
12.
Montenegro’s attractiveness to investors will depend on reducing
macroeconomic and structural vulnerabilities. The authorities and staff agreed that these
tasks are mutually reinforcing; lessened vulnerabilities will help dispel reservations among
potential investors, while higher levels of investment could create positive agglomeration
effects thereby strengthening fundamentals. Conversely, without buoyant investment, the
consolidation task would be harder. Montenegro’s EU candidacy should provide a key
comparative advantage in attracting investment, and the authorities are eager to quickly
commence negotiations.
13.
Provided the required policies are in place, the medium term outlook is
favorable. The authorities and staff agreed that a strategy centered on enabling private
sector-led growth, healthy banks, smaller government, and deregulation should form the
basis for sustainable growth ahead. The country’s unique geography and favorable climate
still offer large untapped potential, e.g., in tourism and hydro-electricity. This could well
trigger larger-than-currently-projected FDI. Even in this case, though, the above policy
recommendations would still be beneficial to lessen the danger of Dutch disease. Discussions
on the specific policy requirements are described in the following sections.

production and some import contraction.

C. Boosting Employment
14.
There is consensus on the need to improve the performance of the labor market.
Unemployment is high and participation low (Figure 5). Moreover, a distinct segmentation of
the labor market has occurred, with employment of foreign workers serving as the buffer.
Thus the headline change of domestic employment understates the decline of actual
employment (including that of foreigners). Even so, domestic unemployment has crept up,
with anecdotal evidence of a large share being long-term unemployed.
15.
“Insiders” are dominating the policy debate. Strong employment protection has
contributed to low wage flexibility and—in the industrial sector—has effectively stalled
restructuring.2 High costs of layoffs are also a disincentive to new hiring, especially of older
workers losing their jobs in restructurings. There are also sizeable impediments to labor
supply implied by an unemployment trap as the unemployed stand to lose several social
benefits if they accept employment. The recent more-than-doubling of the minimum wage
(compared to the previous “minimum price of labor”) aggravated this problem by depressing
demand for low-skilled workers, further marginalizing this vulnerable group. There are
strong political pressures to further tighten employment protection and to limit the
application of fixed term contracts, e.g., in a draft revision of the labor law.
16.
The staff argued for employment friendly reform. The contrasting experiences of
the tourism and heavy industry sectors offered salient lessons: the former, in which
liberalized foreign employment is essential, was nimble in adjusting to the global recession
and registered growth throughout the crisis, whereas the latter is struggling despite global
buoyant commodity demand. Staff saw significant scope for raising both labor supply and
demand.


Labor demand could be boosted by raising flexibility with a view toward creating
and sustaining jobs; for example, the authorities could engage the social partners in
order to provide scope for the introduction of temporary opt-out clauses from
collective bargaining agreements to allow for emergency restructuring, or to boost the
nascent tradable-oriented private sector. Similarly, the recent doubling of the
minimum wage should be revisited and excessive employment protection be reduced.
Moreover, public sector wage restraint and pension reforms, in addition to their
importance for fiscal consolidation, should be used to lead tight economy-wide
incomes policies.



Labor supply could commensurately rise if the very high marginal effective taxation
of the unemployed was cut. One option is the incorporation of negative
income-taxation elements, e.g., an Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) (Annex II). This

2

more than 400 percent of per capita GDP.

11
scheme would also provide an incentive for formal employment (as only incomes
earned in the formal sector would be benefitting from a cash payment), thereby
reducing its costs. The authorities expressed an interest to study the issue and were
also looking at targeted active labor market measures to lower skill mismatches.
17.
The business environment needs to be further improved. The authorities are
focusing on upgrading technical and administrative skills of government agencies that
provide business services, and streamlining construction licensing by municipalities. Staff
welcomed these efforts that targeted key weaknesses documented in surveys, and also noted
that improved economic statistics are essential to bolster investment and policy making.
D. Banking and Financial Sector
18.
Redressing solvency issues and improving liquidity were jointly seen as priority
tasks. Confidence is returning, as evidenced by increasing deposits, though they are still
below their levels in the third quarter of 2007. However, NPLs have not leveled off and
Financial Soundness Indicators have continued to deteriorate (Table 5 and Box 2). There was
agreement that the next steps must focus on fully restoring soundness across the system in
order to allow for renewed lending growth when credit demand for quality projects returns.
Stagnant lending at the current juncture, however, primarily reflected the dearth of such
projects and the staff recommended that the authorities continue to resist calls to force credit
growth.
19.
With the recently strengthened legal framework, the central bank is in a position
to play the central role in safeguarding financial stability. Key improvements to financial
sector legislation were enacted in 2010, including a new Central Bank Law and laws on
banks, bank bankruptcy, and deposit insurance. The authorities considered them in line with
international best practice, having benefited from Fund, World Bank and EBRD advice. Staff
stressed that, endowed with new powers, the CBM must be uncompromising in redressing
any weakness in the system. This called for continued high-frequency and risk-based audits,
and fast follow up. Adequate solvency and liquidity buffers should be required. Recent
temporary regulatory relaxations should be phased out quickly and be replaced with
permanent regulations that are fully in line with best international practice. The authorities
agreed and pointed to preparations already underway, including their joint discussions with
the World Bank on bank restructuring. Staff welcomed efforts to strengthen regulations
related to collateral execution (from corporate and households) as well as the envisaged
move to IFRS and urged to properly prepare for it.

Bank owners must promptly address
any slippages from regulations, especially

last years, foreign parent banks have remained
supportive. Meanwhile the ability of domestic
owners was impaired owing to the sudden stop.

indicated that they were intensively working on a solution for the largest domestic bank that
would incorporate these recommendations.
Box 2. Financial Soundness Compared to Other Emerging Europe Countries
The global financial crisis has left the banking system in Montenegro in a worse shape than in emerging
Europe in general. At end-2007, before the crises, key Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) for Montenegrin
banks did not stand out in comparison to the average for other emerging Europe countries, for which FSIs were
reported in the Spring 2011 GFSR. However, three years later, in late 2010, the picture is bleaker in
Montenegro. While capital to asset ratios have held up, including on account of owners’ capital injections,
profitability and asset quality indicators have deteriorated much more. Although one must be careful in
comparing FSI levels across countries, it is worth noting that the indicators for return on equity and assets, nonperforming loans to total loans, and provisions to total loans are the weakest in Montenegro among all of the
emerging Europe countries in the GFSR.

In any event, reserves need to be rebuilt from low levels. The empirical results for
reserves in a dollarized economy are ambiguous (Box 3). Some dollarized economies have
done quite well with relatively few reserves. At the current juncture, the authorities and staff,

13

Box 3. Liquidity Support in Other Dollarized or Currency Board Countries
In countries where the central bank cannot increase base money supply, the central bank’s capacity as a lender
of last resort is limited. This is the case in both dollarized economies like Montenegro and Kosovo, but also in
countries with a currency board such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Bulgaria. Therefore the fiscal authorities
have a particularly important financial role in supporting the banking system in times of stress in these
countries. The legal and institutional arrangements for this vary. Some countries have more explicit financial
arrangements in place, like Bulgaria, while others have tended to rely on temporary measures and legislation.
A key implication is then that the capacity of country to provide liquidity support to solvent or insolvent banks
is to a large extent determined by the financial capacity of the government. This is also true for countries with
other exchange rate arrangements, but when the central bank is not free to issue new currency, the fiscal
position is even more important.
Having said that, even in dollarized settings some liquidity support can still be provided and it is worth looking
at some measure of the liquidity support capacity of the CBM compared to central banks in other countries. The
most straightforward measure is perhaps to calculate the amount of reserves in relation to deposits in the
banking system.
Such a comparison gives a mixed picture, but the CBM’s level of reserves are not high (table below). It must be
noted that the issuance of a Eurobond in the fall of 2010 significantly boosted reserves in Montenegro. Before
the issuance, the level of reserves in relation to deposits had declined significantly in 2010 and was only above
the level in Panama. This picture is not altered by looking at net foreign assets instead.

however, saw this model as not well suited for Montenegro; a weakened banking sector and a
potentially difficult fiscal financing environment make a higher level of reserves essential.
Staff also cautioned that use of the euro placed very tight limits on central bank liquidity
support operations, such that redressing banking liquidity and solvency problems could
impose large fiscal demands. Aggressive safeguarding of the banking system in line with the
authorities’ plans is one important requirement to avoid this from happening—including by
mandating banks to hold considerably higher capital and liquidity buffers than international
norms. But staff argued that the accumulation of fiscal reserves via fiscal consolidation will
also be essential to provide an additional backstop for confidence in the system.

14
E. Fiscal Policy
22.
The budget is the key near-and medium-term policy tool. In the fully euroized
economy, fiscal policy is the only stabilization tool, is critical to backstop banking problems,
and has a role to play in boosting the economy’s attractiveness to investment. At the current
juncture all these objectives call for consolidation. Given the highly open economy, the fiscal
multiplier is unlikely to be large in any event; moreover, credible deficit cuts could well
improve investor confidence and result in renewed access to cheaper capital.
23.
Fiscal consolidation has commenced, and the authorities’ budget targets for 2011
and the medium term are appropriate. Reflecting mainly significant capital expenditure
cuts, the 2010 fiscal deficit is estimated to have declined by 1½ percent of GDP to
3.9 percent (Table 6), though loan guarantees of 3.6 percent were extended to industrial
companies. Going forward, the authorities aim at balancing the budget in 2012 and achieving
a sizeable surplus thereafter in order to bolster sustainability, lower financing risk, and boost
the economy’s resilience to shocks. They also envisage a tight-fisted approach to loan
guarantees. Staff endorsed these targets, noting that if they were carried over the medium
term, public debt could fall below 20 percent of GDP by 2016, boosting growth prospects
and building buffers.

Staff recommended adding robustness to the strategy, observing that the targets
are predicated on keeping the nominal wage bill constant and effecting further cuts in goods



Staff saw scope to boost revenue collections in a growth-friendly way. Property is
rather lightly taxed by international comparison, and collections could be boosted by
a combination of higher rates, better valuation, and an improved cadastre. Small
increases in income- and VAT tax rates could result in significant additional revenue,
while still leaving intact Montenegro’s regionally favorable taxation regime.
Moreover, flanking such increases by reducing poverty traps—for example by
introducing an EITC—would provide an important boost for formal employment and
tax collection. The authorities stressed that they considered a tax system with a broad
base and low flat rates to be an essential comparative advantage. Within this broad
principle, they were looking for further base-broadening and tax efficiency
improvements and strengthened revenue administration.



Expenditure was jointly seen as an area where efficiency savings were possible.
Elevated public expenditure ratios (especially for current spending) are typical for
ex-Yugoslav countries; Montenegro’s ratios are comparatively high even for this
group.


There was agreement that the most durable and effective way to bring down the
share of public expenditure in GDP is to cut government employment. The large

16
wage bill constitutes a priority in the authorities’ consolidation strategy. In order
to avoid excessive reliance on wage cuts, which have adverse effects on morale,
the government has initiated the process with the requirement that for every new
hiring, at least two positions need to be cut. Staff recommended a less
decentralized approach to cuts, built around an overall vision of the civil service.


The recent pension reform marked important progress in improving the long-term
sustainability of public finances but staff noted the long implementation period
(Box 4). Accelerating the introduction of increased retirement ages and/or
reducing the indexation to wages, as well as tightening eligibility criteria, could
be considered to make further savings without adverse social implications. In the
longer term, a comprehensive reform that establishes a strong link between
contributions and benefits could further reduce the tax wedge, as contributions
become more like savings rather than taxes.



The need for direct budget support to private companies has waned. While
inconsistent with their past reforms that were predicated on the primacy of the
private sector in allocating resources, the authorities noted that such support was
inevitable in a severe crisis. Staff suggested that a new reform push, including
more flexible labor regulations and boosting banks’ resilience are a better way to
enable entrepreneurs to restructure.



Proper control of potential expenditure arrears is essential. The staff stressed that
such arrears need to be closely monitored, especially at the municipal level. The
authorities’ recent transparent high-frequency publication of fiscal statistics,
adoption of a single treasury account, and mandatory commitment reporting were
welcome.



Capital spending is unlikely to be a further source of savings in the near term.
After having borne the brunt of the recent consolidation, staff and authorities
agreed that spending should be sufficient to cover key infrastructure needs that are
critical to Montenegro’s attractiveness to tourists and business. To the extent
possible, the authorities emphasized their desire to involve private sector
financing via PPPs or concessions, but considered the current environment to be
challenging.

25.
Budget financing going forward entails risks. Eurobond proceeds have met a large
part of the 2011 budget financing requirement. Notwithstanding the repeated successful
market access in a difficult regional environment, staff cautioned that the uptake of market
debt was fast (13 percent of GDP over two years) further underscoring the need for fiscal
adjustment in order to secure future market access and repayment capacity. Given the high
opportunity cost of budget financing, every effort should be made to place public funds
safely, while achieving reasonable returns. With the crisis having passed, staff stressed that

17

Box 4. Pension Reform
The social security financing gap is one of the biggest fiscal challenges. The financing gap widened sharply
from 1.3 percent of GDP in 2007 to 5.1 percent in 2009, to a large extent due to rapid pension benefit increases
resulting from court-mandated increases. While adjustments to the compulsory contribution requirement in
2010 reduced the gap to an estimated 2.6 percent of GDP, it still accounted for nearly 70 percent of the overall
fiscal deficit in the year. In addition, the need to finance high transfers through contributions largely explains
the high tax wedge.
The recent pension reform marked important progress in improving the sustainability of public finances. It
included three measures: (i) increase in the retirement age for both men, from 65, and women, from 60, to 67
(the new retirement age for men will be fully implemented in 2025, and for women in 2041); (ii) re-indexation
of pension benefits to 75 percent of living cost index and 25 percent of general wage level, compared with
50–50 percent previously; and (iii) reduction in the frequency of pension benefit index calculation, from
biannually to once a year.

the placement of public sector funds should now be exclusively governed by prudent
financial management principles, rather than with an eye to support banks. The Fund also
stood ready to help if needed.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Growth is resuming and the recovery is projected to gain momentum. The
recovery is being supported by high world prices and demand for Montenegro’s industrial
exports, new tourism projects, and increased confidence in the financial system. Accordingly,
real GDP is projected to grow some 2 percent in 2011 after an estimated 1.1 percent in 2010,
while inflation is expected to remain below the level of that in trading partners.
27.
Substantial risks still linger. Near-term risks reflect an unfinished reform agenda:
poor labor relations and persistent financial problems could yet prevent industry from
profiting from the global demand boom; the repair of the banking system is not yet
completed; and, notwithstanding recent welcome budget consolidation, fiscal buffers remain
depleted. In addition the external environment harbors large risks.

18
28.
Policies must aim to advance external adjustment in order to make future
growth sustainable. Montenegro’s experience demonstrates the crucial importance of
persevering with reform, strengthening resilience and building policy buffers. The still very
large current account deficit requires improved cost competitiveness and a significant
increase in domestic savings. Luckily, Montenegro’s large potential can be tapped, such that
external rebalancing need not sacrifice growth.
29.
Investment holds the key to economic growth and job creation. Foreign
investment is particularly important. It must be leveraged by improved domestic flexibility
and cost competitiveness in order to avoid renewed overheating pressures and to spark off
domestic investment, notably in labor-intensive SMEs. The business environment needs to be
further improved.
30.
The labor market should be invigorated. Demands to restrict the flexibility and
availability of fixed term contracts must be resisted. The authorities should engage social
partners to facilitate the use of opt-out clauses from collective bargaining arrangements.
Poverty and unemployment traps need to be addressed and employment protection and
severance packages have to become affordable.
31.
Completing the repair of the banking system is the key near-term priority.
Thanks to the authorities’ timely actions and the extension of support by parent banks,
confidence has begun to return. The next steps should focus on fully restoring soundness
across the system in order to allow for renewed lending growth once credit demand for
quality projects returns. Adequate solvency and liquidity buffers should be required and
recent temporary regulatory relaxations be phased out quickly. The envisaged move to
IFRS—properly prepared—is welcome. Owners must promptly address any slippages from
regulations, especially capital or liquidity shortfalls or face immediate and forceful central
bank intervention in line with the recently strengthened legislation.
32.
Use of the euro requires greater buffers. Central bank liquidity support operations
are severely constrained in the euroized monetary framework, and banking liquidity and
solvency problems could thereby easily impose large fiscal demands. Aggressive
safeguarding of the banking system, including by mandating higher-than-Basel capital and
liquidity buffers is one requirement to avoid this happening, while the accumulation of fiscal
reserves is an essential backstop for confidence.
33.
The required fiscal consolidation has commenced, and the authorities’ budget
targets for 2011 and the medium term are appropriate. The authorities appropriately aim
to balance the budget by 2012 and to achieve a sizeable surplus thereafter. This target will
bolster sustainability, lower financing risk, and boost the economy’s resilience to unforeseen
shocks. In the near term, some 1 and 2½ percent of GDP in 2011 and 2012 in additional high
quality measures should be implemented to secure these targets.
34.
There is scope to boost revenue in a growth-friendly way. Property is rather lightly
taxed, and collections could be raised by a combination of higher rates, better valuation, and

19
an improved cadastre. Small increases in income tax and VAT rates would result in
significant additional revenue, while still leaving intact Montenegro’s regionally favorable
taxation regime. Moreover, flanking rate increases by reducing poverty traps—e.g., by
introducing an Earned Income Tax Credit—would provide an important boost for formal
employment and tax collection.
35.
Expenditure should be contained in a durable fashion. Cuts in government
employment and tight wage policy are essential to lower the large wage bill. The recent
pension reform marked important progress in improving the long-term sustainability of
public finances. Accelerating the introduction of increased retirement ages and/or reducing
the indexation to wages, as well as tightening eligibility criteria, should be considered to
bring its beneficial effects forward. Tight public sector wages and pensions will also help
anchor incomes policies to boost external cost competitiveness. Direct budget support to
private companies should be eschewed. Close monitoring of potential expenditure arrears is
imperative, especially at the municipal level.
36.
Given the high opportunity cost of budget financing, every effort should be made
to place public funds safely, while achieving reasonable returns. With the crisis having
passed, the placement of public sector funds should now be exclusively governed by prudent
financial management principles, rather than with an eye to support banks. Freeing currently
parked deposits can also help reduce the costs and risks involved in tapping capital market.
37.
Further progress on improving the statistical base is essential. The transparent
high-frequency publication of fiscal statistics, adoption of a single treasury account and
mandatory commitment reporting are welcome. However, weaknesses in economic statistics
continue to hamper economic analysis and policy making. Priority areas for improvement
include national accounts, external sector and labor market statistics.
38.
It is expected that the next Article IV Consultation will take place based on the
standard twelve-month cycle.

ANNEX I. FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN MONTENEGRO1
A. Background
Being a small economy with significant potential, Montenegro attracted very high levels of
FDI in relative terms. As Figure 1 shows, for the last five years it had the highest FDI per
capita as well as FDI as percent of GDP among the emerging market economies of Central
and South Eastern Europe.

The FDI boom mostly targeted the tourism, real estate, financial and energy sectors. FDI
took the form of both greenfield investments and privatization of state-owned enterprises.
Regarding the latter, prominent examples are two, relatively major, investments in the
aluminum smelter and the steel works. The banking sector continued to attract FDI even after
the initial equity acquisitions, mostly because of recapitalization needs in the aftermath of the
financial crisis.
As a result, all energy sector companies now have substantial foreign ownership, so do most
of major hotels and industrial enterprises, and the banking sector is around 90 percent

foreign-owned. Regarding the origins of FDI, these were quite diversified, with Italy and
Russia topping the list of the investor countries. Figure 2 below presents the FDI allocation
by broad sectors of the Montenegrin economy as well as by countries of origin.

B. Literature on FDI and Its Relevance to Montenegro
What explains FDI in general and FDI in Montenegro in particular? Empirical research
suggests FDI is sensitive to host-country political and economic conditions such as the
political situation in the country and the region, the education level of the labor force, overall
market size, factor costs, quality of infrastructure, and the general business climate.2 In
particular, a number of such studies find that FDI is lower in countries with higher corporate
tax rates and suggest that host-country taxation regime is likely to influence FDI decisions.3
Regarding the impact of FDI on economic growth, while many studies failed to provide
conclusive evidence on possible links between FDI and economic growth, studies that tried
to account for initial conditions in the recipient countries were more successful in showing
such a linkage. Dabla-Norris et al (2010) mention, amongst others, the level of financial
2

See, for example, Hanson (2001).

3

See, for example, Hines (1996).

33
sector development, quality of institutions and macroeconomic policies, and capital
endowments as factors that can help explain a country’s ability to benefit from FDI
externalities.
Looking at the period since 2006, when Montenegro gained its independence, one can see
that most of the factors mentioned in the literature are relevant to Montenegro. During this
period the country was politically stable, maintained good relations with its neighboring
countries, and has recorded substantial progress on the road to European Union integration.
The unilateral adoption of the euro as the legal tender has anchored investors’ expectations
(more than half of countries of FDI origin use euro) and, together with the liberal trade and
exchange systems, most likely played an important role in FDI decisions.
Although a small economy with a small internal market, Montenegro has benefited from its
geographical location and natural endowments to become a popular tourist destination and is
continuing to improve its tourism competitiveness. According to the World Economic
Forum’s 2011 assessment, Montenegro has managed to substantially improve its travel and
tourism competitiveness index and ranks 36th amongst 139 countries included in the

regime and currently has one of the lowest income taxation rates in the region (Figure 4).

C. FDI Prospects in Montenegro
The prospects of the Montenegrin economy largely depend on FDI prospects. In particular,
the tourism and energy sectors present clear potential for large projects such as the
development of the coastal line and the transformation of Montenegro into a hub for the
regional electricity exchange. However, in order to achieve a broad-based growth which will
be accompanied with substantial employment generation, the economy needs also investment
flowing into medium and small businesses. Hence, it is important to further improve the
business environment for such enterprises and to provide possibilities for improving
competitiveness.
Particular near-term priorities for Montenegro comprise reforms in labor and product markets
and in market regulation. Other important areas of action include improvement of the quality
of education to better align it with the labor skills required in the market and the development
of transport infrastructure. Finally, well-developed and stable domestic financial markets and
sound macroeconomic policies can create a general stimulus for FDI.

ANNEX II. SCOPE FOR IMPROVING THE TAX SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRO1
During the last decade, Montenegro has moved towards a relatively simple and transparent
tax system that combines broad bases with low rates. While this generally complies with
principles of ‘good taxation’, there is room for improvement and some aspects of the tax
system warrant reconsideration. Some improvements could also contribute to fiscal
consolidation in the short-term. Four key priorities are identified.
Reduce the tax wedge on labor
Despite a low proportional personal income tax rate of 9 percent, the total tax wedge on labor
is high due to additional local surcharges and a high rate of social security premiums. The
total tax wedge as a percentage of labor costs exceeds 40 percent. This exerts significant
adverse labor-market incentives and may partly explain the very weak labor-market
performance in Montenegro. For instance, the participation rate among the low-skilled is
only 13 percent and the overall unemployment rate is almost 17 percent. Reducing the tax
wedge, especially for low incomes, should be a key ingredient of a comprehensive reform
strategy to mitigate labor market distortions. A potentially promising instrument that could
be considered―and that has been successfully introduced in various other countries―is the
earned income tax credit. By gradually phasing out this credit with higher incomes, the credit
can be targeted to low labor incomes, while limiting the budgetary cost.
Mitigate tax arbitrage in the income tax
Two forms of arbitrage threaten income tax revenue from entrepreneurs.


The self-employed with low turnover are taxed according to a lump-sum regime. The
way this is structured creates ample incentives for underreporting and for operating in
the informal sector, especially due to spikes in the tax schedule and a regressive
social security burden. A straightforward improvement would be to transform the
lump-sum regime into a turnover tax for those self-employed.



Entrepreneurial income from limited liability companies is taxed at much lower rates
than the income of nonincorporated businesses. This creates strong incentives for
entrepreneurs to incorporate and for director-owners to label their business income as
capital returns. Arbitrages can be reduced by increasing the mandatory remuneration
for owner-directors of companies, which is taxed as labor income. Moreover, the tax
difference should be reduced by increasing either the corporate income tax rate or the
personal tax rates on capital income.

Strengthen the property tax
Current property tax revenue in Montenegro is low in an international perspective. This can
be partly explained by deficiencies in the system of registration and valuation of properties,
and partly by policy parameters, such as low tax rates and ample exemptions. Strengthening
property tax revenue by improving registration and valuation, increasing rates and abolishing
tax concessions could reduce reliance on other revenue sources of local government finance,
such as central government transfers, revenue sharing with central government taxes and the
plethora of local fees and taxes, which are perceived as a significant burden by the business
community.
Remove remaining tax incentives
Although the tax base is generally broad, Montenegro still applies some tax incentives in the
personal income tax, the corporate income tax and the value-added tax, the benefits of which
are unlikely to outweigh their costs. For instance, in the personal income tax on business
income, there is a tax concession for the labor costs of newly hired workers that could better
be abolished. In the corporate income tax, there is a three-year tax holiday for newly
established firms in underdeveloped municipalities, which could better be phased out. In the
VAT, more goods and services should be taxed under the normal VAT rate of 17 percent,
including tourism and computer equipment.

Annex II: Statistical Issues
(As of end-March, 2011)

A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
Shortcomings are most serious in national accounts and balance of payments.
National Accounts: The Statistical Office of Montenegro (MONSTAT) compiles real
sector data. MONSTAT has started to adopt the 1993 System of National Accounts as a
framework for compiling national accounts estimates. However, the scope of the
accounts is limited to compiling the annual production account in current and in previous
year prices. The accuracy of the data sources needs to be improved and breaks in the time
series eliminated by revising historic data. Business statistics are still following the
material system product concepts, collecting data mainly on quantities produced. The
national accounts estimates depend solely on bookkeeping data. The coverage of the
informal sector is not exhaustive. On the expenditure side, there are no data on changes in
inventories and the quality of investment and merchandise trade data is unsatisfactory.
MONSTAT switched from general to specific trade statistics in an effort to better capture
imports; however, there are indications that exports might be seriously under-recorded,
resulting in a corresponding under-estimation of GDP. National accounts data are also
undermined by the lack of sound techniques to account for nonobserved activities. Some
work has been done on measuring informal activity in construction, retail trade, hotels
and restaurants, but a more comprehensive approach needs to be developed. Statistical
techniques for deriving volume measures of GDP are constrained by the lack of suitable
price and volume indices. The business register is being expanded and a general census is
scheduled for 2011.
Preparations are advancing for the compilation of quarterly national accounts. An STA
mission visited Podgorica in December 2010 to assist the MONSTAT in the compilation
of QNA. The mission concluded there is still a critical need to: (i) improve the accuracy
and reliability of the quarterly indicators to be used in compiling QNA; and (ii) compile
volume measures of quarterly GDP at previous year’s prices. More TA will be needed to
achieve compilation of QNA.
Price statistics: MONSTAT compiles and disseminates monthly consumer and producer
price indices, which broadly follow international standards. However, in both indices, the
“carry-forward” technique for treatment of seasonal goods, new goods, and missing items
are used, resulting in downward bias. New consumer price indices, monitoring more
items and with a broader geographic coverage, started to be compiled in 2010 and the EU
harmonized consumer price indices are scheduled to be released in 2011.

5
Labor market statistics: The quality of the labor and wage indicators is relatively good
but there is little information on foreign employment; frequent methodological revisions
impair time series analyses.
Government finance statistics: Fiscal data are compiled by the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) based on a new GFS institutional classification, and since early 2006, include data
for the social security funds and local governments. The chart of accounts introduced in
2001 has been implemented at the local level from mid-2005. Fiscal data reporting
suffers from frequent re-classifications, especially at all levels of local government and
social funds. The MOF has established a unit responsible for data collection for stateowned enterprises (SOE), but a satisfactory compilation of the public sector fiscal
balance requires significant further effort. Data on enterprises owned by municipalities
are rarely available. Data on the stock of local government arrears need to be
strengthened.
Monetary statistics: Monetary and financial statistics are compiled by the Central Bank
of Montenegro (CBM), broadly following the institutional coverage, classification, and
valuation methodology set forth in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (2000).
Dissemination practices meet the recommendations of the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) with respect to the periodicity and timeliness for financial sector data.
Beginning in early 2006, the CBM publishes detailed monetary statistics in its monthly
Statistical Bulletin, which includes tables on monetary statistics, balance sheets and
surveys for the CBM and the commercial banks.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the CBM
following international reporting standards. The external sector statistics have benefited
from improvements undertaken by MONSTAT to improve coverage, valuation, and
classification of merchandise trade statistics. Merchandise trade debits (imports) are
valued at CIF, rather than FOB prices. Data on imports and exports in the BOP are based
on the general trade system. There is evidence that general trade imports are seriously
under recorded, prompting MONSTAT to switch from general to special trade statistics
in the national accounts. There are also indications that exports are underestimated, an
issue MONSTAT is currently investigating. In the meantime, there is an inconsistency
between balance of payments statistics, which are based on general trade data, and
national accounts, which are based on special trade data. The CBM has not developed
acceptable methodology to estimate the value of insurance and freight on imports, which
should be deducted from the CIF value.
Weaknesses remain, due primarily to the paucity of source data and the shortage of staff
to undertake the data collection and compilation processes. The CBM has made progress
in improving the recording of transactions in the ITRS by refining the transactions coding
system and increasing interaction with the commercial banks; however, the ITRS remains

6
inadequate for recording a broad range of balance of payments transactions such as
reinvested earnings and trade credits. Further, the ITRS records transactions on a cash
basis, whereas balance of payments transactions should be recorded on an accruals basis.
The CBM still needs to undertake a small number of direct surveys of enterprises to
supplement the data received through the ITRS, and prepare comprehensive
documentation on compilation methods and data sources. Montenegro does not yet
compile International Investment Position statistics.
B. Data Standards and Quality
Montenegro does not participate in the
No data ROSC is available.
GDDS.
C. Reporting to STA
A page for Montenegro in International Financial Statistics (IFS) was introduced in the
March 2007 issue.
Montenegro does not report government finance statistics for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook or IFS.
Montenegro does not report data for the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey
and the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey, respectively.
The CBM does not yet report monetary data in the format of Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs). To avoid duplication of effort, the CBM will need to decide whether to adopt the
European Central Bank’s framework for collecting, compiling and reporting monetary
data or the STA-developed SRFs, either of which will provide monetary data that accord
with international standards.

Annex III: Relations with the World Bank Group
Montenegro has joined World Bank Group (WBG) as an independent country in
January 2007. The Bank had implemented a discrete program of lending and analytical
work for Montenegro for most of the period since the State Union of Serbia and
Montenegro had joined the WBG in 2001, with three projects still being active at the
onset of Montenegro’s first Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the fiscal years
2007–10. Within this framework, the Board approved two IDA credits (US$19
million)—just prior to graduation—and five IBRD loans (US$54 million) to provide
selective support to three key country priorities, viz., (i) enhancing sustainable
macroeconomic growth; (ii) building institutions and strengthening the rule of law; and
(iii) improving the standard of living for citizens. The committed portfolio has grown
from US$34 million in 2007 to US$81 million in 2011. About 70 percent of these
commitments remain to be disbursed. Investment operations are focused principally on
supporting programs in the sustainable development and human development sectors.

In January 2011, the Board approved the US$ 216-million CPS for FY2011–14. This
CPS supports the government’s overarching objective of full integration with the EU
within a medium-term horizon. The strategy—reflecting Montenegro’s status as an upper
middle income client with well-defined development priorities—aims at (i) strengthening
institutions and competitiveness in line with EU accession requirements; and
(ii) improving environmental management, including reducing the costs of environmental
problems. The government has requested the Bank to focus its support in areas where it
had previously been engaged and/or gained applicable regional or global experience. The
centerpiece of the Bank’s engagement will be two financial-sector development policy
loans (about US$105 million), which will support a program to strengthen the banking

9
sector, bring regulations into line with EU norms, and encourage resumption of (healthy)
credit growth. New investment lending is planned for a Higher Education/R&D project, a
small investment to facilitate Montenegrin participation in a Regional Catastrophe Risk
Insurance Facility, and an Industrial Waste Management and Clean-Up Project.
Cooperation with the IMF has been strong, particularly the areas of macroeconomic
and financial sector policies. Bank and Fund teams have closely coordinated comments
on a set of (organic) financial sector laws enacted by Parliament in mid-2010. The WBG,
through its ongoing and planned operations, as well its complementary economic and
sector work, will continue to provide input on issues such as (i) public expenditure,
including pension and health reforms; (ii) business climate and competitiveness;
(iii) public sector institutions and fiduciary review, and (iv) agricultural assessment; and
(v) statistical capacity building and poverty monitoring. The Fund and Bank have sought
each other’s input in internal review processes.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for Montenegro
and Miroslav Tomic, Advisor to Executive Director
April 29, 2011
1.
The authorities of Montenegro would like to thank staff for the focused report and the
high quality of advice extended since the previous Article IV consultations. The report
correctly puts in a perspective the causes of the crisis and the challenges the economy of
Montenegro is facing in the post-crisis period. More importantly, the report indicates the
necessary path of action required to utilize the enormous growth potential. There is a high
degree of agreement between staff and the authorities on policy actions necessary for
sustainable growth.
2.
Although the economic developments in 2010 surprised on the upside—a positive
real GDP growth of 1.1 percent was realized against negative projections of -1.7 percent,
matched with low inflation (the end year CPI was at 0.5 percent) and a sizeable current
account adjustment—the authorities are fully aware of the need to step up structural reform
efforts in order to further boost the recovery and put the economy on a higher growth path in
the medium term. In order to avoid severe internal devaluation that could further limit
policy space, the fiscal deficit was financed by tapping into international capital markets.
After the initial issue in September 2010, the recent second issue was better priced (by 62.5
basis points), signaling the market’s recognition of the appropriate policy efforts. A sizeable
headline fiscal adjustment was booked and is projected to continue, in line with the
government’s determination to return into surplus territory as soon as feasible.
3.
The authorities are fully aware of the impact of borrowing on public debt, and,
therefore, enacted several measures to contain public finances in a structural manner, the
most important being pension reform. The pension law has extended the retirement age and
puts the entitlements on a more solid footing from a fiscal sustainability perspective. Staff is
right in claiming that implementation of the key pension reform parameter changes should
be sooner rather than later. The enacted solution reflects, however, the maximum social
compromise that could have been reached within the existing political economy constraints.
In addition, to remedy high spending on wages in the public sector, the government
introduced a rule where for every new hire in public administration two positions have to be
closed.
4.
Although there are encouraging signs of stabilization, such as deposit growth and
recent small credit increase, recovery of the banking system is not taken for granted. Despite
relatively tight prudential regulations, severe damage to the banking system was not
avoided, exemplified through the deposit run, collapse of credit, increase in NPLs and
decreasing profitability. With hindsight, an even more conservative approach to
implementation of banking sector regulation would have been appropriate—a lesson learned
the hard way that will shape the future supervisory and regulatory actions. The authorities’
swift response to support domestic banks, accompanied by adequate reaction from the

2
foreign parent banks to their subsidiaries, succeeded in preserving overall confidence in the
system. Although the NPLs remain high, a reduction and cleaning of balance sheets of
major banks is underway. With technical support from the WB and the IMF, several
important laws (including a law on commercial banks, a law on bankruptcy, and a law on
the central bank) have been adopted in 2010. The Central Bank, under the new mandate, has
stepped up on-site inspection and is carefully monitoring developments in the financial
system.
5.
The authorities recognize that setting the financial system on a solid footing is a
precondition for continued macroeconomic stability. With a limited role for the
‘lender-of-last-resort’ function of the Central Bank, the authorities are aware of the buffers
on public finance needed to maintain the necessary confidence. Although in theory there
may be short-run macroeconomic benefits from a faster credit recovery, the authorities value
full recovery of the financial system as a more important goal and will refrain from any
action that could water down prudency in credit approval. Further improvements in the
financial sector are continuously discussed with both the Fund and the WB staff, and the
authorities stand ready to implement best international practice.
6.
The specificities of a small and open economy help explain the large and volatile
current account. Any of several big projects in the pipeline, requiring import of goods not
locally produced, may further add to this but should not be seen exclusively from the
negative side of the savings-investment imbalance. With the highest per capita FDI in
Europe and a very diversified origin of FDI, Montenegro has relied and will continue to rely
on FDI as a major source of growth.
7.
In light of the macroeconomic framework, the authorities recognize the need to have
a flexible labor market, not only in the tourism industry, which relies also on labor import,
but also in other sectors. Staff recommendation to introduce opt-out clauses from collective
bargaining agreements to allow for a more efficient restructuring is well received. Similarly,
recommendations to increase labor supply through earned income tax credits are worth
considering. The work on removing administrative barriers is underway, and this should,
together with the labor law reforms, secure positive developments in competitiveness.
8.
Political stability is expected to continue in the future. Furthermore, as firm EU and
NATO integration processes are progressing, the country is expected to increase its
attractiveness to foreign investors. The authorities continue to consider these processes,
apart from the political perspective, as business development opportunities and will
fine-tune their policies so that that full economic potential from integration processes can be
realized.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 6, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Montenegro
On April 29, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Montenegro.1
Background
A tentative recovery is taking hold, following the global crisis that exerted heavy blows
upon the economy. In 2010, a good tourism season was followed by resumed metal
production, while heavy rains in the region boosted electricity production and exports.
After contracting for almost two years, industry began to grow again in the second half
of 2010. Nevertheless, industrial production at end-2010 was still considerably below its
pre-crisis peak. Expected large-scale infrastructure foreign direct investment has so far
not materialized and construction activity remains depressed. Overall 2010 GDP growth
is estimated at 1.1 percent, keeping output below its 2008 level.
The needed rebalancing of the economy has begun. Inflation and wage growth
decelerated sharply and the current account deficit halved to around 26 percent of GDP
in 2010. While most of the improvement was due to a weather related boost in electricity
exports and rebounding metals production, the nascent adjustment in costs has also
improved competitiveness. The improved fundamentals have also contributed to the

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
September 2010 debut Eurobond issuance of €200 million, subsequent spread
tightening, and a further €180 million issuance in April 2011.
Fiscal consolidation has commenced. Reflecting mainly significant capital expenditure
cuts, the 2010 fiscal deficit is estimated to have declined by 1½ percent of GDP to
3.9 percent, though, loan guarantees of 3.6 percent were extended to industrial
companies. Going forward, the authorities aim at balancing the budget in 2012 and
achieving a sizeable surplus thereafter in order to bolster sustainability, lower financing
risk, and boost the economy’s resilience to shocks.
In the banking sector, confidence has begun to return, as evidenced by increasing
deposits, though they are still below their levels in the third quarter of 2007. However,
non-performing loans have not yet leveled off and Financial Soundness Indicators have
continued to deteriorate. Stagnant lending at the current juncture primarily reflects the
dearth of creditworthy projects.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, although the recovery is gaining momentum, limited
policy space and incomplete reforms pose risks to the outlook. Accordingly, Directors
encouraged the authorities to step up efforts to reconstitute fiscal, external, and financial
buffers and to address rigidities in product and labor markets.
Directors welcomed the start of fiscal consolidation and supported the authorities’ plan
to balance the central government budget by 2012, and run surpluses thereafter. They
considered that a durable fiscal adjustment should encompass both revenue and
expenditure measures, including steps to increase the yield from property taxes and
curb the public sector wage bill. An early implementation of pension reform would also
strengthen the public finances, as would further efforts to avoid expenditure arrears and
direct budget support to private companies.
Directors stressed the importance of restoring the soundness of the banking system to
bolster the resilience of the economy and promote private sector-led growth. They
welcomed recent steps to reinforce the legal and prudential frameworks and
encouraged stronger supervisory practices. In particular, noting that full euroization
limits the ability of the central bank to provide liquidity support to banks, Directors called
for conservative capital and liquidity requirements and an early unwinding of regulatory
forbearance.
Noting the importance of strengthened competitiveness for securing external stability,
Directors agreed that structural reforms should remain a top policy priority. Greater
flexibility in wage setting and employment protection would support job creation in the
private sector, while addressing unemployment and poverty traps would boost labor
participation and market attachment. Improvements in the business environment and
investment climate are also part of the unfinished agenda.

3
Directors cautioned that long-standing weaknesses in economic statistics hamper policy
design and evaluation. They encouraged the authorities to make further progress in
addressing them.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
