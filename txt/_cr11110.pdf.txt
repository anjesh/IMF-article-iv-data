STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 20, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Overall setting: The economy is recovering from the effects of the global financial crisis,
the domestic credit crunch, and adverse weather-related shocks. The risks to the outlook are
on the downside. Macroeconomic policies need to focus on restoring the room for
countercyclical policies, reducing the risks to Tonga’s external and fiscal sustainability, and
laying the foundations for higher potential growth.
Growth and inflation prospects: GDP growth is estimated to rebound to 1¼ percent in
FY2010/11 on the back of stronger tourism activity and an expansionary fiscal policy
financed by donor aid and previously contracted loans. Risks to the outlook are on the
downside and relate to commodity prices, global growth, and Tonga’s high public debt.
Inflation will likely pick up but remain below 2007/08 levels.
Fiscal policy: The near-term fiscal stance should give priority to mitigating the risks to
Tonga’s fiscal sustainability. There is a need to prioritize expenditure and better align
planned spending cuts with the government medium-term development objectives. This
needs to be done in the context of a broader medium-term fiscal strategy aimed at
achieving a primary surplus of 1 percent of GDP and avoiding new borrowing.
Monetary policy: NRBT should maintain its current stance given ample liquidity in the
banking system, but should stand ready to tighten if inflation pressure from domestic
sources or downward pressures on reserves materialize.
Structural reform: Reforms are needed to raise Tonga’s medium-term growth prospects
and reduce the country’s vulnerability to shocks. Reforms should focus on improving the
business environment and the institutional framework for secured lending.

INTRODUCTION
1.

Context. The recession that began in

2008/09 continued in 2010 with declines in
tourism,

remittances,

and

exports.

Financial

conditions remained tight as banks raised lending
standards following a large rise in nonperforming
loans. In recent months, activity has bottomed out
as growth has been supported by a recovery in
tourism and expansionary fiscal policy financed by
donor aid. Growth is likely to rise to 1¼ percent in
FY2010/11 (year ending June) and to 1¾ percent in
FY2011/12 and the medium term. Limited private

sector development, geographical isolation, and
high public debt are key constraints to faster
growth.
2.

With the economy on the path to

recovery, the time is right to focus on reducing
the country’s vulnerabilities and addressing
the constraints to growth. Policies need to focus
on

restoring

the

countercyclical

macroeconomic policies, reducing the risks to
Tonga’s external and fiscal sustainability, and laying

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
In FY2010/11, macroeconomic policies have remained loose to counter the effects of the
global financial crisis, the credit crunch resulting from banks’ attempts to restore the
health of their balance sheets, and adverse weather-related shocks. With activity poised to
recover and inflation projected to rise, macroeconomic policies need to focus on restoring
the room for countercyclical policies, reducing the risks to Tonga’s external and fiscal
sustainability, and laying the foundations for higher potential growth.

Exchange Rate Assessment

Tonga’s exchange rate is assessed to be broadly in
line with levels suggested by medium-term
fundamentals. This assessment is based on two
standard analytical methods—the macroeconomic
balance and the purchasing power parity. Other
indicators also do not point to pressures from
misalignment of the exchange rate.
Standard
Methods

Exchange

Rate

Assessment

The macroeconomic balance and the purchasing
power parity approaches were employed based
on a cross section of 184 economies, including
those that rely heavily on aid and remittances.1


The macroeconomic balance approach
indicates that the real exchange rate is around
10 percent above its medium-term value, with a
confidence band of around −14 percent to
around 40 percent. Underlying the point estimate
is an estimated current account norm of around
−4½ percent of GDP, which could be as low as
−13½ percent of GDP in light of the important
role of remittances and foreign aid.


The purchasing power parity approach
suggests that the real exchange rate is currently
undervalued by around 5 percent.

inflation has also not been out of line with other
Pacific island countries.


Foreign reserves have been stable or rising in
recent years, even after abstracting from

reconstruction loan. The NRBT intervened on
both sides of the market, and was a net purchaser
of foreign exchange in 2009/10, with net
purchases around 10 percent of its total gross
flows.


The number of tourists has increased
markedly in recent years. Tonga has gained
market share as a tourist destination.


Goods market. New export products, such as
sea cucumber, have provided significant export
earnings in the past year and helped offset the
decline from squash export. Squash export to
Japan was affected by additional supply from
traditional squash exporters during Tonga’s niche
export period.

Other indicators of misalignment do not point to



The current account deficit has been
relatively stable in recent years, remaining
around 8‒9 percent in previous years. While a
temporary rise in the deficit is expected in the
next few years, this reflects both cyclical factors,
as well as reconstruction-related imports, which
are fully financed.


Domestic inflation has picked up in recent

months owing to one-off and global factors.

Box 2

The Interest Rate Channel of the Monetary Policy Transmission in Tonga1

This box provides an assessment of the
effectiveness of the interest rate channel of
the monetary policy transmission in Tonga.
The analysis uses a single equation reduced form
model that links bank lending rates or credit
growth to a policy rate, one-period lag of bank
lending rate, a time trend, and a constant. The
estimation is carried out using monthly data from
2000 to 2010, to gauge the impact of policy rates
(proxied by repo rates) on bank lending rates and
credit growth. For comparison purposes, the
model is estimated for the remaining five Pacific
island countries that have their own currencies
(Fiji, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Solomon Islands,
Samoa, and Vanuatu).
The results indicate that changes in NRBT
interest rates affect both bank lending rates
and the credit growth, but the impact is
smaller than in many other Pacific islands. A
one percentage point increase in the repo rate

raises the average bank lending rate about ¼
percentage points and reduces private sector
credit growth by about 1½ percentage points.
These effects are however smaller than in Pacific
islands, such as PNG and Fiji, which in turn have
weaker transmission mechanism than in more
advanced economies because their financial
markets are shallow.
Developing domestic financial markets
could strengthen the monetary transmission
mechanism. Measured by the ratio of broad
money to GDP, Tonga’s domestic money market is
shallow even compared with many of its Pacific
neighbors. Collateralized interbank lending is not
widely available, and secondary markets for
government and central bank paper are nonexistent. There is no market for commercial
paper, corporate bonds, equity, and foreign
exchange products. Developing a framework for
secured lending could help increase the passthrough of the interest rates to bank lending
rates and bank credit.

Bank Interest Rates and Profitability in Tonga1

Interest rates in Tonga reflect a wide range
of factors. Interest rates are the centerpiece of
commercial banks’ core business of financial
intermediation. They are the key price in the

of monetary policy, the main vehicle for matching
supply and demand and, normally, the key

banks’ perception of risk (country and creditor),
market liquidity conditions, and the depth of
financial markets—which affects banks’ ability to
spread their risk, the cost of doing business, and
the level of competition in the financial sector.
Tonga, like other Pacific Island countries, has a
relatively high risk and high cost of business
environment and a shallow financial sector that
may explain why interest rates would be higher
than in more advanced economies.

Non-interest income is high in Tonga.
It has averaged over 5 percent of average assets
in the last decade, broadly in line with levels in
other PICs but considerably higher than in
emerging and advanced markets. This income is
mostly from foreign exchange activities,
reflecting Tonga’s highly open economy leading
to a large volume of international trade and
remittance transactions.


Bank profitability in Tonga has been
high but recent losses illustrate market
risks. Between 2000 and 2007 Tongan banks’
average return on assets was around 6 percent.
This was well above levels in other regions; for
instance, in 2008 the average return in Australia
was 1.4 percent and in sub-Saharan Africa it was
2.5 percent. However, foreign exchange earnings
accounted for around 60 percent of returns and
have underpinned the high levels of bank
profitability.
These
non-interest
earnings
continued during 2008 and 2009 but were not
sufficient to offset the large losses that were
incurred on lending activities, leading to
significant overall bank losses in Tonga.

Medium-Term Budget Framework1

Box 4

Tonga is in the process of setting up a comprehensive
medium-term budget framework (MTBF), which will
help Tonga ensure fiscal discipline and stability,
and enable strategic allocation of resources in
line with Tonga’s strategic priorities laid out in
the national strategic planning framework
(NSPF). The diagram below highlights the
medium-term budgeting process over a two-year
period, as well as the role of each participant at
each step of this process. The ministry of finance
and national planning (MFNP) is responsible for
maintaining planning and fiscal control over the

fiscal period, and managing the overall process.
Other ministries implement their three-year
corporate plans (CP) and annual management
plans (AMP) that are aligned to the NSPF, and
linked directly to the annual budget. Good
progress is being made in implementing other
building blocks necessary to fully set up a MTBF,
including improvements in macroeconomic and
fiscal forecasting, budget formulation and
monitoring, the recent revision to the chart of
accounts, and the consolidation of the
government’s numerous accounts to improve cash

Medium-term fiscal policy needs to

aim at restoring sustainability. Over the medium
term, a primary surplus of 1 percent of GDP would
be needed to put the fiscal position on a more
sustainable path, bringing down public debt to
around 30 percent of GDP by the early 2020s.
There is a need to integrate within a single

resisted as administering interest rates could result
in rationing credit and hampering banks’ ability to

supervision, including adopting a standardized
examination report format, are welcome. Technical
assistance provided by PFTAC will continue to help

44.

Promoting private sector activity will

strengthen medium-term growth prospects.
There continues to be a need to extend land leases
to 99 years for all allotments and activities to
encourage construction and investment, make
further progress with public enterprise reform to
level the playing field between public and private
enterprises, reduce the number of business licenses,
and lower barriers to foreign investment. Speeding
up reforms to lift Tonga’s medium-term growth
and advancing fiscal consolidation will free up
resources for social protection programs and allow
the government to focus on inequality and labor
market policies.

It is recommended that the next Article IV

consultation take place on a standard 12-month
cycle.

JOINT IMF/WORLD BANK DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
April 20, 2011

ANALYSIS 20111
Approved By

Prepared By

Vivek Arora and Thomas Dorsey (IMF)
Vikram Nehru and Jeffrey D. Lewis (IDA)

The International Monetary Fund and
The International Development Association

Tonga remains at a high risk of debt distress based on the joint IMF-WB low-income
country debt sustainability assessment (LIC DSA). Both the PV-of-debt to GDP, as well as
the PV-of-debt to export ratios remain above the country-specific indicative thresholds for
a prolonged period under the baseline scenario. The two loans from the China EXIM Bank
(one for reconstruction of the central business district and one for road construction) total
over TOP$200 million, close to 30% of GDP1. The loans, denominated in renminbi, pose a
currency risk to the government’s balance sheet. Nonetheless, Tonga’s very high and
relatively stable remittance inflows (normally over 30 percent of GDP)—which are by far
the largest source of foreign exchange earnings—help mitigate liquidity risks. Tonga’s
overall public sector debt indicators, are elevated in the short term, but are expected to
show a decreasing trend over the longer run. Taking into account the cushion provided to
the economy by the large workers’ remittances, the projected debt profile is consistent
with manageable—if high risk—debt dynamics. Additional debt will further heighten the
already high risk of external debt distress, as well as risks to external sustainability, and
significantly constrain the space available for social and developmental priorities, as
outlined in the National Strategic Planning Framework (NSPF). These vulnerabilities
underscore the importance of sound macroeconomic policies to improve Tonga’s growth
potential on a sustained basis, export diversification, and continued efforts in fiscal
consolidation. The authorities have expressed a desire to receive technical assistance to
develop a comprehensive debt management strategy.

This DSA was prepared jointly with the World Bank, and in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank, in accordance with

the Debt Sustainability Framework for low-income countries approved by the Executive Boards of the IMF and IDA. The debt data
underlying this exercise were provided by the Tongan authorities.

These loan commitments were signed in
November 2007 (for reconstruction), and
February 2010 (for roads), and bear a 2 percent
interest rate, 5-year grace, and a 20-year

Despite the rise in overall debt, the

government has continued to reduce its
domestic debt level. Domestic debt has fallen
from around 20 percent of GDP at the beginning of
the decade to around a projected 5 percent of GDP
by June 2011. All outstanding bank loans were
repaid in 2007/08. This fiscal year, the government
issued an additional, unplanned TOP$7 million in
short-term domestic debt to fund operations while
waiting for donor support.

The new debt is

donor funds are received, but has already been

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TONGA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Box 1

Key Assumptions



Real GDP growth is projected to average
around 1.7 percent over the period 2010/11–
2015/16, as the fiscal impulse provided by the
two China loans is completed, the economy
recovers from the global financial crisis, and
remittances recover. Longer-term growth is
expected to be marginally higher, reflecting a
return on the ongoing capital projects but will
remain around its long-run average because of
structural impediments.


As growth recovers, the current fiscal balance
is assumed to narrow from a deficit about
2½ percent of GDP in 2010/11 to surplus of
1 percent by 2015/16. The surplus is projected to
result from restraint in wage expenditures
following the recent public sector restructuring,
tax administration gains, and the alignment of
government ministries under a medium-term
budget framework. In addition, it is important for
the government to ensure that the salary
structure of civil servants adequately reflects
performance and contributes to increasing
efficiency in service delivery.


A current fiscal balance of around 1 percent
of GDP is assumed over the longer-term.
Current revenue and expenditure are assumed to
be broadly stable as a percent of GDP. The
resulting primary fiscal balance will average
around 1 percent of GDP.


Grants are projected to decline from current
high levels of 5¼ percent of GDP, but remain
significant at around 2½ percent of GDP over the
longer term. Donor commitments are extremely
important given the relatively small size of the
Tongan economy and

its vulnerability to external shocks. These grants,
together with projected disbursements from
concessional loans are assumed to be spent
entirely on development projects and associated
maintenance. Following the last disbursement of
the current China Exim Bank loan (in 2012/13),
we assume all future external borrowing is from
concessional IFI (AsDB and World Bank) facilities.
On the domestic front it is assumed no new
domestic
borrowing
until
2014/15
as
consolidation advances and the debt is brought
down. Domestic borrowing is thereafter limited
to filling any financing gap.


The external current account deficit is
projected to reach 10¾ percent of GDP in
2012/13, up from 7¾ percent of GDP in
2009/10, driven primarily by the large
construction-related imports. Over the medium
term, the deficit should return to around
7½ percent of GDP.


Net FDI is projected to stabilize at around
5½ percent of GDP.


The decline in remittances appears to have
bottomed out as economic activity in the United
States, Australia, and New Zealand has begun to
recover. These three countries are the source of
the vast majority of Tonga’s remittances.
Remittances are expected to recover along with
the economies in these three countries and as
Australia reviews its seasonal worker program for
Pacific Islanders to facilitate greater utilization of
the scheme. The export base is projected to
remain narrow and relatively undiversified with a
focus on agricultural products.
The proper
operation of the fumigation facility should help
gradually increase exports as the products will
meet New Zealand’s bio-security requirements.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 16, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Tonga
On May 4, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Tonga.1
Background
Tonga’s economy is recovering, on the back of increased construction activity and
improvements in the external environment. GDP growth is estimated to rebound to 1¼ percent
in FY2010/11 on the back of stronger tourism activity and an expansionary fiscal policy financed
by donor aid and previously contracted loans. Remittance inflows have stabilized in recent
months and should provide additional impetus to growth during the remainder of the fiscal year.
However, this growth momentum will likely be limited by continued tight domestic financial
conditions as banks maintain tight lending standards following the large rise in nonperforming
loans of the past two years.
CPI inflation rose to 6½ percent y/y in February 2011, reflecting mainly increases in global food
and oil prices and one-off effects from higher excises on tobacco and alcohol. Inflation is likely
to average around 6 percent in FY2010/11.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The government’s stepped up capital expenditure in FY2010/11 helped to offset weaknesses in
private demand. At the same time, generous grant inflows from donors during FY2010/11
contributed to narrowing the fiscal deficit to an estimated 4¼ percent of GDP (from about
5¾ percent of GDP in FY2009/10). Nevertheless, Tonga remains at a “high risk of debt distress”
according to this year’s World Bank-IMF debt sustainability analysis.
Monetary policy was geared toward jumpstarting bank lending. In FY2010/11, the National
Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) remunerated banks’ exchange settlement account balances
over TOP 1 million and maintained adequate liquidity in the system to encourage banks to step
up lending. However, credit to the private sector continued to fall, albeit at a slower pace.
The slower decline in bank lending reflects some improvements in banks’ balance sheets.
Banks are now well capitalized; and profitability has improved somewhat in recent months, but
remains well below levels of the past years, owing to high provisioning. Nevertheless, banks are
likely to maintain a cautious lending stance in FY2010/11 amid uncertainties on the outlook.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Tonga’s economy is recovering from the recent internal and
external shocks on the back of stronger tourism activity and fiscal expansion. The policy
challenge now is to reduce the country’s vulnerabilities and to boost potential growth.
Directors stressed that in the near term, fiscal consolidation is necessary to ensure fiscal
sustainability and expand fiscal space to respond to future shocks. They emphasized the
importance of avoiding new borrowing, reducing current spending, especially by containing the
wage bill, prioritizing expenditure, and strengthening tax administration.
For the medium term, Directors agreed that fiscal policy should aim at placing public debt on a
downward path. This strategy should be integrated within a medium-term budget framework that
is consistent with Tonga’s development objectives. Directors also encouraged the authorities to
set up a comprehensive debt-management strategy to limit the credit and currency risks in the
government balance sheet. They commended the authorities’ commitment to improve
transparency in fiscal accounts, which will help secure continued grant financing to support the
government fiscal consolidation efforts.
Directors considered the current monetary policy stance to be appropriate. However, if the
liquidity overhang or higher global commodity prices exacerbate inflation and exert downward
pressure on reserves, a preemptive tightening of monetary policy would be called for.
Directors welcomed recent measures to improve the institutional framework for lending and the
efforts by the central bank to step up regulation and supervision. Further improving
intermediation will require enhancing the legal framework for collateralized lending, increasing
competition within an appropriate prudential and regulatory framework, and enhancing
consumer protection and financial literacy. Directors encouraged the authorities to resist the

3
pressure to administer the level of interest rates to avoid possible significant credit rationing and
hampering banks’ ability to adequately price risks.
Directors noted the staff assessment that the exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals. To safeguard external stability, they encouraged the authorities to stand ready to
use the flexibility within the bands of the pegged exchange rate to gradually depreciate the
pa’anga. Any depreciation should be accompanied by further fiscal restraint, given the effects a
weaker currency would have on the public debt.
Directors emphasized that promoting private sector activity is essential for strengthening the
medium-term growth prospects. They underscored the importance of improving the land tenure
system, making further progress in reforming public enterprises, reducing the number of
business licenses, and lowering barriers to foreign investment.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Aida Budiman, Alternate Executive Director for Tonga
and Peishan Yeo, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
May 4, 2011

1.

On behalf of the Tongan authorities, we would like to thank staff for the constructive
policy discussions and useful advice rendered during the recent Article IV
consultation. The staff report succinctly identifies the short and medium term
challenges confronting the Tongan economy, and sets out requisite actions to restore
the country to a sustainable growth path. The Tongan authorities broadly agree with
the appraisal in the report and will thoughtfully consider the recommendations
therein.

Economic Developments in FY 2010/11
2.

Our authorities agree with staff that the economy is showing some signs of
improvement. The projected GDP growth for FY2010/11 is still being finalized but is
expected to surprise on the upside and come into positive territory, compared to
earlier estimates of -0.5%. The upward revision was mainly on account of a higherthan-expected contribution from construction activity, which was largely financed
from overseas. That said, the authorities assessed that there has been limited
immediate positive spillover to the indigenous economy, as these projects used
imported materials and hired mostly foreign workers. Nonetheless, the resultant
increase in capital stock – in terms of a reconstructed central business district and
more and better roads – is expected to facilitate business activity over the longer term.

3.

There are incipient signs of a turnaround with regard to other drivers of the Tongan
economy. Remittance inflows, which constitute a key multiplier effect on domestic
consumption, have stabilized in recent months. A resurgence in the near term is
however unlikely, given the still uncertain external environment. Tourism receipts
have picked up significantly since the year ended June 2010, although exports
remained subdued. Looking ahead, GDP growth is expected to be driven mainly by
the construction sector and recovery in remittances, although continued tightness in
credit conditions is expected to weigh on growth.

4.

Price pressures have picked up but the outlook remains moderate, although risks are
on the upside. Tonga, like other small open island economies, is vulnerable to
increases in global commodity prices. CPI inflation rose to 6.5 percent y-o-y in
February this year on the back of rising food and oil prices and one-off effects from
higher excises on imported tobacco and alcohol. The authorities’ latest estimates
show inflation to come in at 6.6% and 4.3% in FY2010/11 and 2011/12 respectively.

2
5.

A new government was elected under Tonga’s first parliamentary elections in
November 2010. The government acknowledges the challenges faced by the Tongan
economy, and is committed to advance reforms to promote private sector activity and
diversify the economic base, reduce Tonga’s reliance on remittances and restore the
policy space for countercyclical responses in the event of future shocks. Much work
lies ahead, and it would take time for reforms to be duly implemented and to bear
fruit. Important policy discussions have already commenced, supplemented by the
helpful advice rendered by the IMF team, and progress been made.

Fiscal Policy
6.

The authorities broadly agree with staff’s assessment on fiscal policy.
Notwithstanding capacity constraints and the recent change in government, reforms in
the right direction have continued. The authorities also recognize the need to rebuild
fiscal headroom expeditiously, particularly given the forthcoming increase in debt
service burden from FY2013/14.

7.

Considerable efforts have been directed towards restoring public finances to health.
These include initiatives to strengthen Public Financial Management (PFM), such as
improving auditing and procurement, implementing a Treasury Manual to guide
financial decision-making, consolidation of government accounts and strengthening
macroeconomic forecasting. Tonga has rolled out new IT systems to computerize tax
records and data, which should strengthen tax compliance and bolster revenue
collection. Public Expenditure Reviews are also being undertaken with donor
funding to analyze the effectiveness of the Government’s resource utilization.
Importantly, the Ministry of Finance, line ministries and the Public Service
Commission have enhanced collaboration and coordination efforts to strengthen
expenditure prioritization, in accordance with national objectives.

8.

Looking ahead, efforts in the near term would be focused on restoring fiscal space to
make allowance for the envisaged rise in debt servicing costs. The debt service
burden would materially increase from FY2013/14 when principal repayments for the
Reconstruction and Roads Projects with the EXIM Bank of China would commence.
Our authorities are very mindful of the attendant external risks and are enacting
measures to control public finances in the FY 2011/12 Budget, which is currently
under preparation. These would include revenue measures, although Tonga’s ability
to generate revenue is contingent on economic conditions going forward. On the
expenditure front, the Government is committed to reduce recurrent expenditure by,
for example, endeavouring to contain the wage bill and linking resource allocation to
core activities. In addition, the Government plans to undertake a review to rationalize
public sector activities, which may result in staff redeployment and merging or
relocation of ministries to reduce costs.

9.

Over the longer term, the authorities concur with the need to establish a Medium
Term Budgeting Framework (MTBF), and to integrate the processes therein to the
national priorities in the National Strategic Planning Framework (NSPF). This would
in turn lay the foundations for placing Tonga’s public finances on a sustainable path.
As noted by staff, good progress has been made. For instance, the ministries have
started developing and implementing a budget planning and management structure
that entails a three-year corporate plan (CP) and an annual management plan (AMP)
that link directly to the annual budget, through which resources are allocated and
fiscal constraints addressed. The authorities would continue to work with PFTAC on
outstanding measures.

Monetary Policy
10.

The National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) will stay vigilant to price
developments and stands ready to respond to contain inflation risks. At present,
however, credit remains constrained as banks continue to maintain tight lending
standards in light of the spate of NPLs over the past two years and uncertainty over
the economic outlook. To jumpstart bank lending, the NRBT paid 1% remuneration
on banks’ Exchange Settlement Account balances that are above 1 million pa’anga.
The endeavour has had some success as bank interest rates declined by 0.25-1% since
the policy took effect in January 2010. However, private sector credit growth
(excluding loans from the EXIM bank of China) continued to decline by 7.1 % over
the year ending March 2011, compared to -14.1% in the preceding year. The
envisaged stimulus to economic activity, therefore, has yet to materialize.

Financial Sector
11.

The authorities note staff’s view that it is more effective to incentivize credit flow via
measures that directly tackle the impediments to bank lending, as opposed to
administering interest rates. The latter could entail distortionary effects such as
hampering banks’ ability to price risks and reducing the availability of credit for
higher risk borrowers. Reforms such as the enactment of the Personal Property
Security Act are envisaged to help bring down borrowing costs and enhance access to
bank finance. To address public concerns that reductions in lending rates have been
slower than that in deposit rates, the NBRT has required banks to disclose the
Effective Interest Rates charged to clients.

12.

On the supervisory front, the NRBT’s oversight continues to focus on banks’ credit
risk management owing to the heightened level of NPLs. The spate of loose lending
prior to the global financial crisis, economic malaise and the decline in remittances
have contributed to the rise in NPLs over the past two years. Areas in credit risk
management which were identified for improvement include strengthening the stress
testing regime to reflect factors such as interest rates and commodity prices, and

4
updating outmoded asset valuation methods. Work is underway with the World Bank
IFC to establish a credit bureau and promote electronic checks to strengthen credit
assessment of clients. Tonga has also received technical assistance from the IMF and
PFTAC to fortify its supervisory framework, such as in designing new prudential
returns and enhancing offsite monitoring tools.
Structural Policy
13.

The authorities share staff’s assessment that lifting medium-term growth prospects
remains a challenge in light of Tonga’s geographic isolation and narrow economic
base. Various measures have been implemented to promote private sector activity
and broaden the sources of growth. For instance, to boost agricultural exports, the
authorities have repaired the High Temperature Forced Air machine at the airport and
established quarantine facilities to meet the import standards of overseas markets.
Other initiatives include tourism marketing activities, the establishment of the Tonga
Institute of Sports, and the Tonga Submarine Cable project which is envisaged to
strengthen communication links with the external world. Further, the Tonga Energy
Road Map endeavours to raise the efficiency of energy usage and identify options for
non-renewable energy sources, which would help lower business costs and galvanise
private sector activity.

Final Remarks
14.

The Tongan economy has shown signs of improvement, but a recovery is yet to be
entrenched. The new government is cognizant of the considerable challenges that lie
ahead and is committed to advance the reform agenda, although results would take
time to materialize. Importantly, given Tonga’s capacity constraints, domestic efforts
would need to be supplemented by support from multilateral institutions and other
countries. In this light, our Tongan authorities would like to express their sincere
gratitude to the Fund, the World Bank and PFTAC for their invaluable technical
guidance over the years.
