UKRAINE
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2004 Consultation with Ukraine
Approved by Carlo Cottarelli and Michael T. Hadjimichael
September 28, 2004
Discussions for the 2004 Article IV consultation were held in Kyiv during July 19–August 3,
2004. The mission met with First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Azarov,
Minister of Economy and European Integration Derkatch, Acting Governor of the National
Bank of Ukraine (NBU) Yatsenuik, and other senior officials. The mission did not meet with
the governor of the NBU since he is currently on leave of absence to head the presidential
campaign for the prime minister. The mission also met members of the diplomatic
community, bankers, entrepreneurs’ associations, and research institutes.
The mission comprised E. van der Mensbrugghe (head), M. Rossi, A. Schaechter, A. Tiffin
(all EUR), M. Flanagan (FAD), and I. Halikias (PDR). C. Cottarelli, L. Figliuoli, Senior
Resident Representative, (all EUR) and Y. Yakusha (OED) participated in the discussions.
A precautionary 12-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) was approved on March 29, 2004.
Review discussions held at the same time could not be completed because of policy
slippages.
Ukraine has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions.
The 2003 Article IV consultation was completed on May 14, 2003. Executive Directors
noted Ukraine’s strong macroeconomic performance, marked by robust GDP growth, low
inflation, improved external position, and a rapid decline in public debt. Directors
commended the authorities for their prudent demand-management policies, including tight
fiscal policy, but regretted that the authorities did not seize the opportunity to accelerate
structural reforms.
The discussions took place in the run-up to the October presidential elections, almost
certainly a choice between Prime Minister Yanukovich and opposition leader Yuschenko.
Irrespective of the results, no major policy change is expected.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and outlook: Real GDP grew by 9.4 percent in 2003, despite a poor harvest.
While growth is projected to reach 12½ percent in 2004 and the current account surplus an
impressive 10 percent of GDP, the loosening of fiscal policy in the second half of the year will
exacerbate emerging inflationary pressures. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation is likely to
reach 9–10 percent by year’s end, much above the original projection. The discussions took
place in the run-up to the October presidential elections, almost certainly a choice between
Prime Minister Yanukovich and opposition leader Yuschenko. Irrespective of the results, no
major policy change is expected.
Policy discussions focused on the following key issues:
•

the sustainability of the current economic boom;

•

the immediate risks that such expansion may entail; and hence

•

the need for prudent macroeconomic policies and further structural reforms.

Authorities and staff disagreed on the following:
•

The risk of overheating. The authorities viewed this risk as relatively remote.

•

The fiscal stance for 2004. Staff could not support the amended budget that provides for
a substantial procyclical loosening. The 2005 fiscal target discussed during the mission
seemed broadly appropriate, but recent policy decisions make its attainment difficult.

•

The time frame for exiting the de facto peg to the U.S. dollar.

The staff recommended the following:
•

A 2004 consolidated government deficit limited to the original program target of
1.8 percent of GDP. This would still provide resources to finance an increase in social
and capital spending.

•

Greater exchange rate flexibility. This would help restrain credit growth and inflationary
pressures, while weakening the incentive to build foreign currency-denominated debt
and enhancing Ukraine’s resiliency to external shocks.

•

A monetary tightening to contain inflationary pressures. The extent of sterilization and
interest rate increases required will depend on the authorities’ willingness to let the
exchange rate appreciate.

•

Strengthening the role of the private sector. Tax distortions, corruption, red tape,
inadequate implementation of the legal framework all act as barriers to investment.

Lack of agreement on the above issues and incomplete implementation of key structural
measures have so far prevented completion of the review.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Six years after the 1998 crisis, Ukraine continues to recover strongly (Table 1).
Over 2000-04, GDP growth has averaged 8.4 percent, above the Central and Eastern European
average (3.8 percent), and the Commonwealth Independent States (CIS) average (8.0 percent),
with a projected peak of

delays in structural
reforms and a weak business climate have hindered investment. Besides, growth appears not to
have benefited everyone in the same proportion.2
2.
While exports have triggered the acceleration in growth, domestic demand has
played an increasingly important role (Figure 2). Rapid growth in China has boosted
Ukraine’s steel exports, while continued growth in Russia has benefited Ukraine’s machinery
exports. Consequently, annual

3.
However, unemployment remains high. The official unemployment rate (at about
4 percent since 2001) is an unreliable guide, owing to hidden unemployment and weak
incentives to register for unemployment benefits. According to the International Labor
Organization’s definition, unemployment, although down from 12 percent in 1999, remains at
about 9 percent in 2004.
4.
Inflation has been moderate, but strong upward pressures are emerging. From a
low of -0.6 percent in December 2002, the 12-month consumer price index (CPI) rate reached
8.2 percent in December 2003. While much of this increase seemed to reflect supply-side
factors—especially the impact of a poor harvest—inflation had increased to 9.9 percent by
August 2004. Producer price inflation index (PPI) inflation reached 22.2 percent in August
2004, reflecting mostly higher world prices for energy and metals. Even excluding these items,
“core” PPI inflation would exceed 10 percent. In June 2004, the average nominal wage for the
entire economy was 26.3 percent above its level the previous year.
5.
Capital market access and financial indicators have improved. After regaining
access to international capital markets in 2003, Ukraine issued a $600 million seven-year
Eurobond in March 2004, and a $500 million five-year floating rate Eurobond in August. Both
issuances contain collective action clauses. Spreads are relatively low (about 360 basis points)
but remain correlated with fluctuations in Russia. Standard and Poor’s upgraded Ukraine's
long-term sovereign credit rating to B+, on par with other rating agencies, and Moody’s raised
its outlook to positive (Table 3). Interest rates and stock prices have moved favorably (Figure
3), while the recent banking sector difficulties in Russia have not affected Ukraine.
6.
The public debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen (Figure 4). Primary surpluses and strong
growth during 1999–2003 have helped reduce the debt ratio from 61 percent of GDP to a
projected 27 percent at end-2004. Revenue gains—principally from personal income and
payroll taxes, and state enterprise dividends (Table 4)—have offset a rise in spending from
34 percent to almost 38 percent of GDP.
7.
Fiscal policy remained prudent through mid-2004. The consolidated government
cash deficit was 0.7 percent of GDP in 2003. Through end-June 2004, it amounted to
0.2 percent of (annual) GDP versus an end-June adjusted program ceiling of 0.9 percent.
However, the outturn reflects an accumulation of value added tax (VAT) refund arrears; had the
programmed reduction occurred, the deficit would have been 1 percent of GDP. Indeed, general
problems with VAT administration contributed to a drop in the revenue/GDP ratio and led the
president to replace senior management in the state tax administration in June.

In the context of a de facto peg to the dollar, strong money growth has so far been
consistent with single-digit inflation, amid continued remonetization and a modest
monetary policy tightening (Figure 5). In the first part of 2004, a large buildup of government
deposits helped moderate base money growth, though the NBU’s pronounced interventions in
the foreign exchange market led to strong net international reserves (NIR) accumulation (Table
5). Starting in May, the NBU has tightened monetary policy, including by issuing certificates of
deposit (CDs) (although in small volumes) and raising reserve requirements. The discount rate
was also raised by 50 basis points to 7.5 percent.
9.
Competitiveness remains strong (Figure 6). In the 12 months to June 2004, the real
effective exchange rate depreciated by 4 percent, reflecting mainly Ukraine’s low inflation visà-vis Russia, and the strengthening euro. Average wages remain less than half Russia’s wages.
10.
Despite the NBU’s ongoing steps to strengthen prudential regulation and banking
supervision, credit expansion and credit quality remain a concern (Figure 7 and Table 6).
The credit-to-GDP ratio stands at 29.5 percent compared to 12.4 percent in 2000. While credit
expansion has decelerated since early 2004, loans have increased to about two-thirds of bank
assets—higher than in most transition economies. Nonperforming loans classified by past due
criteria are estimated at 8 percent of total loans. The buildup of bank capital and provisions has
not kept pace with the credit expansion. The fall in the ratio of regulatory capital to riskweighted assets was only reversed in April 2004. The ratio stood at 15.2 percent in June, but for
the 10 largest banks, it was only 1½ percentage points above the minimum requirement. While
relatively low bank profitability has inhibited direct replenishment of capital from retained
earnings, tax avoidance tactics are a major factor behind the official profitability data.
Provisions, as a share of total loans, have fallen steadily despite a tightening in loan
classification in mid-2003.3
11.
The pace of structural reforms has slowed. After progress in late 2003–early 2004,
thus allowing agreement on the SBA (Table 7), several actions under program conditionality—
concerning related-party lending, tax preferences and exemptions, and VAT refund arrears—
have not been completed. Also, legislation on joint-stock companies has lingered in parliament
for quite some time. The European Commission has recently announced that, to be granted
market economy status, Ukraine needs to make further progress implementing the legal
framework for bankruptcy and eliminating state influence on prices. According to the World
Bank, the UN Millennium Development Goal regarding the prevention of HIV/AIDS and
tuberculosis is the only goal that is unlikely to be met by 2015.

12.
The energy sector quasi-fiscal deficit has narrowed. Improved payments discipline
and a buoyant economy have helped strengthen cash-collection ratios in both the electricity and
gas sectors. In stark contrast to previous years, this has allowed both sectors not only to remain
current on their tax obligations, but also to lower their tax arrears.4
13.
The authorities felt they had benefited from Fund’s advice. While in the case of
Ukraine, it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of Fund’s surveillance per se, given the
existence of Fund-supported programs, the authorities indicated that Fund recommendations
had helped them focus and coordinate their macroeconomic policy, particularly in areas such as
tax reform and banking prudential regulation and supervision. Moreover, even when the
authorities and staff have disagreed, dialogue with the Fund has fostered internal debate. It is,
however, the case that key policy commitments under successive Fund-supported programs
have not been followed through.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.

The focus of the discussions was threefold:

•

The sustainability of the current positive economic outlook. The most noticeable
development this year is the impressive growth performance. While this is a welcome
development, can growth be sustained at the same pace? Also, are the expansionary
fiscal stance, sizable foreign exchange inflows, strong credit growth, and the authorities’
reluctance to allow for greater exchange rate flexibility likely to exacerbate inflationary
pressures in an economy already showing signs of overheating, at least in some sectors?

•

The risks that this expansion may generate. Ukraine is particularly susceptible to
external shocks given its dependence on international trade. Moreover, the strong
growth of the last two years has occurred amid the rapid expansion of banks’ loan
portfolios. Can banks then easily cope with a sudden stop in economic growth triggered
by an external shock?

•

How to respond to the outlook and the risks. The immediate challenge for the
authorities is to manage their recent success carefully and ensure that this benefits an
increasing share of the population. In the current circumstances, the authorities may be
tempted to relax macroeconomic policy or set it on the basis of overoptimistic
assumptions, while weakening their resolve to pursue structural reforms, thus
undermining growth prospects in the medium term.

4

See the accompanying selected issues paper on “Energy Sector Quasi-Fiscal Deficit.”

- 16 -

A. Short- and Medium-Term Macroeconomic Outlook
15.
The pace of economic growth in 2004 is unlikely to be sustained (Table 8).
Authorities and staff agreed that the impressive growth performance in 2004 reflected in part
short-term external factors and rapid credit growth, with staff also emphasizing the competitive
exchange rate. Staff projects growth at 6 percent in 2005, supported by domestic demand, and
at around 5 percent in the outer years. The authorities felt these projections were too
pessimistic: they saw growth at 8.6 percent in 2005 and averaging 6.5 percent over the medium
term. While agreeing the risks were on the upside, in particular in 2005, staff noted that, given
Ukraine’s shrinking labor force, a 5 percent growth rate over the medium term will require an
investment/GDP ratio higher than the current 20 percent level, and stronger factor productivity
growth. This pointed to the need for deeper and faster structural reforms and better governance.
16.
A substantial current account surplus is projected for 2004, but Ukraine’s
development in the medium term will eventually require tapping foreign savings.
Authorities and staff agreed that exceptionally high oil and commodities prices, strong demand
from Russia and China, and a competitive currency had resulted in an impressive current
account surplus, which was projected at 10 percent of GDP in 2004.5 Staff noted that, over the
medium term, sustained investment growth was required to upgrade Ukraine’s productive
capacity, absorbing an increasing share of domestic savings. Also, further expansion in the still
undersized financial sector might help finance higher consumption at a time when rising
incomes might raise the propensity to import. Authorities and staff agreed that EU enlargement
will likely have a negligible impact, given Ukraine’s export mix, assuming the EU steel quota
is adjusted quickly.6
17.
Inflationary pressures are on the rise (Figure 8). Staff noted that inflation had edged
up and there were signs that some sectors of the economy were overheating.7 Cost pressures
were increasing with strong wage growth and the PPI/CPI differential was at historical peak; an

The current account surplus is likely overstated in light of the large negative errors and
omissions. See the selected issues paper on “The Impact of Oil Prices on Ukraine’s External
Balance.”

See the selected issues paper on “The EU Enlargement: The Impact on Trade with Ukraine.”

While estimating the output gap is difficult in Ukraine, given the short time span since the
beginning of transition, recent developments suggest the economy is now operating close to its
potential in some sectors. New mortgage lending and high demand for housing have stretched
the supply of construction materials, significantly raising their price. Similarly, in the fastgrowing metallurgical sector (the largest export sector), supplies of key inputs are running low.
In such circumstances, it is likely that any additional increase in aggregate demand will be
mainly inflationary.

indication that CPI inflation may rise further, owing to spill-over effects. While noting that it
would be reasonable to accommodate into domestic inflation the first round impact of higher
global commodities prices, staff stressed the risk that inflation could reach 9-10 percent this
year and rise further in 2005, depending on the implementation of the amended budget and the
steps that the NBU adopts to counter the fiscal impulse and large foreign exchange inflows. The
authorities did not share staff’s views. In particular, they saw the risk of overheating as
somewhat remote and, hence, did not perceive the need to tighten macroeconomic policies as
urgent, while remaining committed to single-digit inflation for this year and the medium term.
Over the medium term, staff noted that, while the authorities’ policies were still to be spelled
out in detail, a realignment of the real exchange rate will likely occur through higher inflation
in light of the authorities’ reluctance to allow nominal appreciation.
B. Risks

18.
Ukraine remains vulnerable to a sudden reversal in external conditions (Table 8).
Exports account for around 60 percent of GDP, and their buoyant performance over the past
couple of years has supported the recovery in domestic demand. Given the surge in private
sector debt, a significant drop in external demand could prompt substantial banking losses via
the private sector’s diminished capacity to repay its domestic debts. This vulnerability also
underscores the need to bring the fiscal deficit down from the level projected for 2004
(3-4 percent of GDP) to prevent a sudden shock from raising it to levels that could make
financing problematic. Around a baseline involving a significant fiscal adjustment, broadly in
line with the authorities’ announced targets, and real exchange rate appreciation, public debt
dynamics look resilient to various types of shocks (see Appendix V). But given the high
uncertainty of growth trends, staff cautioned the authorities against basing financial policies,
including the 2005 budget, on optimistic assumptions. The sustainability of private sector
external debt also raised some concerns. Net private debt stood at about one-fifth of GDP at
end-2003 but external private sector assets may be underreported. Moreover, the large share of
short-term debt (70 percent) makes it susceptible to rollover risk.8 In light of these risks, staff
encouraged the authorities to build buffers against contingent liabilities that could emerge
should economic conditions reverse. These buffers will also help provide the necessary
resources to sustain the medium-term reform effort (see below).

C. Fiscal Policy and Reform

19.
Reacting to stronger-than-expected growth and privatization proceeds, the
authorities in June relaxed the fiscal stance for 2004, but envisaged a tightening for
2005. The June budget

September for
permission to channel privatization receipts exceeding the June projection into additional
spending. However, while not committing to a target, the authorities expected the deficit not
to exceed 3 percent of GDP, partly reflecting technical constraints in capital spending. Staff
noted that, even assuming that (i) not all excess privatization proceeds were spent, (ii) not all
VAT refund arrears were repaid, and (iii) not all capital spending was implemented because
of technical constraints, the deficit could still reach about 3½ percent of GDP. Be that as it
may, the authorities did not regard the 2004 relaxation as problematic. First, the extra 2004
spending was fully financed by privatization proceeds. Second, the spending was well
targeted toward pressing social and infrastructure needs. Third, its inflationary impact should
not be large (in light of the good harvest) and would be continuously monitored by the NBU.
Most important, they regarded the 2004 fiscal expansion as temporary: indeed, in June
parliament approved a 2005 budget resolution, that provided for a central government deficit
ceiling of 1 percent of GDP, consistent with a consolidated budget deficit of about
1.6 percent of GDP. However, in mid-September the authorities submitted to parliament a
2005 budget that aims at a somewhat larger budget deficit. The government has also more
recently increased significantly pensions, thus making it difficult to achieve the 2005 deficit
target. Staff will prepare a supplement with an assessment of the 2005 budget, the fiscal
impact of the pension increase, and, more generally, the risks to the attainment of the fiscal
targets.
The proposed fiscal loosening in 2004, even if limited to 3 percent of GDP, is
20.
inappropriate for several reasons. First, it would increase the deficit despite a booming
economy. Given the uncertainty of where the economy stands vis-à-vis its potential, fiscal
prudence dictates that additional resources this year be saved to allow for a future
countercyclical fiscal policy. Second, additional fiscal expansion exacerbates already existing
inflationary pressures. Third, since only 20 percent of the extra spending could clearly be
identified as one-off—about one-third appears recurrent while the remainder could be
either—this year’s fiscal loosening could undermine the fiscal target for 2005 and beyond,
contributing eventually to higher borrowing costs.

- 20 -

21.
Against this backdrop, the authorities should save the additional resources
stemming from higher growth and privatization proceeds, or, at least, confirm the
original program fiscal stance in 2004—a deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP. With nominal
revenues boosted by growth, the original target would allow new spending of about
HRV 3.6 billion (1.1 percent of GDP) during the second half of the year. While this would be
less than the HRV 8 billion (or 2.4 percent of GDP) envisaged under the amended budget, it
would cover the approved wage increase (along with some additional social and capital
spending), provide full repayment of VAT refund arrears, and allow for a significant
accumulation of deposits at the NBU. Under this scenario, excess privatization proceeds
would not be spent.
For 2005, staff viewed the target set in the budget resolution as reasonable.
22.
However, reaching that target, while implementing the amended 2004 budget and reducing
the VAT rate from 20 percent to 17 percent, as the authorities intended, requires substantial
spending cuts, in contrast with the spending increases envisioned in the budget resolution.
The authorities acknowledged the problem, but were not in a position to discuss the budget in
detail. In this context, staff encouraged the authorities to use prudent growth assumptions in
setting up the budget framework and to resist calls for additional spending throughout
parliamentary discussions.
Over the medium term the authorities will need to implement far-reaching
23.
structural fiscal reforms. The authorities estimate that about 3½ percent of GDP in
additional annual resources may be necessary to address obsolete and depreciated public
infrastructure. Civil service reform is a priority—pay levels are low compared to the private
sector (in part because public employment is very high by regional standards). Pension
reform will likely be needed to prevent a decline in the income replacement rate for
pensioners (the present level of 35 percent leaves pensioners no more subject to poverty than
the population at large, but the replacement rate would fall to less than 30 percent by 2040).
Social spending remains inadequate and poorly targeted, with widespread informal fees
presenting a barrier to education and health care access. Staff estimated that spending
initiatives to address these problems—if not matched by equivalent measures—could result
in some 8-9 percent of GDP a year in additional spending.9 This was another reason to avoid
unnecessary spending outbursts in the near future, and a clear indication that reforms would
need to proceed slowly, as measures were put into place.

24.
The high cost of structural reforms underscores the importance of generating
adequate revenues. The authorities and staff agreed on the need for an extensive basebroadening effort if taxes were to be cut—the authorities are planning to reduce the VAT rate
by 5 percentage points by 2006 and might also consider cutting payroll taxes, which remain
high. To help cover costs, which could amount to 2-3 percent of GDP annually, staff stressed

9

See accompanying selected issues paper on the “Medium-Term Fiscal Priorities.”

- 21 -

that there was scope to eliminate more VAT exemptions (totaling about 1 percent of GDP
even after the envisioned reductions). In this context, staff noted the authorities’ revised
VAT regime for agriculture (which reduces the rate and eliminates refunding) but saw a need
to eliminate the continued ability of producers to retain the VAT collected for their own use.
There was also much scope to improve tax administration, where a combination of poor
management practices (including a badly targeted audit program) and serious internal control
problems have combined to undermine tax compliance and the overall business climate. In
this regard, staff regretted the lack of progress in VAT collection and refunding. The
authorities stressed that the scope for submitting fraudulent refund claims was large, and that
a fully-fledged review of these claims was under way. Staff saw much value in the
authorities’ reform strategy, especially the move to a better-targeted audit, but expressed
concern about allowing in-kind payment of tax debts, the potential fragmentation of tax
administration responsibilities, the absence of measures to address registration and internal
audit shortcomings, and the potential for neglecting VAT refund obligations in order to meet
cash revenue targets. The authorities expect to put the bulk of the new VAT measures into
place in the autumn, once parliament reconvenes.
Careful budget management will also be needed to provide resources for further
25.
fiscal structural reforms. Staff saw room to accommodate some one-off investment costs
without undermining debt sustainability. However, project appraisal, selection, and execution
should first be improved. To generate resources for recurrent costs, the authorities and staff
agreed on the need to fully develop and use the medium-term expenditure framework to
assist in reprioritizing spending. Staff also emphasized that civil service pay increases should
be matched to employment reductions, that parametric changes in the pension fund
(including a higher retirement age) should be used to support higher pensions, and that
industrial and agricultural subsidies were key areas in which to look for cuts. Better
management of state enterprises was also needed. While there had been progress in reducing
the quasi-fiscal deficit of the energy sector, staff noted that the almost 4,000 state enterprises
should be subjected to better monitoring and control, and encouraged the authorities to
further develop and extend to all public enterprises their new reporting templates.
D. Exchange Rate and Monetary Policy
Staff argued that the real exchange rate was substantially undervalued as
26.
highlighted by wage and price levels that were very low compared with those of other
transition countries, and by the large current account surpluses (Box 1). Staff concurred
with the NBU that the surpluses had resulted in a helpful strengthening of international
reserves, but noted that further sharp increases in official international reserves were no

- 22 -

Box 1. Competitiveness
Various indicators suggest Ukraine’s exchange rate is significantly undervalued. First, Ukraine’s current
account has shown in the last few years persistently high surpluses. In 2004 the surplus stands alone
relative to other (non-energy-producing) transition economies. Second, as discussed in the text, signs of
overheating in the export sectors have emerged. Third, average wages remain less than half the wages in
Russia. A more formal analysis of wage levels is detailed in the Selected Issues Paper on
“Competitiveness, Convergence, and the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate”.
The estimates in this paper are based
on a large cross-country panel-data
model, using data from 1990-2000
15.0
across 85 countries. The results
suggest that the equilibrium real
10.0
exchange rate (RER) is less than half
5.0
that of many other transition countries,
reflecting Ukraine’s economy’s lower

capital stock and level of development.

However, even considering this lower
equilibrium, Ukraine’s RER was

results are similar to those of an earlier
study, which found that Ukraine’s
RER was only 28-33 percent of its equilibrium value in 1995.1/ Further, the estimated degree of
undervaluation for Ukraine is comparable with a PPP-based estimate of the equilibrium RER, which
suggests that the exchange rate may be undervalued by as much as 80 percent.

Given possible problems associated with cross-country heterogeneity, such results should be treated
cautiously, and they say little about the pace of adjustment to equilibrium. However, they do suggest that
Ukraine will likely experience sustained upward pressure on its real exchange rate over the medium
term.

longer necessary.10 More generally, surpluses of this size were not desirable over the medium
term. The exchange rate misalignment had thus brought about a distorted saving-investment
balance: Ukraine was, in effect, using a large portion of the economy’s export proceeds to
finance investment and consumption abroad, rather than at home—a somewhat puzzling
result, given the domestic economy’s low living standards, pressing private investment

needs, and high rate of return on capital. Finally, while exports had been key to support
growth, the economy was now growing at an unsustainable pace. While conceding that the
exchange rate was competitive, the NBU took the view that the undervaluation was more
modest than that estimated by staff, and had already allowed the currency to appreciate by
0.4 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar since the beginning of the year.
Against this background, staff argued that a shift towards a more flexible
27.
exchange rate would be helpful both in controlling inflation and in reducing risks to the
financial sector. The current exchange rate regime has served the authorities well in
stabilizing the economy in the aftermath of the 1998 crisis. But, keeping the exchange rate
vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar at a level that staff regards as substantially undervalued exacerbates
the NBU’s challenge to meet its inflation objective, a task already made difficult by strong
credit growth and a looser fiscal policy. In addition, the peg provided an implicit exchange
rate guarantee, with attendant risks for the stability of the financial sector and the balance
sheet of the private sector as a whole. The first-best policy response was then to switch to a
more flexible exchange rate regime in the run-up to an inflation-targeting framework,
allowing the exchange rate to appreciate faster. The authorities were not convinced and
intended to continue to allow for only extremely gradual appreciation of the hryvnia. They
argued that greater flexibility would create adverse expectations and instability in the market.
Moreover, the NBU expressed concern about the potential temporary nature of current
account receipts, and the adequacy of the current stock of international reserves. It agreed
that a flexible exchange rate arrangement, in the context of inflation targeting, would
eventually be appropriate. But, on balance, it argued that greater exchange rate flexibility
was premature until domestic demand had become a more reliable source of growth, inflation
forecasting had improved, structural reforms had deepened, and foreign direct investments
increased. In the meantime, MFD will provide technical assistance on inflation targeting as
requested by the NBU.
Staff noted that containing inflation, while maintaining the peg to the U.S.
28.
dollar, would be difficult and would require tighter monetary policy, including higher
interest rates, in a context of still-restricted capital flows (Figure 9).11 Staff welcomed the
NBU’s recent sterilization operations but noted these had not prevented a large increase in
base money, which had pushed real interest rates down. The NBU was concerned about the
inflationary consequences of the current fiscal stance. It indicated that it would embark on
more extensive sterilization operations and allow interest rates to rise, as necessary, to avoid

establish its independence and improve the transparency of its monetary policy framework
and operations—such as clarity of objectives, use of instruments, and communications to the
public about policy actions.
E. Financial Sector Soundness and Reform
Credit risk remains the main risk for the banking sector, despite a recent
deceleration in credit growth. Staff noted concerns about credit quality in light of
weaknesses in banks’ risk assessment practices and the widespread practice of related-party
lending. The continuing difficulty in identifying the banks’ ultimate owners has exacerbated
these weaknesses. Also, weak accounting and reporting standards for corporations have
inhibited the ability to identify risks, while institutional weaknesses have made the seizure of
collateral and enforcement of contracts more difficult. The NBU agreed with the staff’s
assessment but stressed that recent improvements had reduced vulnerabilities. Although the
NBU also viewed credit as the major risk, it considered credit quality as less of a concern
than staff did when measuring nonperforming loans as only those not serviced in a timely
fashion. Moreover, it pointed to the deceleration in credit growth, the slight strengthening of
the capital adequacy ratio (CAR), and its various regulatory and supervisory responses. Staff
encouraged the NBU to maintain its tight loan classification rules and the related
provisioning requirements until institutional weaknesses are overcome.
29.

30.
Recognizing these risks, the NBU has stepped up prudential regulations and
supervision. Since the beginning of the year, the NBU raised the minimum CAR, tightened
related-party lending rules, strengthened the definition of capital, set interest rate ceilings for
banks borrowing abroad, introduced a real-time monitoring system for interbank activities,
and put in place a new risk assessment methodology for its supervisors. The setting up of a
credit bureau, with the support of the World Bank, is under way. Staff commended the NBU
for these developments, but regretted that the amendments to the Banking Act that would
require identification of banks owners and further tighten related-party lending had not been
approved by parliament, as called for under the program. Staff also raised concerns about
possible conflicts of interest in enforcing banking supervision. Staff recommended raising
the minimum CAR to 12 percent, upgrading risk management systems and practices for
foreign currency-denominated lending, tightening provisioning requirements for unhedged
foreign currency loans, and adopting tighter accounting and reporting standards for
corporations. The NBU reiterated its commitment to ensure the stability of the banking
system but did not see higher minimum CAR or provisioning as necessary now given the
12

See the accompanying selected issues paper on “Capital Markets in Ukraine.”

- 26 -

number of resolutions it had recently adopted to ensure banks’ capital and its quality. MFD
will provide technical assistance on banking supervision as requested by the authorities.
F. Improving the Business Climate
The business climate should be enhanced to sustain growth in the medium term.
31.
The authorities should proceed by reducing the share of the public sector in the provision of
goods and services, facilitating private sector activities, and improving governance.
•

Privatization procedures must be in line with best international practices. Staff
noted that recent privatizations to well-connected members of the establishment, in
which proceeds have totaled more than $1 billion, were not conducive to greater
foreign investment.

•

Staff regretted that the authorities had not seized the current economic situation
to proceed more vigorously with other important measures to improve the
business climate. The authorities should reduce further the burden of licensing and
inspection regimes at all levels to improve transparency in the use of public resources
while eliminating the scope for corrupt practices, and to strengthen the judiciary and
contract enforcement. Ukraine ranked 106th out of 132 countries in Transparency
International’s corruption perception index in 2003. Also urgent is the parliamentary
approval of the joint-stock company law, which strengthens the rights of minority
shareholders and upholds higher reporting standards. Staff encouraged the authorities
to address the outstanding requirements for gaining EU market economy status. The
authorities are confident they will soon demonstrate compliance with all EU
requirements. Staff also encouraged further progress on those energy sector reforms
agreed with the World Bank (Table 9).
G. Trade Policy

While Ukraine has been liberalizing its trade system, it is unlikely that World
32.
Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations can be concluded this year. Following
successive reductions in recent years, Ukraine’s average effective tariff stands at about
7 percent, lower than in other transition economies. However, nontariff barriers are similar
on average to other transition economies and somewhat more restrictive than in
EU-accession countries. Indeed, agricultural quotas are one of the main outstanding issues in
the negotiations for Ukraine’s WTO membership. Other areas where legislative action is
needed include the tax treatment of domestic versus foreign producers; export duties; market
access in banking, insurance, and audiovisual services; and intellectual property rights. Staff
encouraged the authorities to address urgently the main outstanding issues in the WTO
negotiations. It noted that the single economic space (with Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan)
could also impact the negotiations with both the WTO and the EU.

- 27 -

H. Statistics
The quality and timeliness of statistics and data provision to the Fund are
33.
broadly adequate, though further improvements are needed. A key challenge for the
authorities will be the development of a formal “core” inflation index. Another priority is the
provision of consistent historical time-series measures of real GDP, and the publication of
seasonally adjusted data. Enhanced progress in estimating the informal economy would also
provide a better basis for measuring GDP. Better accounting of external transactions for the
balance of payments is also required.
I. Safeguards Assessment

34.
As mandated under Fund policies, the NBU was subject to a safeguards
assessment. The assessment completed on July 14, 2004 found that the NBU has in recent
years strengthened its safeguards framework. However, further improvements could be made
in financial reporting, and in its legal structure and independence. The main
recommendations of the assessment included (i) an NBU Board’s resolution to adopt
International Financial Reporting Standards, (ii) a detailed review of the NBU Law, and
other legislation affecting the NBU, aimed at strengthening its independence, and (iii) semiannual audits, by the NBU’s internal audit function, of the monetary data reported to the
Fund. The NBU indicated that its Board had approved an action plan for implementing these
recommendations and that a six-month audit of NIR and NDA had already been completed.
III. THE STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT
The review could not be completed as originally scheduled because of slippages
35.
in program implementation. Staff indicated to the authorities that the procyclical amended
2004 budget was inconsistent with policies agreed under the program. All end-June
quantitative performance criteria, except that on VAT refund arrears, were met (Table 10).
However, several actions in the fiscal and banking areas have not been completed as agreed
under the program. Completion of the review will be pending until the government (i)
provides concrete assurances that fiscal policy, including the 2005 budget, remains consistent
with its undertakings under the program, and (ii) takes the actions required to observe the
structural performance criteria and benchmarks.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
Recent macroeconomic developments have been striking. Growth has been
36.
booming, the external current account surplus has reached record levels, and gross official
international reserves are likely to rise by 75 percent this year. These developments owe
much to prudent policies and structural reform over the last few years. They also reflect the
favorable external environment, as well as specific domestic factors—the credit boom and an
undervalued exchange rate. On a less positive note, inflation is creeping upward, hovering in
the high single digits.

- 28 -

37.
These developments have implications for economic policies. On the internal
balance, the fast pace of growth is putting pressure on inflation, and there is evidence that
bottlenecks are emerging. The fiscal expansion embedded in the amended budget will
exacerbate inflationary pressures. The very large external imbalance poses considerable
challenges to the achievement of the monetary authorities’ inflation objectives and is not in
itself desirable. Also, the fact that current activity is largely supported by exports is a
reminder that the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks.
To preserve the hard-won gains of the past few years, prudent macroeconomic
38.
and strong structural policies are required. Accordingly, the authorities should resist
succumbing to short-term pre-electoral policies, while setting their policies on the basis of
realistic projections. Over the longer term, strong growth can be sustained only through
macroeconomic stability, enhanced investment, technical development, human capital, and
improved income distribution. It is at times of robust performance that it is easier to proceed
with reforms.
The procyclical loosening of fiscal policy in 2004 is inappropriate. The current
39.
strength of the economy, the emerging inflationary pressures, and the need to support further
structural reforms and to build buffers against future contingencies all speak in favor of
saving this year’s overperformance. Although the increase in the deficit is not debt creating,
spending privatization receipts adds to demand and so contributes to inflationary pressures.
Moreover, only a small portion of the additional spending can clearly be identified as oneoff. Resources from the sale of public assets should be used to retire existing debt or invested
to increase the economy’s productive capacity. Sticking to the original program fiscal target
would facilitate economic management through 2005; it will also help keep the 2005 budget
in line with the already-approved budget resolution.
Maintaining a prudent fiscal stance in 2005 and beyond remains crucial. Fiscal
40.
discipline has served Ukraine well, contributing to strong macroeconomic fundamentals. In
this regard, staff urges the authorities to tighten fiscal policy in 2005, as envisaged in July’s
budget resolution. While the low debt ratio provides the opportunity to finance the most
urgent medium-term fiscal structural reforms without jeopardizing debt sustainability, the
authorities should continue to maintain tight control over spending to ensure its effectiveness
and to reduce tax loopholes and evasion.
The authorities should progress steadfastly with key fiscal structural reforms.
41.
The staff encourages the further development of a medium-term budget framework to help
prioritize expenditure. Tax rate reductions will have to be balanced by tax base broadening,
both by eliminating privileges and exemptions, and by improving tax administration. Staff
welcomes the permanent elimination of some VAT tax exemptions and encourages bolder
action. It regrets, however, the lack of sustained progress in administering the VAT and
cautions the authorities against implementing rate reductions until performance improves.
Resources for further structural reforms can be found by better managing state enterprises.

- 29 -

42.
While the existing monetary and exchange rate regime has served Ukraine well,
particularly after the financial crisis, it is now time to allow for greater exchange rate
flexibility. At the prevailing exchange rate, a significant current account surplus will persist,
and the real exchange rate is bound to appreciate. It would be preferable to achieve this
through nominal appreciation rather than inflation. The authorities’ attention to the level of
international reserves is commended, but the staff notes the opportunity costs of further
sizable increases in reserves.
Meanwhile, since there are considerable upside inflation risks, staff urges the
43.
NBU to further tighten monetary policy. The NBU’s recent increases in reserve
requirements and imposition of stricter lending terms are welcome. Absent greater flexibility
in the exchange rate, staff recommends that the NBU step up its sterilization operations and
raise its interest rates.

44.
Continued progress in strengthening prudential banking regulation and
supervision, as well as the institutional environment, is needed to ensure the stability of
the banking system. Staff commends the authorities on the various actions taken to improve
the monitoring of credit growth and of the adequacy of banks’ risk management practices, as
well as banks’ capital. However, staff regrets that adoption of the draft amendments to the
Banking Act, which would identify bank owners and tighten related-party lending, has not
yet been approved by parliament. Staff urges the authorities to continue addressing the
banking sector’s vulnerabilities to shocks in view of the economy’s large exposure to credit
risk. In this regard, staff encourages the authorities to raise the minimum capital adequacy
ratio to 12 percent, to contain risk from foreign currency loans, and adopt tighter accounting
and reporting standards for corporations, which would facilitate banks’ loan evaluations.
A stronger role for the private sector is crucial to sustain growth over the
45.
medium term. While privatization has accelerated, staff regrets that procedures remain
nontransparent. It urges the authorities to ensure that future privatizations are in line with
best international practices. Staff welcomes the recent reduction in the energy sector quasifiscal deficit and encourages passage of the energy debt restructuring law to enable further
privatization in the electricity sector. In addition to the elimination of tax distortions and the
strengthening of the banking and corporate sector, other steps to improve the business
climate should include reducing further the burden of licensing and inspection regimes;
strengthening the judiciary and contract enforcement; and passing the joint-stock company
law.
Governance should be strengthened. Rent-seeking activities and lack of transparent
46.
procedures are widespread, from tax collection and public procurement to law enforcement
and divestment of public assets. The authorities should address heads on these issues, which
are deterring domestic and foreign investment, and hence, the prospect for strong and
sustainable growth.
Statistical data are broadly adequate for surveillance. The quality and timeliness
47.
of data dissemination has improved with Ukraine’s subscription to the Special Data

- 30 -

Dissemination Standard (SDSS) in 2003. However, a number of data weaknesses should be
addressed, particularly in the national accounts and balance of payments.
48.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Ukraine be held in
accordance with the July 15, 2002 decision on consultation cycles.

Sources: Ukrainian authorities; Moody's Investors Service; DataStream; and Fund staff estimates.
1/ Domestic and external debt contracted by the general government and the NBU; includes budgetary arrears;
VAT refund arrears data only begin in 2001.
2/ Series break due to new classification rules in 2003. NPLs are those classified as substandard, doubtful, and loss. Excluding the timely serviced
"substandard" loans reduces the ratio of NPLs to total loans to 7.9 percent at end-June 2004.
3/ Data include amortization of public debt falling due within the year, central bank short-term liabilities, short-term financial liabilities of
commercial banks, and treasury bill holdings of non-residents. There are no reliable data on private capital flows and some capital inflows
may be misclassified as current account transactions.
4/ An appreciation is indicated by a positive growth rate; period average; CPI-based and average trade weights (1996-2002).
5/ Based on the average weighted price (in U.S. dollars) of common shares of issuers meeting Ukraine's First Stock Trading System (PFTS)
listing requirements with the highest liquidity. The index base is 100 as of October 1, 1997.
6/ Moody's Investors Service. Note that in August 2004, Standard & Poor's upgraded Ukraine's long term sovereign rating from B to B+,
on par with ratings by Fitch and Moody's. Moody's raised its outlook from "stable" to "positive" in September 2004.
7/ Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI+) for Ukraine. December average or latest month reported.

1/ Based on spending authorized in the supplementary budget. Assumes that (i) all excess privatization proceeds are spent; (ii) local governments spend about three-quarters of their foreign borrowing and privatization proceeds; and
(iv) VAT refunds arrears are fully eliminated during the second half of the year.
2/ Assumes: (i) Hrv 1 billion in privatization proceeds are not spent; (ii) Kyiv spends only one-quarter of its Eurobond proceeds; (iii) that the government issues only Hrv 10.8 billion in VAT refunds (consistent with the
supplementary budget estimates); and (iv) the capital budget is underimplemented by Hrv 1 billion.
3/ Excludes offset with Russia involving US$ 98 million amortization for 2003-2004.
4/ Due to a new budget classification introduced for the 2002 budget, the 2002 expenditure are not strictly comparable to earlier years.

1/ Increase in NPLs in 2003 is partly due to new classification rules.
2/ The NBU estimates that as of end-March 2004, 94 percent of loans classified as substandard are being timely serviced.
3/ NPLs are those classified as substandard, doubtful, and loss.
4/ About half of the drop in the provision to NPL ratio from end-2002 to end-2003 is due to new loan classification rules.

Low-Case Scenario 2/
2006
2007

1/ Baseline scenario, based on current macroeconomic policies and the authorities' plans to accelerate structural reforms.
2/ Low case scenario, based on an external shock that results in a drop of GDP growth in 2005 and 2006. The sudden drop in GDP growth is assumed to have a negative impact on the ability of bank borrowers to repay their debt.
Additional capital requirements for banks are assumed to be borne as fiscal costs.
3/ Government and government-guaranteed debt and arrears, and NBU debt. Excludes debts by state-owned enterprises.

Safeguards Assessments:

The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) was subject to a safeguards assessment with respect to
the Stand-by Arrangement, approved on March 29, 2004. The safeguards assessment was
completed on July 14, 2004. The assessment found that the NBU has made progress in recent
years to strengthen its safeguards framework, however, further improvements can be made in
some areas, notably the financial reporting and legal structure and independence areas. The
main recommendations of the assessment include (i) full adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS), (ii) a detailed review of the NBU Law, and other legislation that
impinges on the central bank, in order to strengthen the NBU’s independence, and (iii) semiannual audits by the NBU’s internal audit function of the monetary data reported to the Fund.
VIII. Exchange Arrangements:
In September 1996, the authorities introduced the hryvnia (HRV) at a conversion rate of
karbovanets (Krb) 100,000 to HRV 1. The rate was initially informally pegged to the dollar.
In September 1997, the peg was replaced by a formal band of HRV 1.7–HRV 1.9 per U.S.
dollar. The limits of the band were moved on several occasions, most recently on February 9,
1999, to HRV 3.4–4.6 per U.S. dollar. Since March 19, 1999, the exchange rate for the
hryvnia has been allowed to be determined by the interbank market for foreign exchange. On
February 22, 2000, the NBU officially confirmed its intention of allowing the free float of the
hryvnia. However, the authorities intervene regularly to limit fluctuations in the exchange
rate, so the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified, effective January 1, 2001, as a
conventional pegged arrangement. On August 31, 2004 the hryvnia stood at HRV 5.31 per
U.S. dollar.

14

This schedule is not the currently applicable schedule of payments to the IMF . Rather, the
schedule presents all payments to the IMF under the illustrative assumption that repayment
expectations-except for SRF repayment expectations-would be extended to their respective
obligation dates by the IMF Executive Board upon request of the debtor country. SRF
repayments are shown on their current expectation dates, unless already converted to an
obligation date by the IMF Executive Board.

- 46 -

APPENDIX I

On September 24, 1996, Ukraine accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and
4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, and two remaining restrictions were eliminated in
May 1997. A number of new restrictions were introduced in September 1998. The
restrictions on current international transactions introduced in September 1998 were removed
in March 1999.
IX.

Article IV Consultation:

Ukraine is on the standard 12-months consultation cycle. The staff report (IMF Country
Report No. 03/172), and the Selected Issues (IMF Country Report No. 03/173) and Statistical
Appendix (IMF Country Reports No. 03/174) were considered by the Executive Board on
May 14, 2003.

FSAP Participation and ROSCs

A joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission conducted an assessment of
Ukraine financial sector as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) between
May 10–24, 2002. An update mission visited Ukraine between February 18–21, 2003,and the
Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) report (IMF Country Report No. 03/340) was
considered by the Executive Board on May 14, 2003. The observance of the following
standards and codes were also assessed: Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking
Supervision; Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies;
CPSS Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems; OECD Principles for
Corporate Governance; Accounting and Auditing Practices; World Bank’s Principles and
Guidelines for Effective Insolvency and Creditor Rights System; and AML/CFT
Methodology. A Data ROSC Module was conducted in April 3–17, 2002, and was
considered by the Executive Board on August 5, 2003 (IMF Country Report No. 03/256). A
Fiscal Transparency Module (experimental) was issued in September 1999, and an update in
March 2004 (IMF Country Report No. 04/98).

APPENDIX II

UKRAINE: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(September 2004)
Country Assistance Strategy

1.
The World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ukraine was approved on
October 23, 2003. It covers fiscal years 2004–2007, and its major focus is to support the
“European choice” agenda of Ukraine, including further institutional developments that
would lead to a business-friendly environment and a more inclusive and responsive
government. It emphasizes the need to build Ukraine’s European aspiration both from the
top, through reform of institutions and policies, and from the bottom, through strengthening
of civil society which will help to increase public sector accountability. The strategy
proposes a US$2.4 billion Base Case lending program. Allowance is also made for a more
ambitious High Case (up to a maximum of US$3 billion).
A distinct feature of the Ukraine CAS is its results orientation—the amount and
2.
content of financial assistance will depend on the ability of the Government to accomplish
the relevant benchmarks.
Taking into account political realities in Ukraine, before the elections the strategy
3.
will concentrate on implementation of the reforms underway, as well as on activities aimed at
increasing the voice of civil society. But following the presidential elections, the strategy
will provide for the possibility of a High-Case lending scenario, based on Ukraine’s ability to
seize the reform momentum and accomplish substantial advances in the energy sector,
agriculture, financial sector, public sector accountability, and social sector reform. A CAS
Update will review this possibility in early FY06.
World Bank Program

There are 12 operations under implementation in the current project portfolio, and
4.
another 9 projects are under preparation.
A series of Programmatic Adjustment Loans (PALs) form the backbone of CAS. PAL
5.
is conceived as a sequence of loans, totaling up to US$1.45 billion, with disbursements
depending entirely on performance. The PAL covers five cross-sectoral issues: (i) financial
accountability; (ii) regulatory framework; (iii) property rights; (iv) public sector
accountability; and (v) social and environmental risk management. PAL I (US$250 million)
was approved by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors on September 20, 2001, and
fully disbursed in two tranches of US$150 million and US$100 million, respectively. PAL II
(US$250 million) was approved by the Board on December 9, 2003, upon which a first
tranche of US$75 million was disbursed. Implementation of the program is ongoing and a
second tranche of US$175 million will be disbursed as soon as all of the agreed benchmarks
have been accomplished. Indicative benchmarks have already been defined and agreed for
the proposed PAL III. Among other projects in the public sector are the Treasury System
Project (US$16.4 million), which is designed to assist the government in creating an efficient

- 50 -

APPENDIX II

budget management system, and which is in the final stage of implementation; the State Tax
Service Modernization Project (US$40 million), which is currently under implementation;
and a Statistical System Modernization Project (US$30 million), which was approved by the
Board in March 2004.
6.
Two loans have been approved in agriculture: the Seeds Development Project
(US$32 million) - designed to improve agricultural productivity and boost agricultural
exports through private production of high quality commercial seeds; and the Agricultural
Sector Adjustment Loan (US$300 million), which supported trade liberalization,
privatization of land and agricultural enterprises, and farm restructuring. In June 2003, the
Rural Land Titling and Cadastre Development Project (US$195 million) was approved. A
new Rural Finance project (US$200 million) is currently in late stages of preparation. This
proposed project aims at developing economically competitive and sustainable rural areas
with less incidence of poverty through increased access by all segments of the rural
population to financial services.
The Bank’s program also includes support for the energy sector. The Bank provided
7.
two loans—US$15.8 million for the Coal Pilot Project and US$300 million for the Coal
Sector Adjustment Loan—which contributed significantly to efficiency improvements in
Ukraine’s coal sector. The Hydropower Rehabilitation and System Control Project
(US$114 million) led to the increased production of environmentally clean energy. Two
District Heating Projects (US$200 million Kyiv District Heating Improvement Project and
US$18.29 million Kyiv Public Building Energy Efficiency Project) are under
implementation. They are helping to rehabilitate the existing district heating systems in Kyiv
and to increase heat production capacity as well as to improve energy efficiency in public
buildings (schools, hospitals, kindergartens and public administration buildings).
In infrastructure, the Lviv Water and Wastewater Project (US$24.25 million)
8.
became effective in February 2003. A Municipal Development Loan Fund (US$150 million)
is under preparation, which is designed to provide loans to local governments for priority
infrastructure and other investments.
9.
Private sector development and financial sector reform have been receiving
strong attention in the Bank’s program. Enterprise Development Adjustment Loans I and II
(US$310 million and US$300 million) assisted the government in acceleration and
completion of the mass-privatization program and strengthening the capital markets. To
promote a stronger private sector, the World Bank approved a Private Sector Development
Loan (US$30 million) in March, 2002. In addition, the World Bank has been helping the
Ukrainian government with a restructuring plan for a commercial bank. An Export
Development Project (US$70 million) is being implemented to promote the Ukrainian
economy’s export capacity and to strengthen institutional capacity of state-owned
Ukreximbank. Also, in May 2003, the E-development project was approved which is aimed
at enhancing efficiency of the Government's decision-making process for public procurement
and documentation flow, fostering private sector development, and strengthening civil

- 51 -

APPENDIX II

society in Ukraine through the introduction of innovative models of Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) solutions.
The Bank has devoted considerable resources to the social sector. The US$50 million
10.
Social Investment Fund Project, which supports the development of community-based social
services for the most vulnerable groups, was approved in late 2001. The US$60 million
Tuberculosis and AIDS Epidemic Control Project was approved in December 2002. A Social
Protection Reform Administration Project, and an Education Reform Project are in
preparation stage.
Environmental work is proceeding well. Two Global Environmental Fund
11.
projects—on formulation and adoption of strategies necessary for the protection and
sustainable use of the country's biodiversity, and on assessment of capacity building needs in
biodiversity conservation—have been completed satisfactorily. The third GEF project that is
addressing the problem of Ozone-Depleting Substances is nearing completion and a new
GEF grant on preserving the Azov-Black Sea wetlands (US$6.9 million) has been approved.

The Bank is also providing significant non-lending support. Through the People's
12.
Voice Program, the World Bank initiated a new generation of programs in Ukraine that focus
on the development of civil society. This program is aimed at building integrity at the
municipal level through strengthening the voice of citizen groups demanding better
governance and services, and by facilitating more responsive public organizations.
13.
The main focus of the Global Development Learning Network Project is to help
build and strengthen administrative and institutional capacity in Ukraine through provision of
access to learning facilities from a variety of global sources.
14.
The Bank also carries out economic research, including recent studies on tax policy
and tax administration, regional policy, intergovernmental reform, pension policy, public
expenditures and the budget process, poverty, financial sector and corporate governance,
procurement system, financial accountability, health, education, energy and agriculture.
Reports under preparation include a new CEM, a Trade Study, and a package of policy notes
linked to the PAL program.

APPENDIX III

UKRAINE: RELATIONS WITH THE EBRD
(September 2004)

Ukraine joined the EBRD in 1992 and since then the EBRD has been active in
1.
supporting Ukraine’s transformation toward a market economy, promoting the business
environment and improving the investment climate for all investors. The EBRD’s main
contribution has been the funding of projects in both the pubic and private sectors, including
some equity investments. This has been supported by a range of technical cooperation
activities and by engaging in policy dialogue with the government. The latter has included
membership of the Foreign Investment Advisory Council, but more especially, and in a
sector-focused manner, through the EBRD’s co-chairmanship of the Energy Sector Task
Force.
The EBRD’s first country strategy for Ukraine was approved in October 1992 and
2.
was revised in November 1993. These two documents underlined the need for financing
private sector projects, developing the financial sector and rehabilitating existing
infrastructure. In June 1997, the Board of Directors approved a new country strategy which
in addition to the objectives listed above, emphasized the need to restructure the energy
sector. During the period covered by this strategy, the EBRD and the Ukraine authorities
established the Energy Sector Task Force (ESTF). The ESTF became one of the main
channels for the EBRD to engage in policy dialogue with the authorities on reform in the
energy sector, a dialogue which continues today. Among the main achievements of the ESTF
was its work setting appropriate conditions, especially with respect to tariffs, for the
privatization of the first power distribution companies to strategic investors in April 2001.
A revised country strategy was approved by the Board in August 2000 which focused
3.
on strengthening the financial sector and supporting the needs of SMEs; promoting the
commercialization and structural reform of public utilities; improving energy efficiency and
supporting the transition of the enterprise sector, especially in agribusiness. In addition
during these years the EBRD sought to improve nuclear safety through the Nuclear Safety
Account and the Chernobyl Shelter Fund initiatives, and also sought to ensure a clear
understanding of the conditions to be fulfilled in respect of the K2R4 project financing to
cover the completion of two nuclear power plants. In order to help strengthen the
implementation of its projects, the post of Director for Banking Operations in Ukraine, based
in Kyiv, was established towards the end of 2000.
In its last Country Strategy, which was approved by the EBRD Board in September
4.
2002, the EBRD resolved to further expand its activities in Ukraine, building on the period of
rapid economic growth, the progress in reform in some sectors, for example energy and
agriculture, as well as its success in attracting more non-EBRD financing. The main elements
of the EBRD’s operational strategy since have been:
•
•

encouraging sustained momentum in privatization and commercialization of
major utilities.
encouraging energy efficiency in both the state and private sectors;

- 53 -

•

•
•
•

APPENDIX III

providing funding through the banks to develop the small business sector and
at the same time continue to strengthen the banking sector to enable banks to
meet the demand for a growing range of banking services from other parts of
the economy;
providing direct financing to the private corporate sector.
commence funding for the agricultural sector through the provision of
working capital;
continuing to implement the EBRD’s nuclear safety mandate, both in the
administrative role for donor funds on the Chernobyl project initiatives and
the negotiations leading towards financing of the K2R4 project.

To support these activities the EBRD emphasized the importance of policy dialogue with the
authorities to improve the investment climate, the need to maintain co-ordination with other
IFI’s and also with bilateral donors to secure valuable sources of TC funding.
This approach was endorsed in a Program of Co-operation signed in April 2003 by
5.
the Government of Ukraine and the EBRD during a visit to the EBRD by the (then recently
appointed) Prime Minister, Victor Yanukovich. The agreement identified several priority
projects in the public sector including those in the transport, energy and municipal
infrastructure sectors, and emphasized the importance of nuclear safety. The EBRD also
stressed its support for the development of the private sector, particularly the banking sector.
With respect to the K2R4 project, this project was approved by the EBRD Board in
6.
July 2004 and signed later that Month. The EBRD will lend US$42 million, with a further
US$83 million from the European Commission, to finance post start-up safety and
modernization measures at the two nuclear reactors. The focus of the project is to enhance
nuclear safety and was approved on the basis that the previously agreed safety levels (before
start-up) at the two reactors had been attained and that the completion of the remaining safety
features would be to internationally accepted standards. A further condition of the loan is that
tariff levels within the nuclear sector should be sufficient to enable the authorities to
establish a decommissioning fund, as well as other funds to commence a program of safety
upgrades at the other 13 nuclear plants in Ukraine.
The project is smaller than that originally considered by the Board in late 2000 and
7.
2001 (when the Ukraine authorities decided that the project was not then ready for Board
approval). Since then the Ukraine authorities have completed most of the construction of the
two plants. In addition the financial position of the nuclear generator, Energoatom, improved
significantly owing to large increases in collection ratios and the adoption of an appropriate
tariff methodology.
The EBRD’s portfolio in Ukraine has increased from 5 projects in 1994 to 62 by the
8.
end of July 2004. These amount to a historical net business volume of EUR 1,492.9 million.
Of this amount EUR 900.0 million represented the Portfolio (operating assets plus undrawn
commitments), of which 70 percent were assigned to the private sector (EUR 632.8 million)

- 54 -

APPENDIX III

and 30 percent to the state sector (EUR 267.1 million). Operating assets amounted to EUR
575.5 million at the end of July 2004.
9.
The outstanding commitments to Ukraine represent almost 5.9 percent of the total of
the EBRD’s commitments to all its countries of operation. There are in addition Technical
Cooperation activities in Ukraine and these currently include 216 projects with a total value
of commitments of almost EUR 44.6 million. These are mainly related to project preparation
and implementation.
Projects in the financial sector account for slightly over 25 percent of the EBRD’s
10.
commitment to Ukraine, with much of this represented by the loans provided under
sovereign guarantee to support the development of small and medium size companies (SME)
through lending via participating banks. The first of these loans (for EUR 96.2 million) was
signed at the end of 1994, and is now fully disbursed. A second credit line (for EUR 70.1
million) was signed at the time of the EBRD’s Annual Meeting in Kyiv in May 1998. It was
only approved by the Rada in early 2000, but is now almost fully committed. The SME lines
of credit have been one of the main forms of long-term foreign currency lending in Ukraine
during these years. The EBRD is now considering plans to continue financing SMEs by
lending directly to participating banks. The energy sector accounts for a further 19 percent of
all commitments. The largest single project in this category is in the power sector; other
projects include the development of oil and gas resources, gas transit and energy efficiency.
Projects in manufacturing, including agribusiness, account for 32 percent, transport and
shipping 18 percent, telecommunications 1.4 percent, municipal infrastructure 2.4 percent,
with tourism and property accounting for the remaining 2.2 percent of all commitments.
The EBRD will prepare a new country strategy for Ukraine during the first quarter of
11.
2005.

APPENDIX IV

STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX

1.
The authorities continued to make improvements in a number of areas over the past
year. The data module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was
prepared in 2002, and disseminated on IMF’s website on August 19, 2003, assessing
Ukraine’s data dissemination practices against the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS). On January 10, 2003, Ukraine became the first CIS country to subscribe to
the SDDS. Ukraine’s first international investment position was compiled by the NBU in
2002. The country’s IFS page has been published since July 1996.
While the Fund’s technical assistance has been significantly reduced in recent years,
2.
various multilateral and bilateral sources continued to play an important role. The ROSC
recommended to strengthen the independence of the State Committee on Statistics (SCS).
Statistical deficiencies remain including in national accounts, which suffer from a variety of
methodological problems, and balance of payments data. Publication of external debt data is
delayed.
3.

Key statistical data are generally provided in a timely manner, as summarized below.

Real sector

4.
The 1993 SNA is the general framework for compiling national accounts. The
classifications used are largely in accordance with international standards. The source data
for compiling national accounts come from the extensive survey program of the SCS,
supplemented with data from administrative and other sources. The main survey report forms
used for national accounts purposes have been revised significantly in recent years to bring
them into line with the definitions, scope, and classifications of national accounts data, and
the new chart of accounts of enterprises.
Despite the success achieved in recent years, the national accounts still suffer from
5.
several weaknesses: (i) lack of published time series of real GDP showing its level relative to
a given reference year; (ii) the quarterly data are not seasonally adjusted; (iii) the fourth
quarter national accounts are not compiled from the source data that are consistent with the
source data of the first three quarters; and (iv) there are no proper quarterly price indices for
exports and imports, although the development of these indices has started. The authorities
agreed that the methodology covering the informal economy needs to be revised and
improved. A further improvement of the data collection and production environment is
needed, in particular, through greater use of sample surveys, and improving data flow
management and processing. To address the shortcomings, it is important to revive the
Statistical Council to provide guidance, inter alia, to the SCS, on the quality of the statistical
series and on strategies for improving data production.

- 56 -

APPENDIX IV

Government finance statistics

The Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the State Treasury (STU) have made
6.
considerable progress in the compilation of fiscal data. The MoF publishes monthly data on
operations of the central and regional government within 25 days of the reference period.
The economic classification of transactions and the classification of outstanding debt are
consistent with the methodology outlined in the 1986 Fund publication A Manual on
Government Finance Statistics (GFSM 1986). From 2002, the functional classification is
consistent with the GFSM 2001. All central government transactions and local government
revenue transactions are recorded in the Treasury Single Account (TSA). Starting in 2004,
local government expenditures will also be covered.
The data ROSC report highlighted that Government Finance Statistics (GFS) are
7.
available monthly but do not provide the coverage recommended in the GFSM 1986. The
data formats are more suited to the short-term needs of monitoring the execution of the
budget in the current year, rather than for statistical analysis. The authorities partially
complied with the data ROSC recommendations and reported central and local government
data for 1999-2002 in the GFSM 2001 format, for publication in the GFS Yearbook. The
authorities were also encouraged to publish more extensive information on the definitions,
sources, and methods used in the compilation of fiscal data.
The staff also noted that reporting on arrears, both for receipts and payments, should
8.
be improved in terms of coverage and quality. There are still significant delays in reporting
on the operations of social special funds.
Money and banking statistics

Ukraine has received extensive technical assistance in money and baking statistics,
9.
and substantial improvements have already been made. The data ROSC reports
recommended that the timeliness of the analytical accounts of the central bank be improved
using the daily accounting records excluding internal organizations. The staff urged the
authorities to meet the prescribed SDDS timelines for these accounts rather than exercise the
flexibility option on this data category. SDDS allows subscribers to use up to two flexibility
options on some data categories. Ukraine uses both such options for financial sector data
categories: one for timeliness of the analytical accounts of the banking sector and the other,
also for timeliness of the analytical accounts of the central bank.
The authorities are working on disseminating information on the compilation of
10.
monetary data, including on major aggregates and differences from internationally accepted
standards. As well, they are establishing a migration plan to adopt the recommendations
included in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Other recommendations highlighted in the ROSC report are: (i) expand the coverage
11.
of the monetary data, including on nonbank financial institutions issuing deposit substitutes;
(ii) enhance the internal consistency of monetary data; (iii) separately identify information on

- 57 -

APPENDIX IV

financial derivatives; and (iv) verify consistency of monetary statistics and government
finance statistics on a regular basis.
Balance of payments statistics

12.
Ukraine’s balance of payments statistics are compiled in broad conformity with the
conceptual framework of the BPM5 and are reported to STA on a quarterly basis with a lag
of about ten weeks. The principal data sources are a closed ITRS, administrative data
sources, and a survey of enterprises. Following the recommendations of the data ROSC, the
authorities have expanded the survey on inter-enterprise arrears to include information
relevant for balance of payments purposes, and intend to implement lower reporting
thresholds for banks. Due to lack of financing, the authorities have not implemented
travelers’ surveys in order to improve the quality of shuttle trade, compensation of
employees, and travel estimates. Some methodological weaknesses exist in private portfolio
and FDI surveys. The authorities have made progress in disseminating international reserves
data. The release of monthly data, in line with the Fund’s reserve template, started in mid2002. Though the cooperation between different government agencies has improved in recent
years, problems still exist in coordinating the work of the National Bank of Ukraine, the
SCS, and the MoF, particularly regarding short-term external debt. Ukraine still does not
disseminate external debt data that meet all SDDS requirements.

APPENDIX V

MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK, RISKS, AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline scenario

1.
Achieving a path of high sustained growth depends critically on stronger
investment. In addition to maintaining sound macroeconomic policies, sustained economic
growth over the medium term will require persistent efforts to address weaknesses in the
business climate. In particular, uncertainties in the legal system need to be overcome,
corporate governance needs to be strengthened, and transparency needs to be increased, so
that a level playing field can be established.
Based on significant progress in structural reforms, the staff estimates real GDP
2.
to grow by 5 percent per year over the medium term. With a decline in population and the
depreciation of a large share of the current capital stock, such a growth path requires much
stronger investment in addition to the expected increase in productivity. The baseline
scenario assumes an average increase in the private investment to GDP ratio by 1½
percentage point over the next four years. Additional FDI of about $8 billion until 2008 is
also assumed to stimulate growth.
Fiscal policy would be geared to address pressing social and infrastructure needs
3.
while further reducing public debt levels. A fiscal deficit of 1½ percent over the medium
term would allow the public debt stock to fall gradually to below 20 percent starting in 2006.
In view of the need to develop the domestic government securities market and risks from the
large share of foreign debt (72 percent of total public debt at end-June 2004), a shift towards
domestic debt financing is projected.
The hryvnia is assumed to appreciate gradually contributing to the unwinding of
4.
the current account surplus and the reduction of external debt. The current account
surplus is expected to turn around into a deficit from 2007 as investment and import demand
increase. The capital account is projected to strengthen as portfolio outflows subside and FDI
increases. Gross international reserves are projected to exceed 4 months of imports.

5.
Under the baseline scenario, public and external debt levels remain robust.
Public debt is projected to fall to about 17 percent by 2009, 60 percent of which would be
external debt.
Risks to the baseline scenario

6.
A sharp drop in external demand could temporarily impede the debt
consolidation path. Ukraine’s strong dependence on external demand—exports contribute to
60 percent of GDP—make it particularly susceptible to external shocks. In a scenario in
which exports decline by 4 percent compared to 2004, GDP growth could drop to 1 percent
in 2005—5 percentage points below the projected baseline growth—before it would slowly
recover to its medium-term path (see low case scenario in the Medium-Term Framework
Table). Such a sharp reduction in GDP could also have serious implications for bank

- 60 -

APPENDIX V

borrowers’ abilities to repay their rising level of bank debt and cause distress in the banking
system. Assuming that for the largest 25 banks one third of adversely classified loans
(“substandard”, “doubtful” and “loss”) would not be repaid and achieve a recovery value of
only 25 percent, this would require additional bank capital of about HRV 7½ billion. If the
government were to bear the costs of such banking sector distress, one can expect fiscal costs
of about 1.2 percent of GDP over two years.
7.
Under such a shock scenario, the current account deficit is projected to
deteriorate, the exchange rate to temporarily depreciate, and the fiscal deficit to rise
briefly. The sharp downturn in GDP growth and banking sector distress could result in a
temporary loss of confidence with adverse effects on investment—domestic as well as
foreign—portfolio investment, and the exchange rate. Debt ratios could rise to 29 percent of
GDP by 2006—compared to the projected 19 percent under the baseline scenario—before
reverting to its consolidation path. However, appropriate handling of the distress in the
banking sector and adequate macroeconomic responses are key to keep such a shock shortlived, regain confidence, and put Ukraine back on a sustained growth path.
All in all, public debt levels are robust to various types of shock as long as
8.
macroeconomic policy responses are appropriate. In addition to the shock discussed
above, sensitivity analysis of the baseline projections based on various types of one-time
shocks, which reflect historical volatilities of key economic indicators, is shown in Tables 1
and 2.15 The sensitivity analysis suggests that a large output shock—negative real growth
rates of 6.9 percent for two consecutive years—could push the public debt to GDP ratio to
nearly 40 percent. As long as fiscal policy responds, such a development would be relatively
short-lived and the debt to GDP ratio would reverse to about 35½ percent by 2009. However,
if fiscal policy lacked such prudence, public debt dynamics would become unsustainable and
debt ratios would rise to over 60 percent by 2009. A one-time 30 percent depreciation in
2005 could raise the public debt-to-GDP ratio by 12 percentage points above the baseline.
However, under all other baseline scenarios the debt ratios would converge to below or close
to 30 percent of GDP by 2009.
Thus, Ukraine’s most immediate vulnerabilities are not related to public debt
9.
levels but its dependence on external demand, potential imbalances in the financial
sector, and domestic confidence reversals.
•

15

Credit and exchange rate risk in the banking sector: Rapid credit growth,
including in foreign currency denominated loans, has exposed the banking sector to
significant credit risk, especially given banks’ limited risk management capacities,
relatively weak financial conditions of some banks, and institutional weaknesses,

The caveat of such analysis, however, is that it does not combine the different effects of
potential shocks as discussed under the previous scenario.

- 61 -

APPENDIX V

such as weak accounting and reporting requirements for corporations and weak
corporate governance.
•

External shocks: Ukraine’s open economy is highly dependent on international
trade. In particular, Russia remains the largest market for Ukrainian goods,
accounting for close to 20 percent of all exports. Taking into account the other CIS
countries, which are also dependent on the Russian economy, a downturn in Russia
would affect about one fourth of Ukraine’s exports, equivalent to about 12 percent of
GDP. A decline in net service demand, foreign investment, and worker’s remittances
from Russia may also have a noticeable adverse impact on Ukraine’s economy. The
large share of metallurgical products in exports (about one third) is another risk factor
should the trend in world market prices suddenly reverse.

•

A loss of domestic confidence: Confidence could suffer under various
circumstances. If not counteract decisively, reemerging inflationary pressures could
fuel inflationary expectations and trigger a loss of confidence in the currency.
Combined with political uncertainties and developments that are potentially
detrimental to the investment climate, this could trigger capital flight.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of
foreign-currency denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ The low case scenario is shown in detail in the Medium-Term Framework Table and discussed in the text. It assumes an external shock that reduces GDP growth
to 1 percent in 2005 and 2 percent in 2005. The sudden drop in GDP growth is assumed to also have a negative impact on the ability of bank borrowers to repay their debt.
Additional capital requirements for banks are assumed to be borne as fiscal costs.
10/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
11/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance) remain at the level in percent of GDP/growth rate of the last projection year.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
UKRAINE
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with the Fiscal Affairs
and Policy Development and Review Departments)
Approved by Carlo Cottarelli and Michael T. Hadjimichael
October 18, 2004
1.
This supplement provides information on developments since the staff report was
issued. The new information strengthens the concerns expressed in the staff appraisal (see
below), particularly with regard to the procyclical loosening of fiscal policy.
2.
Inflation continues to edge up. Despite the government’s attempt to contain
increases in gasoline and food prices, modest central bank sterilization operations, and an
excellent harvest, annual CPI inflation rose to 10.7 percent in September, thus hitting double
digits for the first time since June 2001. In response, the National Bank of Ukraine raised its
discount and overnight refinance rates by 50 basis points in October. Since May seasonallyadjusted monthly inflation has remained, at 1 percent, more than double the average over the
first four months of the year. Annual PPI inflation also continued to increase and reached
23.2 percent. Moreover, recently released data on household income and consumption show
a sharp acceleration of expenditure in August. This and the recent loosening of fiscal policy
are clear harbingers of further inflationary pressures. As a result, the staff projects that CPI
inflation could reach 11 percent by year end. The authorities maintain that inflation will
revert to single digits.
3.
In the run-up to the presidential election, spending pressures are rising. The
government approved an increase in the minimum monthly pension from HRV 130 ($25) to
HRV 284.6 ($54), effective retroactively September 1, 2004. This increase—which follows
two earlier sizeable increases in the year—boosts the monthly pension bill by 36 percent for
the remaining four months of the year, raising government expenditure by about 1¼ and
3 percent of GDP in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The government has also decided to clear
wage arrears at state and bankrupt agricultural enterprises, and to increase social spending.
Looking ahead, both leading presidential candidates have announced new plans for more
aggressive tax rate reductions than envisaged so far, and additional compensation for lost
savings from the hyperinflation of the early 1990s, adding yet more uncertainty about the
stance of future fiscal policy.

-2-

4.
With much of the increase in government spending now clearly recurrent and in
the absence of offsetting measures, the fiscal outlook for 2004 and 2005 has deteriorated
substantially. More specifically:

Sources: Ukrainian authorities; and Fund staff projections.
1/ Staff report projections assume a reduction in the VAT rate from 20 percent to 17 percent in 2005 (accounting for 0.8 percent of GDP),
based on the July discussions.
2/ The budget assumes that the VAT rate is not cut in 2005 (since planned legislation has not yet been approved); and does not incorporate
the recent pension increase. Note also that the actual budget numbers for revenues and expenditures are 2 percent of GDP higher than
reported in the table, reflecting offset transactions.
3/ Staff assessment of the fiscal stance in 2005 is based on the draft budget and the recently approved measures.
4/ Corrective measures needed to achieve the target envisaged in the draft 2005 budget submitted to parliament in September.

•

Without corrective measures, the consolidated government deficit would rise to
about 4½ percent of GDP in 2004. To finance the pension increase and clear wage
arrears over the rest of the year, the government has secured the budget committee’s
approval to spend HRV 4 billion of additional privatization proceeds (i.e., exceeding
those projected under the amended budget). Staff estimates this additional spending
to add about 1¼ percent of GDP to the staff report projection of the consolidated
budget deficit. In September alone, the budget deficit was 1 percent of annual GDP.
In communications with staff, the authorities have, however, reiterated their
intentions to limit the consolidated budget deficit to 3 percent of GDP; this would be
accomplished through a combination of more effective tax administration, spending
delays, and under-spending of budget limits. In addition, the authorities have also
noted that in 2002, despite parliamentary elections, government spending was
successfully curbed at the end of the year when faced with budgetary difficulties;
indeed the fiscal outturn was a surplus.

•

Given recent developments and policy measures, particularly on pensions, the
draft 2005 budget, which was submitted to parliament in mid-September, is now
obsolete. While the draft 2005 budget—which targets a consolidated budget deficit of

1.8 percent of GDP—appears broadly in line with staff recommendations, it does not
incorporate any of the recently approved measures. Thus, in the absence of
adjustment, the consolidated budget deficit in 2005 could be much larger. First,
spending would be up considerably. The pension increase will add about 3 percent of
GDP to the deficit. Based on higher planned foreign borrowing and staff projections
for local government own revenues, the staff expects local government expenditure to
be ¾ percent of GDP above budget projections. Moreover, despite local government
revenue overperformance, staff projects that consolidated overall budget revenues
will fall short of budget target by ¾ percent of GDP, reflecting a less optimistic
assumption about improvements in VAT administration. Altogether, achieving the
2005 budget target would require corrective measures of some 4½ percentage points
of GDP. The necessary adjustment would become larger if the authorities proceeded
with reducing VAT rates. This measure (rate cut from 20 percent to 17 percent)
envisaged during the July discussions, is not included in the budget but the Prime
Minister recently announced that he would soon submit it to the Cabinet of Ministers.
Again in communications with staff, the authorities have indicated they expect that
the approved 2005 budget will limit the consolidated deficit to about 2 percent of
GDP.
5.
The authorities have budgeted substantial tax offsets in 2005.1 Total transactions
would amount to HRV 7.4 billion (2 percent of GDP). Communal services arrears or a
portion of the ratepayer’s current bill would be netted against (a small portion of) lost
savings from the 1990s hyperinflation; agriculture sector tax arrears would be netted against
a contribution to food stock building; and Naftogaz tax arrears would be netted against
further efforts by Naftogaz to improve its metering. Based on past experience with offsets,
these transactions may add to, rather than correct, the arrears problems since new arrears
could help economic agents secure their participation in a new offset round.
6.
VAT refund arrears have been drastically reduced. The authorities have indicated
that VAT refund arrears declined to HRV 295 million at end-August. This result reflected (i)
a large surge in securitization of these claims, virtually exhausting the securitization scheme
in the 2004 budget, (ii) increased use of netting against other taxes, and (iii) a significant
increase in rejections of new VAT refund claims (40 percent of claims rejected in July and
August in contrast to a rejection rate of 9 percent in the first half of the year). Based on past
experience, it is uncertain whether the good performance in July and August will be
sustained.
Staff Appraisal
1

In principle, these offsets affect revenues and spending by the same amount. In order to
facilitate the comparison with the staff report projections, they are not included in the last
two columns of the text table in paragraph 4 (see footnote 2 of that table).

-4-

7.
The recent fiscal developments require prompt correction. The significant
increase in recurrent government spending, particularly pensions, resulting from the amended
budget’s use of one-off privatization receipts, is inappropriate and places public finances on
less firm footing, thus compromising the 2005 budget. Indeed, the authorities’ objectives of
cutting the VAT rate, spending more on infrastructure and social needs, raising pensions, and
reversing the fiscal expansion are incompatible. The fiscal discipline that has been
implemented over the past few years has served Ukraine well and has been instrumental in
bringing about strong macroeconomic fundamentals. The staff therefore urges the authorities
to adopt corrective measures as soon as possible in order to prevent hard-won stabilization
gains, particularly low inflation, and a sound fiscal outlook from slipping away.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with
Ukraine
On October 25, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Ukraine.1
Background
Six years after the 1998 financial crisis, Ukraine continues to recover strongly. In 2003 real GDP
grew by 9.4 percent, despite a poor harvest and reached 13.5 percent through July 2004.
Growth in 2003–04 has been prompted by favorable external demand, a competitive cost
structure, and dynamic domestic demand. Export growth has averaged 25 percent (year-onyear) since end-2002, yielding a sizeable current account surplus and foreign reserve
accumulation. Despite the strong growth, unemployment remains high at about 9 percent,
according to International Labor Organization’s definitions.
Inflation has been moderate, but strong upward pressures are emerging. From a low of
-0.6 percent in December 2002, the 12-month Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate reached
8.2 percent in December 2003 and increased to 10.7 percent in September 2004. Producer
Price Index (PPI) inflation was 23.2 percent in September 2004 reflecting mostly higher world
prices for energy and metals. Even excluding these items, core PPI inflation exceeded
10 percent. Wages continue to grow strongly. In June 2004, the average nominal monthly wage
for the entire economy was 26.3 percent above its level the previous year.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2Fiscal policy remained prudent through mid-2004. The consolidated government cash deficit
was 0.7 percent of GDP in 2003. Through end-June 2004, it amounted to 0.2 percent of
(annual) GDP versus an end-June adjusted program ceiling of 0.9 percent. However, the
outturn reflects an accumulation of VAT refund arrears; had the programmed reduction
occurred, the deficit would have been one percent of GDP. Indeed, general problems with VAT
administration contributed to an overall drop in the revenue/GDP ratio, and led the president to
replace senior management in the State Tax Administration in June. In the run-up to the
presidential elections, the government approved an increase in the minimum monthly pension
from Hrv 130 ($25) to Hrv 284.6 ($54), effective retroactively, September 1, 2004.
This increase—which follows two earlier sizeable increases in the year—boosts the monthly
pension bill by 36 percent for the remaining four months of the year, raising government
expenditure by about 1¼ and three percent of GDP in 2004 and 2005, respectively. As a result,
the draft 2005 budget, which was submitted to parliament in mid-September and targeted a
consolidated budget deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP, is now obsolete. Provisional data show that
this year fiscal deficit has increased to 1½ percent of GDP as of end-September.
In the context of a de facto peg to the dollar, strong money growth has until very recently been
consistent with single-digit inflation, amid continued remonetization and a modest monetary
policy tightening. In the first part of 2004, a large build-up of government deposits helped
moderate base-money growth, despite the National Bank of Ukraine’s (NBU) pronounced
interventions in the foreign exchange market that led to strong NIR accumulation. Starting in
May, the NBU has tightened monetary policy, including by issuing Certificates of Deposit (CDs)
(although in low volumes) and raising reserve requirements. The discount rate was raised again
by 50 basis points to eight percent in early October.
Competitiveness remains strong. In the 12 months to June 2004, the real effective exchange
rate depreciated by four percent, reflecting mainly Ukraine's low inflation vis-à-vis Russia, and
the strengthening euro. Average wages remain less than half Russia’s wages.
Despite the NBU’s ongoing steps to strengthen prudential regulation and banking supervision,
credit expansion and credit quality remain a concern. The credit-to-GDP ratio stands at
29.5 percent compared to 12.4 percent in 2000. While credit expansion has decelerated since
early 2004, loans have increased to about two-thirds of bank assets. Nonperforming loans
classified by past due criteria are estimated at eight percent of total loans.
There has been progress in the structural reform agenda, but tax administration should improve.
Income taxes have been cut and the tax base broadened by eliminating some exemptions, the
pension system reformed, and collection ratios in the energy sector have improved. However,
several actions under program conditionality—concerning related-party lending, tax preferences
and exemptions, and VAT refund arrears—have not been completed.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted that the impressive macroeconomic developments over the last few years—fast
growth, declining inflation and strong external position—owed much to the prudent
macroeconomic and structural reform policies followed until recently. They expressed concern,

-3however, about the fiscal expansion underway in the context of an already rapidly growing
economy, and stressed the need to return to a more prudent fiscal stance. Moreover, structural
policies needed to be stepped up to raise sustainable growth over the medium term. In this
context, Directors regretted that the review of the Stand-By Arrangement could not be
completed as scheduled.
Directors welcomed several positive features of Ukraine’s recent macroeconomic performance.
Growth has been booming, the external current account surplus has reached record levels,
market confidence has improved, and, accordingly, official international reserves have
increased considerably. However, Directors noted that capacity bottlenecks were now
emerging, strong foreign exchange inflows continued to fuel domestic liquidity, and fiscal
discipline was increasingly being undermined, pushing inflation up to double digits.
They stressed that the overheating pressures and the fact that current activity was largely
supported by the external sector, while banks’ portfolios had expanded significantly, were
reminders that the economy remained vulnerable to shocks.
In this context, Directors felt that the loosening of fiscal policy in 2004 increased the risks of
overheating. They noted that, although the surge in the deficit this year was largely financed
through higher-than-expected privatization proceeds, the significant increases in recurrent
government spending, particularly pensions, compromised the 2005 budget and placed public
finances on a less firm footing. Moreover, they emphasized that resources from the sale of
public assets would be better used to retire existing debt so as to build room against future
contingencies and for the sizable medium-term public spending needs, including in
infrastructure.
Directors, noting that fiscal discipline had served Ukraine well in the past, urged the authorities
to take prompt corrective measures to restore a sound fiscal outlook and to avoid a sizable
slippage with respect to the original fiscal target for 2004—a consolidated budget deficit of
1¾ percent of GDP. A large correction was also needed to achieve the consolidated budget
deficit envisaged in the draft 2005 budget of 1¾ percent of GDP.
Directors encouraged expenditure prioritization through further development of a medium-term
budget framework, but cautioned against hasty tax rate reductions before the tax base was
broadened and tax administration strengthened. While welcoming the recent sharp reduction in
VAT refund arrears, Directors remained cautious on whether the good performance will be
sustained, and saw significant scope for further improving VAT administration.
Directors noted that the real exchange rate would be subject to appreciation pressures in the
medium term, and, given the choice between inflation and nominal appreciation in realizing this
appreciation, they considered a move toward a more flexible exchange rate regime more
beneficial to Ukraine. In this respect, Directors felt that the de facto peg to the U.S. dollar was
now exacerbating the challenge for the NBU to achieve its inflation objective. It also contributed
to a distorted saving-investment position and provided an implicit exchange rate guarantee, with
attendant risks for the financial stability of the private sector as a whole. Many Directors referred
to the vulnerability of the banking system, observed the need for appropriate sequencing, and

-4suggested that the pace of movement toward flexibility should be left to the judgment of the
authorities.
While welcoming the NBU’s increasing efforts to drain liquidity, Directors noted that monetary
conditions remained too loose to ensure attainment of the original inflation objective in 2004 and
beyond. In the face of additional government spending, mounting inflationary pressures and
absent greater exchange rate flexibility, Directors felt that the NBU should tighten monetary
policy further to achieve its objective of bringing inflation back to single digits.
Directors commended the NBU on the continued progress in strengthening prudential banking
regulation and supervision. The various actions taken to improve the monitoring of credit growth
and of the adequacy of banks’ capital and risk management practices were welcome. However,
they regretted that the draft amendments to the Banking Act, which would allow identification of
bank owners and tighten related-party lending, had not yet been adopted by parliament. While
stressing the need to continue addressing the banking sector’s vulnerabilities, Directors
encouraged the authorities to raise the minimum capital adequacy ratio to 12 percent, to contain
risk from foreign currency loans, and to adopt tighter accounting and reporting standards for
corporations. They welcomed the inclusion of collective action clauses in Ukraine’s 2004
Eurobond issues.
Directors agreed that sustaining high medium-term growth required a better investment climate.
In this context, Directors noted that governance problems remained widespread, ranging from
tax collection and public procurement to law enforcement and divestment of public assets. They
regretted that, while privatization had recently accelerated, procedures remained
nontransparent. Directors welcomed the recent fall in the energy sector quasi-fiscal deficit. They
also advised prompt passage of important legislation, such as the energy debt restructuring law
and the joint-stock company law; a reduction in the burden of licensing and inspection regimes;
and a strengthening of the judiciary and of contract enforcement.
Directors noted that, while broadly adequate for surveillance, statistical data could be improved,
particularly with regard to the national accounts and the balance of payments.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
with Ukraine is also available.
