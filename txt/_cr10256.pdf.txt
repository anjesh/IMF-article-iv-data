EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Sudan has been adversely affected by the global crisis through a sharp decline in oil receipts.
Economic growth in 2009 decelerated to 4 ½ percent as a result of the global recession.
Average inflation fell to about 11 percent, from over 14 percent in 2008. While the overall
fiscal deficit widened in 2009, the non-oil deficit narrowed (as a percent of non-oil GDP),
albeit to a lesser extent than programmed. Most expenditures were lower than envisaged in
the program with the notable exception of transfers to the South, fuel subsidies, and elections
related expenditures. Tax revenue increased significantly, but non-oil non-tax revenue
remained constant in relation to GDP. The authorities relaxed the monetary stance in
response to the global crisis. Foreign international reserves remained low, mainly due to
lower external receipts and central bank sales of foreign exchange.
Important reforms were implemented under the 2009–10 staff-monitored program (SMP),
albeit some with a delay, and three quantitative targets for end-December, 2009 were not
met. Specifically, the targets on NIR, NDA, and domestic borrowing by the government were
missed, largely due to the larger than envisaged fiscal deficit, weak external inflows, and
foreign exchange sales.
Authorities’ views
The authorities plan to reduce the fiscal deficit, including through broadening the revenue
base by reducing tax exemptions and improving administration.
They intend to build up foreign exchange reserves and are aware that a cautious monetary
policy is needed to achieve this objective.
Progress on debt relief under HIPC is essential to remove the debt overhang and regain
access to concessional financing for development and social projects.
Staff recommendations


Tighten the monetary stance to reduce pressures on inflation and the exchange rate.



Increase exchange rate flexibility in order to rebuild foreign exchange reserves.



Continue with fiscal reforms to maintain macroeconomic stability and reduce
dependence on oil revenues. In this context, it is important to streamline tax
exemptions, reduce fuel subsidies, and adopt a multi-year budget planning system.



Continue to strengthen the financial sector, including by improving banking
supervision and restructuring Omdurman National Bank.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Sudan has been adversely affected by the global crisis through a sharp decline in
oil receipts. As a result, the fiscal and external current account deficits widened and GDP
growth decelerated. The discussions focused on fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies
to ensure macroeconomic stability and to rebuild foreign exchange reserves. Sudan has
cooperated with the Fund over the last decade, as evidenced by generally good performance
under successive SMPs and by making payments in excess of obligations falling due.
2.
Parliamentary and presidential elections were held in April 2010. President AlBashir was reelected. No major changes are expected in economic policy due to the elections.
The elections constituted a key component of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement
(CPA). A referendum is scheduled for January 2011 in the South to decide on whether Sudan
is to remain as a unitary state. The United Nations has recently lowered the security phase for
Khartoum to level II.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE SMP
3.
Economic growth weakened in 2009 as a result of the global recession. Overall real
GDP growth is estimated to have decelerated to 4.5 percent compared to nearly 7 percent
in 2008, with the non-oil growth dropping by half to about 5 percent. The deterioration was
broad-based, with the exception of a small increase in oil production. Average inflation fell to
about 11 percent, from over 14 percent in 2008.
4.
The underlying fiscal performance improved in 2009, albeit to a lesser extent than
programmed. The non-oil commitment primary deficit narrowed from 7.6 percent of non-oil
GDP in 2008 to 6.6 percent in 2009. This adjustment was nonetheless 1.5 percentage points
lower than what was envisaged under the program. Tax revenues improved significantly as
expected, reflecting stronger revenue collection effort by the tax and customs administration.
However, non-oil non-tax revenue remained constant in relation to GDP due to weaker than
expected parastatal profits. Most expenditures remained within the program ceilings, with the
notable exception of transfers and fuel subsidies as well as some elections related outlays.
5.
Monetary policy was expansionary in 2009. Reserve and broad money increased by
28 percent and 23.5 percent, respectively. These increases were higher than the program
targets due to increased credit to the government, and as the authorities aimed to ensure
sufficient credit to the private sector to partially offset the impact of the liquidity shortage
created by global financial crisis. However, despite the increased credit from the central bank
to commercial banks for onward lending, credit to the private sector increased by
about 20 percent (slightly higher than nominal GDP but lower than envisaged under the
program).1
1

The central bank financing to commercial banks for onward lending is classified under “other items net” in its
balance sheet.

5
Box 1. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement
The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) was signed between the Government
of the Republic of Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Sudan
People’s Liberation Army in January 2005. The CPA provided for a six year interim
period with the elections, followed by a referendum to determine the future of the
South. It included arrangements for sharing power and revenue from oil and
jurisdiction over the collection and sharing of various types of taxes and duties during
the interim period. According to these arrangements, the Government of Southern
Sudan (GoSS) is allocated half of the net revenue of oil produced in the South and is
granted representation at the federal level in the Government of National Unity
(GoNU).
A number of initiatives envisaged in the CPA have been implemented. A new
national currency was introduced and a dual banking system was adopted (Islamic
banking in the North and conventional banking in the South). In addition to sharing the
oil revenue, the local governments, including the GoSS, were also allowed to retain
half of the federal taxes collected in their regions and to borrow at home and abroad
subject to certain conditions to safeguard overall macroeconomic stability.
The Fund will continue to provide technical assistance to both the federal
government and the South. The Fund has provided technical assistance, mainly to
develop and improve financial and fiscal sectors’ performance. For example, it has
recently provided assistance on central bank modernization, debt and cash
management, and budget classification at both the national and sub-national levels.
Both the GoNU and the GoSS look forward to an increase in such assistance. They
believe that the substantial required capacity building in Sudan, including in the South,
are crucial regardless of the outcome of next year’s referendum. They particularly
place emphasis on the need for institution building to improve revenue collection,
strengthen expenditure management, and enhance availability of statistics.

6.
The balance of payments position deteriorated in 2009 due to the global crisis.
The current account deficit reached 11.5 percent of GDP as the decline in imports (by about
6 percent) was not sufficient to compensate for the fall in oil receipts. In addition, weakerthan-expected remittances and foreign direct investment kept the foreign exchange position
under pressure. Moreover, delayed policy response to the external shock in late 2008 and
continued support to the exchange market contributed to the decline in reserves. The guinea
depreciated by 13 percent against the U.S. dollar through August but subsequently
appreciated as the central bank increased the sale of foreign exchange to the market. As a
result, the overall depreciation of the guinea against the U.S. dollar in 2009 was about
3 percent. The central bank’s net international reserves (NIR) remained low.2
7.
Financial sector indicators showed some improvement but continue to reflect
underlying risks. Gross nonperforming loans (NPLs) declined to 20 percent of total loans at
end-2009, from 22 percent at end-2008, partly owing to a reduction in domestic government
arrears, and provisioning to NPLs increased from 20 to 24 percent. The average capital
adequacy ratio declined to 7 percent at end-2009, compared to 11 percent at end-2008.
However, this was on account of a change in the methodology used to calculate risk. Banks
with about half of the total banking sector loans requiring closer monitoring. In particular, the
financial position of Omdurman National Bank—which accounts for nearly half of the NPLs
and 25 percent of bank lending—remains difficult.3
8.
Three quantitative targets for end-2009 were missed partly due to the slow
global recovery. The domestic financing of the central government was higher than the
program’s ceiling due to the larger than expected deficit and the significantly lower foreign
financing. Moreover, the central bank’s NIR target was missed by a large margin, mainly due
to a smaller than envisaged decline in imports and large sales of foreign exchange. The net
domestic assets of the central bank were also higher than programmed due to central bank
financing to commercial banks for onward lending to the private sector. On the other hand,
the clearance of domestic arrears was significantly higher than the target, and the targets on
payments to the Fund and on contracting of non-concessional loans were also met.
9.
Important structural reforms were completed in 2009, though some with delay.
In the fiscal area, several measures were implemented to improve tax compliance and
strengthen fiscal management and administration. These included modernization of the
taxation chamber, centralization of taxpayers identification numbers, and the extension of
GFS 2001 budget classification to 5 Northern states. However, the comprehensive review of
2

For the program’s monitoring purposes, the NIR level for end-2009 and the projections for end-2010
presented in this report exclude the general SDR allocation (SDR 125.8 million). The staff has advised that
Sudan saves its allocation in view of its low foreign exchange reserves and large external debt.
3

The definitions of capital adequacy requirement and non-performing loans in Sudan are more stringent than
international standards for conventional banking because of the Islamic banking system.

8
the tax policy regime is expected to be completed by July 2010. A restructuring plan for
Omdurman National Bank was prepared in February 2010, in line with the recommendations
of an independent auditor.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Macroeconomic Policies
10.
Growth prospects are likely to remain strong in the period ahead, although there
are downside risks. Real GDP growth is projected to be in the 5-6 percent range
during 2010–15. This is contingent on strong non-oil growth as oil output is projected to
moderate. The focus of the growth enhancing efforts over the medium-term will be on
increasing agricultural production, whose potential remains largely untapped
(see MEFP, ¶11). The authorities have already embarked on a plan to invest about $5 billion
through 2012 to develop this sector. The emphasis is on attracting strategic foreign investors
by providing better infrastructure, removing structural rigidities and distortions, liberalizing
investment and the labor market, and reforming the legal system, including to enhance
property rights and land leasing arrangements. Inflation is expected to remain in single digits.
The external current account deficit is projected to stabilize in the range of 6–7 percent of
GDP, and the fiscal deficit at about 4.5 percent of GDP. Such outcome appears achievable,
but will require maintaining the momentum of fiscal reforms to offset the projected gradual
decline in oil revenue.

9
Box 2. Sudan’s Agriculture: Potential Engine for Growth and Poverty Reduction
Agriculture plays a key role in employment and output generation in Sudan. It
currently accounts for about one third of GDP and employs about 80 percent of the
labor force. Sudan’s main agricultural products are cotton, wheat, sorghum, sugar cane,
gum Arabic, and live stock. Prior to the rise of the role of oil in Sudan, agriculture was
the main source of foreign exchange earnings, mainly from cotton exports. In 2009,
agricultural exports accounted for 90 percent of all non-oil exports.
The substantial untapped potential of the sector can contribute importantly to
growth. Approximately one third of the area of Sudan, the largest country in Africa, is
suitable for agricultural development (www.fao.org). However, only an estimated 15–
20 percent of Sudan’s arable land is under cultivation. Half of this cultivated land is
rain-fed, mostly producing subsistence crops. The sector has been growing by a mere
average of 2.5 percent annually over the past decade. This has been due to inadequate
infrastructure, lack of access to capital, low-level technical efficiency, and conflict and
security problems. The sector has also been affected by the severe drought of the past
couple of years.
The authorities are placing renewed emphasis on improving the performance of
the sector. These efforts include the completion of three dams in 2009, including the
$1.7 billion Merowe dam. Public-private partnership ventures are being established
with both domestic and foreign partners. The National Agricultural Revival Program,
which was originally launched in 2005, is gaining renewed momentum. It aims at
implementing large irrigation schemes, encouraging development of the agro-industry,
including by establishing a number of sugar factories, improving infrastructure, and
increasing spending on irrigation, land preservation, fertilizers, and credit services.
Liberalization is also making progress with the recent termination of the monopoly of
the state-owned Gum Arabic Company on the production and export of gum Arabic. In
addition, the legal system is also being strengthened, including by introducing more
liberal rules on the leasing of agricultural land to foreign investors.

11.
The downside risks to this favorable growth outlook arise from the high
dependence on oil, the debt overhang, and the difficult (albeit somewhat improved) political
and security situation. The production of oil, the main source of foreign exchange earnings, is
expected to moderate over the medium term. Oil receipts account for over 90 percent of
foreign exchange earnings. In addition, any wavering in reforms, in response to deterioration
in the political or security situation, would jeopardize the major gains achieved thus far.

10
12.
The main parameters for the 2010 SMP include: (i) reducing the fiscal deficit from
4.7 percent of GDP in 2009 to 3.4 percent of GDP, (ii) increasing the NIR by $560 million;
(iii) containing broad money and reserve money growth to about 20 percent, and (iv) limiting
the contracting of nonconcessional borrowing to $700 million.
Fiscal policy
13.
The program seeks to maintain macroeconomic stability and to meet social and
infrastructure as well as CPA-related expenditures. The authorities’ approved budget was
based on conservative assumptions on oil prices, but optimistic ones on foreign financing
(MEFP, ¶14).4 The program caps the wage bill at 5.4 percent of GDP, similar to the outcome
of 2009, and preserves outlays for elections/referendum and goods and services in the
approved budget. Considerable tax efforts will be required to enhance revenues. Tax
revenues are projected to increase by 0.3 percent of GDP (or about 0.8 percent of non-oil
GDP) relative to the 2009 outturn on account of the lagged effects of revenue-enhancing
measures introduced in that year and the anticipated implementation of additional measures
to strengthen tax collection (see MEFP, ¶18). Staff also highlighted the pressing need to
increase tax revenues through tightening VAT and personal income tax (PIT) exemptions.
However, given the presidential and parliamentary elections in 2010 and referendum in 2011,
such reforms may not be possible during the current year. The authorities plan to adopt these
and other recommendations of the ongoing comprehensive tax policy review in the 2011
budget (MEFP, ¶17).
14.
A steady improvement in the non-oil primary balance is needed over the
medium term. Oil production is expected to gradually decline below current levels
after 2013. Staff highlighted that this will be an important challenge, notwithstanding an
automatic reduction in oil-related spending associated with the gradual decline in oil
production and the elimination of all domestic arrears in 2010. A medium-term perspective
is, therefore, needed to reduce dependence on oil and to reduce vulnerability to its price
volatility. The authorities recognized the various medium-term challenges, including the
large social expenditure needs that are likely to be identified in the context of the PRSP
process (which is expected to be completed in late 2010). They stressed that they intended to
develop a three-year budget framework and use the non-oil primary balance to GDP ratio as
a key indicator in budget preparation (MEFP, ¶21).

4

The approved budget envisaged an overall deficit of 4.7 percent of GDP and a non-oil primary deficit of
7.5 percent of non-oil GDP (based on oil price assumptions $60/bbl for Nile blend and $50/bbl for Dar blend).
The program is prepared based on the most recent WEO oil price forecast and relatively conservative foreign
aid inflows. In addition, the program incorporates the most recent trend in the gap between the Nile and Dar
blend prices. Accordingly, oil revenues and related expenditures, including fuel subsidy and automatic transfers
to the states, are higher than those in the budget. Capital spending is envisaged to be lower than the budget, in
line with the projected foreign inflows.

11
Monetary and exchange rate policies
15.
A cautious monetary stance should be maintained. While aware of the need to
rebuild reserves and lower pressure on inflation, the authorities stressed that it was important
to have enough liquidity available to the private sector. They, however, agreed with staff’s
recommendation to adopt a cautious monetary stance to keep inflationary pressures in check.
Staff stressed that the monetary targets should be consistent with single-digit inflation while
allowing for credit needs of the private sector. The program targets broad and reserve money
growth at 21 percent and 19 percent, respectively, in 2010 (MEFP ¶22). The authorities are
working to further develop indirect monetary instruments, strengthen the inter-bank market,
and improve liquidity forecasting and management.
16.
Rebuilding international reserves from the currently low level will be a priority
in 2010. The current account deficit is expected to improve to about 7.2 percent of GDP
in 2010 (from 11.5 percent in 2009). This is mainly due to higher oil price projections.
Accordingly, the SMP targets an increase in net international reserves to $950 million at end2010 (MEFP ¶23). In this context, the exchange rate will be allowed to move in line with
fundamentals to rebuild and safeguard the foreign exchange reserve position. Sale of foreign
exchange will be limited to meeting genuine market needs and smoothing short-term
volatility.
17.
The exchange rate level appears to be near equilibrium. The macroeconomic
balance approach and the equilibrium real effective exchange rate approach suggest that
Sudan’s real exchange rate is slightly overvalued but that this is temporary and is within the
margin of error. The pressures on the exchange rate seem to be largely associated with
political uncertainties and concerns about the low level of foreign exchange reserves. Sudan
maintains an exchange restriction and a multiple currency practice arising from the
imposition of a 100 percent cash margin for letters of credit on most imports and an exchange
restriction arising from the limitation on amount of foreign currency purchases for travel
purposes, which were approved by the Board until end-June 2010 in light of the authorities’
intention to eliminate these restrictions. The authorities are committed to remove these
restrictions by end-June 2010, provided that their NIR position improves.

12
Box 3. Financial Sector Development and Soundness
Sudan’s financial system has been growing, but
remains relatively small by regional standards.
The banking sector comprises of 32 banks, including
5 foreign and 4 state-owned banks. Deposits and
credit to the private sector have doubled
during 2005–09. Nonetheless, their ratio to GDP
stood at 16 percent and 12 percent, respectively, at
end-2009. Although both soundness and efficiency
indicators are generally weaker than in other
countries in the region, they differ widely across
banks. Sudan remains under-banked, with banking
and other financial institutions concentrated around Khartoum.
Competition in the sector is reduced by the large presence of public banks. Public banks account for about
50 percent of total banking sector assets. A phased divestiture of the public sector share in the sector would help
create healthier competition and improve the financial system.
Systemic risk is limited due to the small size of the sector and low level of intermediation. However, nonperforming loans (NPLs) are high and provisioning is low. The NPLs are concentrated mainly in the Omdurman
Bank. Capital adequacy ratios are below the required levels for bulk of the banking system.

Non-bank financial institutions and markets are very small and underdeveloped. These institutions and
markets can play an important role in the mobilization of savings and allocation of investments. There is a clear
need to modernize the insurance sector, develop the thin securities markets, and promote microfinance
institutions. In this regard, it would also be crucial to develop the prudential framework and supervisory skills
specific to these institutions.
The authorities have taken steps to strengthen the financial system in line with the 2005 FSAP
recommendations. Both supervision and the legal and regulatory framework have been improved. Other
remaining priority reforms include (i) improving further banking supervision and inspection and their
enforcement; (ii) rehabilitating Omdurman Bank (with 40 percent of its loan portfolio nonperforming) and
lowering the public sector’s share in financial institutions; and (iii) adopting and enforcing international best
practice accounting and audit standards.
A restructuring plan was developed for Omdurman National Bank in February 2010 based on the findings
of an independent audit. The plan includes measures that aim at preventing further deterioration of the bank’s
financial position, its recapitalization by current shareholders (other than the central bank), and its eventual
privatization. The authorities plan to begin the privatization proceedings by end-2011.

13
Box 4. Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff estimates suggest that the Sudanese guinea is near equilibrium in real effective
terms.
Macroeconomic Balance (MB) approach: The CGER-type panel regression, using data for
low income oil exporting countries covering the period 1970 to 2009, suggests that the real
exchange rate is near equilibrium. The norm for Sudan, according to this approach, is a current
account deficit of about 6 percent of GDP in 2014. This compares with a projected deficit of
about 7 percent of GDP. There was some overvaluation in 2006 and early 2007, largely due to
sizable capital inflows, an expansionary fiscal policy, and a real appreciation of guinea.
However, the decline in international oil prices has put pressure on the current account balance
and the gap widened in 2009. Accordingly, a slight overvaluation reemerged, but remains
within the margin of error and appears to be temporary. Since then, fiscal policy has been
tightened and oil price improved. These factors are expected to help the current account
balance to return to a level consistent with the norm starting in 2010.
The equilibrium real effective exchange rate (EREER) approach indicates a possible
small diversion compared to the medium-term estimated equilibrium. The divergence
between the actual and equilibrium REER appears to have temporarily widened in 2009 due to
the sharp decline in oil prices. This divergence, however, is projected to narrow in 2010 and
remain small, within the margin of error over the projection period. The above estimation uses
the standard set of variables in this methodology, including a set of macroeconomic
fundamentals, fiscal balance, openness, and the real oil price.

14
B. Structural Reforms
Fiscal reforms
18.
The authorities intend to undertake a wide range of structural reforms with the
goal of enhancing revenue collections and improving the quality of government
spending. A comprehensive review of the tax policy regime will be completed by July 2010.
Based on the results of the review, the authorities will identify policy measures to be
incorporated in the 2011 budget, with the objective of reducing VAT exemptions, raising
personal income tax collections, resolving tax jurisdiction issues with sub-national
governments, and optimizing the government’s net take from the oil sector. In the area of
revenue administration, the authorities intend to widen the tax base through establishing a
database to allow information sharing on registered taxpayers, with a view to identifying and
incorporating entities currently outside of the tax system, and implement WTO consistent
customs evaluation system (MEFP, ¶17–19).

15
Box 5. Structural Fiscal Reforms
The authorities are taking a wide range of structural measures over 2010 to reinforce the
substantive progress in fiscal reforms in recent years (see MEFP ¶17–21). The main objectives of
these measures are to widen the tax base, enhance revenue administration, improve the quality of
government spending (both national and subnational levels), and strengthen medium-term budgetary
planning.
A number of structural measures have been introduced to improve tax compliance, although
considerable scope still exists to strengthen revenue administration. Key reforms already undertaken in
this area include: (i) establishing a database to allow information sharing on registered taxpayers with a
view to identifying entities currently outside of the tax system and bringing them into the tax net;
(ii) undertaking a review of tax exemptions granted under the Investment Encouragement Act to identify
entities that are no longer entitled to exemptions; (iii) implementing a WTO-consistent evaluation
system for customs; and (iv) upgrading customs stations with ASYCUDA World software.
A key step in the tax policy reform is the completion of a comprehensive review of the tax policy
regime. This review will help identify concrete policy measures to broaden the tax base and enhance the
system’s efficiency. Specifically, it will help in: (i) reducing VAT exemptions granted to certain
domestic sectors and final goods imports; (ii) reforming the personal income tax; and (iii) clarifying tax
jurisdiction issues with subnational governments. Policy measures based on this review are expected to
be incorporated in the 2011 budget.
Expenditure policy reforms will be geared toward improving the quality and targeting of
government spending. This should help protect priority areas as fiscal consolidation effort is further
advanced. The authorities have recently eliminated electricity subsidies, but the reform on restraining
fuel subsidy has been pushed back to 2011. As a prerequisite for the gradual adjustment of the petroleum
price formula, the authorities plan to develop a targeted social safety net based on the household survey,
which is expected to be
completed in mid-2010.
In the area of public financial
management, adopting a
medium-term budget
planning system, using non-oil
indicators is crucial. The recent
improvement in Sudan’s
primary balance, which was
driven by higher oil prices, has
disguised an underlying
deterioration in the non-oil
balance. To better monitor the
performance of the non-oil
primary balance, the authorities
plan to develop a three-year
budget framework, including
projections for non-oil revenue and non-oil primary balance to GDP ratios, and use this framework on a
rolling basis in budget preparation. At the subnational level, plans are underway to extend the GFS 2001
budget classification to another 4 Northern states in order to support better fiscal management and
reporting. To further enhance resource transparency, public oil companies will be required to transfer
their profits directly to Ministry of Finance and National Economy (MoFNE) rather than to Sudan
Petroleum Company.

16
Strengthening the financial system
19.
Progress has been made in strengthening the financial sector, but further efforts
are needed. The authorities have taken steps to improve further the legal and regulatory
framework, including in the areas of provisioning, risk management, and corporate
governance. They recognize the need to strengthen the prompt enforcement of corrective
actions to ensure full compliance with prudential regulations and to address NPLs. For the
Omdurman National Bank, a restructuring plan has been prepared aimed at preventing any
further deterioration of its financial position and preparing for its eventual privatization. As
part of the plan, the bank’s loss-making branches will be closed, loss-making companies that
are fully-owned by the bank will be liquidated, and shareholders will be required to raise
capital (MEFP ¶26). The authorities plan to begin the privatization process by end-2011.
C. External Debt and Relations with Creditors
20.
Sudan’s external debt overhang remains a serious concern. The end-2009 stock of
public and publicly-guaranteed debt is estimated at $35.7 billion, up from $33.7 at end-2008.
The bulk of the increase reflects primarily a further buildup of interest arrears. It also
includes new drawings from Arab multilateral and bilateral creditors, as well as from China
and India. A debt sustainability analysis based on the joint Bank-Fund Low-Income Country
Debt Sustainability Framework was prepared and discussed with the authorities. The results
suggest that, Sudan will remain in debt distress in the foreseeable future even under a benign
global environment and the implementation of appropriate policies (see Sudan—Staff Report
for the 2010 Article IV Consultation and First Review Under the 2009-10 Staff-Monitored
Program—Debt Sustainability Analysis at www.imf.org). The authorities concurred with the
assessment (MEFP, ¶28). The authorities expressed concern that, despite their cooperation on
policies and payments for nearly a decade, no concrete progress has been made on alleviating
Sudan’s external debt burden, severely limiting the prospects for meeting the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) and CPA commitments.

17
Box 6. Sudan’s performance Under the SMPs (1997–2009)
Sudan has been implementing reforms under successive SMPs over the past twelve years.
Performance under these programs has been generally good.
Reforms: Key structural reforms were completed during the last decade in the fiscal and
financial sector, and data quality has improved significantly. In the fiscal area, major reforms
were implemented in tax policy and revenue administration and in public financial
management. On the revenue side, VAT was introduced, exemptions on income tax were
streamlined, excise was imposed on petroleum products, the customs tariff structure was
improved, and the granting of new tax exemptions was stopped. Improvements were also made
in budget classification, cash management, and fiscal reporting. In the financial sector, major
reforms included currency unification and issuance of a new currency, strengthening banking
regulation and supervision, and improving data reporting by adopting international standards.
Most of these reforms were part of structural conditionalities under the SMPs and were
supported by technical assistance from the Fund.
Economic performance: The above reforms have contributed to restoring macroeconomic
stability and buoyant economic growth.







Real growth averaged over 7 percent during the past decade, which was higher than
most countries in the region. Non-oil real growth averaged 6 percent.
Inflation came down from triple digit to single digit throughout most of the period,
except for 2008 and 2009. Higher inflation in the past two years was mainly due to the
increase in the international prices of food and basic commodities.
The fiscal deficit was contained within reasonable limits and averaged 1¼ percent of
GDP during 2000–09. This was despite the high volatility in oil revenue and the
rigidities in outlays that are related to peace agreements’ commitments and some other
current expenditure items. While tax revenue generally increased in relation to non-oil
GDP, the surplus of parastatals fluctuated. The non-oil commitment fiscal deficit
narrowed as a percent of non-oil GDP. The wider than envisaged overall fiscal deficit
in 2009 and the lack of external financing have led to missing the target on government
domestic borrowing.
The balance of payments position, however, remained under pressure and foreign
exchange reserves remained low. This was mainly due to international sanctions and
limited access to grants and borrowing. The authorities have resorted to reserves as the
first line of defense to absorb external shocks. This has led to the breach of the NIR
target.

Repayments to the Fund: Sudan continues to pay more than its new obligations falling due.
Despite this, remaining arrears (including interest arrears and penalties), are about
SDR 1 billion. Sudan has paid the Fund more than SDR 390 million since 1997, and over
SDR 575 million since 1984 (since it last received Fund financing).

18
21.
The authorities are aware of the risks of nonconcessional borrowing. They
emphasized that contracting of such loans had been limited in recent years and that such
loans were generally tied to specific and vital development projects, especially in
infrastructure and the oil sector. They, however, reiterated that the lack of access to
concessional finance and pressing expenditure priorities associated with development needs
and the various peace agreements left nonconcessional borrowing as a necessity.5 In 2009,
the contracting of such borrowing amounted to $693 million, mainly from China. These
loans, which are earmarked for infrastructure projects such as roads and power transmission
grids, have a long maturity and appear to have a grant element due to their generally
moderate interest rate. The authorities agreed to limit contracting of such borrowing to a
program ceiling of $700 million in 2010 (MEFP, ¶29).
22.
Resolving Sudan’s overdue financial obligations remains a high priority for the
government. Sudan has reduced repayments to other creditors in light of the difficult NIR
position and has requested from its main creditors a rescheduling of debt services falling due
in 2010. The authorities intend to pay the Fund at least $10 million in 2010 but stressed that
such payments cannot on their own resolve Sudan’s obligations to the Fund (MEFP, ¶30).
They believe that debt relief under HIPC and MDRI initiatives will play a crucial role in
helping Sudan improve its relations with the Fund and other multilateral and bilateral donors.
IV. DATA ISSUES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
23.
Sudan’s economic data are sufficient for surveillance and program monitoring,
but need further improvement. The quality of Sudan’s economic data has improved in
recent years—due in part to participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System.
Monetary and financial sector statistics are comprehensive and generally timely. Significant
progress is also being made on fiscal reporting, helped by the adoption of GFSM 2001
classification starting from the 2008 budget. While considerable improvement has been made
in the CPI by expanding its coverage and using new weights in the basket, national accounts
data need further improvements.
24.
Sudan’s technical assistance needs are substantial and the authorities place high
weight on continued technical assistance from the Fund. Priorities in the area of monetary
and financial sector include technical assistance on banking supervision and developing
indirect monetary instruments. The authorities also reiterated their desire for an FSAP update
as soon as possible. In the fiscal area, technical assistance is needed in tax administration,
5

As specified in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding, staff considers a loan as concessional if it has a
grant element of at least 35 percent, based on net present value calculations of related costs and repayment.
Some donors continue to make financing pledges to Sudan, mostly targeting humanitarian and development
projects in afflicted areas. For example, in a donors’ conference in Cairo last March pledges for such projects in
the Darfur amounted to $750 million over the next five years. Some donors’ also provide assistance, including
technical, directly to the South.

19
including oil revenue management and tax policy. In addition, further assistance in
improving public financial management, with particular emphasis on fiscal reporting and
budget processing, and setting up multi-year budget planning, will be required. To improve
national accounts statistics, the authorities requested a peripatetic expert to help introduce
the 1993 System of National Accounts. The authorities asked for continued technical
assistance in the South, given the significant need to build capacity. In particular, they
requested a diagnostic mission to identify the specific needs in the fiscal, monetary, and
banking sectors (MEFP, ¶32).
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Sudan has implemented important reforms under the 2009–10 SMP. In
particular, important steps were taken to rein in tax exemptions, widen the tax base, and
improve tax administration. Moreover, several key financial management reforms (such as
restructuring of the MoFNE, setting up of committees to enhance interdepartmental
coordination, and initiating Government Resource Planning) were recently implemented.
Efforts are also under way to address vulnerabilities in the financial sector, including through
developing a restructuring plan for Omdurman National Bank. These efforts have contributed
to a narrowing in the non-oil primary deficit, albeit to a lesser extent than what was originally
envisaged under the authorities’ program, and to a broad improvement in financial soundness
indicators.
26.
The challenges facing Sudan remain immense and complex. Sudan needs to
continue its efforts to create fiscal room to meet its social and development needs as well as
its obligations under the peace agreements. Rebuilding foreign exchange reserves is also an
immediate priority. In the medium-term, Sudan must strengthen its revenue and non-oil
export base and develop its financial system to sustain strong growth.
27.
It is important to contain fiscal pressures in the run up to the January 2011
referendum. Continued fiscal prudence will be key to maintaining low inflation and
macroeconomic stability more generally. In particular, it would reduce the need for bank
financing of the budget and mitigate pressure on the balance of payments and the exchange
rate.
28.
Structural fiscal reforms are critical to maintain economic growth and meet
social and development objectives. Sudan’s dependence on oil revenues, together with the
high correlation between government expenditure and volatile oil prices, underline the
importance of adopting a multi-year budget planning system using non-oil indicators.
Reforms on these fronts need to be focused on a steady improvement in the non-oil primary
balance. It is critical to adopt a medium-term fiscal adjustment strategy. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ intention to replenish the oil stabilization account to guard against the risk of
falling oil prices or a deceleration in oil production.

20
29.
With the narrow tax base and rigid expenditure profile, fiscal adjustment needs
to focus on widening the tax base. Staff urges the authorities to complete the
comprehensive review of the tax policy regime, and to establish clear commitments to
identify policy measures in the context of the 2011 budget, with a view to reduce VAT and
PIT exemptions, and resolve tax jurisdiction issues with sub-national government. Moreover,
staff encourages the authorities to move expeditiously toward the introduction of a targeted
safety net and begin the process of gradually phasing out fuel subsidies.
30.
The monetary stance needs to be tightened in the period ahead. Monetary
aggregates have exceeded program targets, contributing to pressures on inflation and the
exchange rate. There is, however, a need to ensure sufficient credit to private sector to sustain
growth. It will be important to closely monitor price developments and adjust monetary
policy as appropriate.
31.
CGER-based econometric regressions indicate that the exchange rate level is
broadly in line with the estimated norm. It will be important to enhance competitiveness
through measures to improve the business environment and boost productivity. These include
addressing shortcomings related to labor market rigidities, investor protection, enforcement
of contracts, and obtaining credit. It is noteworthy that the authorities have identified these
same shortcomings in the context of their initiative to promote the agricultural sector.
32.
Greater exchange rate flexibility is needed to mitigate the impact of external
shocks and build foreign exchange reserves to a more comfortable level. Reserves fell
sharply with the decline in oil price through the first quarter of 2009. This was mainly due to
insufficient adjustment to the fall in oil prices. The reserves remained low in the remainder of
the year despite the increase in oil prices due to continued sales of foreign exchange. In this
context, staff urges the authorities to rebuild reserves and limit the sales of foreign exchange
to smoothing short term volatility.
33.
It would be important to strengthen the financial sector. The staff welcomes the
authorities’ renewed emphasis on increasing enforcement of prudential regulations by taking
prompt corrective actions in cases of shortfalls. The authorities are encouraged to continue to
take measures to reduce NPLs, and to increase provisioning and capital. The staff urges the
authorities to fully implement measures included in the restructuring plan for Omdurman
National Bank and to prepare it for eventual privatization. The authorities are encouraged to
continue their efforts to enhance financial intermediation, including through developing nonbank financial institutions by putting in place an appropriate legal and supervisory
framework. Also, efforts are needed to further improve the operation of the credit
information bureau.
34.
Sudan is in debt distress and its arrears continue to constrain access to external
development financing. Sudan’s record of cooperation on economic policies and payments
to the Fund augur well for the clearance of Sudan’s arrears at the appropriate time. In the

21
meantime, the authorities should minimize to the extent possible the contracting or
guaranteeing of nonconcessional debt, as such borrowing would further weaken debt
sustainability. Staff urges the authorities to make payments to the Fund on a regular basis to
ensure meeting the payments target for 2010.
35.
The staff believes that the SMP continues to meet the standard of upper-credittranche conditionality, except for the proposed level of nonconcessional borrowing. The
SMP is a valuable tool to support reform momentum. It contains important actions to
maintain fiscal discipline and promote financial sector development. It also provides a
framework within which donors can support the peace process and provide aid, including in
the afflicted areas.
36.
While Sudan’s economic prospects are good, downside risks remain. The main
risk would be a weakening of the resolve to maintain macroeconomic stability and advance
critical reforms if the political or security situation worsens. The impact of the global
financial crisis is likely to continue to affect the recovery of the already low level of
investment and remittances. In addition, volatile oil revenue and a deceleration in oil
production in the coming years highlight the need to maintain prudent policies and move
ahead with structural reforms to sustain growth.
37.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Sudan be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ The exact characterization of Sudan's reporting basis is neither accrual nor cash. Revenues and most expenditures are still reported on
a cash basis; however, goods and services spending (the main source of domestic arrears) are recorded on a payment-order due basis
(starting January 2008) in the context of the switch to the GFS 2001 system.
2/ In calculating the base non-oil balance, oil revenues and grants were removed from revenues, while pipeline fees (recorded under
goods and services spending) and oil-related subnational transfers were deducted from expenditures.
3/ In percent of nominal GDP.
4/ In percent of non-oil GDP.

ATTACHMENT I. SUDAN—LETTER OF INTENT
May 26, 2010
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
Sudan has maintained close cooperation with the IMF for more than a decade. This
cooperation has helped us implement economic policies to foster economic stability and
growth, and reduce poverty—which are necessary to promote peace and reconciliation.
In May 2009, we negotiated an 18-month Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) with IMF staff for
the period July 2009 through December 2010. Progress under the SMP has generally been
good, notwithstanding important challenges brought by the global financial crisis and the
slow pace of the ongoing recovery. The unfavorable external conditions have contributed to a
sharp decline in our oil revenue, foreign direct investment, and remittances. Nevertheless, we
have managed to maintain a reasonably high level of economic growth and macroeconomic
stability. The government also continued to meet the challenges of implementing the
numerous peace agreements, disarmament, and presidential and parliamentary elections.
For the most part, we have been successful in these efforts. Important structural reforms were
completed in 2009. We implemented several fiscal measures to improve tax compliance and
strengthen fiscal management and administration. Furthermore, clearance of arrears was
significantly higher than the program target. Moreover, payments to the Fund were also
higher than programmed and the contracting of non-concessional loans was lower than
target. However, the quantitative targets on NIR and NDA of the central bank, and domestic
borrowing of the government for budget deficit were missed mainly due to the lower than
expected foreign inflows.
We believe that the policies and measures set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to
achieve our objectives, but we stand ready to take any additional measures that may be
appropriate. In this regard, we will maintain a close dialogue with IMF staff and look
forward to our continued close cooperation. We agree to the publication on the IMF’s
website of the staff report, the Public Information Notice, and this letter.
We are determined to further advance our economic integration both within Sudan and with
the international community. Our success will depend in part on the level of support from
multilateral institutions and development partners. In this context, we remain hopeful, and

33
appeal to the international community to recognize our accomplishments and act in
accordance with the principle of equal treatment, including by taking concrete action on debt
relief for Sudan comparable to that provided to other countries.

Sincerely yours,

/s/

ATTACHMENT II. SUDAN: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
May 26, 2010
1.
This memorandum sets out the economic and financial policies and objectives of the
Government of National Unity (GNU) for 2010, in the context of the IMF staff-monitored
program (SMP) for 2009–10.
I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
The past year has brought enormous challenges. The financial global crisis sharply
reduced our oil revenues, foreign direct investment, and remittances. Nevertheless, we have
managed to maintain a reasonably high level of economic growth and macroeconomic
stability. The government also continued to meet the challenges of implementing the
numerous peace agreements, disarmament, preparations for elections, and fiscal
decentralization. For the most part, we have been successful in these efforts. However, the
severity of the global recession has impacted our balance of payments, contributing to a
continued low level of foreign exchange reserves.
3.
Like elsewhere in the region and around the world, economic growth weakened
in 2009. Overall real GDP growth is estimated at about 4.5 percent, with the non-oil GDP
growth rate dropping by half to about 5 percent. Lower growth in almost all sectors of the
economy was partially offset by a small increase in oil production. Average inflation fell to
about 11 percent from over 14 percent in 2008, broadly in line with our program target.
4.
Fiscal performance in 2009 was good. While the overall deficit (on commitment basis)
was higher than programmed (4.7 percent of GDP relative to 4.0 percent envisaged under the
program), tax revenues improved significantly, in line with the program target. Moreover, oil
revenues rebounded in the second half of 2009, mainly due to higher oil prices. Despite the
large increases in oil-related outlays (automatic transfers to sub-national governments and fuel
subsidy), most discretionary expenditures were kept within the program. The main exception
was election-related outlays, which were higher than initially envisaged. The fiscal space
afforded by higher oil and tax revenues was used to support higher-than-programmed capital
expenditure (2.8 percent of GDP, compared to 2.6 percent under the program), as well as
repayments of domestic arrears (0.9 percent of GDP relative to 0.6 percent under the
program). The draw-downs from the ORSA (0.5 percent of GDP) were lower than the
program levels.
5.
Monetary policy in 2009 focused on ensuring sufficient credit to the private sector to
partially offset the impact of liquidity shortages created by the financial crisis. Reserve
money growth was about 28 percent, largely due to central bank financing to commercial
banks for onward lending, contributing to a sharp (32 percent) increase in net domestic assets
(NDA) and credit to the private sector. The central bank’s net international reserves (NIR),
however, remained very low. The guinea depreciated by 13 percent against the U.S. dollar

35
through August and subsequently appreciated as the central bank increased the sale of
foreign exchange to the market. As a result, the overall depreciation of the guinea against the
U.S. dollar in 2009 was about 3 percent.
6.
The balance of payments deteriorated in 2009 mainly due to a substantial decline in oil
prices during the first half of the year. The current account deficit reached 11.5 percent of
GDP as the decline in imports (by about 6 percent) and the rebound in oil prices in the second
half of 2009 were not sufficient to compensate for the fall in oil exports in the first half. In
addition, weaker than expected remittances and foreign direct investment kept the foreign
exchange position under pressure.
7.
Despite the global crisis, financial sector indicators showed some improvement
in 2009. Gross nonperforming loans (NPLs) declined to 20 percent at end-2009, from
22 percent at end-2008, partly owing to a reduction of domestic government arrears. The
ratio of loan provisions to NPLs increased to 24 percent at end-2009, from 20 percent at end2008, following our initiatives to further strengthen supervision, prudential regulations, and
loan provisioning. However, the average capital adequacy ratio deteriorated to 7 percent at
end-2009, from 11 percent at end-2008. We would like to point out that our definition of
capital adequacy requirement and non-performing loans under the Islamic banking system is
stricter than conventional international standards. At least 9 banks with total lending of about
50 percent of banking sector loans remain problematic. In particular, the financial position of
Omdurman National Bank—which accounts for about half of the NPLs and 25 percent of
bank lending—remains difficult.
8.
Important structural reforms were completed in 2009. We implemented several fiscal
measures to improve tax compliance and strengthen fiscal management and administration.
These included the extension of GFS 2001 budget classification to 5 Northern states,
modernization of the taxation chamber, and centralization of taxpayer identification numbers.
The comprehensive review of the tax policy regime is ongoing, and is expected to be
completed by July 2010. The delay in completing the review was due to the reorganization of
the Ministry of Finance and National Economy (MoFNE). In the financial sector, a
restructuring plan for Omdurman National Bank was completed, in line with the
recommendations of an independent auditor.
9.
The slow global recovery has impeded meeting some of the quantitative targets under
the SMP. The domestic financing of the central government was higher than the program
ceiling due to the larger than expected deficit and the significantly lower foreign financing.
The NIR target was also missed, mainly due to weaker than expected oil prices, continued
high imports, and large sales of foreign exchange.1 Moreover, the NDA was higher than
1

The NIR level for end-2009 and the projection for 2010 exclude the general SDR allocation
(SDR 125.8 million).

36
programmed due to central bank financing to commercial bank for onward lending to the
private sector. On the other hand, clearance of domestic arrears was significantly higher than
the program target, and the targets on payments to the Fund and on contracting of nonconcessional loans were also met.
II. POLICIES FOR 2010
10.
The challenges to economic and financial management are not expected to diminish
in 2010. In addition to the expected slow recovery in the global economy, 2010 is a year of
presidential, legislative, and local elections. Moreover, it is the year when most of the
preparation for the 2011 referendum will take place. Furthermore, the recent Doha agreement
on Darfur will add to our already high financial obligations. We expect to continue to
experience low foreign exchange earnings from oil exports, foreign direct investment, and
remittances. In the current circumstances, we fully recognize the need to proceed without
delay with our reform efforts. Our emphasis will be on maintaining macroeconomic stability,
safeguarding and rebuilding foreign exchange reserves, and sustaining economic growth.
A. Real Sector
11.
The slow global recovery will likely lead to lower growth rates than the rates Sudan
has enjoyed over the few years preceding the crisis. Foreign inflows are likely to remain
moderate. Moreover, economic growth continues to be dependent on oil and oil related
activities, while agriculture, which remains an important source for non-oil growth and
employment, has not performed to its potential. We recognize that to sustain growth we need
to focus on developing the agricultural sector and addressing structural bottlenecks to
increase investment.
12.
We remain committed to developing the sector based on our Agricultural
Revitalization Plan developed in 2008. We have successfully established public-private
partnership in the management of 3 pilot projects to improve production in irrigated land. We
continue to invest in basic infrastructure, and are working on diversifying crops, increasing
land under cultivation, introducing advanced technology, enhancing integration of farming
and livestock, building agro-business industry, and increasing access to finance for farmers.
In this context, the central bank has already established channels for microfinance to the
agricultural sector.
13.
We expect real GDP growth to increase to about 5.5 percent in 2010. Non-oil GDP
growth is projected at about 6 percent due to a pick up in agriculture, manufacturing, and
services. The agriculture sector is expected to benefit from the recent completion of the
Merowi Dam and the measures taken to revitalize the sector. The manufacturing sector is
projected to experience strong growth due to the establishment of large cement and sugar
factories. The business environment is being improved by a number of reform measures
intended to facilitate the private investment, including streamlining business registration
procedures and establishing a one-stop-shop. Average inflation in 2010 is expected to drop

37
slightly to about 10 percent in line with developments in international food prices and a
tightening in monetary policy.
B. Fiscal Policy and Reform
14.
Maintaining macroeconomic stability will be a central objective of fiscal policy
during 2010. The approved 2010 budget envisages a deficit of 5.3 percent of GDP on a
commitment and cash basis. The budget was prepared based on conservative oil price
assumptions (US$60/bbl for Nile blend and US$50/bbl for Dar blend), with total revenues
projected at 15.3 percent of GDP, about 0.4 percent of GDP higher than the 2009 outturn.
Tax collections were budgeted at 6.3 percent of GDP reflecting a slow recovery in economic
growth and the challenges in undertaking major tax reforms during an election year. The
approved envelope for current expenditures (16.3 percent of GDP) was smaller than the 2009
outturn, while that for capital expenditures was larger (by 1.6 percent of GDP). External
loans and grants were projected at 5.2 percent of GDP.2
15.
Recent fluctuations in revenues driven by volatile oil prices have underlined the
importance of reducing government dependence on oil. Also, foreign financing prospects
remain uncertain due to the impact of global economic slowdown in some of our major
creditors. In view of these challenges, we recognize that additional efforts will be required to
(i) temper the fiscal contribution to domestic demand pressures in an effort to strengthen
external stability and keep inflation in check; and (ii) preserve a level of adjustment in the
non-oil primary operating balance that is consistent with a gradual depletion of Sudan’s oil
wealth.
16.
Accordingly, we intend to contain the deficit at no more than SDG 6,461 million
(4.2 percent of GDP). This is based on the more recent international oil price forecast
(US$68/bbl for Nile blend and US$56/bbl for Dar blend) and more conservative projections
on foreign aid inflows. We also plan to pay off over SDG 600 million of government arrears,
which would clear the total stock at end-2009. This implies a cash deficit of
SDG 7,073 million (or 4.6 percent of GDP). Fiscal revenues are expected to reach
SDG 25.7 billion (including tax revenues of SDG 11.1 billion), while total expenditures are
envisaged at SDG 32.1 billion.3 Compared with the budget, these figures imply: (i) an increase
2

The figures in this paragraph are based on the definition of revenues and expenditures as used by the MoFNE.
Specifically, the revenues exclude 0.8 percent of GDP worth of accumulation in the ORSA and 0.4 percent of
GDP worth of fuel subsidy. The expenditures are, similarly, exclusive of the aforementioned fuel subsidy.
Under the IMF format, which reports oil revenues at market prices, the corresponding revenue, total
expenditure, and commitment deficit figures are 16.5 percent, 21.1 percent, and 4.6 percent of GDP,
respectively.
3

Our definition of revenues excludes both the fuel subsidy (SDG 1,087 million)—the difference between the
$49/bbl refinery gate price and the international price on local crude sales—and net ORSA accumulation
(SDG 1,234 million). Both these items are included in the IMF definition of revenues, which is based on the
market value of oil sales. The corresponding figure for revenues under the IMF definition is, therefore, about
(continued)

38
in tax revenues of 0.3 percent of GDP relative to the 2009 outturn on account of the lagged
effects of revenue-enhancing measures introduced in 2009, and the anticipated
implementation of additional fiscal measures; and (ii) a net accumulation of 0.8 percent of
GDP in the ORSA to buffer against future oil revenue volatility. In order to achieve the fiscal
adjustment in the revised program, we commit to undertake a number of concrete tax and
expenditure measures, described below:
17.
In the area of tax policy, we intend to build on the measures that we have already
implemented to raise tax revenues. These include: (i) elimination of the trade restriction on
the import raw sugar; and (ii) introduction of a federal customs and excise duty regime in
Southern Sudan. To further enhance tax system efficiency and identify concrete policy
measures to widen the tax base, we intend to:


complete a comprehensive review of the tax policy regime with a view to (i) reducing
VAT exemptions; (ii) reforming the personal income tax; (iii) clarifying tax
jurisdiction issues with sub-national governments; and (iv) optimizing the oil tax
revenue management framework (structural measure for July 2010)



identify tax policy measures that would be implemented in the 2011 budget
(structural measure for December 2010) based on the above review.



increase fees on certain construction material and parts from 10 to 40 percent; and
introduce new fees on certain transportation vehicles.



Increase excise rates to 25 percent on soft drinks, mineral water and juice; and impose
an excise duty of 15 percent on ceramic and some food items.

18.
In the area of revenue administration, we have launched a comprehensive drive to
improve tax compliance and curb tax evasion, including by: (i) centralizing issuance of
taxpayer identification numbers to business and VAT taxpayers, and operationalizing their
use by the customs administration; (ii) passing new custom legislation containing provisions
to adopt WTO-consistent valuation principles; and (iii) installing X-ray container scanners at
the entry ports to facilitate trade. We are also committed to undertaking the following
measures:


identifying and incorporating 400 additional companies currently outside of the tax
system (structural measure for October 2010).

SDG 28 billion. Similarly, our definition of total expenditures excludes the fuel subsidy spending, while the
IMF staff definition includes it. Consequently, the corresponding figure for total expenditures under the IMF
definition is SDG 33.2 billion. The IMF comparable deficit target amounts to SDG 5,225 million.

39


undertaking a review of tax exemptions granted under Investment Encouragement
Act to identify entities that are no longer entitled to exemptions.



establishing a database that allows for a system of information-sharing, cooperation
and coordination for registered companies (structural measure for October 2010).



ensuring that public oil companies transfer their profits directly to the MoFNE rather
than to Sudan Petroleum Company.



implement customs evaluation system in accordance with WTO provisions and Sudan
customs law (structural measure for July 2010).



upgrading customs stations with ASYCUDA Word software (structural measure for
December 2010).

19.
In the area of expenditure policy, we have already abolished electricity subsidies in
August 2009. This measure is expected to contribute to a reduction in current expenditures
by more than SDG 100 million in 2010. Moreover, we have taken steps to lower spending on
goods and services by selling all government vehicles to officials with positions below that of
an undersecretary. This measure has not only generated a one-time revenue increase in 2009,
but is also expected to reduce the annual government expenditures from insurance, fuel, and
maintenance. Our objective is to reduce fuel subsidies by gradually adjusting the petroleum
price formula. We plan to first put in place a well-targeted social safety net to protect the
poor. We will use the results of the household survey, which is expected to be completed by
mid-2010, to develop the social safety net. Given Sudan’s large geographic size and limited
capacity, the establishment of such a scheme during the current year will be difficult. We will
begin the process by undertaking the following: (i) design a methodology study in the context
of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP); and (ii) propose an implementation
mechanism to the line ministries and states (structural measure for December 2010).
20.
In the area of public financial management, we have reorganized the MoFNE in line
with recent IMF technical assistance advice, and have set up committees to enhance
interdepartmental coordination. We have also initiated the implementation of a Government
Resource Planning (GRP) system with the intention of making it a core component of the
overall organizational development of the MoFNE.
21.
The recent economic fluctuations driven by volatile oil revenues have underlined the
importance of adopting a multi-year budget planning system using non-oil indicators.
Reforms on this front will help reduce the macro-fiscal costs associated with oil price
volatility, by allowing excess oil revenues to be adequately saved during the boom years and
withdrawn when oil revenues are low. In this context, we will take the following measures:


develop a three-year budget framework, including projections for non-oil revenue to
GDP ratio and non-oil primary balance to GDP ratio, and use this framework on a

40
rolling basis for budget preparation (structural measure for December 2010). We will
include the non-oil primary balance-to-GDP ratio as an additional key fiscal indicator
in the budget and budget execution documents.


extend GFS 2001 budget classification to another 4 Northern states, with a view to
better monitor general government's fiscal operations and track public spending by
sector.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies

22.
We will adopt a cautious monetary stance to keep inflationary pressures in check.
Consistent with the GDP growth and inflation objectives, the program will target broad and
reserve money growth at 21 percent and 19 percent, respectively, in 2010. The monetary
targets and the projected change in foreign exchange reserves will allow for an appropriate
growth of credit to the private sector. Nevertheless, to limit risks of crowding out the private
sector, these targets will be revisited at the time of the next review and modified if required.
23.
Rebuilding international reserves from the currently low level will be our priority in
the 2010 macroeconomic framework and we will devote all the necessary means to this end.
NIR is targeted to increase by US$560 million to US$950 million at end-2010. Despite an
increase in imports and relatively low remittances and foreign direct investment, the current
account deficit is expected to improve to about 8.5 percent of GDP in 2010 (from
12.9 percent in 2009). This is due to higher oil exports on account of higher projected
international oil prices. As a result, we will be able to rebuild the net international reserves of
the central bank.
24.
The exchange rate will be allowed to move in line with fundamentals to rebuild our
foreign exchange reserve position, and foreign exchange sales will focus primarily to meet
genuine market needs. Given the lumpiness of foreign exchange inflows related to oil exports
and FDI, intervention may be needed to smooth short-term volatility.
D. Financial Sector
25.
We are redoubling our efforts to further strengthen the financial system. In 2009, we
improved further our legal and regulatory framework in a number of areas, including
corporate governance, provisioning, risk management, and the role of Board of Directors. We
plan to strengthen considerably our enforcement of corrective actions when banks fall short
of meeting the prudential requirements. We are also strengthening further our supervision
department, including through training courses, and are requiring banks to adopt international
accounting standards. We will accelerate the program for resolving NPLs, strengthening loan
recovery and loan write-off processes, and improving the credit registry to provide up-to-date
information about borrowers. We will encourage development of non-bank financial
institutions by putting in place appropriate legal and supervisory framework in order to
promote the establishment of microfinance institutions.

41
26.
We recognize the unique nature and problems of Omdurman National Bank. Our
restructuring plan includes measures that aim at preventing further deterioration of the bank’s
financial position, its recapitalization by current shareholders, and its eventual privatization.
Total recapitalization necessary to bring the bank to minimum capital adequacy ratio of
12 percent is SDG 1.8 billion. As part of our restructuring efforts, we are requiring
shareholders (other than the central bank) to inject SDG 532 million in 2010. We will be
reinforcing on-site inspection of the bank’s branches. We will require the bank to close its
loss-making branches, liquidate its fully-owned loss-making companies, and implement the
remaining recommendations of the independent auditor (structural measure for
December 2010). A number of the measures included in the restructuring program are
already being implemented, including completion of the review of the bank’s regulations
regarding (i) the role of Board of Directors; (ii) internal audit and risk management system:
(iii) financial and administrative procedures; and (iv) guidelines of operations. We plan to
begin the privatization proceedings of Omdurman National Bank by end-2011.
III. RELATIONS WITH THE IMF AND OTHER CREDITORS
27.
External debt issues. In 2010, Sudan’s debt service capacity will be constrained by
continued low oil export revenues, the need to rebuild foreign exchange reserves, the burden
of implementing the various peace agreements, and the need to address critical poverty and
reconstruction requirements. Further shortfalls or delays in donor assistance or a significant
negative shock to oil prices would further limit the capacity to service our debt. Based on the
preliminary data, the end-2009 stock of public and publicly guaranteed debt is estimated at
US$35.6 billion. We wish to convey to the international community that Sudan has
cooperated on policies and payments for many years, and in that context has met all the
conditions and requirements for debt relief. We remain hopeful that the international
community will recognize our track record and, in accordance with the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement commitments, take concrete action on debt relief comparable to that provided to
other low income countries. We ask the IMF to facilitate in this process. Finally, we would
point out that reaching an understanding on debt relief prior to the 2011 referendum would
help in its implementation.
28.
Debt sustainability. Indeed, the joint government/World Bank/IMF debt
sustainability analysis concludes that Sudan will remain in debt distress in the foreseeable
future even under a benign global environment and the implementation of appropriate
policies. The debt burden is undermining our efforts to reduce poverty and address regional
inequality, which are critical to maintaining peace and security throughout Sudan.
Accordingly, we urge the international community to apply its debt relief mechanisms in a
uniform manner and move forward with debt relief, noting that Sudan has by now embarked
on 13 successive years of SMPs.

42
29.
External financing. Sudan continues to suffer from limited access to concessional
loans because of our arrears situation and the difficulties we face in resolving our external
debt. Many low income countries are benefiting from the IMF’s concessional facilities,
which also play a catalytic role for concessional financing from other donors. We are
implementing a difficult program during an unprecedented global crisis without access to
concessional financing. We cannot put critical infrastructure, reconstruction, and social
development projects on hold indefinitely. These projects are an essential component of our
strategy to address pressure needs in all states and to support the multiple peace agreements.
Consequently, in recent years, we have had to resort to nonconcessional financing, but
limited the contracting of such borrowing to minimum levels (US$693 million in 2009
compared to a ceiling of US$700 million). We are aware of the concern of other creditors
about this borrowing, and of the risks it may pose over the medium- and long-term.
Therefore, we will seek to limit the contracting of such obligations as much as possible.
For 2010, we will limit the contracting of non-concessional borrowing to US$700 million.
30.
Payments to the IMF. In addition to cooperating with the Fund on economic policy,
Sudan’s payments to the IMF have exceeded program levels under the SMPs. We will make
sure that the IMF’s preferred creditor status will be maintained by ensuring that our payments
in 2010 continue to exceed obligations falling due. To demonstrate our continued
cooperation, we will make payments of US$10 million in 2010, despite our much reduced
foreign exchange earnings. We have also reduced repayments to other creditors in light of
our difficult NIR position and that we have requested from our main creditors a rescheduling
of debt service falling due in 2010. However, while demonstrating our good intentions, these
payments are not a solution to Sudan’s arrears to the Fund. As of January 1, 1997, Sudan’s
outstanding obligations to the IMF were about SDR 1,160 million. Since then, Sudan has
paid about SDR 390 million (about SDR 370 million in principal repayment and about
SDR 20 in interest and other charges) and has accumulated new interest and charges of
SDR 210 million. Consequently, although the total sum paid is equivalent to the principal
Sudan originally owed, its outstanding obligation due to the IMF has not changed much. This
underlies the need for a comprehensive solution to our arrears problem. We appeal to the
international community to recognize our accomplishments, act in accordance with the
principle of equal treatments, and work toward a rapid resolution of Sudan’s debt and arrears
problem.
31.
PRSP. To guide our efforts in reducing poverty, we are in the final stages of
producing our PRSP and hope to complete it by end-2010. The PRSP is placing emphasis on
poverty alleviation in the context of a macroeconomic framework consistent with postconflict challenges, decentralization, an enabling environment for private sector growth, and
capacity and institution building. An important priority will be developing agriculture,
infrastructure, and the financial sector in order to facilitate employment creation and poverty
reduction. However, the success of our poverty reduction efforts will require cooperation and
coordination support from the international donor community.

43
32.
Technical assistance. We have significant technical assistance needs, and value
highly the assistance provided by the Fund. In the area of monetary and financial sector, our
immediate priorities include an FSAP update, and technical assistance on banking
supervision and developing indirect monetary instruments. In the fiscal area, we request
technical assistance in tax administration, including oil revenue management and tax policy.
We also require further assistance in improving our public financial management, including
fiscal reporting and budget processing, and setting up multi-year budget planning. Our
national accounts statistics suffers from serious shortcomings. We require a peripatetic expert
to help us introduce the 1993 System of National Accounts and rebase the data. Finally,
further IMF technical assistance in the South would be very important given the significant
need to build capacity. We would request a diagnostic mission that identifies further needs in
the fiscal, monetary, and banking sectors.
IV. PROGRAM TARGETS AND MONITORING
33.
The proposed quantitative targets up to end-December 2010 are set forth in Table A,
and structural measures are detailed in Table B. We will closely monitor financial and
economic developments in the coming months and will implement any additional measures
that may be needed to safeguard macroeconomic stability in consultation with IMF staff.
34.
To ensure the effective monitoring of the program, the relevant ministries, the Central
Bank of Sudan, and the Central Bureau of Statistics will compile and share with the IMF
staff all economic and financial data necessary, on a timely basis, as specified in the attached
Technical Memorandum of Understanding.

ATTACHMENT III. SUDAN: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
This memorandum specifies the understanding reached with the Fund staff regarding
quantitative targets, structural benchmarks, and reporting for the 2009–10 staff-monitored
program (SMP).
2.
The SMP relies on six quantitative targets for end-June and an equal number of
quantitative indicative targets for end-December. The targets are (i) ceilings on the change in
net domestic assets of the Central Bank of Sudan (CBoS); (ii) ceilings on the domestic
financing of the fiscal deficit; (iii) floors for the buildup of net international reserves of the
central bank; (iv) ceilings on new nonconcessional external loans contracted or guaranteed
by the government or the central bank; (v) floors for payments to the Fund; and (vi) change
in domestic arrears. Broad money, reserve money, and total government revenues from crude
oil exports will be monitored as memorandum items. Some of these targets are subject to
adjustors depending on the financial position of the government of South Sudan, total
government oil revenue performance, and the transfers from the central government to
subnational governments. The definitions of these variables and the adjustors are set out
below. All the quantitative targets and structural benchmarks are displayed in Tables A and
B of this attachment.
3.
Net domestic assets (NDA) of the CBoS are defined as the sum of the Net Domestic
Credit of the CBoS, the net issue of money market instruments and other items net. Net
Domestic Credit is defined as net credit to the central government (i.e. Government
Musharaka Certificates (GMCs), Government Investment Certificates (GICs), and any other
form of central bank credit to the central government minus total central government
deposits) plus net central bank claims on state and local governments, central bank claims on
public enterprises, and claims on banks, and minus Central Bank Ijara Certificates (CICs).
The definition of the central government comprises all accounts of line ministries and
agencies controlled by the government (corresponding to Group no. 11, Group no. 12, and
some accounts of the Group no. 19 in the CBoS general ledger), the Zakat funds (recorded
under Group no. 13), and margin deposits placed with the CBoS by the central government
against letters of credit issued by the CBoS. The definition includes all oil-related accounts
controlled by the government (e.g., OSA). To evaluate program targets, the guinea
equivalent values of foreign exchange denominated items in the balance sheet of the central
bank will be calculated at the program exchange rate (1US$=2.4 guinea).
4.
Net international reserves (NIR) are total gross non-earmarked official foreign
reserve assets on active accounts plus reserve assets of the government of Southern Sudan in
the central bank minus official short-term liabilities (i.e. no more than one-year maturity).
The assets are maintained on accounts with overseas correspondent banks and foreign
exchange banknotes in the vaults of the central bank. Short-term liabilities comprised of the
following items: (i) short-term liabilities, as noted in the balance sheet of the CBoS; (ii) IMF

48

deposit accounts; (iii) nonresident deposits; and (iv) (overdrawn) foreign correspondents
accounts net of dormant accounts.
5.
Domestic financing of the fiscal deficit is defined as total net domestic borrowing
by the central government, including net borrowing from the banking system (including
GMCs and GICs), net sales of GMCs and GICs outside the banking system, promissory
notes (i.e., standing orders, letters of guarantee, sanadats, etc.), revenues from privatization
(net of new acquisition of shares), net buildup of domestic government arrears, and
drawdown in government cash deposits at the CBoS (including OSA). The definition of
central government for the purpose of this criterion is the same as the one applied for the
NDA of the central bank.
6.
Limits on contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional external debt apply to
all forms of debt of more than one-year maturity contracted or guaranteed by the government
or the CBoS. The limit applies not only to debt as defined in point no. 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision no. 12274-(00/85),
August 24, 2000), but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not
been received. The degree of concessionality of debt will be calculated as specified in the
Guidelines.1
7.
Broad money is defined as the sum of local currency circulating outside of the
banks, banks’ demand, and time and savings deposits. It also includes transferable deposits
and margin deposits against letters of credit placed by state and local governments,
nonfinancial public enterprises, and the nonbank private sector with the CBoS. Reserve
money is defined as the sum of local currency circulating outside of the banks, total reserves
(required and excess) for banks, and deposits at the CBoS included in broad money.
8.
Adjustor on the financial position of the government of South Sudan (capped).
The program target for changes in the NDA of the central bank will be reduced (increased)
and the international reserve target will be increased (reduced) by the amount of any decline
(increase) in net central bank claims on the government of South Sudan. The NIR target will
also be increased by the amount of the new SDR allocation. The adjustor will not apply if the
stock of net claims on the government of South Sudan turns positive.

1

For program purposes, a loan is considered concessional if the grant element is at least 35 percent calculated
using a discount factor based on the Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs) published by the OECD
plus margins depending on the loan maturity. The margins are 0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than
15 years, 1 percent for 15–19 years, 1.15 percent for 20–29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more. The
average of the CIRRs over the last ten years will be used for loans with a maturity of at least 15 years and the
average of the CIRRs for the preceding six months will be used for shorter maturities.

49

9.
Oil revenue adjustor. The gross programmed government oil revenue is based on
the program’s assumptions about crude oil prices (f.o.b. Port Sudan) and volumes
(government share). Accrued revenue is the cumulative government oil revenue inflows
based on actual shipments (including deliveries to refineries) at current international prices
(f.o.b. Port Sudan).2 The local currency equivalent of the dollar difference between the
programmed and accrued oil revenues, needed to calculate the adjuster, will be obtained by
multiplying the dollar difference by the average of the monthly exchange rates prevailing
during the period in question. The government oil revenues are programmed at
SDG 6,992 million and SDG 13,984 million, respectively for June and December 2010.3
The oil revenue adjustor will work as follows:


If the accrued government revenue exceeds the programmed amount (because of
price and/or volume increases), then:
the program targets for domestic financing of the budget deficit and NDA will
be reduced, by one half of the local currency equivalent difference between the
accrued and the programmed amounts, and the international reserves target will be
increased by one half the local currency equivalent excess of accrued export oil
revenues over the corresponding programmed level unless the difference is used for
capital expenditures and/or peace related spending in which case the program targets
remain unchanged.



If the accrued government revenue falls short of the programmed amount (because of
price and/or volume decreases), then:
the program targets for domestic financing of the budget deficit and NDA will
be increased, by one half of the local currency equivalent difference between the
programmed and accrued amounts, and the international reserves target will be
reduced by one half the local currency equivalent shortfall of the actual amounts
accrued from the programmed export oil revenues.

10.
Data Reporting. The following table contains the agreed reporting framework. To
the extent possible, the data will be submitted in both printed and electronic form to the IMF
local office.

As compiled monthly by the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFNE).

Exchange Rate Arrangements

The legal tender is the Sudanese guinea, which replaced the Sudanese dinar in proportion
SDG 1=SDD 100 in mid-2007. After the completion of a currency conversion to the new
Sudanese guinea the Bank of Sudan (BOS) has allowed greater exchange rate flexibility than in
2006 and early 2007, suggesting a return to a floating exchange rate arrangement. The exchange
rate system was free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions2 until the BOS introduced an exchange restriction and multiple currency
practice by imposing a floor on cash margins for letters of credit and import credit in 2009. These
restrictions were approved by the Board to end-June 2010.
VIII.

Article IV Consultation

Sudan is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation discussion was
concluded by the Executive Board on November 26, 2008.
IX.

FSAP Participation

The FSAP work took place during October 9–14, 2004 and was completed during
December 1–14, 2004. The Financial System Stability Assessment report was discussed by the
Executive Board on April 29, 2005.

Resident Representative

The Fund’s resident representative office in Khartoum was opened in October 2005, as a
shared post with Djibouti. It was converted to a full post in September 2006.
XI.

Technical Assistance

In January 1995, the Executive Board decided to resume Fund technical assistance to Sudan.
The following table contains a summary of the technical assistance provided since 2004. This
assistance has been provided both from headquarters and from the IMF’s Middle East
Technical Assistance Center (METAC).

2

In November 2005, the authorities removed two remaining exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval
under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. At that time, they lifted the
exchange restriction that prohibited importers in arrears with valid import licenses from executing payments and
transfers for import transactions and eliminated the multiple currency practice arising from the use of a historic
buying rate for the resale of export proceeds.

ANNEX II. SUDAN: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK1
(As of April 30, 2010)
The World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) has no active lending
portfolio in Sudan because of the country’s default on its financial obligations to IDA, which
led to the suspension of disbursements in April 1993. After discussions between the World
Bank and the Sudanese authorities on the need for Sudan to take steps toward normalizing its
relations and establishing a track record with the World Bank, the authorities have been
making small, intermittent debt service payments since mid-1999. The amount of payments
has not been sufficient to prevent a continued accumulation of arrears, which currently stand
at about US$ 580 million and are growing.
The World Bank was a major player in the reconstruction of Sudan following the Addis
Ababa peace agreement of 1972, but was mostly absent from Sudan between 1993 and 2002.
As the prospects for peace with the South rose in 2003, the World Bank formulated a strategy
for a potential reengagement. Following the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement
(CPA) on January 9, 2005 by the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation
Movement, the World Bank became the administrator for two large Multi-Donor Trust Funds
(MDTFs) that support the CPA, and built up its program of non-lending support. Fifteen
MDTF partners2 have contributed US$ 790 million in paid-in funds to the MDTFs. MDTFsupported projects initially experienced implementation challenges, as have all development
and recovery programs in Sudan, but performance has steadily improved. Significant results
are being seen on the ground, including the successful MDTF-supported launch of the CPAmandated new national currency and the completion of the 5th Population Census, though
daunting challenges remain—most notably low capacity, especially at the state level and in
the South.
The World Bank’s Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Sudan was discussed by the World
Bank’s Board in April 2008. The ISN aims to support the Government of National Unity and
the Government of Southern Sudan to sustain peace and reduce conflict by meeting the
commitments contained in the CPA, Darfur Peace Agreement, and the Eastern Sudan Peace
Agreement—particularly in war-affected and marginalized areas and in the fields of
governance, basic services, and pro-poor economic growth. The ISN aims to help Sudan
take important steps toward the achievement of the longer-term strategic vision enshrined in
the CPA: promoting peace in Sudan by making it attractive through development, shared
prosperity, and a reformed system of governance which serves all Sudanese.

Prepared by World Bank staff. For additional information, contact Mr. Greg Toulmin, Country Program
Coordinator for Sudan, Tel. (202) 458-1747.
2

Partners having paid in funds to the MDTFs are: Netherlands, Norway, United Kingdom, European
Commission, Canada, Sweden, Germany, Finland, Spain, Denmark, Italy, Egypt, Iceland, Greece, and the
World Bank. The World Bank contributed (from IBRD surplus) US$5 million to each of the MDTFs.

6
The entry points for World Bank support—through management of the MDTFs and nonlending activities—vary according to the diverse conditions facing different regions of
Sudan. At the National level, a focus on stabilizing peace entails a major role for analytical
work and policy dialogue on implementing key provisions of the CPA (pro-poor growth,
good governance and decentralization, empowerment), and—in the Three Areas and the
East—on pro-peace development projects and building capacity for community-driven
development and local service delivery. In Darfur, the World Bank works with partners, as
security allows, to assess development and recovery needs and to make ready rehabilitation
and development programs to be implemented in the event of peace. In the South, the main
focus is on helping to build a competent, responsive and stable government based on good
governance, rule of law, and transparency, while promoting efforts to empower and
decentralize service delivery to the states, counties, and communities. Another key objective
is to help Southern Sudan develop a long-term strategy to transform itself into a wellintegrated, self-reliant, and viable economic unit that begins to harness its vast and rich
natural resources for the welfare of its people. The substantial financial support through the
MDTFs and the World Bank’s analytical and advisory services will be mobilized to meet
these objectives.
With national elections recently completed, the focus of CPA implementation is now on
preparations for the referendum in Southern Sudan due in early 2011.
IDA’s financial reengagement requires clearance of Sudan’s outstanding arrears. The
clearance of these arrears can only be undertaken once a firm and comprehensive agreement
among preferred creditors is in place. Such an agreement would also include significant
reductions in bilateral debts, so as to make the total debt service obligations sustainable.
Following the eventual clearance of IDA arrears, an exceptional IDA allocation for Sudan as
a post-conflict country would be sought, and the World Bank would prepare another strategy
document which would include, inter alia, a pipeline of projects.
The World Bank has completed a series of major non-lending products since the CPA,
including a Public Expenditure Review, Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (on behalf of its
Integrated Framework partners) and most recently a Country Economic Memorandum on
sustainable and broad-based growth. Major non-lending products planned to be completed
and delivered by the end of calendar 2010 include an Investment Climate Assessment
focusing on the needs of small firms, an Environment and Natural Resources study, a
Country Integrated Fiduciary Assessment, and for Southern Sudan studies on strengthening
good governance and on States’ own revenue potential.
To enrich this menu of policy and analytical support, the World Bank will seek to deepen
dialogue—and open up space for civil society participation in such dialogue—in areas such
as: developing a Darfur reconstruction and development strategy; making decentralization
work; transforming Southern Sudan into an integrated and viable economic unit; and local
area development. The World Bank’s Financial Market Integrity Unit will continue its
technical support to build capacity to combat money laundering through a proposed multiphase program.

ANNEX III. SUDAN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. There are
many areas where further improvements are needed, particularly in compiling national
accounts, state budgetary data, and external trade and financial statistics. This appendix
discusses outstanding statistical issues by sector.
As one of 22 countries participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) Project for Anglophone African Countries, Sudan has undertaken to use the GDDS
as a framework for the development of its national statistical system. Sudan is participating
in the monetary and financial statistics, and the GDDS/PRSP modules of the Anglophone
Africa project (funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID)). This
project aims to assist participating countries to implement plans for improvement identified
in the metadata and to meet GDDS recommended statistical practices. Sudan’s metadata
were posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on August 19, 2003 and partially
updated in December 2005.
I. REAL SECTOR
Practices in the production of the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) are good. Monthly
CPI data are provided shortly after the end of each month. The Central Bureau of Statistics
(CBS) has conduct new household income and expenditure survey and have constructed the
new CPI index based on the survey.
The compilation of the national accounts is subject to delay. The national accounts statistics
suffer from a lack of basic information for many sectors, including oil, livestock,
horticulture, and most services. On the expenditure side, data are lacking on final
consumption by households, investment, and changes in stocks. There are no national
accounts or industrial production data at sub annual frequencies. Furthermore, the annual
data are being reported with a lag of over three years. There is an urgent need to increase
funding to the CBS and rebuild its capacity. Priorities include introducing the 1993 System of
National Accounts, conducting a census of agricultural production, producing poverty on the
basis of household survey, and improving coordination between the CBS, the Ministry of
Finance and National Economy (MOFNE), the Ministry of Energy and Mining, and the
Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock.
II. FISCAL SECTOR
1.
Government finance statistics reported to MCD are broadly adequate for program
monitoring, with the main revenue, expenditure, and financing items reported on a monthly
basis with a lag of about one month. The reported statistics are for the central government
only, and do not include the states and publicly owned corporations. Data are submitted using
an economic classification and, while the allocation of resources by MOFNE to the various
ministries is reported, their actual expenditures are not. In 2008, good progress has been
made in improving accounting and reporting procedures at the MOFNE, introducing the GFS
classifications according to guidelines provided in Government Finance Statistics

8
Manual 2001, and implementing the technical assistance recommendations on GFS. Data
reported for the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook are weak and cover only budgetary
central government up to 1999. No monthly and quarterly fiscal data are reported for the
International Financial Statistics (IFS).
III. MONETARY SECTOR
2.
Sudan has received significant technical assistance to improve the collection,
compilation, and dissemination of monetary and financial statistics. The most recent STA
monetary and financial statistics mission took place in July 2007. It conducted a training
course in monetary statistics methodology and assisted the Bank of Sudan (BOS) in
implementing the ongoing action plan, including the development of data reporting to STA in
the format of the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) and of a framework for incorporating
data from South Sudan in the monetary statistics. The weekly flash report on the activities of
BOS is consistent with relevant components in the depository corporations survey as
recommended in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
3.
In general, the monetary statistics compiled by BOS are broadly adequate for
monitoring purposes. However, BOS should complete the harmonization of accounting codes
and network connections as this would further improve the data collection and compilation.
Also, it should work with MOFNE to review and reconcile government accounts held with
the banking system to ensure their appropriate classification in the monetary statistics, and
continue the work on implementing the framework for incorporating South Sudan’s banking
activities into the monetary statistics.
IV. EXTERNAL SECTOR
4.
Daily exchange rate data are posted on the central bank of Sudan’s web page with
minimal lags. There are several areas for improvement in the external accounts, particularly
with regard to foreign direct investment, remittances, trade, and oil statistics. The BOS’s
foreign exchange balances include reserves earmarked for particular purposes such as
medicine, oil, and spare part imports, but the composition of these reserves and their
potential usability in the event of a balance of payment need is not clear. There is a need for
clarification on items that qualify as international reserves in general, and those earmarked
reserves in particular, and compilation of the data template on international reserves and
foreign currency liquidity should be initiated.
5.
Regarding import statistics, there are significant discrepancies between the reports
from customs and the BOS. The July 2003 STA mission identified some possible causes and,
in collaboration with the authorities, attempted to reconcile the data. Following up on the
2005 METAC mission, in 2006 METAC provided technical assistance for improving the
quality of international investment position (IIP) data. The authorities now report partial IIP
data for 2003-2006 to STA for publication. However, the lack of survey data continues to
affect the compilation of important balance of payments and IIP items such as foreign direct
investment.

9
6.
Medium-term oil production projections and data on amortization of private sector
debt need substantial improvement. The authorities have made some progress in improving
oil projections, but appear reluctant to provide more detailed information on the phasing-in
and expected production levels of new blocks and on amortization of debt in the oil sector.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION AND
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
SUDAN
Joint World Bank/IMF 2009 Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Development Association and
the International Monetary Fund
Approved by Sudarshan Gooptu and Sudhir Shetty (World Bank)
and Alan MacArthur and Dominique Desruelle (IMF)
June 7, 2010
The Joint IMF-World Bank low-income country debt sustainability analysis (DSA) confirms
last year’s assessment that Sudan continues to be in debt distress, and that there is limited
possibility of significant improvement over the medium and long term. Under the baseline
scenario, all debt ratios, except for external debt service, remain above their indicative
thresholds due largely to the country’s massive arrears and despite reasonably prudent
macroeconomic policies over the projection period. It will be critical for Sudan to continue
to follow sound policies consistent with a prudent borrowing strategy.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Sudan’s DSA is prepared under the joint Bank-Fund Low-Income Country
(LIC) Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF).1 The framework follows a methodology for
assessing the risk of debt distress in LICs, based on projections of five debt burden indicators
(under both baseline and standardized stress-test scenarios), namely the present value (PV) of
external debt-to-GDP ratio; the PV of external debt-to-exports ratio; the PV of external debtto-revenue ratio; debt service-to-exports ratio; and debt service-to- revenue ratio. Empirical
evidence suggests low-income countries with a better quality of policies and institutions can
sustain a higher level of external debt. The LIC DSA framework, therefore, compares

II. STRUCTURE OF TOTAL EXTERNAL DEBT
2.
Sudan’s large total external debt is mostly in arrears, its structure has remained
unchanged since 2000, and there has been an improvement in containing nonconcessional borrowing in 2009.2 Based on available data, the end-2009 stock of total
public and publicly-guaranteed debt is estimated at US$35.7 billion in nominal terms, of
which US$29 billion is in arrears. About 69 percent of the external debt is owed to official
bilateral creditors, which is almost equally divided between Paris Club and non-Paris Club
creditors. Of the remainder, multilateral institutions accounted for about 15 percent, while the
debt owed to commercial banks and suppliers accounted for some 16 percent (Text tables 1
and 2).

Sudan contracted US$906 million of new loans in 2008. Of this amount,
US$232 million (about 25 percent) were non-concessional loans, well below the
US$700 million ceiling under the Fund’s staff-monitored program. About 83 percent of new
borrowings are for development in the agriculture sector, while about 6 percent and
11 percent were directed to services and financial sectors, respectively.
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
4.
The 2009 DSA is based on conservative assumptions for key macroeconomic
variables, in line with the recent global economic crisis, and a lower discount rate
compared to the 2008 DSA. Average real GDP growth was revised downward from an
annual rate of 8 percent to about 5.5 percent over the period 2010–30 (Box 1). The overall
fiscal deficit is higher on account of lower oil prices and anticipated decline in oil production
(Box 2). In addition, current DSF guidelines require a lower discount rate throughout the
analysis compared to the 2008 DSA, from 5 percent to 4 percent, due to the recent decline in
global interest rates. The outcome for the main debt ratios (discussed below) continues to
show a sustained breach of the thresholds, albeit with slight improvement compared to
the 2008 DSA on account of a lower discount rate.

2

In 2009 Sudan non-concessional debt was around US$693 million, which is below the IMF Staff Monitored
Program (SMP) ceiling of US$700 million.

3
A. Baseline Scenario
5.
The baseline scenario (Table 1) shows that Sudan is still in debt distress, due
largely to the country’s massive arrears. The results indicate that three debt-burden indicators
are expected to exceed their policy-dependent thresholds in the period 2010–20. In particular,


The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline from 56 percent in 2010 to
around 33 percent in 2020 (indicative threshold: 30 percent).



The PV of debt-to-exports stands at 323 percent in 2010, and is expected to slightly
improve over the medium term, but subsequently increase after 2013, mainly due to
anticipated decline in oil production, and to reach 535 percent in 2020 (indicative
threshold: 100 percent).



The PV of debt-to-revenue, which is estimated to 323 percent in 2010, is projected to
reach 272 percent in 2020 (indicative threshold: 200 percent).

The two debt service indicators (debt service-to-exports ratio and debt service-to-revenue
ratio) are expected to remain below their policy-dependent thresholds throughout the forecast
period 2010–30. However, these ratios should be interpreted with caution since the baseline
scenario assumes Sudan debt servicing performance to remain unchanged. That is, Sudan
does not fully repay its debt obligations, and to fully repay only new obligations falling due
for some selected creditors, and partially repay arrears accrued after 2007.

4
Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions 2010–30
The macroeconomic assumptions are on the conservative side, reflecting the recent
downturn of the global economy and revised oil production projections provided by the
authorities.
Real sector: Real GDP is assumed to grow at an annual average rate of about
5.6 percent during 2010–30. The real growth during the 2010–15 is largely based on
the projected increase in oil production which is expected to peak in 2012 and to
subsequently decrease gradually. It is assumed that the drop in oil output will be offset
by robust growth in non-oil GDP. During 2016–30, non-oil growth is projected to
average about 6.1 percent, benefiting from structural reforms in the fiscal and financial
sectors as well as development of infrastructure. Annual inflation is assumed to decline
from 10 percent in 2010 to around 4 percent. Over the period 2010-2030, inflation
averages 5 percent.
External sector: The current account deficit (on a cash basis) is projected to be around
5 percent of GDP on average throughout the projection period, with a slight
improvement over the long term. The improvement is on account of the projected
increase in non-oil exports. The external trade account is expected to deteriorate
gradually, reflecting a steady decrease in oil production, while non-oil exports will
show steady growth, reflecting a rise in productivity especially in agriculture. Foreign
exchange reserve coverage is projected to rise to 2.0 months of imports by 2015.
Fiscal sector: The fiscal deficit (on a cash basis) is projected to average about
4.3 percent of GDP during 2010–15, reflecting a combination of factors: (i) repayment
of the entire stock of domestic arrears; (ii) continuation of current spending shares on
transfers to states; (iii) moderate improvements in tax revenue collection; (iv) a slight
decline in oil revenues; and (v) rising capital expenditure outlays. Over the long term
(2016-30), the fiscal deficit is expected to average some 3.1 percent of GDP, reflecting
a consolidation of expenditures and a gradual increase in tax revenues to around
10 percent of GDP by 2030.
External financing: Foreign direct investment (FDI) is projected to remain stable,
averaging about 4 percent of GDP over the projected period. After the peak in oilrelated investment, FDI is expected to shift to agriculture and service sectors. Demand
for foreign financing is assumed to decrease as domestic savings will increase in the
future in context of a deepening of the financial sector.
Debt: It is assumed that repayments on outstanding debt will continue to a few selected
creditors giving new loans, arrears on other outstanding obligations will accumulate,
and debt service obligations arising from new borrowing will be paid. Disbursements
of new loans are projected at about 1.5 percent of GDP during 2010–15, and
2.0 percent during 2016–30. The share of concessional loans is assumed at 60 percent
in 2010—in line with the actual loans contracted in 2008—and subsequently declines
gradually to about 50 percent by 2030.

5

Box 2. Oil Sector Assumptions
The oil sector continues to dominate the Sudanese economy, accounting for a majority
of GDP when including associated service sector activity, about 90 percent of exports
and about 50–60 percent of government revenue. The DSA assumptions for the
sector’s future are driven by a production outlook informed by discussions with the
Sudanese authorities and operators in the country as well as price projections calculated
by the IMF and the World Bank.
Production: The Ministry of Energy and Mining expects a slight increase of
0.5 percent in production in 2010 to around 476 thousand barrels per day (bpd), due to
waning mature fields (higher quality Nile blend) and other technical production
problems. Peak production is expected in 2012 near 547 thousand bpd, before a gradual
descent to about 151 thousand bpd by 2030.
Prices: Forecasting international oil prices involves a high level of uncertainty. The
DSA is guided by the IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook figures for the medium
term and the World Bank’s Commodity Market Review for the longer term. Overall,
prices are expected to remain stable and average around US$71 per barrel for Sudanese
crude over the medium term before settling to around US$54 per barrel in the longer
term.
B. Standardized Sensitivity Analysis
6.
Alternative scenarios are carried out to assess the robustness of the baseline
scenario to various shocks. The results of these scenarios for the key debt-burden indicators
are presented in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 1.


The alternative scenario comprises two tests: (A1) a historical scenario in which
main variables that determine debt dynamics (namely, real GDP growth; inflation,
measured by changes in the U.S. dollar GDP deflator; the non-interest external
current account in percent of GDP; and non-debt-creating flows in percent of GDP)
are assumed to remain at their 10-year historical averages. The second alternative
scenario (A2) is a financing scenario in which new borrowing is assumed to be on
less favorable terms (a 2 percentage points higher interest rate) throughout the
projection period.



The bound tests (B1 through B6) apply two-period/one standard deviation negative
shocks to the key macroeconomic variables (i) the above-mentioned parameters plus
(ii) export growth, (iii) a combined one-half deviation shock, and (iv) a one-time
30 percent depreciation of the Sudanese pound against US dollar.

6
7.
Similar to last year’s DSA exercise, the scenario of holding the key debtdynamics parameters constant over the long term at their historical averages (scenario
A1) produces some improvements in both debt and debt service indicators relative to
the baseline. Moreover, one debt indicator (PV of debt-to-GDP) is projected to be lower than
the indicative thresholds by 2030. Favorable historical performance of nominal GDP and
export growth, due to increasing oil production and a spike in oil prices explains this
improvement relative to the baseline scenario. The latter assumes a decline in oil production
and oil prices after its peak in 2012 and 2013, respectively. With regard to the unfavorable
borrowing condition scenario, a 2 percentage points higher interest rate somewhat flattens the
downward path of debt and debt service ratios in all indicators over the projection period
(scenario A2).
8.
The results of bound tests are very similar to those of the 2008 DSA, namely that
the debt situation remains precarious. For instance,


A one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation relative to the baseline in 2010 (B6)
proved to be the worst scenario for two of the three debt indicators (the PV of debt-toGDP ratio and the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio). The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio is the
highest for this test. Starting at 56 percent in 2010, it declines to 47 percent in 2020
and 26 percent by 2030, which is 7 percentage points higher than the baseline.
Similarly, the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio is the highest at 323 percent in 2010, it
increases to 381 percent by 2020 and gradually declines to 257 percent in 2030,
which is about 70 percentage points above the baseline.



In the case of debt- and debt service-to-exports ratios, lowering the export value
growth at its historical average minus one standard deviation in 2011–12 (B2) gives
the most challenging outcome as was the case in the 2008 DSA. The PV of debt-toexports ratio rises to 469 percent in 2011 from 323 percent in 2010, reaching
1175 percent in 2020, before falling to 679 percent in 2030, which is about double the
baseline value. Similarly, the debt service-to-exports ratio climbs to around
40 percent in 2020, before falling to 26 percent in 2030. This outcome is mainly due
to the projected decline in oil production starting in 2012.
C. Customized Sensitivity Analysis

9.
Oil is a critical factor in assessing Sudan’s debt sustainability. To analyze the debt
dynamics under less favorable oil revenues, an additional stress test is performed using
a 20 percent shock to the baseline oil price projections. Under this customized scenario,
Sudan’s external debt indicators worsen significantly, especially with respect to exports (see
panel charts below). Considering the volatility in global oil prices, the oil price shock
highlights Sudan’s high vulnerability to exogenous shocks.

IV. TOTAL PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
10.
The results of the total public debt sustainability analysis mirror the ones under
the external debt sustainability analysis.3 Under the baseline scenario (Table 3), debt stock
and debt service indicators show similar patterns as those of external debt. The PV of public
sector debt-to-GDP starts at a relatively high level in 2010 (71 percent of GDP), it then
declines over the medium term to reach about 60 percent in 2015, due to high real GDP
growth and a reduction in the fiscal deficit envisaged for 2010–15. The debt service-torevenue ratio is projected to fluctuate within the range of 12–14 percent for the whole period.
11.
The alternative scenarios confirm that Sudan’s public debt sustainability
depends on Sudan’s commitment to improve fiscal soundness and growth potential,
particularly in the non-oil economy.


3

Under the bound tests, a one-time 30 percent real depreciation in 2010 (B4) produces
the worst scenario for two of the debt indicators. The PV of debt-to-GDP and the PV
of debt-to-revenue would be 56 and 436 percent in 2020. The debt service-to-revenue
ratio would increase to 17 percent in the same year for the same bound test.

The 2010 level of the public debt stock indicators (PV of debt-to-GDP and PV of debt-to-revenue) is
substantially higher than those reported last year. This upward jump reflects adverse developments in both
external debt—the buildup in external arrears and the contraction of new external loans; and domestic debt—
and the further accumulation of sizeable domestic arrears in 2008.

8


The no reform scenario, where the primary balance is projected to remain unchanged
from the relatively high 2007-09 levels, highlights the vulnerability of Sudan’s public
debt trajectory to large fiscal imbalances. The PV of debt-to-GDP and debt serviceto-revenue ratios for 2020 would be 48 and 13 percents, respectively, about 3 and
2 percentage points higher than the baseline.
V. CONCLUSIONS

12.
The third DSA for Sudan provides further evidence that, despite its considerable
economic progress since 2000, Sudan remains in debt distress. The vulnerabilities
highlighted in the DSA need to be effectively addressed in the coming period through
proactive public debt and financial management policies, including increased reliance on
concessional borrowing to finance necessary development expenditures.
13.
Sudan should reconsider its external borrowing strategy in light of the future
debt service burden that would follow if it took on high volumes of non-concessional
debt. Further recourse to such borrowing could also jeopardize Sudan’s access to possible
debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and the MDRI. The authorities believe that
debt relief under these two initiatives will play a crucial part in helping Sudan assume a path
to achieving sustainable development goals.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 29, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation
with Sudan
On June 23, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Sudan.1
Background
Economic growth weakened in 2009, in line with the global recession. Overall real gross
domestic product (GDP) growth is estimated to have decelerated to 4.5 percent compared
to nearly 7 percent in 2008, with the non-oil GDP growth dropping by half to about
5 percent. The deterioration in growth was broad-based, with the exception of a small
increase in oil production. Average inflation fell to about 11 percent, from over 14 percent
in 2008.
The underlying fiscal performance improved in 2009. The overall non-oil commitment deficit
narrowed from 8.7 percent of GDP in 2008 to 7.7 percent in 2009. Tax revenues improved
significantly as expected, reflecting stronger revenue collection efforts by the tax and
customs administration. However, non-oil non-tax revenue remained constant in relation to

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
GDP due to weaker than expected parastatal profits. Most expenditures (with the notable
exception of transfers and fuel subsidies) were contained.
Monetary policy was expansionary in 2009. Reserve and broad money increased by
28 percent and 23.5 percent, respectively, in 2009. These were to ensure sufficient credit to
the private sector to partially offset the impact of the liquidity shortage created by the global
financial crisis. However, despite the increased credit from the central bank to commercial
banks for onward lending, credit to the private sector increased by about 20 percent (slightly
higher than nominal GDP growth).
The balance of payments position deteriorated in 2009 due to the global crisis. The current
account deficit reached 11.5 percent of GDP as the decline in imports (by about 6 percent)
and the rebound in oil prices in the second half of 2009 were not sufficient to compensate
for the fall in oil receipts. In addition, weaker than expected remittances and foreign direct
investment kept the foreign exchange position under pressure. The guinea depreciated by
13 percent against the U.S. dollar through August but subsequently appreciated as the
central bank increased the sale of foreign exchange to the market. As a result, the overall
depreciation of the guinea against the U.S. dollar in 2009 was about 3 percent. The central
bank’s net international reserves (NIR) remained low.
Important structural reforms were completed in 2009, though some with delay. In the fiscal
area, several measures were implemented to improve tax compliance and strengthen fiscal
management and administration. These included modernization of the taxation chamber,
centralization of taxpayer identification numbers, and the extension of the Government
Finance Statistics (GFS) 2001 budget classification to 5 Northern states. However, the
comprehensive review of the tax policy regime is expected to be completed by July 2010.
The delay in completing the review was due to the reorganization of the Ministry of Finance
and National Economy (MoFNE). A restructuring plan for Omdurman National Bank was
prepared in February 2010, in line with the recommendations of an independent audit
report.
Executive Board Assessment
They welcomed Sudan’s progress on key structural reforms under the staff-monitored
program (SMP), while noting that macroeconomic performance has been affected by the
global crisis. Going forward, Sudan will continue to face large and complex challenges in
view of the slow recovery from the global crisis, the projected decline in oil receipts over the
medium term, and the large development needs. Directors urged the authorities to maintain
prudent macroeconomic policies and to accelerate fiscal, financial sector, and structural
reforms.

3
Directors stressed the importance of fiscal prudence, and commended the steps taken to
reduce tax exemptions and improve tax administration. They called for further efforts to rein
in the non-oil primary fiscal deficit and widen the tax base. Directors looked forward to the
completion of the comprehensive review of the tax regime, which should lead to further
reductions in value added tax (VAT) and income tax exemptions, and the resolution of tax
jurisdiction issues with sub-national governments. They underlined the importance of
introducing a targeted safety net and gradually phasing out fuel subsidies. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ intention to adopt a medium-term budget framework using non-oil
indicators.
Directors supported the authorities’ recent steps to tighten the monetary stance, which will
help reduce pressures on inflation and the exchange rate. They noted the staff’s
assessment that the real exchange rate appears to be near its equilibrium level. Directors
emphasized the need to accelerate structural reforms to enhance competitiveness. They
commended the recent increase in exchange rate flexibility, which is essential to help
rebuild foreign exchange reserves and mitigate the impact of external shocks.
Directors noted that sustained economic growth requires a strengthening of the financial
sector. They welcomed the authorities’ renewed emphasis on enforcement of prudential
regulations, reducing nonperforming loans, and increasing provisioning and capital. They
called for full implementation of the measures in the restructuring plan for Omdurman Bank
and preparation for its eventual privatization. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to
implement structural reforms aimed at diversifying the sources of growth, especially in the
agricultural sector.
Directors noted that the SMP meets the standard of upper credit tranche conditionality,
except for the allowed level of non-concessional borrowing. They generally welcomed
Sudan’s record of cooperation on economic policies, and strongly encouraged the
authorities to significantly increase their arrears payments to the Fund as the country’s
payment capacity improves. A few Directors reiterated their call to allocate payments to
charges falling due rather than to principal in arrears. A number of Directors felt that
Sudan’s broadly satisfactory performance under the successive SMPs should be reflected
in a clear and timely path for normalization of Sudan’s relations with the Fund and debt
relief. At the same time, Directors acknowledged that resolving Sudan’s debt and arrears
problems would require broad support from the international community. Directors took
positive note of the authorities’ request for a stocktaking of Sudan’s progress under
successive SMPs over the past 13 years.
While recognizing Sudan’s reconstruction and development needs, Directors urged the
authorities to minimize nonconcessional borrowing in view of Sudan’s unsustainable
external debt burden. This would also give a strong signal of Sudan’s cooperative effort and
avoid complications in the event of any future debt-relief operation.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Sudan
June 23, 2010
1.
The following information has become available since the staff report (www.imf.org)
was prepared. It does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
A new government was formed on June 14, 2010. Mr. Ali Mahmood Abdul-Rasool
was appointed Minister of Finance and National Economy, while the ex-Finance Minister,
Mr. Awad Ahmed Al-Jaz, became Minister of Industry. The new Minister of Finance has
reconfirmed Sudan’s commitment to the staff-monitored program and to continued
cooperation with the Fund.
3.
Inflation was in the 14–15 percent range in the first five months of 2010, mainly due
to an increase in food and beverages prices, which constitute more than 50 percent of the CPI
basket. This was mostly supply driven. By end-May, net international reserves have
increased by about $30 million, compared to the most recent figure available during the
mission (end-February). The central bank has announced measures to tighten monetary
policy by increasing reserve requirement from 8 percent to 11 percent (effective
July 1, 2010) and withdrawing central bank deposits with commercial banks. Also, the
authorities have allowed more flexibility in the exchange rate which has depreciated by
3.8 percent since end-March 2010.
4.
The authorities have confirmed that fiscal structural measures for end-June 2010
(review of tax exemptions granted under Investment Encouragement Act and introduction of
customs ASYCUDA software) are expected to be implemented. The review of the tax policy
regime (structural measure for end-July 2010) is underway and is also expected to be
completed as scheduled.

Statement by Mr. Itam, Executive Director for Sudan
June 23, 2010
We thank staff for their well balanced reports and their candid dialogue with the authorities.
We would also like to convey the authorities’ appreciation to Management and Executive
Directors for their constructive dialogue and supportive engagement over the years,
particularly on the important issue of normalization of relations with the Fund. My Sudanese
authorities broadly agree with the staff’s assessment of economic performance, prospects and
challenges going forward, and consent to the publication of the reports.
Sudan has posted impressive economic performance, despite the difficult global economic
environment and complex internal challenges. Spillovers from the global economic crisis
impacted the economy particularly through reduced oil and other export earnings,
remittances, and FDI. Nevertheless, my authorities’ prudent macroeconomic policies and
expeditious responses to the crisis have allowed them to maintain a reasonably high level of
economic growth and macroeconomic stability, while continuing to tackle the numerous
challenges of implementing the peace agreements. Program developments have been broadly
positive and most of the quantitative targets under the SMP were met. However, the need to
mitigate the negative impacts of the external crisis on the economy and society has
moderated the authorities’ achievements in the fiscal area and contributed to a low level of
foreign exchange reserves.
Challenges
Sudan is at a crucial juncture. Having carried out presidential, gubernatorial, legislative and
local elections in April 2010, a referendum to determine the nation’s destiny is slated for
early 2011.The country faces enormous challenges of building peace while addressing the
demands for post-conflict reconstruction, broad based development and poverty reduction.
The high dependency on oil revenues creates additional vulnerability, given its high price
volatility and nonrenewable nature. Consequently, my authorities have placed the
normalization of relations with the Fund and realization of debt relief high on their strategic
agenda, as these are important factors in securing peace and achieving meaningful
development.
Normalization of relations with the Fund and debt relief
My authorities have established an impressive, and arguably the longest, track record of good
performance under thirteen years of SMP. They have assiduously engaged the Fund,
implemented agreed policies and measures under their programs, and made payments
commitments to the Fund. Sudan’s SMPs continue to meet upper- credit- tranche
conditionality and the country has long satisfied the requirements for arrears clearance and
the start of the HIPC process.

2

My authorities have continuously engaged Management and Executive Directors to seek
support for the long overdue process towards debt relief. The authorities reiterate the
importance of debt relief to Sudan’s stability and development. They wish to underline the
development and peace-building challenges facing Sudan and the need to deliver on the debt
relief promises made by the international community to the people of Sudan within the
framework of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. They consider the resolution of the debt
issue as an important element in the implementation of the various peace agreements. They
are concerned that if the issue is not resolved soon it may end up complicating the ongoing
political process in the Sudan.
My authorities, therefore, expect the Fund to take the lead and use its leverage and good
offices to facilitate expeditious arrears clearance. The authorities’ sustained and proactive
engagement with the Fund, their impressive performance record, and their commitment to
reform and development demand that the Fund and the international community avail to
Sudan the necessary support.
Enhancing and broadening economic growth
One of the major challenges facing Sudan is enhancing and broadening growth to address the
overdependence on oil revenues. At present, the value added of the oil sector is only about 10
percent of GDP, compared to 35 percent for agriculture and 50 percent for services.
However, its contribution to the country’s external and fiscal balances has been of critical
importance, accounting for about 95 percent of exports and more than half of government
revenue. The authorities are cognizant of the inherent problems of such dependency,
particularly in view of the expected depletion of the currently known reserves. Consequently
they have been accelerating programs aimed at diversifying the sources of growth, with keen
appreciation of the fact that the non-oil sector, particularly agriculture, is performing below
potential. The authorities are implementing a broad agricultural development program
incorporating irrigated and rain-fed farming, livestock development, and expansion of nontraditional products and exports under the Revitalization of Agriculture Program. The
program hinges on utilization of the opportunities created by the new Merowe dam,
rehabilitation and reclamation of old irrigation infrastructure, and provision of improved
seeds.
The authorities are undertaking broad-ranging reforms to encourage private sector
investment, including FDI and public private partnerships. The business environment is
being improved through a number of reform measures, including streamlining business
registration procedures and establishing a one-stop shop. Fiscal and monetary policies have
been geared to respond to the critical requirements and bottlenecks of diversification. For
example, the fiscal space afforded by higher oil and tax revenues was used to support higherthan-programmed capital expenditure, particularly infrastructure. The central bank is
focusing on increasing financing access to farmers and has already established channels for

3
microfinance to the agricultural sector. Despite these efforts, however, the lingering impact
of the global crisis and the external political perception of the country continue to constrain
the pace of development.
Recent developments and program performance
In the five years up to 2008, the Sudanese economy was one of the fastest growing
economies in SSA, with an average annual growth of 8 percent. However, due to the
spillover effects from the global crisis, real GDP growth rate decelerated to 4.5 percent in
2009. Average inflation on the other hand, declined. Developments in the other key areas
were mixed. The authorities determined effort led to substantial improvements in tax
revenues, in line with the program target. However, higher-than-programmed expenditure, as
well as repayments of domestic arrears, resulted in the overall deficit being higher than
programmed. Nonetheless, the authorities adhered to the limit on non-concessional
borrowing. Monetary policy focused on mitigating the impact of the external shocks on the
economy by, inter alia, ensuring sufficient credit to the private sector to partially offset the
impact of liquidity shortages. The substantial decline in oil prices in the first half of 2009 led
to a widening of the current account deficit and deterioration in the overall balance of
payments position.
Important structural reforms were completed in 2009. Tax compliance and fiscal
management and administration were improved. The comprehensive review of the tax policy
regime is ongoing, and is expected to be completed in July 2010. The Ministry of Finance
and National Economy (MOFNE) was reorganized, benefiting from Fund advice, and
capacity enhancing measures to improve its operations are on track. In the financial sector, a
restructuring plan for Omdurman National Bank was completed, in line with the
recommendations of an independent auditor.
Macroeconomic policies in 2010
The authorities recognize that the challenges to economic and financial management will
remain complex in view of the expected slow recovery in the global economy and ongoing
implementation of the various peace agreements. The preparation for the 2011 referendum
and, hopefully, the implementation of the recent Doha agreement on Darfur may add to the
already high financial obligations. The authorities expect to continue to experience low
foreign exchange earnings from oil exports, foreign direct investment, and remittances. In the
current circumstances, they fully recognize the need to proceed without delay with their
reform efforts. They intend to place emphasis on maintaining macroeconomic stability,
safeguarding and rebuilding foreign exchange reserves, and enhancing economic growth.
In this regard, the fiscal and monetary policies agreed with staff reflect the authorities’
commitment to these objectives. The authorities intend to contain the overall fiscal deficit at

4
4.2 percent of GDP in 2010, with a number of new tax and expenditure measures. These
measures constitute the bulk of the program targets and structural benchmarks incorporated
in the SMP.
The authorities are engaged in a comprehensive effort to build and upgrade public sector
capacity both at the central and state levels. They have identified the gaps and weaknesses in
the relevant public institutional infrastructure and prioritized their technical assistance needs.
They have discussed their priorities with the staff.
In the financial sector, my authorities attach high importance to strengthening the
supervision, improving the regulatory framework, and addressing the problems and
vulnerabilities of the sector. They have developed an action plan to resolve the problems of
the banking sector within a realistic timeframe, benefiting from the FSAP recommendations.
Conclusion
The authorities’ prudent policies have enabled Sudan to weather the ongoing global crisis
and maintain reasonably high economic growth. Sudan continues to make progress in
realizing national political and social objectives but faces difficult and complex challenges.
In this context, and in the thirteenth year of an SMP, the authorities continue to show strong
commitment to strengthening their engagement with the Fund and the international
community. They seek Fund support for arrears clearance and ascending to the path of debt
relief.
