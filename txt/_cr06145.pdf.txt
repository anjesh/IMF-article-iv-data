INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation
with Antigua and Barbuda
Approved by Charles Collyns and Matthew Fisher
December 5, 2005
Economic background. Antigua and Barbuda is a three-island economy in the eastern Caribbean, with a
combined land area of 443 square kilometers, population of about 75,000, and per capita GDP of about
US$10,300. It is one of eight members of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), and accounts for
25 percent of the combined ECCU GDP. The ECCU has a common central bank, the Eastern Caribbean
Central Bank (ECCB), and a common currency, the Eastern Caribbean (EC) dollar. The EC dollar has been
pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. Antigua and Barbuda has
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 (Appendix II).
Political situation. Antigua and Barbuda has a bicameral parliament consisting of 17 appointees in the
Senate and 17 members of the House of Representatives, who are elected by proportional representation to
serve five-year terms. Prime Minister Baldwin Spencer’s United Progressive Party (UPP) won the election
in March 2004, unseating the Antigua and Barbuda Labor Party (ALP), which had been in power
since 1976, prior to independence in 1981. Currently, the UPP has 12 seats, the ALP 4 seats, and the
Barbuda People’s Movement 1 seat in the House.
2004 Article IV consultation. At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation on November 15, 2004,
Executive Directors welcomed the new administration’s resolve to address deep-rooted fiscal imbalances
and its openness in discussing difficult issues. Directors called for a large up-front fiscal adjustment as a key
step in regaining fiscal balance and clearing arrears. Directors supported the authorities’ intention to
reintroduce a personal income tax, and encouraged a reduction of exemptions, and strengthened tax
administration. Directors urged a comprehensive public sector reform to reduce expenditure and to enhance
the efficiency of government service provision. They also stressed the importance of improving the business
climate, particularly by addressing longstanding governance issues. The staff report is available at
www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2004/cr04367.pdf.
2005 Article IV discussions. A staff team comprising D. O. Robinson (Head), J. Chai, P. Khandelwal (all
WHD), D. Kovtun (PDR), H. Morsy (FAD), and E. Graham (IBRD) held discussions in St. John’s during
August 31–September 13, 2005. The mission met with the Cabinet, the Minister of Finance, other senior
government officials, the leader of the Opposition, as well as trade union, private sector, and other civil
society, representatives. ECCB and Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) staff participated in the
discussions. R. Sahay (WHD) and S. Ladd (OED) joined the mission for the final discussions. A joint press
conference was held at the conclusion of the consultation.
Statistical issues. Antigua and Barbuda is a participant in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS). Major improvements in all areas are needed to facilitate effective surveillance (Appendix V).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•
Antigua and Barbuda has the highest per-capita income in the ECCU region, but
has lived with very high public debt, weak institutions, and widespread arrears for
many years. Public sector debt built up rapidly during the 1980’s as the economy moved out
of sugar into tourism. Exogenous shocks—five major hurricanes in the 1990’s—and the use
of the public sector as employer of last resort exacerbated fiscal imbalances that were
financed by the accumulation of arrears. Inefficient government services, limited
infrastructure investment, and governance issues, served to weaken the business environment.
•
The United Progressive Party, elected into office in March 2004 after 27 years in
opposition, has launched an extensive reform agenda. Measures have focused on:
improving governance and transparency; strengthening the business environment; improving
fiscal balances through an ambitious tax reform; and enhancing social programs.
•
Despite the structural changes, growth slowed in 2005 due to temporary factors,
and fiscal outcomes deteriorated. Tourist arrivals have declined in the first half of the year,
but growth is expected to rebound as construction activity accelerates ahead of the 2007
Cricket World Cup. Revenues have strengthened, but government expenditure increased due
to new social programs, higher capital expenditures in advance of the 2007 Cricket World
Cup, and an increase in the number of ministries. Arrears have continued to accumulate.
Policy Discussions
•
Restoring fiscal and debt sustainability with sustained growth will require
continued efforts to strengthen the business environment, improve fiscal balances, and
reduce vulnerabilities.
•
Raising growth potential will require additional efforts in a number of areas,
including: strengthening the investment climate; re-evaluating the investment incentive
regime; enhancing the flexibility of labor markets; and trade facilitation.
•
Civil service reform and improvements in tax administration will be key to
achieving fiscal sustainability. The central government currently employs about 40 percent
of the labor force. The government has launched a voluntary severance scheme to facilitate
downsizing, but it will be important to ensure that an appropriate skill mix is retained. The
sweeping tax reform has placed a heavy burden on tax administration and capacity at the tax
collection agencies needs to be enhanced to ensure that increased revenues materialize.
•
Vulnerabilities to exogenous shocks are high, but the greatest risks may stem from
delays in domestic policy reforms. Even with a large fiscal adjustment and robust growth,
public debt is likely to remain high for a number of years pointing to the need for enhanced
mitigation activities and strengthened financial sector supervision.

-5-

I. DEEPENING FISCAL IMBALANCES
1.
Antigua and Barbuda has the highest income level in the ECCU, but has lived
with very high debt, weak institutions, and—unlike the other ECCU countries—
widespread arrears for more than two decades (Figures 1 and 2). Antigua and Barbuda
was the first ECCU country to transition out of its traditional agricultural product (sugar),
developing a tourism industry in the 1970s and 1980s. Public sector debt rose rapidly,
reaching 120 percent of GDP in 1990, due to substantial public sector investments—in many
cases conducted in a nontransparent manner—in tourism infrastructure. The situation was
exacerbated by a series of exogenous shocks—five major hurricanes hit Antigua and Barbuda
in the 1990s, as well as the September 11 shock to tourism and a contraction in the offshore
sector as regulations were tightened and following the U.S. ban on internet gaming. Despite
significant debt relief from creditors in the mid-1990s, fiscal imbalances widened steadily.
As access to official financing dried up, the government borrowed from banks and individual
investors, secured by earmarked revenues, and arrears—to domestic and external creditors,
social security contributions, and domestic suppliers—mounted, averaging 7½ percent of
GDP a year in 1990–2003.1

ensuring timely wage and pension
payments was afforded the highest priority.
3.
The deteriorating fiscal situation has significantly impacted economic
performance and prospects:
•

Governance concerns have hampered private sector development. Investors—
including those providing financing to the government—have been able to negotiate
substantial discretionary concessions. The perceived absence of a level playing field
has resulted in erratic FDI flows, driven by just one or two investors.

•

Extensive concessions have
significantly eroded tax bases,
requiring higher rates to achieve
revenue goals. The resulting pattern
of effective tax rates on goods and
services is quite arbitrary and
distorts economic behavior.

government revenue goes toward wages and salaries and another third to debt service,
leaving little room for essential government services such as roads.

•

Fiscal institutions are very weak. Expenditure commitments routinely went unmet,
making the budget largely meaningless. Prior to 2005, the budget was never approved
prior to the beginning of the fiscal year. Budget execution is impeded by extensive
earmarking of revenues (about 25 percent of tax revenues at end-2004) and the
fragmentation of the budget due to the creation of off-budget entities with their own
revenue streams and limited oversight.

-9-

•

There is a clear risk of a disorderly adjustment. High debt, an economy dominated by
tourism, frequent natural disasters, lack of access to capital markets, and emerging
pressures on the social security system, point to significant risks going forward that,
absent a significant policy change, the government may not be able to meet priority
expenditures in a timely manner.
II. EFFORTS TO RESTORE MACROECONOMIC BALANCE

4.
The United Progressive Party (UPP), elected into office in March 2004, has
initiated an extensive reform agenda (Box 1). With wage arrears emerging in late 2003,
fiscal mismanagement and governance concerns became central issues in the elections. The
UPP’s policy agenda—first elaborated in the 2005 budget, entitled “Foundation for a Fresh
Start”—reflects campaign promises to enhance governance, strengthen fiscal accounts and
institutions, and improve social conditions, including by increases in pensions and the
introduction of free school uniform and school meals programs.
5.
Following strong growth
in 2003–04, economic activity is
estimated to have slowed in
2005. The tourism sector has
cooled, with stay-over arrivals
falling by 5 percent in the first
half of 2005, partly a reflection
of one-off factors—two major
hotels are undergoing
renovations and a spike in
tourism due to the 2004 English
cricket tour. Construction activity
has accelerated with the onset of
a number of projects linked to
the 2007 Cricket World Cup.

Box 1. Progress with the Authorities’ Economic Program During 2004–05
Strengthened governance and transparency
•

A Freedom of Information Act, an Integrity in Public Life Act, and an Anti-Corruption Act have
been passed to raise accountability and integrity in government. An Integrity Commission has
been appointed and ministers are now required to disclose personal assets.

•

Increased transparency and communication with the public on key policy challenges.
Consultations have been held with stakeholders prior to the introduction of key measures, such as
the PIT and Antigua and Barbuda Sales Tax (ABST). Transparency in relations with the Fund has
increased via press conferences and publication of staff reports.

•

The 2005 budget was submitted to parliament in November and approved in early December,
prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.

•

The granting of discretionary concessions was suspended in June, 2005.

Support to private sector activity
•

Established the Antigua and Barbuda Investment Authority under the prime minister’s office, to
foster private sector investment. A new Investment Code has been prepared, with technical
assistance from FIAS.

•

Lowered the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 30 percent from January 1, 2005.

•

Established an EC$10 million fund for small businesses.

Improvement in fiscal balances
•

The personal income tax (PIT) was reintroduced in April 2005.

•

Moving the property tax to a market value-based system, effective January 1, 2006.

•

Introduction of the ABST (a VAT-type tax) announced for the second quarter of 2006. A White
Paper was published in September describing the broad features of the tax.

•

Public sector transformation to increase the efficiency of government service provision and
reduce the size of the civil service. Ghost workers have been eliminated from the payroll, and
retirement ages have been enforced.

•

A formal public sector investment program mechanism has been introduced to permit a more
rational and transparent allocation of capital expenditures.

Regularizing relations with creditors
•

A donor-financed debt strategist has been hired to work with the Debt Coordinating Committee to
formulate options for regularizing relations with all creditors.

•

Bilateral negotiations have been concluded with certain creditors.

Enhancing social programs
•

Minimum pensions for the civil service and social security scheme were increased effective
January 1, 2005, to EC$750 and EC$350, from EC$500 and EC$150, respectively. Further
increases are planned.

•

Free school meals and free school uniform programs have been introduced.

Box 2. Macroeconomic Impact Of Higher Global Oil Prices
Retail prices of petroleum-based products have been adjusted only infrequently in Antigua and Barbuda,
with limited pass-through to consumers. A flexible pricing regime—incorporating a fixed margin for
distributors, a specific consumption tax, and an ad valorem import levy—was introduced in April 2003, but was
abandoned in February 2004.
Rising world fuel prices and fixed domestic retail prices resulted in falling government revenues, but a
significant adjustment in domestic petroleum prices in October has halted the revenue loss. Domestic
retail prices have been smoothed by reducing the consumption tax to absorb the increases in imported petroleum
prices. The revenue foregone is estimated at more than EC$1 million a month during the first half of 2005 (over
1 percent of GDP on an annual basis). In October, subsequent to the mission, the retail prices of gasoline and
diesel were raised from EC$9.30 and EC$9.31 per imperial gallon to EC$11.89 and EC$10.44, respectively.
This increase is estimated to have addressed the revenue loss from petroleum products at the time.
The petroleum product import bill has doubled since 2003. The impact of higher import prices has been
compounded by the absence of adjustment in domestic consumption—assuming a price elasticity of oil demand
of -0.25, flexible pricing could have reduced oil imports in 2004 by around 0.5 percent of GDP.1

The impact on inflation has been modest, but will increase following the recent domestic petroleum price
adjustments. Staff estimate that the 43 percent increase in petroleum prices since the beginning of 2005 could
ultimately add about 2 percent to the CPI.
The impact on growth appears to have been modest. While country-specific factors have resulted in a
slowdown in tourism in Antigua and Barbuda, tourism in the Caribbean region has continued to grow, albeit at a
slower pace—stayover arrivals increased by 3 percent in the first half of 2005, after growing by 5 percent
during 2004.

Box 3. How Large is the Public Sector?
Limited data availability prevent the presentation of the fiscal accounts on a consolidated basis, but
data for 2003 (in several cases unaudited) suggest that the overall public sector is much larger than
the central government. Consolidated public sector revenues are double the level of the central
government, and public sector capital expenditures amounted to 7 percent of GDP, significantly higher
than the 4 percent of GDP implemented by the central government. Public enterprises generate an overall
surplus and carry a small amount of debt (about 10 percent of GDP), while the statutory bodies are
financed by special levies.

Deficits continue to be financed by

and a short-term revolving credit provided by
domestic banks, creditors have generally not

have accumulated on government contributions

creditors have produced significant debt relief:

The external current account deficit
has narrowed to around 11 percent of GDP,
financed by FDI.3 Despite the increased oil
import bill, the trade deficit declined in 2004,
possibly reflecting the impact of the real
depreciation of the EC dollar since 2002.
Service receipts have wavered in 2005 as
tourism slowed.
10.
High money demand growth, a
reduction in exposure to the government,
and limited domestic lending
opportunities, have resulted in the
further accumulation of foreign assets.
Net credit to the public sector has declined,
as commercial banks roughly maintained
their gross exposures to the central
government while public enterprise
deposits rose. As broad money demand
grew in line with economic activity, the
additional liquidity has been channeled into
foreign assets as credit to the private sector

has increased only gradually and with some reduction in interest rates (principally on
mortgages).
11.
Financial soundness indicators are mixed (Figure 3). Locally licensed banks
account for half of total banking system assets. While their capital adequacy ratio is above
the 8 percent prudential requirement, provisioning levels are relatively low, and asset quality
is weak—NPLs significantly exceed the prudential target of 5 percent and government
exposures are very high.
12.
Progress has been made in addressing the issues raised in the Basle Core
Principles (BCP) assessment of the offshore banking system.4 The BCP assessment found
the offshore banking sector to be compliant or largely compliant with 16 of 23 applicable
principles. Amendments to the International Business Corporations Act were approved in
2004, and new regulations and guidelines were issued by the Financial Services Regulatory
Commission (FSRC) to address issues identified with respect to the power of the offshore
supervisor, rules on reporting, accounting, risk management, and internal controls, the
licensing of offshore captive banks, and introducing a risk-based capital regime.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Overview
13.
While wide-ranging structural reforms have been implemented, these have yet to
translate into improved growth or fiscal outcomes. During the past year, an ambitious
legislative agenda has been adopted that has improved the governance framework, enhanced
transparency in the provision of investment incentives, and modernized the tax system.
Growth, however, has slowed as private sector investment has yet to respond to the improved
business climate. While fiscal revenues have increased, the impact has been more than offset
by the lack of expenditure control.
14.
In the discussions, the authorities reiterated their commitment to addressing the
economic challenges, but noted the complexity of balancing economic prerogatives with
social concerns. There remains a broad policy consensus with staff on the key measures that
need to be undertaken, but the authorities noted that the containment of expenditure had
proven difficult. While expressing their determination to achieve a fundamental
transformation of the public sector—including rationalizing the civil service—the authorities
stressed the need to ensure that reforms were achieved with minimum social dislocation.

The BCP assessment was conducted in conjunction with the ECCU regional FSAP held in September and
October 2003 (the FSSA is available at www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2004/cr04293.pdf). The Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) for the BCP assessment of the offshore banking sector in Antigua

The authorities’ agenda contains many elements discussed in earlier Article IV
consultations. The authorities noted their appreciation for the Fund’s assistance in presenting
and discussing policy options which has helped hone their agenda, particularly in the design
of the tax reform and the debt strategy. Remaining differences largely concern the pace of
reform—the authorities have very rapidly introduced an extensive tax reform in order to have
the key legislative changes in place early in the political cycle, while the staff proposed a
more gradual introduction in order to reduce the pressure on administrative capacity.
Substantial technical assistance has been provided by CARTAC, the Fund, and some donors
to facilitate the authorities’ reform efforts. Discussions with the staff have also been much
more transparent: the 2004 Article IV staff report was published for the first time; joint press
conferences with the minister of finance were held at the conclusion of Article IV missions
and during the ECCU regional discussions; and seminars on some of the background papers
for the ECCU regional discussions were open to the public.
B. Macroeconomic Outlook and Policy Framework
16.
Growth prospects for the coming years are strong, potentially generating labor
shortages. The combination of the initiation of the construction of a new cricket stadium
(funded by a grant from China) and a series of tourism sector projects already under
discussion is likely to underpin growth for the next few years. Indeed, the authorities
considered that growth could be significantly stronger than the 4 percent average projected
for the medium term by the staff, depending on how rapidly the projects currently under
preparation were implemented. If growth does accelerate, it is likely that, as elsewhere in the
region, it would be necessary to import labor in the construction industry.
17.
Available indicators suggest an improvement in competitiveness, though
productivity could be increased by advancing the structural reform agenda (Figure 4).
Due to the CBA, the real depreciation of the U.S. dollar since end-2001 has resulted in a
large depreciation of the real effective exchange rate and Antigua and Barbuda’s tourism
market share has increased. The authorities acknowledge that Antigua and Barbuda is a highcost destination but stressed that the decline in tourism arrivals witnessed in the first half of
2005 was due to temporary factors—including two large hotels undergoing renovations—
with many hotels experiencing unusually high occupancy ratios.5 It was agreed that
competitiveness issues could best be addressed through structural reforms to raise
productivity rather than through a change in the regional exchange rate peg which was
unlikely to yield significant benefits. 6

5

Preliminary data provided by the Antiguan Hotel and Tourism Association suggest that occupancy rates in the
first quarter of 2005 were 79 percent, up from 67 percent in the first quarter of 2004.

Even with an acceleration in growth, achieving fiscal and debt sustainability will
require a large and sustained improvement in the fiscal stance.7 Staff estimates suggest
that, if fully implemented, the authorities’

stock of arrears are being developed by
the Debt Coordination Committee, with the assistance of international financial advisors.
While bilateral negotiations have been initiated with key creditors, the authorities noted that
they intend to approach remaining creditors as a group, with due consideration for
intercreditor equity. Domestic commercial banks have already contributed by reducing the
interest rate on government obligations, but staff noted that further reductions may be needed
as part of the regularization strategy. Steps to facilitate access to capital markets were
underway, including the preparation of Amendments to legislation to permit entry on the
Regional Government Securities Market. In terms of asset sales, staff recommended that a

Given the anticipated increase in global interest rates, the assumption of a fixed 10 percent interest rate on

C. Realizing Growth Potential
20.
Notwithstanding the favorable outlook, efforts are underway to further improve
the business environment. It was agreed that reforms are needed in a broad range of areas to
address issues raised in recent studies of the investment climate (Box 4), and the authorities
are currently focusing on:
•
Strengthening the investment climate. The authorities noted that the new Investment
Act and the Investment Authority were designed to foster private sector investment—both
domestic and foreign.9 The Investment Authority would provide investors with information
on regulations, facilitate land purchases, and ensure a more transparent environment for
investors. Staff agreed that the Investment Authority could play a useful role, but noted that it
was important to provide it with sufficient powers to implement its mandate and reduce the
burden on potential investors.
•
Reinvigorating the offshore sector. The authorities noted that the development of the
offshore sector—which had been emerging as a new growth sector that provided well-paying,
high-skilled jobs—continued to be impeded by the failure to resolve the trade dispute with
the U.S. on internet gaming, despite WTO rulings in their favor. They emphasized their
commitment to maintaining the sector in full compliance with international norms, noting the
favorable BCP assessment of the offshore banking sector, subsequent progress in
strengthening the regulation of the entire offshore sector, and ongoing work to develop an
AML/CFT regulatory framework for nonbanking financial services such as gaming, casinos,
and money transmission agents.
•
Trade facilitation and liberalization. The authorities noted that the ongoing Customs
Renewal Programme would significantly reduce processing time at Customs, lowering the
cost of doing business. The mission welcomed this initiative and encouraged further progress
in trade liberalization through the removal of remaining quantitative restrictions and
licensing requirements, except where justified on the basis of health or security concerns.

Box 4. Investment Climate
Recent studies by the World Bank, USAID and Caribbean Rim Investment Initiative identified
several structural rigidities that adversely affect the business climate:
Labor market rigidities. Wage costs
are high, as is labor protection in the
form of severance pay. Other concerns
include aspects of the labor regime
which make it easy for workers to file
industrial disputes, and a cumbersome
and discretionary process for granting
work permits to foreign workers.

Real estate market. The government
owns over 55 percent of the land in
Antigua. The process of leasing or
purchasing land from government
requires Cabinet approval—foreigners
also need Cabinet approval for land transaction with the private market. The system is cumbersome,
nontransparent, discretionary, and discriminates against foreigners. In addition, reliable information
on the real estate market is limited.
Inefficiencies and high costs of utility services.
Utility services in Antigua (except international
telephone services) are provided by a
monopolistic public enterprise. Electricity tariffs
are high, with complex tariff structures.
Application procedures for obtaining
connections are lengthy and complicated.
Reliability of infrastructure is a concern and
investors often develop their own facilities.

impose quantitative restrictions on imports. The
system for issuing licenses can be discretionary and time-consuming. The complex structure of
CARICOM’s common external tariff, uneven implementation, prevalent multiple surcharges and
exemptions, and high customs service charges make customs processing complicated and costly.
Lack of timely data and information. Reliable and timely information on key macroeconomic
variables such as growth, fiscal performance, public debt, trade, labor market is unavailable. Other
areas in need of improved information dissemination include regulations governing investment
incentives, and procedures for business licensing and registration.

D. Fiscal Policies
2006 Budget
21.
Staff recommended that the 2006 budget target a primary surplus of 1½ percent
of GDP (excluding the costs of severance packages). This would represent a significant but
feasible adjustment—close

for 2006 and on the measures that would deliver such an improvement. Revenues would
rise as a result of measures already introduced in 2005 and the ABST. There was also
agreement on the need to revisit the petroleum pricing regime. In terms of expenditures, the
authorities noted that a key priority for 2006 was to implement a public sector transformation
program to enable a rationalization of the civil service through a voluntary severance scheme,
to yield both fiscal savings and enhance the efficiency of the provision of government
services.
Revenues
23.
The overhaul of the tax system is well underway, and will be largely completed
once the ABST is introduced. While key parameters of the ABST were still under
discussion, a White Paper describing the ABST and the taxes that it would replace was
published in September and public consultations with key stakeholders have been held.
Given the short timeframe for its introduction, it was agreed that the tax should be kept as
simple as possible (both for the benefit of taxpayers as well as to ease administration) and, at
least initially, be restricted to a small number of large taxpayers.
24.
Strengthening administrative capacity at the tax collection agencies will be key
to ensuring that increased revenues materialize. The rapid introduction of the PIT, the
modernized property tax, and the ABST has placed a heavy burden on administrative
capacity. The staff noted that there was a need to ensure that the tax collection agencies had
the necessary resources, including an appropriate skill mix—for example, that there were
sufficient auditors and IT professionals—to ensure the effective implementation of the new
legislation and to absorb the technical assistance being provided by donors.

- 23 -

Expenditure
25.
A Public Sector Transformation, based on a voluntary severance scheme and
enhanced productivity, is under preparation. The authorities noted that management
consultants were examining options for achieving efficiency gains in existing processes. At
the same time, a voluntary severance scheme—comprising a combination of lump sum
severance payments, training options, and access to small business loans—is under
preparation.10 The staff stressed the need to ensure that an appropriate skill mix was retained
and that new hiring be strictly limited to situations where specific skills, not already available
within the public sector, were required. Over the medium term, staff encouraged a
comprehensive review of the role of the government in the economy, including the core
services to be provided by the government, streamlining the number and structure of
ministries, and alternative service delivery options. In addition, options for linking wage
increases to productivity improvements or other performance indicators should be considered
to provide the necessary incentives for the most skilled workers to remain.
26.
The staff encouraged the consolidation of existing social programs into a social
safety net targeted to the needs of the most vulnerable groups. A series of untargeted
social programs had been introduced that were both expensive and not necessarily meeting
the needs of the most vulnerable groups. The staff noted that the poverty assessment being
undertaken should be used to identify the most vulnerable groups and their needs. The
authorities agreed with the desirability of addressing the needs of the most vulnerable
groups—particularly given the increases in domestic petroleum prices and downsizing of the
civil service. They noted that the free school meals program and the free school uniforms
program met important social objectives, but that options for containing the costs of the
programs—limiting administrative bureaucracy, and possibly introducing a cost-recovery
element for the school meals program—were under consideration.
27.
Pension systems—both social security and civil service—need to be re-examined
in order to ensure medium-term viability (Box 5). The authorities concurred with the need
for pension reform and the policy options presented, but noted that it would take time to
build public support. The staff acknowledged that these were difficult reforms but stressed
that delaying the needed changes would only make the ultimate adjustment larger. The staff
urged that additional increases to minimum pensions should be granted only after a clear
strategy for ensuring the viability of the pension schemes is developed.

10

The fiscal projections assume, in line with the indications from focus group studies undertaken by the
government, that about 1,800 civil servants participate in the scheme, implying annual wage bill savings of
about EC$50 million, but upfront severance payments of EC$80–120 million.

Expenditure on civil service pensions, which government retirees receive in addition to ABSSS
pensions, is high and rapidly increasing. Civil service pensions are noncontributory. Combined
civil service and ABSSS pensions can reach 117 percent of pre-retirement salaries. Budgetary
expenditures on civil service pensions amounted to 2 percent of GDP in 2005, but are projected to
rise to 5 percent of GDP by 2020 as the number of eligible civil service retirees increases.

28.
Strengthened expenditure control, including over capital expenditures, would
ensure a more rational allocation of fiscal resources. The authorities acknowledged that
existing procedures for keeping expenditure commitments in line with available resources
had proven ineffective. Consequently, revisions to the Finance and Audit Act were under
preparation that would seek to impart greater accountability at the level of the line ministries.
They also noted that a formal PSIP mechanism was being introduced with clear procedures
for establishing priorities, enabling better sequencing of projects in line with institutional
capacity and the flow of funds, and requiring at least a minimal impact analysis. The staff
welcomed these steps and urged the use of the PSIP framework for the 2006 budget.
E. Transparency and Data Dissemination
29.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to enhancing transparency in
government. Staff welcomed the improvements in transparency that had occurred and
proposed a number of additional steps that could foster a better public understanding of the
ongoing fiscal reforms, including:
•

Publishing a quarterly or semiannual economic review containing preliminary budget
outcomes and other macroeconomic indicators, to supplement the quarterly reviews
prepared by the ECCB;

•

Identifying in the budget the one-off costs of reforms, such as severance payments,
that result in a temporary deterioration in current fiscal outcomes while strengthening
medium-term prospects;

•

Including multiyear budget projections in the budget documentation to clearly
demonstrate the underlying fiscal situation; and

•

Producing a consolidated government budget in addition to the central government
budget to provide a clearer and more transparent assessment of the role of the
government in the economy.

30.
The authorities agreed that increased data dissemination would support their
policy agenda, but noted the need to ensure the quality of data released. It was agreed
that data quality was an important constraint, and the authorities noted that they are seeking
technical assistance from CARTAC and other donors to strengthen all areas of statistics. A
key priority is to introduce a regular survey of living conditions to monitor progress and
identify emerging problems.

world, underscoring the
need to give a high priority to disaster preparedness. Since being hit by four major
hurricanes in 1995−99, Antigua and Barbuda has been spared by recent hurricanes. The staff
recommended increased enforcement of building codes and encouraging home-owners to
obtain insurance. The regulation of the insurance sector should also be strengthened to ensure
a sufficient degree of contract certainty and better protection for policyholders. Antigua and
Barbuda could also benefit from participation in regional initiatives, such as the World
Bank’s Catastrophic Risk Insurance Project, which are designed to pool insurance risk across
countries.

35.
Strengthening the
prudential and regulatory framework for banks would reduce vulnerabilities to adverse
shocks. Stress tests conducted by the staff highlight the impairment of government
obligations or increased loan losses as the key risks to bank balance sheets. Recently
approved Amendments to the Uniform Banking Act—that would permit the implementation
of revised prudential guidelines on capital adequacy, risk-based supervision, and corporate
governance standards—should help strengthen the effectiveness of banking supervision and
the staff urged their timely implementation.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The authorities have made a strong start in advancing their policy agenda to
address the deep-rooted economic problems. Important legislative changes have been
introduced in the past year in many areas, including governance and transparency, tax reform,
and the investment climate.
37.
Despite the important structural changes, macroeconomic imbalances have yet
to close appreciably. Growth has slowed, due to temporary factors. However, an
acceleration in activity is anticipated due to a construction boom associated with preparations
for the 2007 Cricket World Cup together with renewed growth in tourism. Tax revenues have
risen following the reintroduction of the PIT, but expenditures have also risen due to
expanded social programs and an increase in the number of ministries. Consequently, there
has been little progress in reducing the primary deficit and substantial arrears continue to be
incurred.

- 28 -

38.
Achieving macroeconomic stability and sustained growth will require improving
the business environment, closing fiscal imbalances, and reducing vulnerabilities. These
reforms are mutually reinforcing and it is important that progress be made in each area.
Closing the fiscal imbalances will be key, not just for enabling normal budget execution but
for supporting growth through the provision of quality government services and providing a
stable tax environment going forward.
39.
The strong near-term growth outlook provides a window to address structural
impediments to raising longer-term growth prospects. Reducing distortions and
governance issues stemming from the existing investment incentive regime by moving to a
transparent rules-based system, further liberalizing the trade regime, enhancing the efficiency
of Customs to reduce processing time, and easing labor market rigidities would contribute to
achieving growth potential. The depreciation of the U.S. dollar in the last few years has
provided some breathing room, but productivity growth will be key to maintaining
competitiveness.
40.
Sustaining the fiscal effort to ensure progress toward fiscal and debt
sustainability will require greater focus on controlling expenditures. The fiscal effort
during 2005 has been driven by tax reform, with expenditure reforms delayed and new
expenditure initiatives serving to increase fiscal imbalances. The expenditure slippages—
particularly the increase in the number of ministries—are worrisome as the government has
to do its part in the fiscal adjustment by bringing expenditures to a sustainable level in order
to maintain support from taxpayers. Key measures include:
•

Transforming the public sector into a modern efficient civil service that delivers
quality government services.

•

Improving expenditure control mechanisms to enhance accountability for ensuring
that expenditure commitments correspond to budgetary allocations and are consistent
with available resources, including through developing a system for expenditure
prioritization.

•

Strengthening the Public Sector Investment Program to ensure that all capital projects
are effectively evaluated and prioritized.

•

Addressing emerging concerns about the long-term viability of the pension system,
including the separate pensions provided for retired civil servants.

41.
The ongoing tax reform should generate a more equitable and efficient tax
system, but implementation will be key to ensuring that the benefits materialize. The
PIT is already contributing significant revenues, as should the ABST once it is introduced.
Given the rapid pace at which the new legislation has been introduced, it is inevitable that tax
administration capacity is being stretched and it is imperative that the tax collection agencies
are provided with appropriately skilled staff. It will also be critical for the government to be
resolute in denying requests for special exemptions from the new taxes—such exemptions

- 29 -

serve to erode the tax base and would signal that, as previously, tax obligations are
negotiable with adverse effects on the investment climate. Recent increases in domestic
petroleum products have stemmed the revenue loss, but the formal adoption of a transparent
pricing formula with full pass-through of global oil price fluctuations would avoid the need
for discrete adjustments and ensure that appropriate incentives are provided to consumers of
petroleum products.
42.
Normalizing relations with creditors would represent a major step forward for
Antigua and Barbuda. Clearing longstanding arrears and establishing a reputation as a
reliable counterpart would facilitate access to regular financing sources. The decision to hire
financial advisors is welcome but once a strategy has been developed it is important to
advance quickly to the implementation stage. In the meantime, the authorities are encouraged
to maintain an open dialogue with creditors in order that a cooperative solution can be found.
43.
Significant vulnerabilities to exogenous shocks highlight the need to focus on
contingency planning and mitigation activities. The frequency and intensity of recent
hurricane seasons reinforces the need to maintain disaster mitigation efforts and to ensure
appropriate insurance coverage of key public sector assets. Given its key role in the recovery
from natural disasters, supervision of the insurance sector could also be enhanced.
44.
The high level of nonperforming loans and substantial exposure to the public
sector reinforce the need to carefully monitor developments in the financial sector. The
recent approval of the Amendments to the Uniform Banking Act is an important step toward
strengthening supervision of the banking system and should be implemented soon. The
continuing progress in enhancing the regulation of the offshore sector should strengthen the
stability of the financial system.
45.
The greatest risk could come from domestic policy slippages, making it critical
that support for the reforms be maintained. To this end, continued efforts to enhance
transparency and improve data dissemination, particularly over fiscal operations, would
facilitate informed debate on available policy options and help generate consensus for needed
reforms. Establishing a well-targeted social safety net is an important component of the
reform strategy, to ensure that vulnerable groups are protected.
46.
It is recommended that Antigua and Barbuda remain on the standard 12-month
Article IV consultation cycle.

APPENDIX I

Medium-Term Outlook and Debt Sustainability
As of June 2005, Antigua’s stock of external and domestic public and publicly
guaranteed debt amounted to about 105 percent of GDP, of which about a half is in
arrears. Thus, prospects for achieving a more manageable fiscal and debt positions over the
medium term will depend critically on the growth path, sustaining a strong fiscal adjustment,
and the terms at which relations with creditors are regularized and on which new financing is
available.
Three fiscal scenarios were considered—two active scenarios and a passive scenario.
Active scenarios. Ongoing structural reforms to strengthen the investment climate permit
growth to converge gradually over the medium term to the estimated growth potential of 5
percent a year. Fiscal measures—including strengthening tax administration, so that the
legislative changes generate higher revenues, and progress with downsizing the public
sector—result in a primary surplus of 4 percent of GDP over the medium term.
•

In the first scenario, arrears on external as well as domestic debt are assumed to be
regularized during the second half of 2006 through an exchange of both principal and
interest arrears for a new bond carrying an interest rate of 10 percent with a ten-year
maturity. It is assumed that remaining financing needs are met through external
borrowing at the same 10 percent interest rate. On this scenario, debt declines, but
only very gradually with gross financing needs remaining large.

•

In the second scenario, it is assumed that the government is able to negotiate a lower
interest rate on the regularization and that any necessary new financing—gross
financing needs are much lower under this scenario—is available at the same 5
percent interest rate. In this case, debt declines much more rapidly.

Passive scenario. No additional reforms are undertaken, resulting in the fiscal balances
gradually deteriorating. Growth slows, following the temporary spike associated with the
Cricket World Cup, declining to just 1 percent by the end of the decade. Regularization is
assumed to occur at an interest rate of 10 percent, but large and growing financing gaps place
debt on an explosive path.
Even with the fiscal adjustment programmed in the active scenario (at 10 percent
interest rate), the stock of public debt declines very slowly to about 98 percent of GDP
by 2010. Thus, the medium-term outlook is subject to a number of significant risks,
including: (i) a natural disaster such as a hurricane; (i) a decline in growth; and (iii) an
increase in interest rates.
•

A natural disaster. A possible hurricane is one of the most significant risks to the
outlook. A large but plausible shock clearly sets the debt stock on an unsustainable
path. The risk is illustrated by a scenario in which Antigua experiences a strong
hurricane in 2006. Growth, the current account and the fiscal deficit are set to paths

consistent with median
responses of these
variables to the 12 largest
natural disasters in ECCU
countries (IMF Working
Paper 04/224,
Macroeconomic
Implications of Natural
Disasters in the
Caribbean, by T.
Rasmussen). As a result,
the stock of public debt
reaches 150 percent of
GDP by 2010.

debt steadily increases to about 125 percent of GDP in 2010.

•

Higher interest rates. An across-the-board increase in interest rates by 100 basis
points starting in 2006 raises the debt service in percent of revenue and slows the
decline of the debt stock.

1/ Includes gross central government and government guaranteed debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance as a percentage of GDP.
8/ Dynamics of GDP growth and the primary balance are taken from median impact of 12 large natural disasters in the ECCU (Rasmussen, WP/04/224).
9/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
10/ Combines B2, B3 and a real interest rate shock equal to 1/4 of the historical standard deviation.
11/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

B1. All interest rates increased by 100 basis points
B2. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus one half of the standard deviation
B3. Primary balance is at historical average minus one half of the standard deviation
B4. Combination of shocks using 1/4 standard deviation shocks 10/
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2006 11/
B6. 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2006

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP
deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows as percentages of GDP.
6/ Dynamics of GDP growth and the current account are taken from median impact of 12 large natural disasters in the ECCU (Rasmussen, WP/04/224).
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.
8/ Combines B2,B3 and an interest rate shock equal to 1/4 of the historical standard deviation.

B1. Interest rates increased by 100 points
B2. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus one half of the standard deviation
B3. Non-interest current account is at historical average minus one half of the standard deviation
B4. Combination of shocks using 1/2 standard deviation shocks 8/

APPENDIX III

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
As of October 14, 2005
The World Bank’s Management presented to its Board the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), on September 13, 2005. The World Bank Group’s
strategy for the four years covered by this CAS (FY 2006–09) supports the sub-region’s
development agenda through two main pillars: (1) stimulating growth and improving
competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social inclusion and
strengthening disaster risk management.
The CAS, which covers the period FY 2006–09, includes lending to Antigua and Barbuda
under a high case scenario. Under the High Case lending scenario (triggered by successful
implementation of a stabilization program monitored inter alia by the IMF) US$10 million is
planned for investment lending and/or Development Policy Lending to support policy reform
efforts in the areas of growth and competitiveness (including interventions on Public Sector
Modernization and Public Utilities Reform).
Antigua and Barbuda will also benefit from participation in the Catastrophe Risk Insurance
project financed through on-lending, which will strive to deepen insurance markets to allow
for the improved sharing of insurable and uninsurable risks among the public sector, private
sector, international insurance industry, international capital markets and the domestic ‘selfinsured’ population. A GEF-funded Mainstreaming Adaptation to Climate Change
Environmental Protection project, which seeks to assist in the incorporation of climate
change concerns in sector and regional planning for the OECS nations and to identify critical
vulnerabilities, is also planned. Additionally, Antigua and Barbuda will benefit from
ongoing and planned analytical and advisory activities to support the two pillars of the CAS.
These analytical activities include: Caribbean Air Transport Rationalization study, a
Caribbean Skills and Curriculum Study, Caribbean Recent Economic Developments in
Infrastructure study, Caribbean Financial Sector and Regulation report, Caribbean Social
Protection Strategy Review and a regional study on Crime, Violence and Exclusion.
The previous CAS, which covered the period FY 2002–06, did not include any lending to
Antigua and Barbuda.

APPENDIX V

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Antigua and Barbuda has been a participant in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) since October 2000. Its statistical database is deficient in coverage and quality,
preventing an accurate assessment of the flows of funds within and among sectors in the
economy. There are significant problems with real, fiscal, and balance of payments data.
1.

Real sector

National accounts compilation has been plagued by the continued absence of trade data since
1991. This has had a serious impact on the estimation of value added in some sectors,
especially construction and wholesale and retail trade. For construction, alternative data
sources include building applications approved annually and the government’s public sector
investment projects. Wholesale and retail trade estimates are inflated based on movements in
the CPI and patterns of consumer spending.
The consumer price index uses as its weights data from a Household Income and Expenditure
Survey conducted during February 1998−January 1999. However, the survey and price
collection exclude Barbuda. There is no comprehensive labor force survey and thus little
coverage of the labor market developments. An Annual Wages and Hours Worked Survey
for the private sector was conducted in 2003, though the coverage of Barbuda was limited.
Results of the 2001 population census have been analyzed and published.
2.

Government finance

Annual and quarterly data on central government finances published by the ECCB are
broadly in line with the methodology set up in the 1986 GFS Manual. However, Antigua and
Barbuda has not been reporting statistical information in recent years to STA for inclusion in
the GFS Yearbook and IFS publications, which needs to be rectified.
3.

Monetary statistics

Monetary statistics are compiled by the ECCB on a monthly basis with a lag of six weeks.
The data are reported to the Fund regularly. The monetary survey, however, does not include
the accounts of credit unions that accept demand and other deposits. The ECCB is taking
steps to collect reliable data on credit unions.
4.

Balance of payments

Balance of payments statistics are provided to STA by the ECCB. These data are reported on
an annual basis only and are not reported in the format recommended in the fifth edition of
the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual (1993). Reporting of data on reserves and external
debt is in accordance with Antigua and Barbuda’s participation in the GDDS. The latest data
published in the International Financial Statistics are for 2002.

(As of November 14, 2005)

- 53 -

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
December 21, 2005
1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
circulation of the staff report. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Macroeconomic Developments and Prospects
2.
The authorities have revised their growth projection for 2005 to 5 percent from
4 percent previously, on account of a more rapid than expected pick up in construction
activity. However, tourism outcomes remain weak—data through end-September indicate a
5.5 percent decline in stayover arrivals by air relative to the same period of 2004—and staff’s
GDP projection remains unchanged relative to the staff report.
3.
Inflation has risen following the recent increases in domestic petroleum prices.
The CPI increased by 2.2 percent in the 12 months ending October 2005. The increase in the
CPI excluding accommodation was 4.3 percent.
Policy Developments
4.
Additional information on the authorities’ policy agenda for 2006 has been
provided in the context of the Throne Speech (delivered on November 18) and the
Budget Speech (delivered on November 30). The 2006 Budget is now being debated in
Parliament. Key policy commitments—which are broadly in line with information provided
in the staff report—include:
•

The Antigua and Barbuda Sales Tax is to be introduced in the second quarter of 2006,
replacing a number of existing taxes but projected to generate additional revenue of
around 1½ percent of GDP in 2006.

•

A modern Property Tax is to be effective on January 1, 2006. Following an audit
conducted during 2005, the number of properties included in the property tax registry
has increased by 75 percent.

•

Petroleum products are to be priced in line with the common approach to achieving
increased flexibility being developed throughout the ECCU.

•

A voluntary severance scheme for civil servants has been announced, with
applications due by February 28, 2006. The package includes a lump-sum payment
based on years of service plus grants for training.

•

Spending on the school meals program will be limited to EC$5 million, by targeting
the program to nine primary schools in 2006.

-2-

•

The public sector debt stock is to be reduced to less than 80 percent of GDP by
end-2007, compared to 105 percent of GDP at end-2005.

•

Amendments to the Labor Code and Industrial Court Act are under preparation to
provide a better balance between the rights and obligations of employees and
employers, reasonable recognition of long service by employees, and to respond to
the need for a regulatory climate conducive to investment and business viability.

•

Liberalization of the telecommunications sector to ensure competition and support
development of the IT service sector and the transition to e-Government. The removal
of the monopoly operating license on providing landline international calls has been
announced, effective January 1, 2006.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 1, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Antigua and Barbuda
On December 21, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Antigua and Barbuda.1
Background
Antigua and Barbuda has lived with high debt, weak institutions, and substantial arrears for
many years. Public sector debt rose rapidly in the 1980’s as the economy moved out of
sugar into tourism. Exacerbated by a series of exogenous shocks—five major hurricanes hit
Antigua and Barbuda during the 1990’s—fiscal imbalances widened, financed by the
accumulation of arrears, and the public sector was used as the employer of last resort when
growth slowed.
Since 2004, significant reforms have been introduced. In particular, governance has been
strengthened through the approval of the Integrity in Public Life Act and the Anti-Corruption
Act, the granting of discretionary tax concessions has been suspended, the tax system has
been overhauled, and social programs expanded.
Following strong growth in 2003–04, economic activity is estimated to have slowed in
2005—the tourism sector has cooled, partly due to one-off factors, but growth is expected to
rebound as construction activity accelerates ahead of the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Inflation
has been low, but is anticipated to rise due to the impact of global oil price increases.
After strengthening in 2004, data for the first half of 2005 point to a widening fiscal deficit.
A combination of a reduction in capital spending and some improvement in revenues
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and
policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing
Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

following a tightening of the concessions regime resulted in a closing of the primary deficit
to 1½ percent of GDP in 2004. Revenues have performed well following the reintroduction
of the Personal Income Tax, but expenditures have increased due to the implementation of
new social programs, higher capital expenditures in preparation for the 2007 Cricket World
Cup, and an increase in the number of ministries. Arrears continue to accumulate, but the
debt stock fell following debt relief provided by the Italian Government.
The external current account deficit has narrowed to around 11 percent of GDP, financed by
foreign direct investment. Foreign assets of the banking system have risen as a result of
high money demand growth, a reduction in bank exposure to the government, and limited
domestic lending opportunities.
Progress has been made in addressing the issues raised in the Basle Core Principles
(BCP) assessment of the offshore banking system.2 Amendments to the International
Business Corporations Act were approved in 2004, and new regulations and guidelines
were issued by the Financial Services Regulatory Commission (FSRC).
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for their strong start in addressing Antigua and
Barbuda’s deep-rooted economic problems. Important legislative and structural changes
have been introduced, including politically difficult tax reforms, and measures aimed at
improving governance, transparency, and the investment climate. However, important
macroeconomic imbalances persist, and in this context, Directors welcomed the authorities’
active engagement with the staff and efforts to raise public awareness regarding the need
for the sustained implementation of further reforms. Improving the business environment,
closing fiscal imbalances, and reducing vulnerabilities will be key to attracting private
investment and strengthening economic prospects. Directors also observed that a regional
approach is needed to significantly reduce tax concessions and discourage a destructive
competition for investments.
Directors urged the authorities to take advantage of the strong near-term growth prospects
to pursue structural reforms to raise longer-term growth. They recommended improving
governance and transparency, moving to a rules-based investment incentive system, further
liberalizing the trade regime, enhancing the efficiency of Customs, and introducing greater
flexibility into the labor market.
Directors called for a greater focus on controlling expenditures to ensure progress toward
fiscal and debt sustainability. They expressed regret that expenditure slippages, in particular
the expansion in the number of Ministries, had offset the revenue improvements achieved
by the tax reform during 2005. They stressed the importance of the government
2

The BCP assessment was conducted in conjunction with the Eastern Caribbean Currency
Union regional FSAP held in September and October 2003. The Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC) for the BCP assessment of the offshore banking sector in
Antigua and Barbuda is available at www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2004/cr04366.pdf.

demonstrating its resolve to cut spending in order to maintain support from taxpayers for the
fiscal reform. Directors welcomed the recently launched voluntary severance scheme, but
noted the importance of retaining an adequate skill mix to transform the public sector into a
modern and efficient civil service. Additional steps are needed to improve expenditure
control mechanisms, to strengthen the Public Sector Investment Program, and to address
emerging concerns about the long-term viability of the pension system, including the
separate pensions provided for retired civil servants.
Directors emphasized that the ongoing tax reform should foster the creation of a more
equitable and efficient tax system. At the same time, strengthening tax administration will be
key to ensuring that the benefits of the reform materialize, and they supported the
authorities’ request for further Fund technical assistance in this area. Directors urged the
authorities to deny requests for special tax exemptions. They recommended the adoption of
a transparent petroleum product pricing formula with a full pass-through of global oil price
fluctuations, which would avoid the need for discrete adjustments and provide appropriate
incentives for consumers.
Directors noted that clearing longstanding arrears and establishing a reputation as a reliable
counterpart will be key steps in reestablishing the country’s access to capital markets.
They welcomed the hiring of financial advisors to assist in the design of the strategy to
regularize relations with creditors. Directors encouraged the authorities to maintain an open
dialogue with creditors to facilitate the identification of a cooperative solution.
Directors considered that significant vulnerabilities to exogenous shocks highlight the need
to focus on contingency planning and disaster mitigation efforts. They urged the authorities
to ensure appropriate insurance coverage of key public sector assets, and to enhance
supervision of the insurance sector.
Directors called for careful monitoring of developments in the financial sector in light of the
high level of nonperforming loans and substantial exposure to the public sector. They
welcomed the recent approval of the Amendments to the Uniform Banking Act, and urged
their prompt implementation. Directors noted the progress made in strengthening the
regulation and supervision of the offshore sector, and the need for continued efforts to
ensure the stability of the financial system.
Directors stressed the importance of sustaining public support for the reform efforts in order
to prevent domestic policy slippages. While significant advances have been made in
strengthening transparency and governance, Directors noted that further steps, including
enhanced data dissemination, would help generate consensus for needed reforms. The
development and public discussion of medium-term fiscal projections could facilitate public
understanding of available policy choices and generate support for the authorities’ efforts to
achieve fiscal and debt sustainability. Directors supported the establishment of a welltargeted social safety net to ensure that vulnerable groups are protected.
Directors encouraged the authorities to work toward providing more timely and accurate
economic data in order to support effective policy making.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after
Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in
a particular case. The staff report for the Article IV consultation with Antigua and Barbuda may be made
available at a later stage if the authorities consent.
