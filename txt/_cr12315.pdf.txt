STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 15, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: Following the 2008/9 financial crisis and deep recession, a cyclical recovery
took hold in Ukraine, supported by a stronger external environment. Efforts to
consolidate public finances and repair the banking system began strengthening
Ukraine’s resilience to external shocks. More recently, policies have not been sufficient
to meet key objectives, and the government has hesitated to undertake politically
unpopular reforms. The external environment has become less supportive, and the
recovery is losing momentum.
Outlook and risks: Vulnerabilities are elevated given significant external and fiscal
funding needs and weak buffers. Risks of external shocks which could worsen Ukraine’s
growth outlook and reduce the availability of financing have risen. The medium-term
outlook is clouded by still weak bank balance sheets and credit growth prospects and
an uncertain business environment.
Main policy recommendations: Discussions focused on policies to reduce
vulnerabilities, safeguard financial stability, and raise sustainable growth. The
immediate tasks are to consolidate fiscal adjustment, improve the monetary and
exchange rate policy framework, strengthen banks’ balance sheets, and step up
structural adjustment, especially in the energy sector.

UKRAINE

CONTEXT
1.

In the aftermath of the 2008/9 crisis, Ukraine’s economy stabilized, and growth

resumed. Following one of the deepest recessions in Europe (real GDP contraction of 15 percent
in 2009), a cyclical recovery took hold supported by a stronger external environment, better policies,
and backing from the international community. Inflation fell to single digits. The combined general
government and Naftogaz (NG; the state-owned gas company) fiscal deficit was halved to
4.3 percent of GDP by 2011, supported by policy measures, including pension reform, gas price
increases (in mid-2010), and a cyclical rebound in revenues. The banking system was stabilized and
recapitalized, and several banking and crisis resolution laws and reforms were completed. The
sovereign regained access to international markets and foreign exchange reserves were rebuilt.
These efforts strengthened Ukraine’s resilience to external and macro-financial shocks and its
performance relative to peers, and reduced perceptions of risk (Figure 1).
2.

Ukraine’s prospects are now hampered by uneven policy implementation and external

headwinds. Confidence in economic policies has deteriorated as the government reform agenda
has lost some momentum. The fiscal policy stance for 2012 has been loosened and energy pricing
reforms are stalled. The authorities continue to maintain a de facto peg as the nominal anchor,
which drives monetary policy. The business environment has seen improvement in some areas, but
still suffers from uneven administrative decisions and weak governance, which in turn dampen
investment and growth prospects. Compounding this are weaker global growth prospects, renewed
volatility in the euro area, ongoing deleveraging, and disruptions in global financial markets. Official
sector support to Ukraine has been largely suspended (Box 1).
3.

More ambitious policies would help contain risks and boost medium-term growth.

Immediate steps in fiscal consolidation and reforms in the energy and banking sectors are needed
to reduce vulnerabilities and strengthen confidence and market access. Contingency planning for
potential shocks should continue. Deeper structural reforms are needed to rebuild buffers and
strengthen institutions. Together, these steps would help realize Ukraine’s substantial growth
potential—given abundant resources, an educated labor force, and proximity to major economic
centers—and help close the income gap. Ukraine’s per-capita income is about $3,600, or 10 percent
of the EU27 level.1

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. Ukraine: Stand-By Arrangement
A 29-month, SDR 10.0 billion (US$15.4 billion, 729 percent of quota) program was approved by the Executive
Board on July 28, 2010 (EBS/10/146). The first review was completed in December 2010 (EBS/10/232). Two
purchases totaling SDR 2.25 billion have been made, of which US$2 billion was for budget support. The program
expires in December 2012.
The second review under the SBA has been on hold since March 2011 as program performance has fallen short of
expectations. On the positive side, a key structural reform, enactment of pension reform legislation, was
completed in October 2011 and progress has been made in strengthening the banking sector. However, the
authorities’ backtracking on their commitment to raise gas and heating tariffs in 2011 has been a key obstacle for
the review, and reforms in other areas—including the VAT refund system, social assistance programs, the
corporate insolvency law, fx regulations, resolution of intervened banks, and the framework for addressing NPLs—
have been delayed or are incomplete. While some fiscal consolidation was achieved in 2011 and the general
government deficit target was met, the combined deficit with NG of 4.3 percent of GDP exceeded the 3.5 percent
program target due to NG’s overruns. The authorities’ reluctance to allow greater exchange rate flexibility
undermined their ability to boost reserve buffers in line with program objectives. The authorities are considering
necessary actions to resume program relations. World Bank and European Commission budget support remain
suspended.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.

Ukraine’s real GDP growth has moderated, reflecting weakening external demand and

tight credit conditions. The economy grew briskly in 2010–2011 by 4.1 and 5.2 percent
respectively, led initially by higher industrial and agricultural production and exports and later by
domestic demand as recovering incomes and consumer confidence boosted consumption
(Figure 2). Labor market conditions have improved, with real wages rising about 8 percent annually
and unemployment edging below 8 percent. Growth, however, slowed in 2012:Q1 to 2.0 percent yo-y (from 4.7 percent in 2011:Q4), notwithstanding still buoyant domestic consumption demand.
Industrial production—particularly the metallurgy, chemical, and machine building sectors—
decelerated, driven by weakened external demand, except from Russia. Construction stagnated due
to lower government investment spending as Euro-2012 preparations tapered off. Credit growth has
been constrained by tight monetary policy, government financing requirements, and deleveraging
by banks. The total loan portfolio has fallen slightly over the last two quarters, through March.

Headline inflation has fallen rapidly, but pressures remain evident. Headline inflation (y-

o-y) fell from 12 percent in mid-2011 to -0.5 percent in May, close to historical lows, on account of
falling food prices, flat utility prices, tight monetary policy, and decelerating economic activity
(Figure 3). However, core inflation is around 4 percent, and wage increases have outpaced
productivity growth. Unit labor costs are now approaching pre-crisis levels.

Ukraine’s external position has been under pressure and buffers have fallen (Table 4;

Figure 4). Under the de facto exchange rate peg against the dollar, the real exchange rate
depreciation of 2008/9 has been reversed, fueled by high real wage growth and inflation
differentials. The exchange rate is now slightly overvalued (Annex I). The current account deficit
widened to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2011 from 2.2 percent of GDP in 2010. The government tapped

Eurobond markets for US$5½ billion from September 2010 through mid-2011, but rising
perceptions of risk have effectively blocked sovereign access since then. Spreads have been 800–
1,000 bps in recent months, up from 450 bps in early 2011. Overall external rollover rates remain
strong but continued bank deleveraging has been accompanied by shortening maturities (Figure 5).
The hryvnia came under significant pressure in the second half of 2011, as external conditions
worsened and skittish households withdrew fx cash. Gross reserves fell by about 20 percent (about
US$6.5 billion) between May 2011 and January 2012, to around US$31 billion, or about 55 percent
of short-term debt. From January to May 2012, the balance of payments improved—allowing US$1.2
billion in Fund repurchases without degrading gross reserves.
7.

Monetary policy has been geared to support the de facto peg, resulting in large swings

in liquidity and interest rates, and fx interventions (Table 6). Through January, the NBU
undertook aggressive liquidity tightening (the overnight interbank rate peaked at 33 percent) and
stepped-up fx sales, and adjusted prudential and administrative measures to hold the exchange rate
at about UAH8/US$. The latter measures included

After some improvement in 2011, the fiscal stance is loosening. Under current policies,

the combined deficit (general government and Naftogaz) is expected to rise to 5.3 percent of GDP in
2012 (from 4.3 percent in 2011).

2

In 2011, the NBU issued instructions to ensure that the exchange rate used for transactions between the
Government and the NBU will not deviate from the contemporaneous exchange rate in the interbank market by
more than 2 percent. Staff continues to discuss with the authorities how the new rule can be implemented to
eliminate the multiple currency practice (MCP) earlier identified by the staff. Ukraine also maintains another MCP, as
described in the Informational Annex.

The general government met its deficit target of 2.8 percent of GDP in 2011,3 resulting in a
structural fiscal contraction of 0.8 percent of GDP over 2010 (Table 2). But this was achieved
through under-implementation of capital expenditures that offset overspending in wages
and pensions. Public debt fell from 41 to 36 percent of GDP during 2010–11. The general
government deficit target for 2012 is set at 1.8 percent of GDP. However, in April 2012, a
supplementary budget was approved that boosts spending by 2.5 percent of GDP. Because
much of this increase is for higher wage and pension spending, expenditure in future years is
also likely to be higher. The official deficit target remains unchanged because the
government has revised revenue projections upward, based on expectations of stronger
revenue collection. There is some evidence of revenue increases, but the government’s full
year revenue projections appear optimistic, and staff projects a deficit of 3.3 percent of GDP
(fiscal performance through May indicates a 1 percent of GDP deficit). With respect to
financing, primary issuances dropped significantly in mid-2011 over reluctance to pay high
market yields, but have picked up around 2011:Q4 as the government introduced lower
yielding foreign currency denominated and indexed bonds and increased reliance on shorter
term instruments. The government reported it reached agreement on rolling over 50 percent
of a US$2 billion external bank loan that matures in June.

In early 2011, the government adjusted its 2011 deficit target from 3.1 percent of GDP (EBS/10/232) to 2.8 percent

The energy sector remains a fiscal drain. The deficit of NG was 1.5 percent of GDP in 2011
(against a target of 0.7 percent) and is headed towards 2 percent of GDP this year (against
an adjusted target of 0.7 percent). The economic cost is even larger, at about 5 percent of
GDP (Annex II). NG finances continue to suffer from failure to raise domestic tariffs, as well
as higher import costs and lower than expected payment compliance. The government has
set energy independence as a longer term national objective. Key elements of their strategy
to achieve this are investment in domestic gas exploration and production, energy efficiency
measures, and, if necessary, domestic tariff increases. Ukraine recently signed gas
exploration agreements with several major international energy companies, and
simultaneously announced its commitment to implement the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI). Ukraine is

Progress in other fiscal structural reforms has been mixed:

(i) The authorities recently approved a new customs code which reduces the time for customs
clearance from 24 to four hours and sets up a “single window” shop. Discretion in ascertaining
customs values is reduced by minimizing the contact between officers and taxpayers.
(ii) A comprehensive pension law approved in late 2011 is expected to yield medium-term annual
savings of 1.8 percent of GDP by aligning the retirement age for women (from 55 to 60) to men
(60) and increasing the years of service for pension eligibility. However, some of these gains
(about 0.7 percent of GDP) will be eroded by pension increases in the 2012 supplementary
budget. Without further reform, the system is projected to carry annual losses of around
5 percent of GDP over the long-term.
(iii) The authorities have recently started the process of centralizing the Large Taxpayers Office. By
end-June, a centralized database will be operational, and reporting could be done online.
(iv) Significant progress has been made in modernizing state tax services, including implementation
of a centralized web-based solution for registering taxpayers, filing and paying taxes, and tax
audit execution.
(v) There has been some progress in automating VAT refunds with latest data through end-May
showing about 60 percent of receipts refunded via the automated system, but some companies
continue to report overdue refunds.
(vi) During 2010–11, civil service reforms cut the

and pension increases in 2011.
(vii) A new tax code was approved in 2010 that gradually lowers corporate tax rates (which dropped
2 percentage points on January 1) and VAT in line with the authorities’ objective of lowering the
tax burden. However, the tax system continues to suffer from loopholes, evasion, and uneven
administration.
10.

Progress has been made on banking sector reforms, but bank balance sheets remain

weak, and private credit growth is subdued. (Table 7; Figure 6; Annex III). Capital adequacy ratios
are above the statutory minimum, thanks to two rounds of capital injections in 2009–10. But bank
profitability is near zero as banks continue provisioning against bad loans. Nonperforming loans are

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

around 15 percent of total loans (39 percent under broad definition of NPLs). Credit growth to the
economy was only 6 percent in March, y-o-y, and credit as a percent of GDP has fallen from
79 percent in 2008 to 59 percent. Notwithstanding some de-dollarization, bank balance sheets
remain exposed to currency movements due to regulatory distortions (the banking system has an
overall fx short position of about US$8 billion) and fx (mostly in US$) loans to unhedged borrowers.
External support for the banking system is shrinking. BIS figures show a 26 percent drop in foreign
bank exposure to Ukraine during 2011. The loan-to-deposit ratio has fallen to a still high
160 percent, from a 2009 peak of 230 percent. Several important banking laws and reforms were
completed during the past 18 months that will strengthen transparency (Ultimate Controllers law),
banking supervision (Consolidated Supervision law; new provisioning regulations; migration to IFRS)
and the resolution framework (Deposit Guarantee Fund law). Implementing regulations for these
laws are being finalized. Nadra Bank (intervened in 2009) was privatized and recapitalized during
2011 with private funds, while resolution of the remaining state-intervened banks continues.
11.

Efforts to improve the business environment have had mixed results. Strengthening the

business climate is a major focus of the President’s Economic Reform Program. Some successes have
been achieved. For example, deregulation efforts have reduced the number and time required to
receive permits. But after some improvement in 2010, Ukraine has lost ground in international
surveys (Figure 7). A recent IFC survey found that the amount of revenues absorbed by unofficial
means to resolve business constraints had risen in 2011.

OUTLOOK, RISKS, AND SPILLOVERS
12.

Growth will slow and financing needs will widen this year. Headwinds from slowing

domestic demand, waning exports (consistent with trading partner growth), and tight credit markets
are expected to slow real GDP growth to 3 percent this year (Table 1). While inflation has surprised
on the downside, it is expected to rise to 7.4 percent y-

7

o-y given rising food prices (due to unwinding effects of

6

the bumper 2011 harvest) and pressures from rising

wages (propelled by social initiatives of the

Fund. Gross reserves are projected to drop to around US$24 billion (40 percent of short-term debt)
by year-end. Public financing needs are significant, and the authorities will likely have to rely heavily
on domestic financing (Tables 3 and 8).
13.

Absent more comprehensive reforms, medium-term growth prospects are muted, and

shadowed by persistent vulnerabilities. Under the baseline scenario, Ukraine’s reform program
fails to pick up pace, financial support from IMF and most international financial institution (IFI)
remains suspended, and global growth gradually improves in line with the latest WEO forecast.
Ukraine’s real GDP growth would recover to a modest level of around 3.5 percent next year—
reflecting in part some recovery in partner country growth—, well below levels that could be
expected under a reform scenario that would help unlock Ukraine’s considerable growth potential.
Gradual increases in nominal exchange rate flexibility (moving in line with trading partner inflation
differentials) are anticipated, and the current account deficit would moderate slightly to around
5.5 percent of GDP, weighed down by large energy imports. Inflation would gradually fall to about
5 percent though greater volatility could be expected if the NBU retains its de facto pegged
exchange rate regime. Gross reserves would drop to very low levels in 2013–14 (27 percent of shortterm debt), leaving Ukraine vulnerable to swings in investor confidence. External and public debt
would settle at around 65 and 35 percent of GDP, respectively, but financing requirements would
remain elevated. Some standard debt shocks suggest potentially unsustainable trajectories,
particularly with respect to growth shocks (Figures 8 and 9).
14.

Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. A worsening of euro area turbulence or

global growth could have significant negative implications for Ukraine. Although Ukraine’s direct
real and financial sector spillover channels from the euro area are smaller than some peers, Ukraine’s
underlying vulnerabilities—including low reserve cover, large external and fiscal financing needs,
heavy dependence on commodity export prices, and a crisis-weary public—make it vulnerable to
external shocks and shifts in investor and depositor sentiment (Annex IV). If Ukraine’s market access
is lost for a protracted period and global growth slows significantly, Ukraine may come under severe
financial and economic strains, with currency overshooting, high interest rates, financial sector
disruptions, recession, and higher unemployment.
15.

Ukraine’s financing prospects will also be influenced by the quality and pace of

domestic policies (the prospects for which are rendered more uncertain by approaching
parliamentary elections). There are upside as well as downside scenarios. If the authorities succeed
in improving revenue collection, the budget deficit and financing needs will be smaller. Greater
exchange rate flexibility in 2012 would help the current account. On the downside, an attempt to

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

hold a fixed exchange rate over the medium-term despite higher inflation than trading partners,
coupled with wage increases which exceed productivity gains, would lead to higher current account
deficits, more reserve depletion, and severe financial and economic disruptions. The perceived
deterioration in the business climate, if left unaddressed, could also result in lower investment and
growth.

REPORT ON DISCUSSIONS
A. The Policy Mix and Overall Risks
16.

Against this backdrop, discussions centered on policies to: (i) secure sound public

finances; (ii) strengthen the energy sector; (iii) reduce financial vulnerabilities and revive
lending; (iv) enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy; and (v) facilitate higher,
sustainable medium-term growth. Discussions also covered spillovers, crisis preparedness, and
contingency plans. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of spillover channels but
believe that the staff’s baseline scenario and assessment of risks is overly pessimistic. They expect a
post-election environment that will allow them to implement key reforms, thus facilitating IFI
financial support, which would increase reserves and reduce risks.

B. Securing Sound Public Finances and a Strong Energy Sector
17.

Strengthening public finances in a durable manner remains an overarching policy

objective. The authorities agreed that the rapid increase in public debt in recent years is a key
vulnerability. They viewed strict control over budget deficits and other debt-creating activities as
critical to reduce financing needs and debt, rebuild confidence, and lower borrowing costs. In this
context, they reiterated a commitment to limit the general government deficit to 1.8 percent of GDP
in 2012 and the NG deficit to 0.7 percent of GDP. They intend to further reduce government deficits
over the medium-term and to take further steps to bolster NG’s finances.
18.

Staff urged measures to reverse projected fiscal slippages this year. While some

improved collection can be expected in corporate tax and VAT revenues, staff argued that this
would only be sufficient to offset lower revenues from reduced corporate tax rates. It would not fully
offset higher expenditures under the supplementary budget and, therefore, the deficit is likely to
approach 3.3 percent of GDP. To meet the 1.8 percent of GDP deficit target, staff urged immediate
adoption of fiscal measures—including increasing the tax rate for higher income earners (from 17 to
20 percent for the second tax bracket), eliminating tax exemptions (mainly VAT exemptions),
removing special tax treatment with offshore tax havens, and cuts in current spending. If the
authorities prefer contingency measures, they should be prepared to adopt them quickly, given that

UKRAINE

half the year has already passed (and therefore revenue gains will be more limited). Staff cautioned
against the use of restrictive trade policy measures (tariffs) to generate revenue, as they can damage
the business climate and competitiveness, and result in longer-term economic costs.
19.

Authorities’ views: The authorities argued that stronger revenue collection efforts will be

sufficient to offset increased expenditures. They pointed to stronger enforcement mechanisms
under the new customs code, efforts to increase formalization of economic activity, and better
management of the tax authority. They agreed, however, to quickly identify contingency revenue
and expenditure measures that could be implemented if needed.
20.

Staff pressed for measures to strengthen NG’s finances, and to articulate a broader

energy sector reform strategy. The most effective initial step towards achieving energy
independence would be to raise household gas

1,200

and heating tariffs, permitting an increase in the

1,000

gas price received by NG. These prices are
currently, on average, less than one-quarter of

800

the cost to import the gas. Gradually raising

600

prices will lower NG’s deficit, reduce imports, and

free up resources for investment in domestic
production and energy efficiency.4 This would
initially bring modest revenue gains (0.2 percent
of GDP this year), but over time would generate
significant revenue. Staff urged the authorities to
consider such tariff hikes as a critical part of any

broader energy sector strategy that should also include energy efficiency improvements and
implementation of better-targeted social assistance to support the poorest (Annex V). The mission
welcomed recent efforts to boost investment in gas exploration through new tenders and off-shore
drilling. Staff supported the authorities’ metering and energy savings efforts (see below), and urged
the authorities to work closely with the World Bank on these efforts.
21.

Authorities’ views: The authorities reiterated their medium term goals of weaning NG off

budget support, enhancing efficiency, and (in the long-term) achieving energy independence. But
they continue to reject near-term household tariff increases, arguing that they would hurt the poor,
4

Staff has argued for significant and upfront increases of 30 percent and 58 percent in the price received by NG for
household gas and from heating utilities (with full pass-through to end-user tariffs), in the context of SBA
negotiations, followed by semi-annual increases (20 percent) for each.

14

have little impact on efficiency and consumption without proper metering and housing upgrades,
and further weaken payment discipline. Instead, they intend to focus on payment discipline,
improving heating meter coverage and household energy saving infrastructure supported by
subsidized loans to households. Once this process has advanced, they will gradually increase enduser energy prices. They will also continue efforts to attract investment in domestic gas exploration
to boost domestic production.
22.

Staff highlighted the risks from higher fiscal deficits. Absent measures, staff projects that

the combined general government and NG deficit will rise to 5.3 percent of GDP (against a
2.5 percent target) in 2012, putting pressure on financing needs in an already challenging
environment. This would push yields higher, crowd out private sector credit, or push up inflation.
Staff also expressed concern over increasing amounts of shorter term and fx-linked government
debt. Over the medium-term, staff projects that without new measures, the combined general
government and NG deficit would remain at around 5 percent of GDP, which would continue to
pose financing risks. Staff suggested that cutting tax rates may need to be postponed until better
revenue collection is achieved, exemptions are eliminated, or expenditures are cut (so as to bring
public debt down). It would also be important to contain the government wage bill and to bring the
pension system into balance through further reforms. Staff also noted risks that unanticipated
shocks could push debt to unsustainable levels (Figure 8).
23.

Authorities’ views: The authorities argued that better revenue collection and energy

efficiency and increased domestic production would help bring down combined general
government and NG deficits to 2½ percent of GDP in 2012 and to around 1 percent of GDP in the
medium-term, resulting in a medium-term reduction of public sector debt. Over the medium-term,
the authorities want to reduce the high tax burden over time and create space for higher
infrastructure spending (EBS/10/232).
24.

To strengthen public finances over the medium-term, staff urged reforms to

strengthen institutions and increase investment. Steps to achieve this could include:


Well-targeted social spending to help cushion the impact of fiscal consolidation on the most
vulnerable. The authorities expressed their intention to reform social spending in consultation
with the World Bank.



Public administration reform in the critical health and education sectors where the bulk of
public employment rest and the quality of services is low. The authorities noted they plan to
continue reforms and reductions in 2013–2014.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT



UKRAINE

Fiscal framework improvements to strengthen procedures for monitoring, disclosing and
controlling fiscal risks and develop a medium-term fiscal framework. The authorities agreed
with these goals, and would gradually implement them.



Improved revenue administration to increase taxpayers’ trust in the tax system and reduce
widespread tax avoidance. The authorities indicated this was a priority area, particularly
reducing the shadow economy.



Public investment increases to rehabilitate and develop infrastructure. Staff stressed that
investment projects need to be prioritized and included in the budget (with off-budget
guarantees strictly limited). The authorities agreed on the need for further investment.

C. Strengthening the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy Framework
25.

Monetary policy should focus on achieving price stability, rather than on the exchange

rate. There was agreement on the importance of maintaining domestic price stability, consistent
with the NBU’s mandate, and that present monetary conditions were striking an appropriate balance
between heightened external risks and the still closing output gap. However, a tighter policy stance
would be needed if balance of payments or inflationary pressures intensify. The mission noted that
gradually increasing exchange rate flexibility would better serve Ukraine in adapting to changing
economic fundamentals (and help preserve competitiveness; Annex I), provide a buffer to external
shocks, push the private sector to more properly assess fx risk, and help raise reserves, which are
very low compared to debt service. It would also free up monetary policy to focus more squarely on
inflation (Annex VI) and would represent an important step towards the medium-term objective of
transitioning to full-fledged inflation targeting. Increased exchange rate flexibility should be
supported by fiscal, monetary, and wage policies consistent with maintenance of price stability.
Staff also advised the authorities to continue with the agreed foreign exchange market liberalization
plan, including establishing a framework to develop the forward exchange market.
26.

Authorities’ views. The authorities stressed they have no predetermined path for the

exchange rate (the de jure policy remained a “transition to a free floating exchange rate”) and
accepted the case for more day-to-day flexibility. However, they were concerned that significant
exchange rate volatility would be detrimental to efforts to rehabilitate the financial sector given
balance sheet mismatches, and would undermine public confidence in the hryvnia. They agreed that
interest rates need to take a leading role in the conduct of monetary policy in the period ahead but
wished to proceed carefully and gradually. The authorities shared staff’s concerns regarding low
reserve cover, but noted that import coverage remained above 3 months, and as the external
environment and confidence improved, fx inflows would increase. They also expressed hope that the
wider range of instruments (including fx-denominated instruments) would help repatriate resident fx
16

UKRAINE

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

holdings. With respect to fx market liberalization, the authorities are continuing work to strengthen
the framework for forward markets.
27.

Unwinding crisis-era policies pose significant challenges to monetary policy. There was

agreement that the unwinding of two major crisis era policies, Resolution 109 and stabilization loans
(Annex III), combined with external deleveraging of banks, could put significant pressure on liquidity
and the exchange rate, and must be carefully managed to avoid unnecessary disruption in financial,
credit, and exchange rate markets.5 With respect to Resolution 109, staff urged the NBU to gradually
unwind the measure through staged liberalization of LLPs on fx loans (gradually returning them into
banks’ statutory calculation of net open position) in a manner that treats all banks equally. Staff
agreed that the next stage in unwinding the resolution (following an NBU pilot involving a few
banks) would need to be carefully sequenced, and that modest issuance of fx-linked bonds by the
government would be useful. This should begin soon, given the vulnerability of the banks to
exchange rate depreciation. The other major challenge is bank repayment of remaining
UAH60 billion in NBU stabilization loans. Together with hryvnia liquidity needs to unwind
Resolution 109, and the loss of term financing through deleveraging, banks face a potential systemic
liquidity gap that could be addressed by the NBU through refinancing, repo, and other liquidity
management tools. The NBU should reaffirm bank solvency before extending or providing new
liquidity (and should be careful not to undermine development of private longer term capital
funding).
28.

Authorities’ views. The NBU noted it is preparing modifications of liquidity support

mechanisms to address the withdrawal of term financing, and to address any systemic liquidity gaps.
There was agreement that policies to unwind these crisis era legacies should be consistent with
broader monetary policy objectives (with any support provided only to solvent banks), and that
issuance of fx-linked bonds should be limited.

5

Resolution 109 has pushed banks’ economic net open position about US$8 billion short. Banks have outstanding
stabilization loans totaling about UAH60bn (granted by the NBU in 2008-9 in response to deposit runs and an
external funding freeze).

D. Reducing Financial Sector Vulnerabilities and Reviving Lending
29.

Global and domestic risks call for contingency planning and close supervision to

ensure an effective response in the event of any renewed pressure on the banking system.
Staff urged a review of contingency plans, strengthened monitoring, and creation of a dedicated
financial stability unit. The mission also urged close supervision of banks to ensure compliance with
prudential norms (including through more reliance on ‘early warning system’ tracking of financial
soundness). Banks with weaker indicators should be subject to enhanced monitoring with a welldeveloped action plan including, if necessary, additional capital injection (and reductions of related
party lending), as needed. Efforts are also needed to encourage consolidation of the sector. The
large number of smaller banks (with reportedly significant connected lending in many cases) could
pose supervision and governance problems. Staff urged quick resolution of remaining stateintervened banks. This should include completion of the transformation of one of these banks into a
bad bank to absorb NPLs from state-owned banks and state-intervened banks. Staff also urged
further steps to strengthen state-owned banks consistent with the findings of due diligence studies.
30.

Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed on the importance of contingency plans, and

noted ongoing upgrades of their supervisory framework, bank resolution and emergency liquidity
assistance frameworks, as well as strengthened communication channels. They indicated they are
maintaining appropriate monitoring and supervision of all banks, and are proceeding with plans for
enhanced financial stability functions inside the NBU. They are proceeding with plans to resolve the
three remaining state-intervened banks, which include completing the creation of a bad bank to
manage their NPLs.
31.

Further steps are needed to help remove bad assets from private bank balance sheets.

Staff stressed the importance of removing regulatory and tax obstacles to recognizing, restructuring,
writing off, and selling (to third parties) bad loans. Corporate insolvency legislation, which was
approved by Rada in January 2012, needs to be amended to facilitate out-of-court restructuring. A
strategy to develop the personal insolvency framework is also needed. These efforts would also
need to be complemented by steps to strengthen judicial decisions and collateral enforcement.
These steps would help free up resources to facilitate new lending to the economy.
32.

Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that further steps to facilitate NPL reduction are

important, and noted they are in discussions with banks and the government over possible
additional tax and legal amendments to achieve this. They intend to incorporate changes to the
insolvency law later this year. They have no plans at this time to reform the personal insolvency
framework.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Progress has been made in strengthening some aspects of the NBU’s safeguards

framework. The external audit of the NBU’s 2011 financial statements was conducted by Ernst &
Young (EY) and completed in a timely manner. EY issued an unqualified audit opinion, which is
progress from the previous qualified opinions from PWC. The NBU Council has met and approved
the audited financial statements as required under the law. Staff is awaiting EY’s 2011 report
concerning internal controls and other issues identified by the audit. This report is currently being
finalized and should be available for review in mid-2012.

E. Creating a More Dynamic Economy
34.

Generating sustained improvements in living standards will require further structural

reforms to boost competitiveness and growth, while limiting external imbalances. Achieving
higher long-term growth depends on addressing underlying structural weaknesses, including the
business climate, high entry barriers, weak competition, poor infrastructure, and low export
diversification.
35.

The authorities should press forward with reforms envisaged in the President’s

Economic Reform Plan to promote growth, improve the business climate, and attract
investment. Goals include deeper global integration, more deregulation, stronger governance, and
further privatization. Key reform areas include:


Agriculture. This sector has significant potential to promote higher growth, exports, and
investment. The authorities indicated they are now exploring measures, including land reform,
and a unified registry of land and real estate, that could enhance efficiency and production.



Investment and integration. The authorities are pursuing measures to ease the barriers to
business entry, operation, and exit. Faster integration with the EU would support these efforts.



Transparency and governance. Reports from private businesses, and Ukraine’s standing in
international surveys, suggest that Ukraine’s business reputation continues to slip, hurt by
perceptions of partial and discriminatory enforcement of laws and an uneven playing field
fostered by weak governance and institutions (a 2011 EBRD survey cited corruption as the top
business obstacle in Ukraine). The authorities recognize the need to strengthen the investment
climate. They are undertaking measures to reduce the scope for discretionary administrative
decisions and plan to set up a one-stop investment bureau.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

UKRAINE

F. Capacity to Repay the Fund
36.

Authorities have made commitments at the highest level to repay the Fund. Ukraine

has repurchases of SDR 1.9 million and SDR3.7 million over the remainder of 2012 and 2013,
respectively. All Fund repayments are fully reflected under the current baseline (which also shows a
drop in gross reserves through 2014).

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.

Ukraine has made progress in several areas since the 2008–09 crisis. The government

has targeted, and in 2011 achieved, a lower general government deficit. The NBU has succeeded in
bringing down inflation. Pension reform passed in 2011 will support medium-term fiscal adjustment.
Simplification of the tax and customs codes enacted during the last six months has the potential to
improve the business environment.
38.

However, there have also been policy slippages. The new spending in the supplementary

budget is certain, the projected higher revenue much less so. The authorities have failed to increase
gas tariffs paid by households, leading to a continued large NG deficit. The NBU’s reluctance to let
the exchange rate move deprives them of a useful tool in responding to shocks.
39.

These policy settings expose Ukraine to serious risks. The current account deficit is high,

and is projected to increase this year. There are financing risks for both the budget and the balance
of payments. Debt has fallen from its post-crisis peak, but remains high. Reserve cover remains very
low in relation to debt service. Spreads have risen. In part this is due to external developments
beyond Ukraine's control. But the deterioration in Ukraine's perceived creditworthiness also reflects
doubts about the credibility of domestic policies.
40.

In the short term, the authorities' priority should be to make sure that policies,

particularly fiscal policy, provide strong support for domestic and external stability. The
authorities are determined to meet the general government deficit target of 1.8 percent of GDP. But
they are depending heavily on better revenue collection to achieve this target. The authorities stress
their willingness to adopt new measures if it seems that the target will not be met. However, they
have not specified contingency measures. High financing needs, the difficulty of putting in place
new measures quickly, and the approaching parliamentary elections all argue for clear and credible
advance planning.
41.

Monetary and exchange rate policies also need to be more supportive. Monetary policy

has been relatively strong, but has been subordinated to a policy of keeping the exchange rate

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

stable. Staff continues to believe that gradual increases in exchange rate flexibility would make
Ukraine more resilient in the face of fragile domestic confidence and possible external shocks,
whether from reduced demand for Ukraine's exports or shortfalls in financing. Increased exchange
rate flexibility should be supported by fiscal, monetary, and wage policies consistent with
maintenance of price stability. The authorities will face a difficult few months, with financing needs
high and confidence fragile. They should set policies to reduce risks, and prepare contingency plans
in case they materialize. Ukraine maintains two multiple currency practices as described in the
Informational Annex. Staff does not recommend approval of those MCPs and encourage the
authorities to eliminate them as soon as feasible.
42.

It will also be important to resolve problems in the banking sector. High levels of NPLs

are present in the banking system, many banks still rely heavily on liquidity support from the NBU
(and face external deleveraging pressures), balance sheets remain exposed to currency movements,
and a plethora of banks, some of which reportedly have significant connected lending, pose
governance problems. If not addressed, the banking system will be hindered from providing a
supporting role for economic growth—capital could be eroded and risks to stability could reemerge. The crisis-era resolution setting rules on the calculation of foreign exchange positions
leaves banks exposed to currency fluctuations should be unwound as soon as possible, as it leaves
the banks exposed and inhibits exchange rate flexibility. Some use of fx-linked bonds could help in
this process, but the authorities should avoid exposing the government balance sheet to greatly
increased foreign exchange risks. The authorities also need to unwind another crisis era resolution
supplying emergency liquidity. In doing so, they should avoid excessive liquidity creation and
provide any new liquidity support only to solvent banks.
43.

Comprehensive reform of the energy sector is needed. Low prices paid by households for

gas and heating result in high consumption and heavy losses for NG, and ultimately for Ukrainian
taxpayers. The authorities' goal is energy independence, but they shrink from significant increases in
the prices paid by domestic consumers. Such increases are an essential component of any strategy
to bring supply and demand into balance at a lower level, alongside increased investment in
domestic energy production, improved energy efficiency, and targeted subsidies to help the poorest
households.
44.

Over the medium term, Ukraine is at risk of getting stuck in a low growth equilibrium.

An aging population and financing constraints mean that neither growth in the labor force nor
greatly increased investment is likely to be a source of strong growth. This puts a premium on
improvements in productivity. The President's Economic Reform Program contains many initiatives
which are designed to support this, but much will depend on their implementation. There is also a

disjunction between the authorities' plans to improve the business environment and the business
community's view that they are more exposed to fiscal pressure and selective decisions by officials.

It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation with Ukraine be held on a

12-month cycle.

Box 2. Ukraine: 2008 Article IV Consultation: Key Recommendations and Actions Taken
Soon after the conclusion of the 2008 Article IV consultation Ukraine was engulfed by the global financial crisis
and entered into a program relationship with the Fund. As circumstances drastically changed, several
recommendations became less or no longer relevant, in particular those related to short-term macroeconomic
management. Staff policy advice was adjusted accordingly as reflected in program documents. Structural reforms
remained largely valid and progress has been mixed.



Fiscal recommendations. Fiscal restraint (deficit at or below 2 percent of GDP); strengthen fiscal
framework (broaden fiscal coverage; adopt medium-term fiscal framework).



Progress: In 2009 (when GDP fell 15 percent), the Fund adjusted its fiscal stance advice and encouraged
greater protection of the poorest. The general government deficit widened to 6¼ percent of GDP, and
narrowed to 2¾ percent of GDP by 2011. Some progress has been achieved in strengthening the fiscal
framework. A medium-term budget was adopted this year as required by a new budget code. However,
off-budget expenditures have continued (including significant guarantees).



Monetary/exchange rate recommendations. Shift to a flexible exchange rate regime, and ultimately to
inflation targeting anchor.



Progress: During the global financial crisis the authorities devalued the hryvnia. An opportunity was
missed to adopt a more flexible exchange rate regime and the hryvnia was eventually re-pegged. The
NBU has continued technical preparations for adopting inflation targeting, including by strengthening its
forecasting and modeling capabilities.



Financial sector recommendations. Strengthen banking sector risk management and oversight, including
consolidated supervision, transparency of ownership, and intensified supervision.



Progress: The banking system nearly collapsed in 2009. Since then, banks have been recapitalized twice
(and others liquidated or nationalized). As confidence returned the banking system regained deposits.
The legal framework has been strengthened. However, implementation of some of these measures is still
pending.



Structural reform recommendations. Energy sector reform; tax system reform (VAT administration, broader
base; rate reductions); financial sector development.



Progress: Domestic gas prices for the industry and budgetary institutions are in line with import prices
and adjusted regularly. Domestic prices for households and heating companies have been increased on
two occasions but the increases have not offset the depreciation of the hryvnia and higher import prices.
VAT administration has remained problematic with refund arrears recurrently accumulating.

1/ Gross debt of general government (including guarantees) and of monetary authorities.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal
exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

5/ Defined as the sum of current account deficit, amortization on medium- and long-term debt, short-term debt at end of previous period, and other net capital outflows (mainly reflecting
residents' conversion of hryvnia cash to foreign currency held outside the banking system). Excludes IMF transactions.
6/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP)
remain at their levels of the last projection year.

2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar
terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e >
0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.

1/ The frontier represents the implicit output level that could be obtained if a country were to employ all its resources efficiently
(IMF Working Paper 06/167).
2/ Initial capital stock in 1994 calculated as twice nominal output in 1994. Evolves with U.S. dollar-based real gross fixed capital
formation with 2005 base year and assumes a depreciation rate of 9 percent.
3/ Measures how closely (in percent) a country operates to the global production possibilities frontier.
4/ Calculated as the normalized average of five indices from the World Bank Governance Database: rule of law, political stability and
absence of violence, control of corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and voice and accountability.
5/ Ranked from worst to best with the worst receiving a ranking of "1." Data corresponds to 2007 and 2012 publications.
6/ Formerly, "Closing a Business."
7/ Score indicates the perceived level of public-sector corruption. A high score corresponds to a low perception of corruption.

Annex I. Ukraine: Exchange Rate, External Sustainability, and Competitiveness
Over the years, the Fund has recommended shifting from a peg to the U.S. dollar to a more
flexible exchange rate with a view to gaining better control over inflation, facilitating adjustment to
external shocks, and discouraging dollarization and excessive risk taking by unhedged borrowers.
In the past, large inflation differentials vis-à-vis main trading partners led to overvaluation of
the real effective exchange rate (REER), eroding competitiveness. Between 2004 and 2008,
Ukraine’s real effective exchange rate appreciated by over 40 percent—with inflation at times
exceeding that of the main trading partners by 20–30 percent—increasingly pushing the trade
balance into the red, notwithstanding high international demand for traditional exports. In 2009, a
nominal exchange rate devaluation, forced by external shock, compressed imports and boosted
competitiveness. Since then, there has been some appreciation of the REER.
Staff assessment of the exchange rate suggests the hryvnia is now slightly overvalued. An
assessment of the real effective exchange rate based on standard CGER-type methodologies
suggest that the exchange rate is slightly more overvalued relative to September 2011.1 Of the three
approaches, two yield estimates of overvaluation in the range of 8 and 13 percent. The
macroeconomic balance method suggests a moderate overvaluation, implying that the REER needs
to depreciate by 13 percent to close the gap between the underlying current account balance (CAB)
and an estimated equilibrium CAB. The external sustainability method also points to an
overvaluation, implying that an REER adjustment of 8.3 percent would be needed to close the gap
between the underlying CAB and the balance that would stabilize Ukraine’s NFA position at around 28 percent of GDP. The equilibrium real
exchange rate method estimates on the other

UKRAINE

Ukraine’s wage competitiveness is eroding and risks are aggravated by the unattractive
business environment. Ukraine’s low nominal wages still appear to be consistent with its low total
labor productivity, but competitiveness will be eroded if wage pressures are not abated. Productivity
growth has been somewhat slower than in other European countries, in part due to the poor quality
of capital stock and limited technological advancement. This, coupled with Ukraine’s poor
performance in cross-country rankings of business environment indicators, undermines overall
competitiveness and attractiveness of the economy for inward foreign direct investment and further
technological progress. As a result, Ukraine’s penetration in global export markets has been well
below that of other countries in the region.

Ukraine’s vulnerability remains elevated with limited policy buffers. Gross reserves fell to
around $31 billion in January 2012—from a peak of $38 billion in May 2011—and are expected to
fall to $24 billion (40 percent of short-term debt) by end-2012, driven by Fund repurchases, low
bank rollovers, additional household fx withdrawals, and constrained sovereign market access.
Ukraine scores poorly in cross-country comparisons of reserve adequacy per the new metric—
assessing liquid reserve needs based on a combined measure of a country’s exposure to external
liabilities, current account variables (export earnings) and risks of potential capital flight (broad
money) based on experience of past crisis—and has particularly poor coverage of short-term debt.2

2

An event study shows that, during periods of exchange market pressure, EM countries with higher reserve holdings
were more able to maintain more stable consumption growth (relative to the pre-event trend) than those with lower
reserve levels. They were also more able to expand fiscal policy to help offset the effects of the crisis, whereas low
levels of reserves were associated with procyclical fiscal contraction. In both cases the effects were more apparent in
moving from low to moderate levels of reserves than in moving from moderate to high levels.

Annex II. Energy Sector: Economic Costs and Policy Reform
I.

Background

Naftogaz (NG) dominates Ukraine’s gas sector. This State-owned holding company is composed
of several subsidiaries specializing in oil and gas exploration, production, import, storage, transit,
and distribution:


Exploration and production. Chronic underinvestment has hampered NG’s natural gas
production in recent years—currently down to 16 from 20 bcm per annum in past years.
Appropriate investment levels would permit Ukraine to tap into about 1.1 trillion cubic
meters of proven gas reserves, eliminating the need to import gas.



Importing gas from Russia. Being one of the most energy-intensive countries in Europe,
Ukraine imports about two thirds of its annually consumed gas from Russia. A contract
signed in early 2010 with Gazprom links the price of gas to a nine-month backward looking
moving average of oil prices, and offers a 30-percent discount over the price implied by the
contract’s formula.



Transiting gas to Europe. NG manages the system of pipelines and storage that transits
about 100–110 bcm of Russian gas to western and central Europe—making Ukraine the
most important transit country for Russian gas. As compensation, NG receives a transit fee
based on volume of gas transported, gas import prices, and distance.



Domestic gas distribution. NG supplies gas to: (i) industries—one third of the domestic
market; (ii) households—another third of the market; (iii) budgetary institutions; and
(iv) utility companies—including district heating companies which use gas as one of their
main inputs in producing heat for households. Some gas is also consumed in the production
process and some is lost (technical losses).

Gas prices paid by households and district heating companies are far below rising import
prices, weighing on NG’s finances. Years of gas import subsidies from Russia were terminated
in 2006 when Ukraine’s import prices were raised close to European levels. Domestic prices for
industrial users have been adjusted to import parity while those for households and utilities remain
regulated. Despite several rounds of increases, prices for households and heating companies remain
among the lowest in Europe and create losses for NG, together on average about one quarter of
import prices.

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

End-user household heating tariffs also fall short of production costs. District heating
companies receive subsidies from the government in addition to already paying below import prices
for gas from NG.
II.

Economic Costs

NG carries out large quasi-fiscal activities. Defined as operations carried out by NG that have a
direct impact on the company’s financial position and would not prevail without government
intervention, these activities result from:

In 2011, NG’s economic cost was almost 5 percent of GDP. In recent years, gas transit revenues
have not fully offset these costs from quasi-fiscal activities. As a result, NG suffered deficits of
1.7 and 1.5 percent of GDP in 2010 and 2011, undermining its financial viability.
The below cost pricing policy has had several adverse implications:

Reliance on government support. An unsustainable pricing structure coupled with poor
global market conditions has left NG without market access. Instead NG relies on
government support, including direct cash transfers, recapitalization bonds, tax offsets, and
a government guarantee that enabled restructuring of NG’s external liabilities in 2009.2



Underinvestment. Running large deficits, NG has had to cut back on investments, which are
critically important given the capital intensive nature of NG’s activities in exploration,
production, transport and distribution of gas.



High energy consumption.



Arbitrage across industries (paying import prices) and households (paying below-import

III.

Policy Reforms

Reducing economic costs will require large domestic gas and heating tariff adjustments. At
the outset of a Fund-supported program, prices received by NG from households and utilities were
increased by 50 percent in July 2010, with pass-through to end-user heating prices in January 2011.
However, NG’s finances have since deteriorated substantially reflecting rising gas import prices and
postponement of further domestic gas price hikes. The President’s Economic Reform Committee
reform program recognizes the challenges posed by the current gas and heating pricing policies.
However, the authorities advocate a very gradual pace of adjustment.

2

A combined deficit target for the general government and Naftogaz was introduced under the program supported
by an SBA to capture all the financial support provided by the government.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

A new centralized and independent regulator is gradually assuming the responsibility of
overseeing the tariff-setting mechanism. During the transition, the National Energy Regulatory
Commission is setting the gas tariffs and the National Commission for Utility Regulation is setting
the household heating tariffs.
Broader reforms to modernize the gas sector are also advancing. These are important for
enhancing energy efficiency and ensuring efficient and reliable gas delivery to Ukraine and Europe.
The protocol for Ukraine’s accession to the Energy Community Treaty (ECT) was signed in the fall of
2011, following the adoption of the gas sector law during the summer (which included provisions for
restructuring NG). In 2012 a law permitting the unbundling of Naftogaz entities was another key
step in fulfilling ECT requirements, although privatization is still prohibited. Further efforts are being
made to speed up progress on pilot projects for modernization of the gas transit and distribution
system with the assistance of the EBRD and EIB, and also to join the EITI.

Annex III. Financial Sector Developments and Challenges
This annex looks at the emergence of Ukraine’s banking crisis and the policy response and highlights
some key near-term challenges facing the sector and policymakers, including: deleveraging, high
nonperforming loans, currency mismatches, and withdrawal of longer term liquidity support granted
during the crisis. It concludes with an assessment of banks’ relative financial soundness.
In the years leading up to the 2008/9 financial crisis, bank lending in Ukraine grew at a very
rapid pace. Credit growth peaked in 2005–07 at an average of 70 percent per annum and the loanto-GDP ratio surged to nearly 80 percent of GDP by end-2008.

The credit boom exacerbated vulnerabilities, many of which were discussed in the context of
the 2008 FSAP (Box A1). Household and corporate
sector debt grew rapidly, but banks’ risk management
and lending standards, and supervisory oversight did
not keep pace. Credit risks rose from real estate prices
that surged well past levels in countries with
comparable income levels and from currency
mismatches on borrowers’ balance sheets from
pervasive foreign-currency lending. Banks’ liquidity risk
deepened as loan-to-deposit ratios approached
230 percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box A1: Key recommendations of the 2008 FSAP
The 2008 FSAP focused on financial system stability, contingency planning, and capital market development.
The authorities were encouraged to address risks related to balance sheet currency mismatches and growing
credit risk, closely monitor liquidity risk management, deepen consolidated supervision and cooperation, and
increase disclosure standards and transparency practices. This was to be undertaken in the context of a
transition to a more flexible exchange rate regime and supportive monetary policy framework. The
authorities were also encouraged to enhance contingency planning, strengthen the bank resolution
framework, and facilitate mergers and acquisitions. Other recommendations were made regarding capital
market development and the securities market.

In late 2008, Ukraine was hit by a banking crisis. Weakened confidence in Ukraine’s policies and
concerns about banks’ ability to roll over existing credit lines set off a deposit run that quickly
developed into a full-blown banking crisis. As depositors fled (resulting in a 20 percent drop in the
depositor base) they also abandoned the hryvnia, triggering a currency crisis. Bank lending froze
(-2 percent nominal credit growth in 2009), NPLs rose rapidly, and bank profitability plummeted as
banks increased their capital buffers and provisioned against loan losses.

The initial focus was on containing the crisis. The Fund (backed by a CIDA technical assistance
grant) worked closely with the authorities and the World Bank, initially to stabilize the system
through anti-crisis measures, and then on rehabilitation and strengthening banks and the
institutional framework, and reducing vulnerabilities (Box A2). Two rounds of recapitalization have
raised capital adequacy ratios to their current level of about 18 percent—well above the statutory
minimum of 10 percent (Table 7)—thus providing some buffer against any further losses.

Box A2: 2008/9 Crisis Response
Emergency liquidity support (“stabilization loans”) was granted by the NBU to banks, peaking at about
UAH 85 billion (about 8 percent of GDP).
Deposit guarantees were expanded to cover nearly all household deposits. The Deposit Insurance Fund
provided about UAH 4 billion (0.3 percent of GDP) in reimbursements. Limits were imposed on early
withdrawal of time deposits.
Crisis management and bank resolution procedures were strengthened. A Crisis Management Unit was
created within the NBU to deal with bank resolution issues. A Recapitalization Board composed of
senior government officials was established to decide on government participation in the
capitalization of individual systemic banks.
Removal of weak banks. The legal framework to resolve banks was amended to facilitate more prompt
and cost-effective bank resolution. Several systemic and many smaller banks were intervened. Of the
184 banks operating before the crisis, 28 banks had temporary administrators appointed and 20 went
into liquidation.
Recapitalization. Diagnostic tests in 2009 and 2010 identified 61 private banks with capital shortfalls
totaling about UAH 30 billion (2.8 percent of GDP). This was covered by raising additional capital and
reducing credit exposures. The government provided about UAH 40 billion (4.0 percent of GDP) in
additional recapitalization funds.
Regulatory measures. (1) In early 2009, the NBU revised (via “Resolution 109”) banks’ fx net open
position calculation by removing loan loss provisions against fx loans from the statutory calculation.
This forced banks to sell fx to comply with the new resolution, which in turn eased pressure on the
exchange rate, but also pushed most banks short in economic terms (the banking system is currently
about US$8 billion short). (2) A ban on fx lending to unhedged borrowers was put in place.

The focus has gradually shifted towards strengthening the legal and regulatory framework,
and the contingency framework. Several important laws have been passed to strengthen
supervision (consolidated supervision law), transparency (ultimate controllers law), and the
resolution framework—implementing regulations for all three will be finalized during 2012.Under
the revised resolution framework, responsibility for administering intervened banks has been shifted
to the Deposit Guarantee Fund, which will allow the NBU to focus more squarely on its core
mandate. The NBU is reviewing their emergency liquidity assistance and refinancing operation
frameworks to allow longer maturities in some circumstances (while retaining strong collateral,
solvency, and monitoring conditions, as needed). Given their experience in during the 2008/9
banking crisis, Ukraine could quickly re-activate other crisis response functions, if needed.
Despite progress made, Ukraine’s financial soundness indicators, and credit growth, remain
comparatively weak. Ukraine is one of the more vulnerable countries with respect to NPL and loanto-deposit positions (and spreads), and real credit growth has been negative.

Key challenges. There are a range of challenges
inhibiting banks from reviving lending and providing
a more supportive role for growth, including: risks of
macroeconomic instability, a weak legal framework,
lack of stable long-term funding, and still-weakened
bank balance sheets. The focus here is on four
specific near-term challenges: deleveraging, high
NPLs, currency mismatches, and unwinding longterm liquidity support (stabilization loans).1
Deleveraging. The foreign banking presence in
Ukraine is smaller than in many peer countries (about
40 percent of Ukraine’s banking system is foreign
owned; about 22 percent by euro area banks).
Nonetheless, the drop in external funding has been
significant, and has dampened banks’ capacity to
lend (despite some increase in deposits). External debt of banks fell 35 percent between end-2008 to
end-2011 to US$25 billion) and BIS figures indicate significant reductions in foreign claims on
Ukraine. Bank balance sheets continue to grow (with loans to corporates increasing), but at a slower

There are a range of other important reform issues not discussed here, including a need to facilitate mergers and
acquisitions and strengthening the derivatives framework.

pace than nominal GDP (banks are relying relatively more on local deposits to reduce still-high loanto-deposit ratios). Overall nominal credit growth is in single digits (fx-denominated loans continue
to fall, driven by the ban on fx loans to unhedged borrowers, which has contributed to an overall
drop in retail loans). Deleveraging is expected to continue to weigh on bank balance sheets, with
foreign financing to Ukraine’s banking system is expected to continue to fall. The NBU has
expressed interest in participating in Vienna 2.0, which could provide a platform for mitigating
deleveraging pressures, and better cross-border coordination.

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Reducing NPLs. The crisis pushed NPLs and loan loss provisions (LLPs) into a steep upward trend.
By end-April 2012, NPLs (doubtful and loss items) appeared to have stabilized at around 15 percent
of total loans (or around 40 percent if including “substandard” loans). A comparison against past
crisis cases suggests Ukraine is lagging in terms of bringing down NPL levels at this stage of the
post-crisis cycle (though contemporaneously better than some peers). NPLs are concentrated
among enterprises, though household mortgages have also contributed. These high levels of NPLs
are weighing heavily on bank balance sheets and profitability, and the lack of incentives to write-off
loans could be dampening full realization of the extent of bad loans (some analysts have noted that
current levels of LLPs may be insufficient). The NBU and the Government have taken some measures
to help cleanse NPLs from the banks’ balance sheets by providing tax relief for loss provisions and
write-offs, the latter of which totaled to UAH 33 billion (about 4 percent of loans) during the past 16
months. A new regulation bringing asset classification and loan loss provisioning rules closer to
international best practices was approved, but further tax, legal, and regulatory measures are
needed. Where banks report high ratios of restructured loans (or other risk factors), independent
assessments may be useful. Other steps should include further strengthening of creditors’ rights,
and tax measures to facilitate write-offs (e.g., clarify tax consequences of writing off fully provisioned
loans, establishing fair value of NPL sales for tax purposes, tax treatment of accrued but unpaid
(suspended) interest on overdue loans, and VAT on resale of repossessed collateral).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UKRAINE

Reducing currency mismatches. In early 2009, the NBU redefined (via ‘Resolution 109’) the
coverage of banks’ net open fx positions by instructing banks to exclude fx LLPs against fx loans
from the calculation. This created a sudden increase of long (or a decrease of short) fx positions that
compelled the banks to sell fx in the market against UAH. The overall short position of the banking
system (from an economic perspective) is currently estimated at about US$8 billion, or about
6 percent of system assets. This leaves banks exposed to movements in the exchange rate, with
implications for capital adequacy through devaluation losses and possible increases in NPLs and
provisioning (banks remain exposed to exchange rate movements from fx lending to unhedged
borrowers). The NBU is moving forward with a pilot program for unwinding this policy that has
included the parallel sale of government fx-indexed bonds. The impact on the exchange rate or fx
reserves (and bank liquidity) from unwinding this resolution is an important consideration, though
the magnitude is contingent on the mix of adjustment chosen by banks. Overall, stress tests suggest
that existing banking system capital buffers could absorb a modest exchange rate depreciation,
though some individual banks could require additional capital.
Unwinding Longer Term Liquidity Support (Stabilization Loans). The stock of stabilization loans
has fallen from a peak of about UAH85 billion shortly after the onset of the crisis, to around UAH60
billion. These loans are scheduled to be paid down in roughly equally distributed amounts over the
next four years, though some of these loans may be only partially recoverable (e.g., those to stateintervened banks). These repayments, combined with liquidity needs from unwinding Resolution 109
(and deleveraging), present liquidity management challenges for banks and the NBU. It is likely that

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

the NBU will need to provide liquidity support, to banks determined to be solvent, in the context of
unwinding these crisis era policies and as term external funding is withdrawn. In this context, the
authorities are reviewing their refinancing window, with an eye towards extending maturities out
towards 365 days, and are considering some smoothing payments of stabilization loans under
strengthened collateral conditions.
Assessment of Ukrainian Banks’ Financial Soundness. To assess the health of the banking system,
staff compiled a financial soundness indicators (FSI) index using bank-by-bank data. The results
suggest that while the large majority of banks currently have adequate indicators, there is a need for
close monitoring and assessment of some banks. Such indicators (with established thresholds that
could trigger supervisory actions) provide useful ‘early warning indicators’ for bank monitoring
purposes.
Technical note on FSI Index. Six vulnerability indicators were normalized and then compiled into an
index, drawing from NBU data
for 2011. In addition to
standard CAMEL indicators, we
add an additional indicator for
stabilization loans. Liquidity
support (LS) = Refinancing
loan as percent of deposits.
Capital adequacy ratio (CAR) =
Capital/risk weighted assets.
NPLs net of provisions/total
loans (NPL) = (Broad NPLsprovisions)/(total loans).
Liquidity (LIQ) = (Liquid
assets)/deposits. Return on assets (ROA) = Net profit (loss)/(total assets). Fx Risk (FX) = Net fx
exposure/capital where net fx exposure = gross fx assets – gross fx liabilities. The index was
constructed using differential weights, based on literature and judgment and statistical
normalization. The FSI Index = 0.15*LS + 0.20*CAR + 0.20*NPL + 0.10*LIQ + 0.28*ROA + 0.07*FX.
Before aggregation into the index, the individual FSIs are normalized (statistical normalization was
used, consisting of expressing all values in standard deviation, where FSIs’ averages are equal to

zero), to avoid one indicator from skewing the aggregated index, or having overly important impact
on variation, as they do not have the same unit or variation). The use of equal weights and different
normalization techniques did not alter the results significantly.

Annex IV. Spillovers and Risks
In the event of a major external shock, Ukraine—a relatively open country—would be hit through
trade and financial spillover channels. Analysis of a potential intensification of the crisis in the euro
area (EA) suggests that Ukraine could be significantly affected. Russia would play a significant role in
transmitting such a shock to Ukraine given close linkages—and could act as an accelerator or brake
(e.g., if higher oil prices are sustained). In response to a major shock, some conventional policy
responses may have limited effectiveness, and additional measures (e.g., capital controls and bank
holidays) may need to be considered to achieve initial stability.

Trade channel. This is an important channel. Ukraine exports about 50 percent of GDP ($75bn),
putting it at the median of Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. The EU and Russia
dominate bilateral trade links. Ukraine’s high concentration of commodity exports—chemicals,
agriculture, metals, minerals, and timber account for about (60%) of all goods exports—makes it
vulnerable to global (including non-trading partner) growth swings, through effects on commodity
prices. The importance of this channel was evident during the 2008/9 crisis, when deterioration in
terms of trade and drops in trading partners’ (and global commodity) demand resulted in a
significant reduction in export volumes and values. However, imports fell at a faster pace (dragged
down deeper by steep drops in domestic demand), resulting in a positive net export contribution to
GDP (this stood in contrast to the EA, where the drop in exports exceeded imports).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Financial Spillover Channels. Ukraine’s financial openness is above peer average, with the EU and
Russia as important sources of financing. Much of this exposure is in the corporate and household
sectors. Banking exposure is lower than in many peer countries, but still significant. Other linkages,
such as remittances, are relatively small.

Banking channel. Ukraine’s banking sector exposure to the EA is low by regional standards (table),
but still large enough to pose risks. 25 percent of assets are controlled by EA banks, which is
significant as a percent of Ukraine’s GDP and gross reserves. Russian banks own another 11 percent
of system assets (EA periphery banks have a minor presence in Ukraine). Ukraine has already

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

witnessed significant deleveraging since 2008, with external bank debt dropping about 35 percent
between end-2008 and end-2011, down to about 15 percent of GDP. BIS data paint a similar story.
This exposure could be reduced further for reasons such as heightened risk aversion or a need for
dollars (most lending by European banks to Ukrainian banks is in dollars). Loan-to-deposit ratios
also remain high among EA subsidiaries in Ukraine, providing an additional incentive to deleverage.
During the 2008–09 crisis, foreign ownership of local banking systems was a source of strength in
many CEE countries. In Ukraine, many parent banks agreed to recapitalize their subsidiaries in the
context of two rounds of diagnostic tests (total bank-related FDI in 2009–10 was in the range of
US$4.5 billion. But many European banks with exposure to Ukraine are now in a weaker financial
position than in 2008–09.

Foreign Direct Investment. EA countries are an important source of FDI (Chart). Ukraine has
received around 4 percent of GDP in FDI annually in recent years (US$6 billion in 2010), and has a
stock of FDI of about US$52 billion. About 70 percent of inward FDI is sourced from the EA.
However, a significant portion of this (31 percent of overall) is from Cyprus, much of which is
reportedly round-trip investments from Ukraine, or possibly Russia. Should external conditions

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UKRAINE

worsen, Ukraine could see reduced amounts of FDI (and may be more vulnerable to reductions in
FDI than its peers, given its weaker investment climate).

Remittances. The euro area and Russia are important sources of remittances, but overall amounts
are small, and have been relatively stable. Ukraine receives about USD6 billion annually in
remittances: 41 percent from the EU (32 percent from the EA), 27 percent from Russia, and
12 percent from the U.S. Annual flows have been fairly steady (between US$4 and 7 billion).
Other Capital flows. Shocks emanating from the EA could dampen external and domestic
confidence and lead to capital outflows or lower rollovers for corporates and sovereigns, and trade
finance could decline. Households’ confidence in the banking sector is skittish based on experience
in past crises, and tensions (inflation, market turbulence, threat of depreciation, political and
economic shocks in neighboring countries) can quickly lead to fx savings withdrawals by
households, as seen in 2008–09, and again in the second half of 2011. However, in contrast to many
other EM countries, foreigners have little domestic presence in Ukraine’s local t-bills. Foreign
investors own less than 5 percent of local government paper in Ukraine (less than US$0.6 billion).

62

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Asset valuations. Ukraine could also take losses on the value of EA-originated assets, though
Ukrainian banks’ foreign assets are mostly in the form of currency and deposits. About 45 percent of
bank foreign assets ($3.5 billion, or 3 percent of total assets of the Ukrainian banking sector) are
held in the EA, which is roughly equally split between dollars and euros. Ukrainian direct portfolio
investment (both equity and debt securities) in the EA is negligible.1
Financing risks. Ukraine’s high overall gross external financing requirements, combined with high
investor risk perceptions towards Ukraine, leave it vulnerable to shifts in market confidence and risk
aversion. Cross-country data on GEFR-to-reserves indicate that Ukraine is well-above EM medians
(chart). Any reduction of external financing would put significant pressure on reserves and the
exchange rate that could have severe repercussions. Ukraine’s sensitivity to global risk perceptions
can be seen in the high correlation of Ukraine’s EMBI spreads relative to the VIX, a widely used
measure of market risk (correlation between Ukraine’s EBMI spreads and the VIX is about 0.75).

Implications for growth (VAR analysis). A VAR analysis helps to quantify the possible impact of a
EA shock. We find strong co-movement between real GDPs of the EA and Ukraine (and Russia and
Ukraine) in response to a shock to EA real GDP. A one-percent shock to EA real GDP brings a
significant impact on Ukraine, peaking after 4
quarters.2 A VAR analysis (not shown) also
indicates that a shock to Russian GDP has a
significant impact on Ukraine(which can also be
interpreted as the part of the EA effect that is
transmitted through Russia). This reinforces
common perceptions of the importance of
developments in the Russian economy in
Ukraine. It also suggests that were Russia to be
supported by higher oil prices, it could act as a
brake against some of the spillovers from a EA
shock.

2

The impulse-response function is identified using Cholesky decomposition, imposing a recursive causal structure
from the top variables to the bottom variables. This implies, for example, that a shock to Russia’s GDP will have a
contemporaneous effect on GDPs of Ukraine but the effect on oil prices and euro area GDP will emerge with a lag. All
variables are measured in log, and the model is estimated using two lags (k=2). The analytical results are robust to
alternative specifications, including different ordering in the Choleski decomposition, estimation over the sample
period before the 2008 crisis, and the addition of U.S. GDP. The responses are statistically significant for about four
quarters, and a similar pattern is also found in the regression with the pre-crisis sample (2001:Q1–2008:Q2).

Policy implications. A look at proposed policy responses suggests some limits to first round
defenses (if other countries in the region react to a common external shock with, for example,
depreciation, and interest rate defense). Additional steps may be needed, depending on
circumstances (e.g., including capital controls, deposit freezes, and stronger cross-country
collaboration (e.g., Vienna 2) to achieve initial stability.

Expected Impact and Transmission Channel if Shock is Realized

 Ukraine exports about 50 percent of GDP, with bilateral trade links dominated by EU and
Russia. Commodity exports (chemical, agriculture, metals, minerals and timber ) account
for about 60 percent of exports). In 2009, Ukraine suffered a 40 percent decline in
nominal goods exports and a 15 percent drop in real GDP.

 Euro area and Russian banks own about 24 and 11 percent, respectively, of Ukraine’s

financial system and gross external financing requirements are large (about 40 percent
of GDP). The sovereign has limited access to financial markets and spreads are high and
composition is shifting towards shorter maturities. Higher funding cost would
exacerbate external financing tensions, and lead to exchange rate pressures.

 Higher-than-expected fiscal multipliers could lead to a sharper downturn, making it
more difficult to meet consolidation targets.

 EA sudden loss of investor confidence could push up yields or dampen financing.
 Insufficient energy and social reform may keep growth low for a protracted period,
undermine fiscal consolidation.

3. Banks’ and corporates’ asset

 Global liquidity shortage, contaminate bank and corporate balance sheets by slowing

down rollovers, exacerbating currency mismatches, or trigger foreign cash withdrawal.
Possible shortages of collateral could elevate funding pressures. NPLs could ncrease
due to recession, especially from the SOE sector. This would weaken banks’ capital
base and corporate balance sheets.

 The banking system is increasingly exposed to the sovereign (which has limited market
funding options), including through the purchase of fx-linked bonds. Further policy
slippages risks deposits and fx cash withdrawal, crowding out private credit,
depressing activity and creating more NPLs. Higher interest rates and shorter rollovers
would exacerbate the crunch and hurt growth further.

 Bank recapitalization needs may be difficult to source from market and may trigger
contingent liabilities from possible government guarantees of bank debt.

4. Oil/ Energy price surge

•

Geopolitical instability could
trigger an oil/gas price

 Higher oil/gas prices would increase import bills adding to balance of payment

pressures and resulting inflationary pressures could undermine confidence in domestic
currency and would erode purchasing powers.

Annex V. Household Utilities: Social Assistance Reform
Social assistance programs for household utilities are poorly targeted. Of the total utilities’
social assistance budget (0.3 percent of GDP), about 30 percent is distributed to wealthy households
while the poorest households receive less than 8 percent. In 2010, the average transfer value per
capita to the wealthiest quintile of households (UAH 1,200) was UAH 500 higher than for the
poorest quintile.
Targeting preferential categories of citizens and significant use of benefits over subsidies has
skewed the system towards the wealthy. The current system of benefits and subsidies aims to
provide advantages for special categories of
people (e.g. war veterans, Chernobyl victims) and
citizens engaged in socially important professions
or with certain social attributes (e.g., age, health or
social status). Consequently, gas benefits are
received by 20 percent of households,
predominantly going to wealthier households. In
contrast, gas subsidies based on household
income levels cover only 5 percent of households
but even there governance challenges have
resulted in high income earners receiving higher
average per capita transfers than those with lower
income.
The poorly targeted nature of these programs
harms their ability to reduce poverty. About 85
percent of individuals below the poverty line do
not receive any transfers for household utilities.
Cost-benefit analysis suggests that only 5–
12 cents on the dollar spent in social assistance
programs for household utilities go toward
reducing the poverty gap (hryvnia equivalent
needed to bring all poor to just above the
poverty line).

Transitioning to a well-targeted social assistance system will be essential as end-user gas and
heating tariffs rise. If efficiently distributed, the current financial envelope (defined as a fraction of
GDP) is sufficient to fully subsidize all households with a utility bill-to-income ratio above
10 percent, even once domestic tariffs reach market prices (assuming gradual increases over a
decade).

Annex VI. Ukraine: Evidence on Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism
With a de facto fixed exchange rate regime and weak liquidity management, the NBU’s foreign
currency interventions by in large determine dynamics of monetary aggregates and complicate
reaching officially announced inflation objectives.
Although Ukraine does not operate a pegged regime, a stable exchange rate has been de
facto a key policy objective since mid-1990s. The role of the exchange rate as a monetary target
goes back to mid-1996, when the NBU first
introduced a band around the U.S. dollar. Aside
from a number of short-lived periods of forced
float coupled with sizable adjustments of the
band’s width and level—primarily during 1998–
2000 and 2008–09 financial crises—the NBU has
kept the hryvnia broadly stable against the
U.S. dollar. There is a widespread view in Ukraine
that this policy helped to break away from the
hyperinflation of the early 1990s and contributed
to the stabilization after the 1998 crisis. At the
same time, it has also constrained policy flexibility: Ukraine is highly exposed to terms of trade
shocks and its domestic business cycle is strongly correlated with world commodities’ prices.
The exchange rate regime has taken a clear precedence over monetary policy targets,
complicating the NBU’s control over money supply. In the context of large (but volatile) capital
inflows and windfall gains from generally favorable terms of trade shocks, dynamics of monetary
aggregates have been largely driven by the NBU’s foreign exchange interventions. Liquidity
management operations only partially sterilized massive liquidity injections and were often
misguided by concerns over the strength of the NBU’s own balance sheet and overplayed fears of
speculative capital inflows. In this setting, the NBU found it difficult to square its exchange rate
policy with achieving its monetary and inflation objectives. In principle, the NBU’s annual Monetary
Policy Fundamentals lays out key policy targets for the monetary aggregates, inflation, and
exchange rate that should guide the NBU’s policy conduct. In practice, steering the exchange rate
within the targeted band has taken priority while other policy targets were rarely met.1 The NBU has
repeatedly failed to deliver on officially announced inflation objectives.

overnight interbank rates—which could be influenced by the NBU through its liquidity management
operations—estimated over a rolling 24-month window suggests that the pass-through has been
significant in 2000–02 and since mid-2007 to the present. The strength of the interest rate passthrough seemed to depend strongly on overall liquidity conditions. This is reflected by the response
coefficient taking larger values in periods when banks’ excess liquidity stood low and was tightly
managed (including in the context of 2008 and 2010 SBA programs). With sticky prices, changes in
nominal lending rates determined the real cost of credit and thus affected overall credit growth and
domestic demand in the economy. As an illustration, local currency credit growth peaked at about
80 percent (year-over-year) in early 2008 which coincided with historically high liquidity in the
banking system and highly negative real lending rates. The pass-through of changes in real lending
rates to credit growth seemed to break down in 2003–07 and 2010–12. The first episode is likely
driven by proliferation of foreign currency lending as during that period the average annual credit
growth of foreign currency credits to households and corporate was 160 percent and 36 percent,
respectively. The second episode is likely associated with the legal ban on foreign currency lending
to unhedged borrowers that squeezed those borrowers into local currency credits notwithstanding
rising real interest rates.
Sterilization operations failed short of what was needed and were often guided by concerns
over the strength of the NBU’s own balance sheet and fears of speculative capital inflows. To
the extent that there are significant frictions in cross border capital mobility (including due to the
presence of capital controls), the NBU could have afforded some degree of flexibility in adjusting its
policy rates in the context of its monetary policy operations, deviating from the interest rate parity.
In practice, however, the NBU has been reluctant to aggressively adjust a menu of policy rates for its
open market operations and standing facilities, directly affecting liquidity conditions and interest
rates in the interbank market with an aim to influence aggregate demand and inflation.

household wealth, and thus increase consumption. In Ukraine, however, this channel of transmission is likely to be
weak due to its low degree of financial development and limited ability of market participants to use asset wealth to
finance consumption and investment.

Despite continued remonetization of the economy, Ukraine’s inflation remained well above
that for most other regional peers and, by in large,
has been a monetary phenomenon. Empirical
evidence suggests that there was a rather strong link
between the intervention-driven fluctuations in
monetary aggregates and inflation outcome. Impulse
response functions based on a simple three-variable
vector autoregression model estimated over a sample
of monthly data from 2000–11 seem to suggest that a
one-standard deviation innovation in NBU foreign
currency interventions—which in the studied sample is
estimated to be rather large at about 4½ percent of
base money—significantly increases growth in base
money, adding (with a lag of about six/eight months)
about ½ percent to core inflation.

Large inflation differentials vis-à-vis main trading partners pushed the real exchange rate
away from levels consistent with fundamentals. Between 2004 and 2008, Ukraine’s real effective
exchange rate appreciated by over 40 percent—as at times inflation exceeded that in main trading
partners by 20–30 percent—fueling domestic demand and increasingly pushing trade balance deficit
into red, notwithstanding high international demand for its traditional exports (agricultural and steel
products). Mounting exchange rate misalignment made Ukraine vulnerable to external shocks,
making eventual nominal exchange rate correction virtually inevitable.

Furthermore, the quasi fixed exchange rate regime contributed to financial dollarization and
over-leveraging. As in many other countries in Eastern Europe, stability of the nominal exchange
rate was taken for granted and led to significant mispricing of currency risks. With borrowers
attracted by low interest rates on loans in foreign currency, FX-denominated credit to corporate and
households increased rapidly from 7 percent of GDP and 0.1 percent of GDP in 2000 to 23 percent
of GDP and 22 percent of GDP in 2008, respectively. At the same time, Ukrainian corporates and
banks with access to international capital markets have also accumulated large external liabilities
which, at the beginning of the crisis in 2008, amounted to 24 percent of GDP and 23 percent of GDP,
respectively. In this setting, a realignment of nominal exchange rate produced devastating balance
sheet effects.
To effectively implement its newly strengthened mandate of safeguarding price stability, the
NBU needs to allow greater exchange rate flexibility. In the current environment of elevated
uncertainty and external funding pressures, monetary and exchange rate policies should be more
flexible to respond swiftly to shocks, while protecting international reserves. To focus more squarely
on its main policy objective, the NBU should continue pressing ahead with foreign currency market
liberalization and increasingly allow greater exchange rate flexibility. The NBU should break away
from its current practice of frequent intervention in the interbank foreign currency market and
heavy-handed administrative measures (e.g., a mandatory ID requirement with any purchase of cash

foreign exchange). To avoid undermining confidence in the hryvnia and to safeguard private sector
balance sheets, the pace of these actions need to be carefully gauged against conditions in the
foreign currency market.
Enhancing the NBU’s liquidity management framework will be key to strengthening monetary
policy transmission. The money market is highly segmented and not effective at redistributing
liquidity across the banking system. At the same time, an overly wide spread (over 500 bps) between
deposit and lending facilities of the NBU—aggravated by less-than-automatic access to standing
facilities—encourages banks to be overly conservative in the use of reserve funds (since the cost of
running short is high) and discourages development of a well functioning interbank market. As a
result, the NBU often simultaneously lends to and absorbs from the banking system and the
interbank rate has been very volatile,
undermining transmission of monetary policy
signals to other markets and retail lending rates.
The NBU should enhance its liquidity
management framework and be more aggressive
in managing liquidity fluctuations. In this regard,
more reliable standing facilities should be made
available, with access guided by price and
availability of suitable collateral, and the
overnight rate should be brought closer to the
middle of a narrower policy rate corridor.
Monetary policy needs to become more credible and transparent. Expectations could have
considerable significance for effectiveness of monetary policy transmission: as the NBU’s ability to
deliver on its inflation objectives becomes firmly established, private sector wage and price
expectations will become more forward-looking, speeding up demand adjustment to changes in
policy stance. Anticipated policy changes will be priced into the yield curve, reducing a need for
large policy swings. Therefore, strengthening the NBU’s credibility (through safeguarding its
independence) and improving predictability of its policy actions (through greater transparency and
stronger communication) will be key to anchoring expectations and improving the effectiveness of
monetary policy.

V. Exchange Arrangements:
In September 1996, the authorities introduced the hryvnia (Hrv) at a conversion rate of karbovanets
(Krb) 100,000 to Hrv 1. The rate was initially informally pegged to the dollar. In September 1997, the
peg was replaced by a formal band of Hrv 1.7–Hrv 1.9 per U.S. dollar. The limits of the band were
moved on several occasions. Since March 19, 1999, the exchange rate for the hryvnia has been
determined by the interbank market for foreign exchange. On February 22, 2000, the NBU officially

amount of such arrears will be shown in this section.

confirmed its intention to allow the free float of the hryvnia, but intervened regularly to limit
fluctuations to a small band, first around Hrv 5.33 per U.S. dollar, and from March 2005, around
Hrv 5.05 per U.S. dollar. It was classified as a de facto peg. Reflecting greater flexibility in the
exchange rate from April 2008, the exchange rate arrangement was reclassified as a managed float
with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. As of December 29, 2008, the NBU fixed the
official exchange rate of the hryvnia against the dollar at Hrv 7.7 per U.S. dollar and resorted to
interventions with the aim of keeping the market exchange rate close to the official rate. Since 2009,
the official exchange rate has been allowed to fluctuate, but has remained close to Hrv 8.0 per
U.S. dollar. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement
had been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to
other managed arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification
methodology. The arrangement was then reclassified to a stabilized arrangement against the dollar,
effective March 1, 2010, and reconfirmed again in January 2011. The current classification of the de
jure exchange rate arrangement is characterized as a transition to a free floating exchange rate is
planned as the financial system recovers and the transmission mechanisms mature.
On September 24, 1996, Ukraine accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the
Fund’s Articles of Agreement, and two remaining restrictions were eliminated in May 1997. A
number of restrictions on current international transactions were introduced in September 1998, and
were removed in March 1999. In October 2008, a number of new exchange controls were
introduced, many of which were removed by May 2010 and the remaining ones were removed in
the context of the 2010 SBA-supported program. Ukraine currently maintains multiple currency
practices arising from (i) the use of the official exchange rate for certain government transactions,
and (ii) the requirement that a Ukrainian resident who sells the previously purchased foreign
exchange not used within 10 days (including when FX was returned to the resident because the
counterpart failed to fulfill its obligations under an import contract) shall transfer 100 percent of the
positive difference from the sale price, on a quarterly basis, to the State budget.
VI. FSAP Participation:
A joint World Bank–International Monetary Fund mission conducted an assessment of Ukraine
financial sector as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) between May 10–
24, 2002. An update mission visited Ukraine between February 18–21, 2003, and the Financial Sector
Stability Assessment (FSSA) report (IMF Country Report No. 03/340) was considered by the Executive
Board on May 14, 2003. The observance of the following standards and codes was assessed: Basel
Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision; Code of Good Practices on Transparency in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

UKRAINE

Monetary and Financial Policies; CPSS Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems;
OECD Principles for Corporate Governance; Accounting and Auditing Practices; World Bank’s
Principles and Guidelines for Effective Insolvency and Creditor Rights System; and AML/CFT
Methodology.
A further update mission visited Ukraine between June 11–22, 2007 and July 9–20, 2007. The
observance of the following standards and codes was assessed: Basel Core Principles for Effective
Banking Supervision; and IOSCO Core Principles of Securities Regulation. An updated Financial
Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) was considered by the Executive Board as part of the 2008
Article IV consultation.
VII. ROSCS
A Data ROSC Module was conducted in April 3–17, 2002, and was considered by the Executive Board
on August 5, 2003 (IMF Country Report No. 03/256). A Fiscal Transparency Module (experimental)
was issued in September 1999, and an update in April 2004 (IMF Country Report No. 04/98).
VIII. Safeguards Assessments:

The most recent safeguards assessment of the NBU was completed on February 1, 2011. The
assessment found that the NBU has strengthened its safeguards framework since the 2008
assessment by implementing the majority of the related recommendations. However, the deferred
implementation of some provisions under the new NBU law enacted in 2010 weakens its
effectiveness. The assessment also found that new financial risks have emerged because of special
legislation and resolutions impairing the NBU’s autonomy. Steps are being taken to address these
issues, including with the approval of a law repealing the requirement that bank recapitalization
bonds are subject to mandatory repurchase at their face value by the NBU.
IX. UFR/Article IV Consultation:
Ukraine is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded
on June 2, 2008 and a report was published on

No. 10/262).

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(May 2012)
Country Partnership Strategy
The World Bank Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Ukraine for the period 2012–16 was
endorsed by the Bank’s Board of Directors on February 16, 2012. The Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) 2012–16 aims to assist Ukraine in overcoming implementation bottlenecks identified in the
Presidential Program and thus help to make progress in the declared ambitious reform and EU
integration agenda. The World Bank Group will adjust its policy dialogue, lending, investment, and
technical assistance respectively to respond to the government’s demonstrated commitment.
Support of donors in building the capacity of CSOs will continue to be very important. The CPS is
organized around two pillars, both emphasizing the importance of improved governance for
sustained socio-economic progress in Ukraine. Pillar I supports deepened relations between
government and citizens, focused on improving public services, sustainability and efficiency of
public finances, and a more transparent and accountable use of public resources. Pillar II supports
more productive cooperation between government and business by focusing on growth,
competitiveness and job creation, improvements in the business climate, the promotion of domestic
investment and foreign direct investments (FDI) to achieve productivity improvements, and
channeling public investment into critical public infrastructure.
The Bank's assistance to Ukraine in the new CPS will be calibrated to match the scope and
instruments of support to the strength of the authorities' commitment, capacity and track-record in
key areas of potential engagement. Specifically, investment loans will be offered where governance
risks are manageable, where a track record of implementation has been established and capacity
has been built and where there is broad consensus on the general policy framework. Analytical and
advisory services will be offered to help strengthen reform consensus and build capacity.
Development policy lending will be contingent on demonstrated progress in tackling key
governance weaknesses and thereby on evident commitment and leadership in overcoming vested
interests to carry out a coherent reform and development strategy.
World Bank Program
The current investment lending portfolio includes eleven operations for a total amount of
US$ 1.8 billion of which 60 percent is undisbursed. Among the projects in the public sector are a
Public Finance Modernization Project (US$50 million), a State Tax Service Modernization Project
(US$40 million), and a Statistical System Modernization Project (US$32 million). In the area of rural
development, under the Rural Land Titling and Cadastre Development Project (US$89.7 million), the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

UKRAINE

Bank supports the establishment of a secure land cadastre system to enable land transactions to be
efficiently processed and protected. The Hydropower Rehabilitation Project and additional financing
(US$166.0 million) were approved in June 2005 and November 2009, respectively, and the Power
Transmission Project (US$200 million) was approved in August 2007. The Bank Board of Executive
Directors also approved a new Energy Efficiency Project (US$200 million). In infrastructure, the Bank
approved a Roads and Safety Improvement project in 2009 for US$400 million (currently under
implementation). The Bank also has an Urban Infrastructure Project (US$140 million), designed to
provide financing to local governments and utilities for priority investments in water and
wastewater. In the financial sector, the Second Export Development Project (EDP2; US$154 million
plus additional financing of US$150 million), which builds on the success of the first project,
promotes the export sector access to finance. The Bank has been supporting the modernization of
administering social benefits through a Social Assistance System Modernization project
(US$99 million) since November 2005.
The investment lending program for the first two years of the CPS envisages base level support in
the range of USD 500 million per annum. The current investment lending pipeline for FY13 includes
a follow up to the existing Roads and Safety Improvement project and an additional financing to the
State Statistical System Development project. In FY14, indicative lending includes an operation to
support scaling up targeted social assistance, a second Urban Infrastructure project and a Gas Sector
Efficiency and Modernization project. Financing amounts are still indicative and the total lending
envelope may change based on the government’s demand and the Bank’s lending capacity. In FY15–
16, additional investment lending may be envisaged in the following areas: (i) transport and trade
facilitation; (ii) energy efficiency and energy security; (iii) municipal services and governance; (iv)
health services and financing; (v) private sector development and access to financing.
The calibrated engagement strategy leaves scope for an upward revision of lending amounts
through the addition of DPLs should reforms accelerate and consistent progress on governance be
made. The Second Programmatic Financial Rehabilitation Development Policy Loan could be
delivered quickly and a new cross-sectoral DPL series (building on the earlier DPL I-III series)
supporting improved economic governance and competitiveness could be launched in FY13–15
subject to the government's request for IBRD resources, Ukraine's performance, IBRD's financial
capacity, demand from other borrowers, and global economic developments.
All areas of engagement will build on strong diagnostic work and technical assistance, with a focus
on building greater consensus in society regarding policies and processes to tackle key structural
challenges. Key focus areas for analytical and advisory assistance (AAA) engagement will be: (i) the
investment climate, including advice in key policy areas such as agriculture, land, business
regulations; (ii) fiscal, tax and PFM; (iii) energy efficiency and governance (including gas sector
modernization); (iv) financial sector stability and development; (v) municipal governance and service
delivery; (vi) social reforms (targeted social assistance and pension reform); and (vii) health sector
reforms. Partnerships in policy dialogue and AAA with the European Commission (EC), the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), United Stated Agency for International Development (USAID),

Bank-Fund Collaboration
In the October 2010 Joint Management Action Plan on Fund-Bank collaboration on Ukraine,
the staff teams agreed that the Fund and the Bank would support Ukraine’s efforts to: (i) pursue
fiscal consolidation whilst finding fiscal space to increase public investments needed to support
private sector growth and to tackle pressing social issues, (ii) move forward with energy sector and
utility tariff reforms whilst protecting the poor, (iii) complete rehabilitation and strengthen oversight
of the banking system, (iv) strengthen the monetary policy framework, and (v) improve the
investment climate. The teams agreed to the following division of labor and coordination:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX



UKRAINE

Restoring confidence and fiscal sustainability: Strengthening public finances and tackling
long-standing problems through advancing structural reforms would underpin medium-term
fiscal sustainability and growth. The Fund program and the Bank’s support are designed to
support the authorities’ efforts to lower budget deficits and to: (i) tackle key budgetary rigidities
to gradually reduce the footprint of the public sector on the economy; and (ii) support the
reallocation of resources from transfers and other current spending toward growth-enhancing
capital investments and better targeted social support. To this end, the Bank, in coordination
with the Fund, has recommended a series of structural measures to reform the pension system.
The Fund and Bank teams work closely through their programs to push the implementation of a
sequence of reforms aimed at putting the pension system on sound financial footing and
reducing its strain on public finances. In the context of administrative reforms in Ukraine, the
Bank and Fund will continue to provide advice aimed at ensuring a leaner and more efficient
public service. The Bank will continue to provide project financing for the public sector, including
a Public Finance Modernization Project, a State Tax Service IT Modernization Project, a Statistical
System Modernization Project, and the ongoing investments to modernize social assistance
services. The Bank also plans to focus on improving the efficiency of public spending. The Bank
and Fund will also coordinate on supporting the authorities’ efforts to strengthen debt
management (and extend and strengthen the domestic yield curve). An assessment of SOEs
financial reporting has been finalized by the Bank, identifying areas where financial reporting
can be strengthened to improve transparency and decision making.



Reforming and modernizing the energy sector whilst improving targeting of safety nets:
Energy sector reforms will continue to aim at improving energy efficiency of the economy,
eliminating the need for budgetary support to Naftogaz, and encouraging investment in gas
exploration, extraction, and transportation. The Bank’s support for the authorities’ energy sector
reforms will continue to focus on infrastructure modernization through a sequence of
investment loans, including in areas of hydropower rehabilitation, power and gas transmission,
and energy efficiency. In the context of the SBA, the Fund will focus on supporting efforts to
phase out Naftogaz’s deficit, including through a program of steady gas prices and utility tariff
increases to advance cost recovery and reduce fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits generated by the
company. The Bank and the Fund will continue to work together on supporting reforms that
depoliticize price-setting mechanisms of public utilities and improve payment discipline. To
improve transparency of reporting in the gas sector, the Bank will support and advise the
authorities in securing membership to the EITI. The Bank team will continue its advice on
improving targeting of social assistance to protect poor households from higher utility tariffs

and other necessary fiscal reforms. The Bank and Fund teams will work closely to support
implementation of this reform agenda.


Restoring and safeguarding banks’ soundness: Finalizing full rehabilitation of the financial
sector will facilitate the resumption of credit to the real sector and efficient credit allocation, and
thus support economic growth. In the context of the SBA and the PFRL, the Fund and the Bank
will coordinate closely in supporting the authorities’ goal of developing and implementing
restructuring strategies for the state owned banks. In this context, the Bank and Fund staff will
continue to serve as observers on the Bank Recapitalization Board. The teams will also work
closely on supporting further development of a framework that properly recognizes and
facilitates the resolution of impaired loans, including development of a strategy to pro-actively
address barriers to nonperforming loans’ effective resolution and any necessary changes to the
existing legislation and regulations, including tax treatment. The Fund and the Bank will also
coordinate in supporting legislative and regulatory reforms and implementation aiming at
strengthening consolidated supervision and enforcing ultimate controllers disclosure (following
the recent approval of the related legislation), and enhancing the bank resolution framework.
The Bank will continue its technical assistance to the Deposit Guarantee Fund (DGF) and the
NBU on bank resolution and selected banking supervision issues.



Developing a more robust monetary policy framework: Focusing monetary policy squarely
on domestic price stability with greater exchange rate flexibility under a more independent NBU
will facilitate inflation reduction, discourage dollarization and excessive risk-taking, and provide
a buffer against frequent external shocks. The Fund will lead in this area, including through
policy advice, and also by providing technical assistance on strengthening monetary policy and
operations frameworks and establishing necessary preconditions for moving toward inflation
targeting regime over the medium term. The Fund will continue to provide technical assistance
as needed for implementing the authorities’ strategy for liberalization of the foreign currency
market. It will also work with the authorities as needed on addressing remaining shortcomings in
the governance of the NBU identified in the context of the recent Safeguards Assessment.



Improving investment climate: Deep and sustained improvements of the business
environment is key for converting economic stabilization into strong and sustained economic
growth. In support of this objective, the Bank will lead in this area supporting measures and
reforms to reduce entry and exit barriers (including joint Bank-Fund work on developing a new
insolvency and corporate restructuring framework), to enable the creation of new businesses
and to allow a faster reallocation of resources in the economy. The Bank would also support

measures to improve fair competition and to overcome governance and regulatory barriers to
trade and FDI. The Fund will provide support for the authorities’ efforts as appropriate.

RELATIONS WITH THE EBRD
(May 2012)
Ukraine joined the EBRD in 1992, and since then the EBRD has been active in supporting Ukraine’s
transformation toward a market economy. As of end-April 2012, EBRD’s portfolio in Ukraine reached
€4.4 billion, most of it in the private sector. The Bank’s exposure in Ukraine is the second largest
after Russia, accounting for 1/8th of the Bank’s overall portfolio. Financial sector and industry are two
largest sectors of operations in Ukraine, accounting for 3/4th of the total operating assets.
Operations in the infrastructure and energy sectors are also significant. The EBRD’s main
contribution in Ukraine has been through funding of projects with significant transition impact
potential in the private and public sectors, including some equity investments. This has been
supported by a range of technical cooperation activities and by engaging in policy dialogue with the
government.
During the financial crisis of 2008–09, the EBRD pursued a country specific crisis response program
for Ukraine in coordination with various stakeholders, including the authorities, other IFIs and
international donors. Despite the increased country risk, in 2009 the EBRD invested €1.1 billion in
Ukraine, a record level for the country. Almost two-thirds of the total was invested in the banking
sector, helping to support stability and confidence. During the crisis, the EBRD also undertook a
complete reassessment of business needs in the corporate sector, which suffered from a terms-oftrade shock and financial sector de-leveraging, resulting in investments of over €250 million in 2009.
A further €220 million was invested in the infrastructure and energy sectors. All in all, in 2009, the
EBRD invested over €600 million in the form of equity and subordinated capital, assisting in
restructuring and strengthening of balance sheets of banks and enterprises.
The Bank’s country strategy for 2011–14 was approved in April 2011. Its focus is on addressing
Ukraine’s important transition challenges in all key sectors, including strengthening energy efficiency
and energy security; unlocking Ukraine’s agricultural and industrial potential; providing good quality
and reliable infrastructure; and dealing with the legacy of the crisis in the financial sector.
In 2011, the Bank invested over €1 billion whilst focusing its operations on the revival of the
corporate sector, in order to compensate for the absence of bank-mediated lending in Ukraine. The
Bank supported twelve projects in agribusiness, totaling €190 million and nine transactions in the
manufacturing sector totaling €228 million. In infrastructure and energy, the Bank invested €143
million with the private sector, including support for the coal recycling operations and agreed on a
€200 million sovereign loan to help modernize hydro power stations operated by Ukrhydroenergo.
In the financial sector, the Bank took equity stakes in two banks and provided significant support to
cross-border trade. The Bank also engaged in policy dialogue on support and modernization in the
agribusiness sector; restructuring of and reorganization of state owned enterprises (including
Ukrainian Railways, Ukrenergo and NAK Naftogaz); and local currency capital market development.
In cooperation with other IFIs and business association, the Bank has worked to enhance business

environment in Ukraine including by taking an active role in the Domestic and Foreign Investors
Advisory Council established by the President of Ukraine.
Over the years, the Bank has been active in developing of the local private sector and encouraging
FDI. The Bank has supported a number of medium and large local clients, including Obolon, Astarta
and Centravis. Small and medium enterprises have been reached via credit lines offered to them via
the partner banks. The Bank has actively participated in financing of several leading international
investors (including Lafarge, Bosch and Louis Dreyfus) as well as cross-border transactions with
sponsors from other countries of operation. In May 2010, the Bank rolled out in Ukraine its hallmark
Business Advisory Services (BAS) Programme, which is expected to help private enterprises to adapt
to the demands of a market economy and undertake restructuring after the crisis.
The Bank has worked to promote the development of domestic capital markets, including by
helping to successfully establish KievPrime, a credible local currency inter-bank index. It is engaged
in policy dialogue with the authorities and other IFIs, including the IMF, on market-friendly policies
for encouraging longer-term lending in hryvnia after the crisis. In 2011, the Banks prepared an
assessment of local currency market development challenges and prospects.
The Bank continues to pursue its strategic goal of supporting environmental protection and energy
efficiency and security. The EBRD supported local private business in the oil and gas sector by
financing, and more recently taking an equity position, in downstream operator Galnaftogas. A
number of banks have benefited from the energy efficiency credit lines and related capacity building
support. In the power and energy sectors, the Bank has helped support the implementation of the
March 2009 EU-Ukraine memorandum of understanding, which is the cornerstone of EU-Ukraine
cooperation in the field of energy. In particular, the Bank is expected to assist with the
modernization and rehabilitation of the main trans-European energy networks of Ukraine. It also
plans to invest in modern and energy efficient generation, transportation and distribution of energy.
The Bank will also support the diversification of the supply sources and promote alternative fuels.
These aims will be complemented by support to reforms in the energy sector to advance its
liberalization and promote private sector involvement. Together with other IFIs, the EBRD continues
to explore mechanisms for supporting the authorities as they pursue the modernization of Ukraine’s
gas transit system. In the area of nuclear safety, the Bank is working to improve the safety standards
at the existing nuclear power plants (NPPs), the safe decommissioning of Chernobyl NPP and the
creation of a safe confinement for its Unit 4.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(May 2012)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Among Ukraine’s economic and financial data, there are some shortcomings, particularly in
national accounts, government finance statistics (GFS), and external sector statistics.
National Accounts: The National Accounts (NA) are broadly in line with the 1993 SNA. An STA
multitopic technical assistance mission in April 2010 flagged financial account and sector balance
sheets, as well as estimates of financial intermediation services indirectly measured, as the parts
of the system that remain to be developed. In line with previous recommendations, a number of
changes were implemented in 2009–10 that improved compilation of the quarterly national
accounts (QNA). Volume measures of GDP have been rebased using 2007 as the reference period
but a number of recommended methodological improvements remain to be implemented.
Seasonally adjusted data are not disseminated on a quarterly basis. Government regulations
regarding revisions policy restrain the State Statistics Committee of Ukraine’s ability to improve
data accuracy through flexible revisions for the annual NA and the QNA. Starting from 2011,
Ukraine is one of the beneficiaries of the STA TA project on Capacity Building for Sustainable
Compilation of Real Sector Statistics in Eastern Europe, which entails two/three missions per year
on national accounts and price statistics, as well as training activity.
Price statistics: The weights of CPI are updated annually; geometric means are used at the very
first level of price aggregation (beginning with observations January 2010) and scientific
sampling of outlets was introduced beginning with observations in January 2011, with the results
being published within six days of the end of the reference month. However, their geographical
coverage is limited to urban areas and data validation practices fall somewhat short of
internationally accepted best practices. The CPI excludes price changes for owner occupied
housing. The lack of appropriate price indices hampers production of accurate long-term GDP
volume series. Efforts to develop imports and exports price indices are underway.
Government finance statistics: Compilers are cognizant of the GFSM 2001 methodology and
reference materials. However, the lack of a strong legal framework for compiling GFS and its
incomplete statistical coverage are significant shortcomings. The full adoption of the GFSM 2001
system depends on strengthening of primary data sources, government accounting reform
(undertaken under the International Public Sector Accounting Standards), and successful
completion of the GFS component of the World Bank project on the development of statistics. A
lack of clarity on the stock of VAT refund claims prevents a full assessment of the underlying
fiscal performance.
Monetary statistics: The authorities use the Standardized Report Forms (SRF) for reporting
monetary data to STA and EUR. In addition, data beginning from December 2001 have been
converted into the SRF framework. and published in IFS since September 2006, and are available
online.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

Balance of payments: The compilation system relies heavily on the International Transactions
Reporting System, customs declaration database, and enterprise surveys, providing a broad
coverage of data on a timely basis. Nevertheless, direct data collection through enterprise
surveys and a more intensive use of available data sources would improve data quality in the
areas of financial services, travel, compensation of employees, workers’ remittances, and
reinvested earnings. Goods statistics could benefit by improving the methodology for estimating
the c.i.f./f.o.b. conversion coefficient as well as by bringing reporting forms and instructions in
line with the international guidelines. Efforts are also needed to reconcile direct investment data
provided by the survey enterprises and ITRS, and to determine the sources of large FX cash held
outside of the banking system classified under currency and deposits. In line with 2012 STA TA,
improvements are needed regarding the compilation of external debt on a remaining maturity
basis and direct investment by improving the coverage of debt instruments data and the
valuation of equity.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the SDDS since January 10, 2003.

Data ROSC published on August 19, 2003.

III. Reporting to STA
The country’s IFS page has been published since July 1996. On monetary statistics, data have
been published since September 2006 using the SRF framework in the IFS and are available
online. The authorities also report regularly the quarterly data on Financial Soundness Indicators.
These data are disseminated on the IMF’s website with observations beginning in 2005. Data on
international investment position has been compiled and reported since 2002.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Ukraine
On June 29, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Ukraine.1
Background
Ukraine had a strong economic recovery in 2010–11, following the deep recession ensuing from
the 2008–09 global crisis. However, recovery is now slowing. Lower demand for Ukraine’s
exports and slow credit growth are weighing on economic growth, which is projected at
3 percent this year. Inflation is projected to rise to 7.4 percent during the year, reflecting wage
pressures and rising food prices. Weakening external demand is expected to widen the current
account deficit to 6.5 percent of GDP.
Risks remain elevated in an uncertain global environment. A significant contraction in global
demand, commodity price shocks, or deleveraging by European banks would pose risks to
external stability given Ukraine’s high external financing requirements.
Following a 3.1 percent of GDP government deficit improvement in 2011, the fiscal position is
now under pressure. Public debt fell from 41 to 36 percent in 2011 and pension reform
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

improved medium-term fiscal prospects. This year, a supplementary budget has increased
wage and pension expenditures and absent increased revenue collection to finance this, staff
projects the general government deficit at 3¼ percent of GDP, compared to a target of
1.8 percent. The state-owned gas company’s deficit is projected to reach 2 percent of GDP this
year, adding to the weight of the general government deficit on public finances.
The current tight monetary stance aims at addressing external risks and containing inflation.
However, this combined with deleveraging by banks has constrained credit growth. Liquidity
tightening as well as prudential and administrative measures have contributed to exchange rate
stability.
Banking sector reforms have advanced although balance sheets remain week. The banking
system appears well capitalized. Nonetheless, profitability is near zero, nonperforming loans
remain high, and banks balance sheets remain exposed to currency movements. Measures
have also been taken to deregulate the economy and to simplify the tax and customs codes that
have the potential to improve the business environment.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the progress made by Ukraine since the 2008–09 crisis,
including the rebound in growth, and the decline in inflation and in the general government
deficit. Directors also commended the authorities’ efforts to advance several reforms,
particularly the approval of the pension law and the new tax and customs codes. They noted,
however, that the country faces lingering vulnerabilities due to low reserve cover, large external
and fiscal funding needs, and the difficult external environment. Directors stressed the need for
strengthened policies and reforms to reduce these vulnerabilities, build buffers for domestic and
external stability, and improve medium-term growth prospects.
Directors underscored that fiscal consolidation remains a priority. They welcomed the
authorities’ determination to meet the 2012 deficit target and encouraged them to identify
quickly contingency measures to safeguard against possible shortfalls. Over the medium term,
continued efforts will be needed to strengthen public revenue, reform the public sector, and
reorient spending towards growth-enhancing priorities.
Directors stressed that a comprehensive reform of the energy sector is critical to reduce the
strain on the budget and gain energy independence. They urged the authorities to gradually
increase gas and heating tariffs and enhance payment compliance. Increases in domestic
energy prices will be essential to bring supply and demand into balance, alongside increased
investment in domestic energy production. Energy efficiency improvements and better-targeted
subsidies to protect the poorest should also be important components of the energy sector
strategy.

3

Directors advised that monetary policy should focus more on price stability. They noted that a
tighter monetary stance would be warranted if balance of payments or inflationary pressures
intensify. Directors concurred that gradually increasing exchange rate flexibility would help
mitigate external shocks, strengthen reserves, and preserve competitiveness. Increased
flexibility should be supported by efforts to reduce balance sheet mismatches in the financial
sector, along with fiscal, monetary and wage policies consistent with maintenance of price
stability.
Directors welcomed the progress made in the banking sector. They urged the authorities to
address the remaining weaknesses, notably the high level of non-performing loans, low
profitability, and currency mismatches, to allow the sector to fully support economic growth.
Directors welcomed the plans to reduce banking system exposure to foreign exchange risks,
including through limited sales to banks of foreign currency linked bonds issued by the
government. More broadly, Directors encouraged the authorities to press ahead with their
efforts to unwind crisis era policies.
Directors welcomed progress under the President’s Economic Reform Plan which aims at
promoting growth, improving the business climate, and attracting investment. Achieving these
objectives will require implementation of comprehensive structural reforms, including stronger
governance and further privatization.
