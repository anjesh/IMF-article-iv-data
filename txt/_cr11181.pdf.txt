STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Growth after the earthquake. After a sharp contraction in production and private
demand, supply constraints are easing and activity has begun to recover. GDP is
forecast to decline by 0.7 percent in 2011 before rising by 2.9 percent in 2012. The
outlook, however, remains uncertain depending on how quickly supply bottlenecks
ease and sentiment recovers.
Reconstruction funding and fiscal strategy. The immediate priority of fiscal
policy is to revive growth, but to limit bond issuance and strengthen commitment
to fiscal reform, reconstruction spending should be financed by new tax measures.
While other tax measures could also be considered, staff recommends a moderate
increase in the consumption tax, from 5 percent to 7–8 percent, in 2012 when a
cyclical recovery is underway. Long-term reforms to bring down the public debt
ratio require a 1 percent of GDP annual reduction in the structural primary deficit
over ten years.
Ending deflation and safeguarding financial stability. To ward off deflation risks
and support the recovery, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) could increase purchases of
longer-dated public securities and expand its asset purchase program for private
assets. The earthquake poses little immediate risk to financial stability, but policies
should protect against risks of a prolonged economic slowdown and higher market
volatility given banks’ significant holdings of government bonds and equities.
Implementing the growth strategy. The economic slowdown provides an
opportunity to accelerate growth-enhancing structural reforms. The priorities are to
boost employment by raising labor participation among the elderly, young, and
women, pursue trade liberalization, and promote SME restructuring.
Spillovers. Recent production disruptions have highlighted Japan’s role as a key
supplier to regional production networks. The main potential international
spillover, however, is through the public sector. Fiscal consolidation would have
long-term benefits for Japan’s partners by reducing tail risks from a disruption in
the Japanese government bond market and freeing up domestic savings to help
lower global interest rates.

JAPAN 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THE ROAD TO RECOVERY
1. The Great East Japan earthquake and
tsunami on March 11, 2011 brought
Japan’s nascent recovery to a halt. It
destroyed large parts of Japan’s northeastern
coastal areas and damaged key infrastructure.
The destruction far exceeded those of the
1995 Great Hanshin earthquake near the city
of Kobe and is likely to influence economic
developments for some time.
2. The authorities have responded swiftly
to stabilize markets and activity has begun
to recover. Recent data on household
spending and production suggest that activity
is picking up, and supply chains are being
restored faster than expected. Nevertheless,
the outlook remains uncertain, due to
lingering concerns about power supply and
weak sentiment. In addition, greater spending
will push up Japan’s already high level of

public debt, while subdued demand and a
delayed recovery could intensify deflation
pressures. Uncertainty over PM Kan’s future
and a potential realignment of political parties
before the Lower House general elections
scheduled before 2013 could delay needed
policies.
3. Ensuring a robust recovery will require
a significant policy effort. The government
is now considering additional budgets for
reconstruction and a blueprint for longerterm tax and social security reforms. These
measures will have important implications for
Japan’s growth and fiscal outlook. Against this
backdrop, this year’s Article IV consultation
focused on policies to revive growth and
reforms to bolster confidence in public
finances.

THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE EARTHQUAKE
A. Signs of a Recovery are Emerging
4. Although the direct damage was
limited to coastal areas, the impact of the
earthquake was felt nationwide. In the first
quarter of 2011, GDP contracted by
3.5 percent (q/q, s.a.a.r.) led by sharp declines
in private consumption and stockbuilding.
Four factors explain the earthquake’s severe
initial impact:
 extensive damage to private capital and
public infrastructure (estimated at
3–5 percent of GDP),
 electricity shortages in the Kanto region
including Tokyo, which accounts for
40 percent of GDP,
 widespread supply chain disruptions
affecting production nationwide, especially
in automobiles and electronics (about
35 percent of exports), and a sharp decline
in sentiment following the earthquake,
which weighed heavily on domestic demand

5. Supply has begun to recover faster
than expected, but private demand remains
sluggish (Figure 1). After declining by
15 percent in March, industrial production
grew modestly in April, and leading indicators
point to a solid rebound in the coming
months. Confidence is growing that summer
demand for electricity will be met due to
aggressive energy conservation efforts and
added capacity. Some demand-side indicators,
such as retail sales and capital goods shipment
have also started to recover, but household
and corporate sentiment still remains weak.
6. Consumer prices were largely
unaffected by the earthquake. Core inflation
excluding fresh food has held steady in the
first two months after the earthquake as higher
prices for food and clothing were offset by
declines in prices of durable goods items.

7. Financial and exchange markets
stabilized quickly after the earthquake
(Figure 3).
 Equity markets. Equity markets fell by over
15 percent in the first weeks after the
earthquake, but recouped roughly one third

 Corporate bond and lending. Corporate
bond issuance fell sharply after the
earthquake, while spreads on lower-rated
corporate bonds picked up modestly. Bank
lending continues to decline but at a slower
pace, reflecting increased demand for
working capital.
 Exchange rate. After concerted intervention
in coordination with the G-7 in mid-March,
the yen / US$ rate has traded in a band of
80–84. For the year-to-date, the yen has
strengthened against the U.S. dollar but
weakened against the euro. In real effective
terms, the yen has depreciated by 5 percent
since the beginning of the year but remains
about 15 percent stronger than during preLehman lows.

B. Outlook and Risks

Contributions to GDP Growth (q-o-q, saar)

8. The economy continues to face
headwinds from the earthquake’s impact
but is set to recover in the second half of
this calendar year. Supply disruptions,
electricity shortfalls, and weak demand are
holding back economic activity, but starting
over the summer, the economy is expected to
recover as supply conditions normalize and
reconstruction spending picks up. The recovery
will continue in 2012 as the resumption of
exports lifts domestic demand and
reconstruction spending continues.
Specifically, staff forecasts:

12

 GDP growth to slow to -0.7 percent in 2011
before rising to 2.9 percent in 2012.
 Headline inflation to be around zero
percent in 2011 and 2012, while underlying
inflation—excluding food and energy—is

projected to remain negative as a result of
the still wide output gap.1

1

Relative to the large decline in GDP, the output gap
is projected to widen modestly (by about
½ percentage point to 5.5 percent in 2011) due to the
simultaneous decline of supply and demand. Given the
temporary nature of the shock and a very flat Phillipscurve, the impact on underlying inflation is estimated
to be about 0.1 percentage points in 2011.

JAPAN 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

9. The uncertainty surrounding the
outlook is unusually large. Risks to the
outlook are biased downwards as delays in
resolving supply disruptions and rebuilding
electricity capacity could hold back private
consumption and investment. In particular, the
impact on electricity supply from nuclear
power represents a significant downside risk
(Box 1). External risks stem primarily from a
slowdown in other advanced economies. If
these risks materialize, larger upfront fiscal
spending and monetary easing combined with
a more ambitious medium-term fiscal
consolidation strategy will be needed. On the
upside, a faster easing of supply constraints
could accelerate the recovery in exports and
investment.

sustainability assessment, the yen appears to
be broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals.

10. The impact of the earthquake on
global supply chains is expected to be short
lived (See Box 2 of Spillover Report).
Reflecting Japan’s large global share in many
high-tech inputs, overseas production slowed
in several industries, especially in automobiles
and electronics. However, with industrial
production showing signs of turning around,
exports will likely pick up soon, limiting the risk
of a sustained disruption to regional supply
chains.

12. Officials expect the economy to
recover sharply during the second half of
the year in line with staff’s projections. After
adjusting for the weak Q1 GDP outturn and
historical revisions, the BoJ and Cabinet
Office’s growth forecasts on a calendar year
basis are roughly similar to staff’s projections.
The authorities noted that supply disruptions
had started to ease earlier than expected and
the electricity situation had improved. Fiscal
spending would initially drive the recovery
followed by a strengthening of confidence and
demand.

11. The yen appears fairly valued based on
medium-term fundamentals. In the
immediate aftermath of the earthquake, the
yen appreciated sharply on speculation about
sizeable repatriation flows by insurance
companies, corporations, and households, but
these did not materialize. By mid-June, the yen
returned to levels close to its 20 year average
in real effective terms. As a result of supply
disruptions, the trade balance turned negative
in May, but the impact on the current account
is expected to be temporary. Staff projects a
current account surplus above 2 percent of
GDP in the medium term, supported by
investment income from Japan’s large net
international investment position. Based on
IMF methodologies using a macroeconomic
balance approach, an equilibrium real
exchange rate assessment, and an external

The Authorities’ Views

13. The authorities also viewed the risks to
the outlook as mainly on the downside.
Although supply chains are now recovering,
the outlook is still subject to considerable
uncertainty about how quickly consumer
sentiment will rebound and electricity
shortages addressed, especially if more nuclear
plants are shut down. Externally, the economy
faces risks from a weak U.S. recovery, European
sovereign problems, and inflationary pressures
in emerging market economies.

Box 1. Implications of the Earthquake for Japan’s Electricity Supply
The earthquake substantially reduced electricity
capacity in the east of Japan. The damage to the
Fukushima nuclear plants and other thermal plants cut
Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO)’s supply
capacity to the Kanto and greater Tokyo region by
nearly 30 percent to below 35 million KW, forcing
TEPCO to implement rolling blackouts to meet normal
demand of around 35–40 million KW in March. TEPCO’s
efforts to restore capacity and government measures to
conserve electricity enabled the company to end rolling
blackouts by early April.

inspection, with the remaining reactors scheduled to be
taken off line for inspection by spring of next year.
Restarting will depend on local government approval,
which has become more challenging due to rising
public concerns over nuclear safety. With nuclear
energy providing close to 30 percent of the nation’s
electricity, shutting down all the nuclear reactors could
reduce Japan’s electricity supply significantly and

TEPCO’s electricity supply is expected to be
sufficient to meet peak demand during the summer.
As a result of reactivating and installing thermal plants,
TEPCO projects its supply capacity to rise to around
55 million KW by July, which, based on past usage,
should be sufficient to meet peak demand this summer.
But to avoid possible blackouts, the government has
called for a 15 percent reduction in electricity usage
during summer peak hours, which corporations plan to
meet by shifting around production schedules, working
over the weekends, and running their own power
generators. After the summer, electricity demand is
projected to decline as cooler weather reduces the use
of air conditioning.
Beyond the summer, however, the outlook for
electricity supply is clouded by the uncertainty over
restarting inspected nuclear plants. Under Japanese
regulations, nuclear reactors must be shut down for
inspection every 13 months. Currently, 35 out of
54 reactors have already been shut down for

Japan could substitute nuclear energy with other
sources, but this will push up energy costs
substantially. Japan is already turning more to
alternative energy sources, such as thermal and
renewable energy. However, this shift may take time,
and by some estimates, could raise electricity costs by
around 10 percent (or 0.3 percent of GDP). During the
transition, higher energy costs and increased
uncertainty over the power situation could undermine
the recovery by constraining investment and possibly
2
accelerating a shift of Japanese production overseas.
To mitigate such risks, a clear policy on securing a
stable and affordable energy supply would be needed.

________________
1

The elasticity of GDP with respect to electricity supply is
estimated to be around 1 over the past 10 years, suggesting
that a severe electricity shortage would represent a significant
downside risk to the growth outlook.

Increased reliance on thermal energy would also create a
conflict with Japan’s commitment in the Kyoto Protocol to cut
emission of greenhouse gases.

JAPAN 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

14. Compared to staff’s projections, the
BoJ forecasts a higher rate of inflation due
to more buoyant commodity prices. The
BoJ’s forecast for inflation in FY2011 and
FY2012 are around 0.6–0.7 percent, higher
than staff’s projection of zero inflation, largely
on account of commodity prices which the BoJ
expects to rise 6–7 percent annually over the
next two years. This partly reflects the BoJ’s
view that strong emerging market demand
and the “financialization” of commodities will
continue to push up prices.2 The BoJ saw little
risk that the earthquake would significantly
weaken prices as medium-term inflation
expectations remain well anchored at around
1 percent.

15. The international spillovers of the
earthquake highlighted Japan’s important
role for global supply networks. The
authorities stressed that Japan maintained
important trade links with the region, not only
as an exporter to the supply chain but also as a
consumer of final demand.
16. The authorities emphasized that
exchange rates should be determined by
markets, reflecting underlying economic
fundamentals. They also expressed concern
about the yen’s volatility and disorderly
movements especially during times of financial
distress and saw the G-7 coordinated
intervention as successful in addressing
excessive volatility after the quake.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Fiscal policy will need to chart a path between increased spending to facilitate a swift
recovery and longer-term reforms to bring down the high level of public debt. The Bank
of Japan’s (BoJ) accommodative monetary stance has helped stabilize financial markets,
but more can be done to guard against deflation risks and support the recovery. Financial
policies should strengthen the resilience of the system to a slowdown and market risk,
while timely implementation of the government’s growth strategy would help sustain
fiscal adjustment and support the recovery.

A. Financing Reconstruction and Charting a Path for Fiscal Reforms
Background
17. The fiscal costs of the earthquake
could range between 2–4 percent of GDP
spread over several years (Figure 2).
Reconstruction is projected to increase the
fiscal deficit in 2011 to 10½ percent of GDP
and the net debt-to-GDP ratio to above
130 percent of GDP. In May, the government
passed its first supplementary budget
(0.8 percent of GDP) to repair damaged
infrastructure, financed mainly from
contingency reserves, reprioritized spending,
and a temporary reduction in the
government’s contributions to the public
pension fund. Additional supplementary
budgets focused on revitalizing the region are
expected this summer.

18. Among options to finance
reconstruction, the near-term scope for
further expenditure cuts is limited. Japan’s
non-social security spending (excluding
interest payment) has been well contained and
at about 16 percent of GDP, is the lowest
among the advanced economies. Social
security benefits, on the other hand, have been
rising steadily due to population aging.
19. Japan, however, has ample room to
raise additional tax revenue. At about
17 percent of GDP, overall tax revenue is one
of the lowest among OECD economies.
Compared to other countries, Japan’s
consumption tax rate at 5 percent is very low
(Box 2) and the personal income tax allows for
ample deductions and low marginal rates for
middle-income households. By contrast, the
corporate income tax rate of 40 percent is
relatively high.
20. In the absence of new taxes, JGB
issuance could rise by 2 percent of GDP or
more in 2011–12. While the size of the
additional bond issuance is manageable, the
capacity of the bond market to absorb further
debt is projected to decline with population
aging. In addition, the JGB market faces several
risks from changes in the institutional investor
base, external developments, and near-term
reconstruction activity, which could put
upward pressure on interest rates (Box 3).

JAPAN 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. The Case for Raising the Consumption Tax in Japan1

 Japan has one of the lowest VAT rates in the

world. The VAT in Japan was introduced in 1989
at the rate of 3 percent, and, despite rising to
5 percent in 1997, is still the lowest among
advanced economies that have a VAT2 (see chart).
The revenue yield from VAT in Japan is
correspondingly low, at approximately
2½ percent of GDP.

 Japan’s VAT is relatively efficient and easy to

administer. It is applied on a broad basis and has
a uniform rate. The C-efficiency ratio (VAT
revenue divided by total consumption times the
standard rate—a crude indicator of how far a VAT
is from the benchmark of a single rate levied on
all consumption) is nearly 70 percent—one of the
highest among OECD countries (see chart),
indicating that Japan’s VAT is broad-based with
relatively strong compliance.

Raising the consumption tax (VAT) rate to bring
down public debt is appealing for a number of
reasons:

Account Database (OECD); International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation
(IBFD); Corporate Taxes (2007), Worldwide Summaries
1/ VAT revenue divided by total consumption times the standard rate.

 VAT is a stable and robust source of revenue

in an aging society. Aging implies dissaving by
households (spending exceeding income),
making the tax base for VAT more robust than
the base for labor income, which grows more
slowly as the population ages. Indeed, in Japan,
labor income in nominal terms has grown by
about ½ percentage points per year slower on
average over the past 10 years than private
consumption. There is also international evidence
that the VAT is less damaging for economic
growth than personal or corporate income taxes
(Arnold, 2008)3. The less distortionary feature of
the VAT is particularly relevant for aging societies
such as Japan’s, where there is a relative shortage
of labor.

Box 3. Assessing Risks to the Japanese Government Bond Market1
Population aging and a recovery in risk appetite are
likely to diminish the bond market’s capacity to
absorb new debt over the medium term. Japan’s
large pool of domestic savings, a stable investor base,
low share of foreign ownership of domestic debt, and
current account surplus position have helped maintain
stability in the JGB market. Whilst these factors are
expected to persist for some time, the market’s capacity
to absorb new debt will diminish as population aging
reduces saving and risk appetite increases. Without a
significant policy adjustment, the stock of outstanding
JGBs could exceed the level of household financial
assets (currently 300 percent of GDP) within 5 to 10
years, suggesting that the government may need to
turn more to other sources of financing, such as the
2
corporate sector or foreign investors.

This episode was termed the “VaR shock” because a rise in
expected losses in banks’ internal value-at-risk (VaR) models
led to one-sided selling by banks as they attempted to shed
risk (Bank of Japan, Financial System Report 2010).

factors, including in the U.S. Treasury market where
the estimated correlation of yields is as high as 0.6.
Although the foreign ownership share of JGBs is only
5 percent, foreign participation in the JGB futures
market is about ⅓ of total trading, highlighting a
possible channel for overseas spillover. Late last year,
the sudden rise in JGB yields mirrored those in U.S.
Treasuries as Japanese banks pared back bond
holdings and shortened duration to minimize capital
losses. Market stress in overseas sovereign debt
markets or rating downgrades could also push up
JGB yields.

 Market volatility. Higher interest rate volatility could

induce a JGB sell-off by banks, similar to what took
place in 2003 when JGB yields rose suddenly by
3
100 bps. Similarly, JGB rollover risks have risen along
with the government’s annual financing requirement
(now at 55 percent of GDP including short-term
financing bills). Given the large amount of bonds that
need to be rolled over, uncertainty over the supply
and demand of JGBs could disrupt the smooth
absorption of new bond issuance.

JAPAN 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

21. In early June, the authorities outlined
their social security reform plan to support
their medium-term fiscal strategy. The plan
proposes to gradually double the consumption
tax to 10 percent by FY2015.3 The tax increase
would be used to fund social security and allow
the government to meet its target of halving
the primary deficit (in percent of GDP) by
FY2015 as part of its medium-term fiscal
strategy announced last June. The plan also
proposes to raise the pension retirement age
and adjust nominal pension benefits for
deflation, but does not specify steps beyond
FY2015 for meeting the final target of reducing
the debt ratio starting in FY2021 at the latest.
Policy Issues and Staff’s Views
22. The immediate fiscal priority is to
repair damaged infrastructure and facilitate
a swift recovery. The government has moved
quickly to pass its first supplementary budget
to address immediate needs. Timely passage of
an additional, more sizeable supplementary
budget, which is well targeted and focused on
revitalizing the affected regions, would help
address downside risks and catalyze private
spending.
23. At the same time, new tax measures are
needed to limit bond issuance and
strengthen the commitment to fiscal
reforms. While other tax measures could also
be considered, staff recommends a moderate
increase in the consumption tax, from
5 percent to 7–8 percent, in 2012 when a
cyclical recovery is underway.4 The alternative,
relying mainly on debt financing, would add to
fiscal risks stemming from an already high level
of public debt.
24. Bringing down public debt over the
medium term will require a sustained and
3

The plan is under cabinet consideration and does not
specify a timetable for the tax rate increase. The
proposed revenue measure is hence not included in
staff’s baseline scenario.

significant adjustment of the primary
balance. Staff welcomes the recent proposal
to double the consumption tax by FY2015, but
more needs to be done to put the net debt-toGDP ratio on a downward path earlier by the
middle of this decade. This would reduce the
risk of a more severe adjustment resulting
from a loss of confidence in public finances.
Based on IMF staff estimates, stabilizing the
net debt ratio by 2016 and reducing it to
around 135 percent of GDP by 2020 would
require a reduction of the primary fiscal deficit
by 10 percent of GDP over a 10 year horizon.
Staff estimates that in the short run, fiscal
adjustment could reduce growth by
0.3–0.5 percentage points per year, but that
over the longer term it could raise growth due
to improved confidence in public finances.5

25. Given the limited scope for cutting
expenditure, fiscal adjustment would need
to rely mainly on new revenue sources and
limits on spending growth (see table). The
main elements could include:
 Comprehensive tax reform. The key revenue
measure would be a gradual increase in the
consumption tax to 15 percent over several
years, yielding 5 percent of GDP. To
promote domestic investment, the
corporate income tax rate, currently at
40 percent, could be lowered to 35 percent
with revenue losses offset by reforms of
personal income tax that reduce allowances
and base exemptions.

Introducing a “solidarity” tax would also be in line
with experience in other countries following large
disasters, such as Chile after its earthquake in 2010
and Australia following major floods in 2011.

terms and introducing an income cap on
social transfers. To facilitate these reforms,
we support the government’s efforts to
introduce a taxpayer identification system
to allow a more effective targeting of
social transfers.

26. Adopting an explicit fiscal rule could
help sustain fiscal consolidation. In 2010, the
government introduced a “pay-as-you go”
budget rule that requires new expenditures be
funded through offsetting savings or higher
revenue. To further strengthen the
commitment to cap public debt, the
government could adopt an explicit fiscal rule
that targets a primary surplus consistent with
its debt reduction plan. The framework should
be based on prudent economic assumptions

and permit temporary deviations from its
target only under narrowly defined conditions.
27. Lengthening the maturity of public
debt would help limit rollover risks and
keep funding costs low. The government has
progressively lengthened the average maturity
of public debt (including financing bills) to
5–6 years, close to levels in other advanced
economies. However, given the large debt
stock, annual financing requirements are high
at about 55 percent of GDP.6 To lower rollover
risk and lock in favorably low interest rates, the
government could accelerate extending of
maturities by converting more short-term
financing bills to longer-term debt.

6

The financing requirement is calculated as the sum of
the estimated overall deficit of the general
government (about 10 percent of GDP) and the
principal value of short-term financing bills and JGBs
maturing in 2011 (45 percent of GDP).

JAPAN 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

28. Delays in fiscal reform could have
spillovers to other countries. The capacity of
the market to absorb debt will gradually
decline as private savings fall due to
population aging. If yields increased rapidly,
Japanese banks, including Japan Post Bank,
which hold almost 40 percent of outstanding
JGBs, could experience sizeable losses and
affect their asset portfolios. In addition,
increases in JGB yields, as a result of delays in
fiscal reform, may lead to higher interest rates
elsewhere, especially in some economies
where government debt is high.
The Authorities’ Views
29. The authorities agreed on the need for
a well-targeted supplementary budget and
remain committed to medium-term fiscal
consolidation.
 Reconstruction spending. The authorities
stressed that the supplementary budget
should be well targeted to make efficient
use of the funds. The budget would also
consider carefully the ideas of the
government’s Reconstruction Design
Council and local authorities for revitalizing
the affected region. The authorities are
exploring various financing options,
including raising the consumption, personal
and corporate income taxes and viewed the
issue of a temporary reconstruction tax as
separate from the longer-term issue of
securing fiscal sustainability.
 Medium-term fiscal strategy. The authorities
agreed on the need for a more ambitious
medium-term strategy to maintain public
confidence, but noted difficulties in
achieving consensus on accelerating their

planned adjustment. They emphasized that
given the limited room for further
expenditure cuts, tax measures were crucial.
The authorities acknowledged the need to
contain social security expenditures, but
also gave priority to securing a stable
source of revenue to strengthen the
credibility of the system.
 Debt management. The authorities did not
see any immediate rollover risk to the JGB
market, but nevertheless would continue to
lengthen JGB maturities. They also stressed
the need to take into account changes in
market demand when lengthening
maturities and would continue their close
dialogue with market participants.
 Fiscal rule. The authorities were cautious
about adopting an explicit fiscal rule, citing
their experience with the 1997 Fiscal
Structural Act whose targets were quickly
abandoned after the banking crisis of the
late 1990s. Instead, the authorities viewed
their multi-year expenditure framework,
updated annually by the cabinet, as being
more flexible and effective.
 Spillovers. The authorities welcomed the
finding that fiscal consolidation in Japan
would benefit other countries, particularly if
accompanied by structural reforms. On the
financial linkages, however, they were
skeptical about staff’s tail risk analysis
showing how a JGB shock could affect
global financial markets through banks’
balance sheets, as the share of foreign
assets held by Japanese banks was around
10–20 percent. In general, they cautioned
against relying too heavily on models of
financial contagion and strict interpretation
of the results.

B. Monetary Policy Options to End Deflation
Background
30. Prior to the earthquake, the BoJ
substantially broadened its policy toolkit
for easing monetary policy. In late 2010,
under its comprehensive monetary easing
policy the BoJ (i) adopted a “virtually zero
interest rate” policy, (ii) committed to maintain
zero interest rates until it judges that price

stability is in sight on the basis of its “mediumto long-term understanding of price stability,”7
7

The BoJ’s Policy Board members’ “understanding of
medium- to long-term price stability” is for year-onyear change in the CPI “to fall in a positive range of
2 percent or lower, centering around 1 percent.” The
BoJ uses the annual headline inflation rate as the
primary policy consideration and the policy

(iii) introduced a new asset purchase program,
covering corporate bonds, commercial paper,
exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and real estate
investment trusts (REITs), in addition to
government securities (¥5 trillion).
31. Following the earthquake, the BoJ
undertook further easing measures. It
expanded the size of the asset purchases to
¥10 trillion (text table). The BoJ also introduced
a new ¥1 trillion loan program to support
lending activity of financial institutions in the
affected regions and expanded its lending
facility to “strengthen the foundations of
economic growth” by ¥½ trillion to encourage
asset-based lending by financial institutions.
Event study analysis finds that the BoJ’s
monetary easing measures have cumulatively
lowered the 10-year sovereign yield by about
25 basis points in the first week after the
announcements, while equity prices rose by
about 5–7 percent (Box 4).

32. Despite the pick-up in headline
inflation, deflation pressures continue to
persist. Higher fuel prices have pushed up
headline inflation with the BoJ’s forecast of
core inflation (which excludes fresh food but
includes energy) in FY2010–11 now around

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

0.6–0.7 percent. Underlying core inflation
(excluding food and energy), however, remains
subdued and has averaged around -1 percent
since 2009 following a decade of mild
deflation driven by structural factors related to
population aging and diminished growth
expectations. Although the initial impact of the
earthquake on inflation is unclear, the sharp
fall in demand and heightened uncertainty
about the outlook could weaken inflation
expectations. In addition, the rebasing of the
inflation index in August 2011, which is
estimated by market analysts to reduce the
price level by around 0.5 percentage points,
could push headline inflation back into
negative territory.

Policy Issues and Staff’s Views
33. Broader communication of the special
factors driving inflation could help clarify
the BoJ’s policy stance. In its regular reports,
the BoJ has usefully explained that the rise in
inflation has been partly due to higher
international commodity prices. The BoJ could
further strengthen communication by regularly
reporting the outlook for different inflation
indices and explain their influence on
monetary policy setting. In the current
environment, where underlying inflation
pressures are very subdued, the BoJ should
give high weight to measures of inflation that
exclude food and energy.
34. To insure against deflation risks, the
BoJ could consider8:
 Further monetary easing. To further reduce
term premia on yields, the BoJ could
increase the share of longer maturity JGBs
(3 years and above) in its portfolio. And it
could expand its special loan facility
to ”support the foundations of growth” to
include reconstruction projects in the
affected regions.

P. Berkmen analyzes the effectiveness of recent easing
measures in stimulating economic activity.

JAPAN 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 4. Bank of Japan’s Monetary Easing Measures—
Are they Comprehensive and Powerful?1
This box outlines an event study to assess the initial
impact of the BoJ’s asset purchases on financial
markets. The events are selected based on the dates
on which the BoJ announced and implemented its new
monetary measures since December 2009. These
measures include the introduction of fixed-rate fundssupplying operation against pooled collateral, a lending
facility to strengthen the foundations of economic
growth, and the asset purchase program under the
Comprehensive Monetary Easing. To isolate the impact
of the measures, changes in several high-frequency
financial indicators around the events are compared
with the changes in a typical trading day. This
methodology has been widely applied in other studies,
such as those on the Fed’s large scale asset purchase
program (e.g., Gagnon 2010).
BoJ’s easing measures have had a favorable impact
on asset prices, mostly from announcement effects
(see chart). Across the identified events, after the BoJ
announcements, the asset prices have generally
improved. Specifically,

 Sovereign yields. The 10-year JGB yield fell

cumulatively by nearly 25 basis points, and the 2-year
JGB yield by more than 10 basis points. These
declines were statistically significant and larger than
the 0.1 basis point change in a typical two-day
trading window. The term premium also fell, helping
to flatten the yield curve.

 Corporate yields. Yields on corporate bonds across
various investment grades declined initially, but
reverted by the end of the following week.

 Stock prices. Equity prices improved by more than

5–7 percent, with the increase being statistically
significant compared with the changes during typical
trading days.

 Exchange rate and inflation expectations. Monetary

easing, however, had almost no measurable effect on
the exchange rate or inflation expectations.

The asset purchase program introduced in October
2010 appears to have lowered tail risks in financial
markets. Following the announcement of the program,
implied volatility on assets declined significantly,
helping to reduce risk premia and support investors’
risk appetite. Markets’ perceived risk of a double-dip
recession also receded, as indicated by the decline in
the implied volatility of out-of-the-money call and put
options—a measure of the cost of insuring against
extreme tail risk events. Although the size of the impact
on financial markets has been modest, the results
suggest that the asset purchases have been effective in
reducing term and risk premia and could be expanded
further to support activity.

(see chart). After the easing announcements, equity
prices of insurance companies and large banks rose

 Additional purchases of private assets. To
stimulate activity, the BoJ could accelerate
and expand its purchases of corporate
bonds, commercial paper, and ETFs. The BoJ
could also purchase securitized SME loans
to ease financial conditions and foster a
new market for lending to smaller firms.
35. Monetary easing has had little effect
on the yen exchange rate. Since the global
crisis, interest differentials between major
currencies have narrowed and reduced
incentives for yen-funded carry trade.
However, as Japan is likely to maintain an
accommodative stance for longer than other
advanced economies, the yen could weaken
and affect other economies via trade and
financial channels although a return of largescale carry trades appears unlikely.
The Authorities’ Views
36. The BoJ viewed their exceptionally
accommodative monetary stance as
sufficient to stabilize financial markets and
meet demand for credit. While the BoJ
recognized the argument for easing further to
insure against possible downside risks, their
outlook did not warrant such action now. They
also emphasized that policy insurance involved
a cost, and that the case for further easing
needed to be weighed against the possible
side effects associated with unorthodox
policies:
 Extending maturities of JGB purchases. The
BoJ agreed that buying JGBs of longer
maturity could absorb duration risk and
catalyze portfolio rebalancing, but given the
very low 10-year JGB yield, the expected
gains would appear limited. More
importantly, without a credible fiscal
strategy, it may send the wrong signal that

debt issuance is becoming unconstrained
and adversely push up long-term yields.
 Special loan facility to support the
foundations of growth. The BoJ noted that
they have already used up most of the
committed ¥3 trillion in funds and have
upgraded the facility but wished to avoid
contributing to excess loan competition.
They were also unsure whether the loan
facility, which targeted innovative sectors
for development, was best suited to deal
with immediate reconstruction needs.
 Purchases of private assets. The BoJ is still
purchasing private assets and evaluating
their impact. Again, expanding the program
needed to be weighed against the side
effects of distorting the market mechanism
and sacrificing the soundness of the BoJ’s
balance sheet. SME securitized loans is a
promising area for development but the
market is still too small and illiquid for the
BoJ to enter.
37. In communicating their assessment of
the inflation outlook, the BoJ cautioned
against relying too heavily on core-core
measures of inflation. Because the BoJ
believes that no single indicator can
adequately capture underlying inflation, they
analyze various inflation measures in their
regular reports. The BoJ noted that their core
measure excluding volatile fresh food but
including fuel was shown to be a robust
predictor of future inflation. They cautioned
against paying too much attention to corecore measures if the rise in commodity prices
proves to be more persistent. On the rebasing
of the CPI, the BoJ has highlighted in their
reports the likely downward revision in the CPI
but expressed reservations about providing an
estimate given the difficulty in predicting its
magnitude.

C. Safeguarding Financial Stability
Background
38. Swift and decisive policy action has
helped the financial sector weather well the
initial shock of the earthquake. On the first

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

business day after the disaster, the BoJ
provided an unprecedented ¥21.8 trillion yen
of short-term liquidity, nearly three times
larger than that injected after the Lehman
crisis. The BoJ and the Financial Services

JAPAN 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Agency (FSA) also took steps to ensure smooth
functioning of financial transactions in the
affected regions.
39. Exposures of the banking and
insurance sectors to the affected regions
are limited.
 Major banks, which account for 53 percent
of total banking assets, have only a small
exposure to the affected areas (½ percent
of their loans) with estimated losses well
within their capital buffers. Major banks
have steadily raised their Tier 1 capital ratio
to 13 percent at end FY2010, but still hold
about one-third of this capital in the form
of preferred securities and tax deferred
assets.
 A few regional and shinkin banks (credit
unions) have sizeable exposures to the
affected regions and could face large losses,
but these banks pose little systemic risk
given their small size (2 percent of the
banking system) and limited connectedness.
Overall, regional banks’ Tier-1 capital ratio
stood at 9.4 percent in FY 2010.9
 Domestic insurance companies are
expected to have sufficient reserves to meet
disaster claims. Insured losses from life and
non-life insurers are estimated at around
¥2.7 trillion, well within the solvency
margins, which stood at above 760 percent
of liabilities.
40. Financial markets have reacted
negatively to uncertainty about the
financial situation of the Tokyo Electric
Power Company (TEPCO) and its possible
implications for creditors and shareholders.
TEPCO’s share price has fallen by nearly
90 percent since the earthquake, with the
company reporting losses of around
¥1¼ trillion in FY2010. Major banks have
around ¥3 trillion in loans to TEPCO, of which
around ¥2 trillion were extended as emergency
financing after the disaster.

Policy Issues and Staff’s Views10
41. Banks face risks from a sluggish
recovery. A delayed recovery could raise
credit costs, especially on loans to heavily
indebted small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs). Looking ahead, once the recovery is
underway, existing emergency support
measures on SMEs loans should be withdrawn
to limit moral hazard risks and strengthen risk
management towards SMEs.11
42. Banks also face significant market and
interest risk. Their holdings of equities
account for nearly one half of Tier-1 capital
and bank-held government bonds are over
15 percent of their total assets. Supervisors
should continue to encourage banks to
monitor market risks closely and reduce their
equity holding. To minimize spillovers from
TEPCO’s financial problems, any rehabilitation
plan should follow applicable laws on the
treatment of claims on TEPCO.

43. Core profitability of Japanese banks
remains low. FY2010 results for the major
banks show that, despite improving credit
costs, net interest margins remain very
compressed while overall lending declined.
Reforms to promote more risk-based (as
opposed to collateral-based) lending would
help increase margins while consolidation or
restructuring of weak regional banks, including
through the use of public funds, would
strengthen the banking sector. Privatization of
Japan Post would also ensure a level playing
field and broaden financial intermediation.
44. Possible capital surcharges and other
regulations under the new Basel framework
for globally systemically important financial
institutions (G-SIFIs) could have
implications for Japanese financial
institutions. While the outcome is still under
discussion, if classified as G-SIFIs, those
Japanese financial institutions would have to
meet the surcharges and additional
regulations within the agreed timeline.12
The Authorities’ Views
45. The authorities noted that the financial
sector has remained resilient since the
disaster. They ascribed the smooth financial
intermediation to the response by financial
institutions, the BoJ, as well as the
government. In particular, amendments to the
Act on Special Measures for Strengthening
Financial Functions to enhance financial
intermediation through injection of public
funds into disaster-affected institutions helped
maintain market confidence.
46. Supervisors considered current bank
capital levels to be sufficient to cover credit
and market risks.
 Credit risk. Supervisors recognized that
while credit risk could increase with a slow
recovery, the rise in credit costs was likely to
12

Complex Financial Institutions’, IMF Staff Position
Note, November 2010 (SPN/10/16).

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

be manageable. Banks have also steadily
reinforced their capital base through
retained earnings following large-scale
capital increases since FY2009.
 Market risk. On interest risk, officials noted
that the impact of yield curve changes on
the financial sector was unclear. To reduce
banks’ exposure to equity volatility,
supervisors would continue to encourage
banks to reduce their overall equity
holdings.
 Stress test. The authorities noted that under
a severe stress test scenario of a
1 percentage point slowdown in growth
combined with a decline in equity prices to
the lowest level since 2008, Japanese banks’
capital as a whole would remain above
regulatory minimum levels. Although this
stress test was conducted before the
earthquake, the magnitude of the shock can
be considered similar to the impact of the
earthquake.
47. The authorities shared staff’s concern
over the uncertain situation surrounding
TEPCO. They agreed that resolving TEPCO’s
problems should avoid unintended spillovers
to the financial sector while the government
establishes a framework for appropriately
compensating for damages and restoring
electricity supply.
48. The FSA is focusing on strengthening
risk management to boost bank
profitability. The FSA saw relationship-based
banking as a way to strengthen risk
management by promoting closer consultation
between banks and their borrowers. As
Japanese banks expand lending in Asia, the
FSA aims to monitor closely banks’ risk
management practices. For the weakest banks,
the FSA considered capital injections under the
proposed amendments to the Act on Special
Measures as a potentially effective policy tool
for strengthening financial intermediation and
depositor confidence.
49. The authorities noted that it is
premature to assess the financial impact of
the G-SIFIs regulations now under
discussion. Nevertheless, higher capital
surcharges and other regulations could

JAPAN 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

constrain banks in supporting the recovery. To
minimize this risk, the authorities viewed that
the G-SIFIs policy framework should avoid
excessive regulations, ensure that global SIFIs
be regulated according to their respective risk

levels, and adopt a comprehensive, wellbalanced policy package, rather than focusing
exclusively on additional capital adequacy
regulation.

D. Japan's Growth Strategy after the Earthquake
Policy Issues and Staff’s Views
50. Implementing the government’s
Growth Strategy would help raise trend
growth and sustain fiscal consolidation.
Japan’s potential growth has declined since
the 1990s due to a shrinking labor force and
slower capital accumulation. The government
last year set out an ambitious goal of more
than doubling trend growth to 2 percent by
the end of the decade. Notwithstanding the
large but temporary shock, the earthquake
provides an opportunity to broaden and
accelerate reforms in several areas:

 Boosting employment. Improving access to
childcare by easing the approval process
for new facilities would increase female
employment, while raising the mandatory
retirement age would increase the share of
elderly in the labor force. A new, more
flexible labor contract that gradually
increases employment protection would
facilitate the employment of young
workers and help narrow the gap between
regular and nonregular workers.13
13

See accompanying Selected Issues Paper by
Masato Nakane and Chad Steinberg (2011) “To Fire or
to Hoard? Explaining Japan’s Labor Market Response
in The Great Recession”, IMF Working Paper 11/15.

 Raising productivity through regional
integration. Further trade liberalization,
such as through the proposed Trans Pacific
Partnership Agreement (TPP),14 could open
the door to new export markets and
greater inward FDI. Negotiations would
likely cover protected sectors and further
deregulation and market opening could be
a catalyst for productivity improvements,
particularly in agriculture, health, and other
services.15
 Promoting start-ups and restructuring SMEs.
To support start-ups, the time limit on
public credit guarantees should be
shortened from the current 7–10 years and
some preference for guarantees given to
businesses in new growth areas.
Establishing asset management companies
to purchase distressed loans would
promote bank-led restructuring and
reduce leverage in the SME sector.
The Authorities’ Views and Policy
Intentions
51. The authorities view their growth
strategy as important for achieving fiscal
adjustment and were supportive of staff
proposals that complement their own.
 Boosting labor participation. In response to
the high drop-out rate of women from the
labor force following childbirth, the
authorities plan to increase childcare
services, including by merging

Results from trade models suggest that joining the
TPP could raise Japan’s annual export growth by
between 1–4 percentage points and benefit regional
trading partners.

kindergarten and childcare systems. They
also highlighted job training and matching
efforts to raise employment of the young
and elderly.



 Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement. The
authorities agreed that participation in the
TPP would provide a boost to exports and
encourage new investment in the service
sectors. However, after the earthquake, the
need to evaluate the impact of a TPP on
farming and fishing in the affected regions
has delayed a decision to join negotiations.
The authorities underscored that a plan on
agricultural compensation will likely be
needed to garner broader support for the
TPP.

16

SME restructuring. The authorities were
generally supportive of reforming the
credit guarantee system to promote startups and keeping guarantee maturities
reasonably short and limiting rollovers.16
However, altering the system now would
be difficult given its widespread use and
need to promote reconstruction. They
also
supported
establishing
asset
management companies to facilitate
bank-led restructuring of earthquake
related distressed loans, but would first
need to evaluate the scale of the
distressed loan problem before laying out
concrete proposals.

The average length of a credit guarantee is about
5½ years, shorter than the maximum limit of 7 and
10 years under the regular and special guarantee
systems.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAPAN 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

E. Staff Appraisal
52. Japan’s economy is set to recover later
this year. Supply disruptions are easing faster
than expected, and reconstruction spending
will provide a boost in the second half of the
year. However, the recovery faces risks from
delays in restoring electricity capacity and a
slow pick-up in private demand.
53. A significant downside risk to the
outlook is uncertainty over longer-term
electricity supply. With nuclear power plants
potentially remaining offline following routine
inspections, Japan could lose a significant
share of its electricity supply. Uncertainty over
the power situation and higher energy costs
could undermine confidence and accelerate a
shift of production abroad.
54. The immediate priority is to repair
damaged infrastructure and facilitate a
swift recovery. Timely passage of an
additional supplementary budget that is welltargeted to revitalize the affected regions
would help address downside risks and
catalyze private spending. While other tax
measures could also be considered, financing
should be supported by a moderate increase
in the consumption tax in 2012 to take
advantage of a cyclical recovery and limit bond
issuance.
55. Japan needs a more ambitious
medium-term strategy for bringing down
public debt. To reduce the public debt ratio
by the middle of the decade will require a
reduction in the structural primary deficit by
10 percent of GDP over a 10 year period. Given
the limited scope for cutting expenditures,
fiscal adjustment should rely on
comprehensive tax reforms centered on a
gradual increase in the consumption tax.
Raising the average maturity of public debt
and adopting an explicit fiscal rule based on a
primary surplus and debt target with limited
escape clauses would strengthen the credibility
of these efforts and reduce fiscal risks.

56. Further monetary easing could guard
against deflation risks and support the
recovery. Although the impact of the
earthquake on inflation is unclear, the sharp
fall in demand and heightened uncertainty
about the outlook could add to deflationary
pressures. To guard against such deflation
risks, the BoJ could consider increasing the
share of longer maturity JGBs and private
assets in its portfolio. The BoJ could also
strengthen its communication strategy by
explaining the outlook for inflation measures
that exclude both food and energy.
57. Financial policies should protect
against the risk of an economic slowdown
and higher market volatility. To strengthen
the resilience of the financial system,
supervisors should encourage weak banks to
improve their capital bases and take early
action vis-à-vis distressed borrowers. To raise
banks’ core profitability, a shift to more riskbased (as opposed to collateral-based) lending
would help increase lending margins, while
consolidation or restructuring of weak regional
banks would strengthen the banking sector.
58. Timely implementation of the
government’s growth strategy would help
sustain fiscal adjustment and support the
recovery. Priority should be given to
expanding employment opportunities for
women, youth, and the elderly and raising
productivity by promoting further regional
trade integration, such as through the
proposed Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP).
Reorienting the public credit guarantee system
to support startups and establishing asset
management companies to purchase
distressed SME loans would promote bank-led
restructuring of the SME sector.
59. As one of the largest and richest
economies in the world, Japan is an
important contributor to regional growth

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAPAN

and stability.17 Japan accounts for nearly
9 percent of global GDP and about half of its
international trade is conducted with the
region. Its sophisticated manufacturing base
contributes a large share of value added to
regional production chains and Japanese final
demand is an important and stable source of
export demand for its Asian trading partners.
60. To maintain these positive spillovers,
fiscal and structural reforms are essential.
Fiscal consolidation would have long-term
benefits for its partners by reducing tail risks
from a disruption in Japan’s large sovereign
debt market and freeing up domestic savings
to help lower global interest rates.

17

61. Despite the adversity caused by the
earthquake, Japan continues to
demonstrate its strong commitment to
international cooperation. Japan has enacted
swiftly the law and budget to contribute to the
replenishment of capital of the International
Development Association (IDA) of the World
Bank and other multinational development
banks, as well as the quota increase of the IMF.
62. It is recommended that the next Article
IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. JAPAN: PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
This appendix presents two scenarios: i) a no
adjustment scenario, which leads to a continued
rise in the net debt ratio; and ii) a policy
adjustment scenario that would reduce the net
debt GDP ratio to 115 percent by 2030.
Macroeconomic assumptions. Both real GDP
growth and the inflation rate are assumed to
converge to 1 percent over the long term. As a
result, nominal GDP growth is around 2 percent
per year over the next 10 years. The nominal
interest rate growth differential is assumed to
converge to 1¼ percent (pre-crisis average
since 2000) over the long run.2
No adjustment scenario. Without adjustment,
net public debt would rise and approach
250 percent of GDP by 2030. The no-adjustment
scenario assumes expiration of enacted stimulus
(1 percent of GDP), a modest expenditure
adjustment (1½ percent of GDP), and unchanged
tax policy (no increase in the consumption tax)
over the next 10 years, which altogether
produces an improvement of 2½ percent of GDP
over the next decade in the structural primary
balance.

Policy adjustment scenario. Achieving debt
sustainability will require that Japan stabilize
and put its debt-to-GDP ratio firmly on a
downward path. To achieve this goal, the policy
adjustment scenario assumes a 10 percent of
GDP improvement of the structural primary
balance over the next decade. This comprises of
a withdrawal of stimulus (1 percent of GDP) plus
additional policy measures of 9 percent of GDP,
of which 5 percentage points are assumed to
come from a net tax increase including a
gradual rise in the consumption tax starting
in 20123 and 4 percentage points from
expenditure reforms (e.g., freezing non social
security spending in nominal terms, limiting
growth in social security spending).
Sensitivity Analysis. The debt sustainability
results are sensitive to macroeconomic
assumptions. In particular, a higher interest rate
growth differential (than the baseline of
1¼ percent) would lead to a faster pace of debt
accumulation. However, even with a modestly
higher differential of 2 percent, the net debt-toGDP ratio would still decline over the longer
term in the policy adjustment scenario (see
table). Depending on the size of the interest
rate growth differential, returning the public
debt ratio to its pre-crisis level by 2030 would
require an adjustment of between
12½–16 percent of GDP.

The analyses focus on net debt of the general government
including the social security fund.

Consequently, the average nominal interest rate is assumed
to rise to 3¼ percent (compared to 1.1 percent currently) over
the long run.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

More specifically, the adjustment scenario assumes a
combination of a consumption tax increase by 10 percentage
points cumulatively (2 percentage points each in 2012 and 2013,
and 3 percentage points each in 2015 and 2017); and ii) a
corporate tax cut (0.5 percent of GDP) and a personal income
tax hike (0.5 percent of GDP) in 2013.

The following information has become available since the preparation of the staff report. This
information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Second Supplementary Budget: The cabinet endorsed a modest second supplementary budget
of ¥2 trillion (0.4 percent of GDP) to fund additional earthquake reconstruction. The second
budget does not rely on bond issuances as it will be funded by higher-than-expected FY2010 tax
revenue and unused funds. About half of the spending will be used for transfers to local
governments and income support for
households in affected areas, with the

projects to rebuild affected regions.
Tax and Social Security Reforms: In late June, the joint government and ruling party panel on
social security reform decided to double the consumption tax rate to 10 percent “by the mid2010s” to fund social security, with any tax increase conditional on an economic recovery. The
plan also expands health and pension spending combined with measures to raise the efficiency
of social security spending. The proposal is expected to be discussed with opposition parties and
reflected in a tax and social security reform bill by the end of FY2011 (end of March 2012).
Staff Views: Although modest in size, the second supplementary budget will provide support to
disaster relief and reconstruction. Going forward, timely passage of a sizeable (third)
supplementary budget focused on large infrastructure to rebuild the affected regions will be
critical to help address downside risks and support the recovery. At the same time, new tax
measures are needed to limit bond issuance and strengthen the commitment to fiscal reforms.
On the tax and social security reform plan, staff welcomes the plan to double the consumption
tax by the mid-2010s, but further increases in the consumption tax beyond FY2015 and caps on
spending growth will be required to bring down the public debt ratio over the medium term.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Japan
On July 13, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Japan.1
Background
The Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami on March 11, 2011 brought Japan’s
nascent recovery to a halt. It destroyed large parts of the northeastern coastal areas and
damaged key infrastructure. The destruction far exceeded those of the 1995 Great
Hanshin earthquake near the city of Kobe and is likely to influence economic
developments for some time.
Four months after the disaster, Japan’s economy shows signs of recovery. Recent data
on household spending and production suggest a recovery in activity is underway, and
supply chains are being restored faster than expected limiting spillovers to other
countries. While the trade balance has weakened, the current account has remained in
surplus given income derived from Japan’s large net foreign asset position. As of end
June, equity markets have recouped two-thirds of their losses following the earthquake
and ten-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yields have been stable at around 1.1–
1.2 percent. After concerted intervention in coordination with the G-7 in mid-March, the
Japanese Yen to the US dollar rate has traded in a band of 80-84 until early July.
The Japanese economy is set to expand later this year. After a sharp contraction in the
first half of this year, supply conditions are expected to normalize this summer and
reconstruction spending to pick up steadily. The recovery is forecast to continue in 2012
as the resumption of exports lifts domestic demand and reconstruction spending
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

continues. As a result, GDP growth is expected to slow to -0.7 percent in 2011 before
rising to 2.9 percent in 2012. Headline inflation is projected to be around zero percent in
2011 and 2012, while underlying inflation—excluding food and energy—will likely remain
negative as a result of the still wide output gap. Uncertainty surrounding this outlook is
large with the risks mainly on the downside. The key risks facing the recovery are from
delays in restoring electricity capacity and a slow pick-up in private demand.
The fiscal costs of the earthquake could range between 2–4 percent of GDP spread
over several years. Reconstruction is projected to increase the fiscal deficit in 2011 to
10½ percent of GDP and the net debt-to-GDP ratio to above 130 percent of GDP. In
May, the government passed its first supplementary budget (0.8 percent of GDP) to
repair damaged infrastructure, and the cabinet endorsed a second one in early July
(0.4 percent of GDP) to continue reconstruction. An additional supplementary budget
focused on revitalizing the region is expected later this year.
To support reconstruction and contain risks of deflation re-emerging, the Bank of Japan
(BoJ) has further eased its accommodative policy stance by expanding the size of its
asset purchase program to ¥10 trillion and through a new ¥1 trillion loan program to
support lending activity of financial institutions in the affected regions. The BoJ also
expanded its lending facility to “strengthen the foundations of economic growth” by
¥½ trillion to encourage asset-based lending by financial institutions. Financial sector
policies helped maintain financial stability and ensured a smooth functioning of financial
transactions in the affected regions.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Japanese authorities for their swift policy response
to stabilize markets following the devastating earthquake and tsunami. Directors noted
that economic activity has recovered faster than expected, and the impact of the
earthquake on global supply chains is expected to be short-lived. Nevertheless, the
uncertainty surrounding the outlook is unusually large, with potential risks from delays in
resolving power supply disruptions, and protracted weak demand and market sentiment.
Against this backdrop, policy stimulus remains needed. At the same time, it is important
to address longer-term issues through fiscal and broader structural reforms aimed at
enhancing confidence in public finances and raising potential growth, while also
minimizing risks of negative financial spillovers to other countries.
Directors stressed that the immediate priority for fiscal policy is to repair damaged
infrastructure and facilitate a speedy recovery. They supported a sizeable, well-targeted
supplementary budget that relies primarily on new tax measures, given limited room for
further expenditure cuts and the need to limit government bond issuance. In this context,
Directors welcomed the social security and tax reform plan, which includes a proposal to
double the consumption tax rate by the mid-2010s. They noted that a more ambitious
medium-term strategy, with a significant adjustment of the structural primary balance, is
necessary to accelerate the pace of public debt reduction. This should comprise
expenditure freezes and comprehensive tax reform, featuring a further gradual increase

3

in consumption tax. Adopting a fiscal rule while allowing for some flexibility could help to
enhance the credibility of the government’s strategy in this regard.
Directors supported the broadening of the Bank of Japan (BoJ)’s toolkit under its
comprehensive monetary easing policy to combat deflation. They welcomed the
authorities’ readiness to take additional easing measures as warranted. Should
deflationary pressures emerge, consideration could be given to increasing purchases of
longer-maturity public securities, and possibly private assets, under the BoJ’s asset
purchase program, while paying due regard to their implications for financial market
stability and the BoJ’s balance sheets. There is also some scope for further improving
monetary policy communication to the public.
Directors agreed that the exchange rate should be determined by the markets, reflecting
underlying economic fundamentals. They noted the need to avoid excessive volatility
and disorderly movements in the exchange rate, which have adverse implications for
economic and financial stability.
Directors commended the swift, decisive policy action to protect the financial sector from
the initial shock of the earthquake. Noting potential risks of an economic slowdown and
increased market volatility, Directors considered it important that banks maintain
adequate capital and shift to more risk-based lending. They also encouraged a gradual
withdrawal of special measures that had been put in place to facilitate loans to smalland medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as conditions permit.
On spillovers, Directors welcomed the initiative. They remarked that such analysis
needs to be further developed, and noted that, although policy spillovers from Japan on
the global economy have been relatively limited in recent years, Japan remains an
important contributor to regional growth and stability. Directors considered that fiscal
consolidation would free up domestic savings and help reduce the risk of a rise in
government bond yields that could lead to higher interest rates elsewhere. Timely
implementation of the new growth strategy—with its focus on boosting employment,
raising productivity through regional integration, and promoting startups and
restructuring of SMEs—would help contain any negative short-term effects of fiscal
consolidation measures. Directors commended the Japanese authorities for their strong
commitment to international cooperation and development aid.
