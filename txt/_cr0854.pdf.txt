INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF SERBIA
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Serbia
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Michael T. Hadjimichael
December 28, 2007
Executive Summary
The Serbian economy, now in its seventh year of transition, continues to grow strongly with
moderate inflation, but imbalances are widening and vulnerabilities increasing. Growth was
boosted by inflows and expansionary policies. The inflows allowed for significant official reserve
accumulation, but also complicated macro management by boosting credit and domestic demand.
This was compounded by large wage increases. With mixed progress on structural reforms so far, the
current account has deteriorated and competitiveness slipped. A more uncertain external environment
and continuing political uncertainties have added to vulnerabilities.
To counter these trends and ensure sustainable economic growth, staff calls for a significant
rebalancing of policies, with enhanced structural reforms and tighter fiscal policy, relieving the
burden on monetary policy. This will include:
•

Tightening fiscal policy significantly, as a restrictive fiscal stance is the main short-term
macroeconomic tool available to curb domestic demand and reduce external imbalances.
Specifically, fiscal surpluses are needed until the effects of structural reforms take hold.

•

Focusing monetary policy on entrenching low inflation as part of a gradual move toward inflation
targeting. Competitiveness concerns should be addressed through corporate restructuring and
wage moderation rather than exchange rate intervention, which should focus on smoothing
shocks.

•

Reforming the corporate sector through privatization and, where necessary, bankruptcy
proceedings, and further measures to improve the business climate.

•

Strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework to manage increasing financial sector
risks. This requires continued monitoring of banks’ resilience to shocks, contingency planning,
and cross-border supervisory coordination. Developing capital markets will contribute to growth
and financial stability in the medium term.

The authorities acknowledged the need to reduce external imbalances. They were more sanguine
about risks to the economic outlook and favored a more gradual fiscal adjustment, while focusing on
growth and employment. Budgetary expansion was seen as inevitable in 2008 given existing wage
and pension commitments. The authorities agreed on accelerating enterprise restructuring and have
prepared an ambitious plan for privatization of remaining socially and state-owned companies.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Since the last Article IV consultation, the Serbian economy—boosted by large
capital inflows and expansionary policies—continued to grow strongly, but external
imbalances widened and vulnerabilities rose. The inflows allowed significant official
reserve accumulation, but at the same time complicated macroeconomic management by
boosting credit and domestic demand. This was compounded by expansionary fiscal and
wage policies. With tight monetary policy aimed at containing inflation and slow-moving
structural reforms, the external current account deteriorated and competitiveness slipped.
Rising private foreign debt and euroized credit, along with a worsened external environment,
increased vulnerabilities.
2.
The political situation remains unsettled. The coalition government formed in
May—following a constitutional referendum and parliamentary elections—was well received
by the international community, and its stepped-up cooperation with the International
Criminal Tribunal (ICTY) led to the initialing of a Stability and Association Agreement
(SAA) with the EU. However, the unresolved Kosovo status issue dominates the political
agenda, the EU accession process still faces hurdles, and political campaigning continues
ahead of presidential and local elections likely to be held in early 2008. This weighs heavily
on economic prospects.
II. BACKGROUND
3.
Serbia continues to grow strongly—a welcome result of the structural reforms of
the past (Table 2). The economy has undergone significant changes since 2000: inflation has
come down to single digits; the banking sector was restructured; and hundreds of companies
were privatized—doubling the private sector share in non-budget non-agricultural
employment to about 61 percent. As a result, the corporate sector posted aggregate profits—
for the first time in years—in 2006 (Table 13). These transformations helped raise output by
about 46 percent since 2000. After reaching an impressive 8 percent in the first half of 2007,
GDP growth is projected to settle at about 7 percent for the year, notwithstanding droughtrelated losses in agriculture.
4.
However, sustaining the reform momentum has been a challenge and
weaknesses in the corporate sector persist. Hampered by political uncertainties, structural
reforms stalled in 2006–07. Consequently,

The large inflows—combined with rapid credit growth and expansionary

Credit growth, compounded by large wage increases of 20-30 percent in the public sector,
income tax cuts, and fiscal relaxation ahead of the January 2007 elections, supported robust
growth in 2007. But given

Box 1. Vulnerabilities
By many measures, Serbia is among the vulnerable countries in the region, with rising external
and financial sector vulnerabilities (Figure 6).
Vulnerability

Trend

Manifested in:

Main causes

External

Rising

High and rising current account deficit and
external debt, both among the largest in the
region. Rising financing requirements and
uncertain FDI inflows.

Transition factors exacerbated by weak
corporate structures and large capital
inflows, over half of which are debtcreating. Limited share of "greenfield" FDI.

Financial

Rising 1/

Rapid growth of household credit coupled
with high euroization, unhedged domestic and
off-shore borrowing, which is partly
guaranteed by domestic banks, high ratios of
risky assets.

Capital inflows, relaxed wage policies,
transition factors, aversion to dinar lending
due to past history of high inflation,
underdeveloped capital markets.

Public sector

Stable

Relatively stable public sector debt, but fiscal
slippages, rigidities in public expenditure, and
accelerated spending of privatization revenue
may resurrect sustainability concerns
(Appendix II).

Paris Club and London Club debt write-offs
and privatization receipts. High share of

The high reserve cover is a mitigating factor, but should be interpreted with caution, as gross
reserves are partly matched by large short-term central bank obligations.

2007, despite a surplus of
¼ percent of GDP through October—aided by a cap on expenditures due to the absence of a
budget early in the year—a deficit of about 1 percent of GDP is projected, with an expected
spending acceleration in the remaining two months.
8.
Despite prudential tightening, credit growth remained largely unabated, as
competition in the banking sector—dominated by foreign banks—intensified (Tables 910). Notwithstanding the tightening of macro-prudential regulations by the National Bank of
Serbia (NBS) at end-2006, credit grew by 28 percent annually in real terms in October,
mostly driven by highly euroized household credit. Moreover, a slowdown in domestic credit
to enterprises—due to reserve requirements of 40–45 percent on foreign exchange
liabilities—was partly offset by increased off-shore borrowing.2 Thus, total—including offshore—bank credit continued to grow rapidly, reaching 40 percent of GDP in August 2007.

Subsequently, a new set of measures seems to have slowed consumer credit growth—at least
temporarily.3
9.
High credit growth and euroization have increased financial sector
vulnerabilities.4 Risks from high credit growth are compounded by high credit euroization
(over 70 percent). Intense competition among banks raises concerns over a possible
deterioration of asset quality and profitability, especially in the event of a downturn. A
survey of the nine largest banks revealed a 43 percent increase in non-performing household
loans during the first half of 2007.5
10.
But banking sector soundness has so far been preserved. Rigorous risk
classification rules and high provisioning, reserve, and capital requirements have resulted in
a high risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio of over 25 percent in June 2007. The nonperforming loans of the banking system, although relatively high, have been well
provisioned.
11.
The new monetary policy framework has so far been successful in achieving low
inflation, despite a pickup at end-2007. The framework—introduced in September 2006—
aimed at a gradual transition towards inflation targeting with explicit objectives for core
inflation. The latter declined from 14.5 percent at end-2005 to about 6 percent at end-2006,
aided by double-digit real appreciation resulting from high NBS interest rates. Despite

Selected Issues Chapter III discusses vulnerabilities arising from the growth in household borrowing.

The household non-performing loan (NPL) ratio was 4.4 percent in June 2007. While the overall NPL ratio of
these banks reached 10.4 percent in June, it was 3.5 percent after accounting for provisions.

of inflationary pressures from rising demand, as well as a drought-related spike in food
prices in August. In November 2007, core inflation stood at 4.5 percent—at the lower bound
of the 4–8 percent target range for the year—while headline inflation reached 8.8 percent,
reflecting rising energy and utility prices.

But with large capital inflows, the tight monetary policy stance resulted in sharp
nominal appreciation in 2006, which persisted through most of 2007. The NBS actively
participated both ways in the foreign exchange market in 2006—accommodating foreign
inflows via purchases at a premium

purchases, combined with

NBS securities, and private credit
flows, boosted official reserves to

over $14½ billion by end-November 82
2007 (7½ months of imports). Direct
intervention diminished in 2007 and
84
84
was limited to smoothing shocks,
and the NBS announced the removal
86

of the premium paid to the bureaus
by end-2007. The exchange rate
remained broadly stable in the first

half of the year, but became more
volatile since September, initially
90
90
driven by high inflows following the
announcement of higher bank
capital requirements, and
subsequently by increased stock market volatility and heightened Kosovo-related
uncertainties (Box 2).

The repo rate was cut from a high of 18 percent in November 2006 to 9.5 percent in July 2007.

The exchange rate arrangement is a managed float. Serbia has accepted the obligations under Article VIII and
maintains a system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, except
with respect to blocked pre-1991 foreign currency savings deposits (IMF Country Report No. 02/105).

9
Box 2. Financial Market Volatility in November–December 2007
The initial impact on Serbia of the global market turmoil was limited. Spreads in external
sovereign bond markets rose—broadly in line with other emerging markets—but they had little
impact on domestic financial markets.
In the last two weeks of November, however, both the exchange rate and the stock market
declined by over 9 percent, and spreads shot up significantly. The less favorable external
environment was combined with a growing unease about the outcome of the Kosovo status
discussions. The tensions abated in early December.

Box 3. CGER-Type Exchange Rate Assessment
CGER-type methodologies tentatively point to an overvaluation of the real exchange rate in the
range of 5–16 percent. The assessment is at current policies, stripped of temporary factors and the
effects of projected terms of trade and REER changes.
These are only broad estimates and should be considered with caution. Major structural changes
in the past two decades, the incomplete state of transition, and significant uncertainties ahead—e.g.
regarding the Kosovo status and the EU accession track—complicate the definition of fundamentals
and the measurement of the underlying current account. In particular, the latter is blurred by the
difficulty to calculate the output gap and by uncertainties related to the recent drop in remittances. It
is unclear whether this drop is temporary or permanent (the calculations assume it is temporary, in
part because of frequent data revisions). Moreover, data limitations are important.

2/ For each variant, the first estimate uses staff's conservative medium-term growth rate (5.5 percent). The second assumes that
clearer EU accession prospects and resolution of the Kosovo status brings about higher FDI, productivity, and growth at unchanged
economic policies. For calibration purposes, the 2003-07 average growth rate for 15 Eastern European countries (6.2 percent) is used.
3/ Because of the difficulty to define a desirable NFL target given Serbia's incomplete transition process, the target for this variant was
calibrated as the mid-point between Serbia's projected 2007 level and the maximum NFL position observed in recent years in Eastern
European countries (close to 100 percent of GDP in Hungary and Estonia.)

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS9
14.
With the authorities aware of, but more sanguine than staff about rising
vulnerabilities, discussions focused on assessing external and financial stability, and on
policy options. The authorities aim at increasing employment through higher growth boosted
by improved infrastructure, and anchor their policies to the objective of eventual EU
membership. While conscious of macro imbalances, they considered those as temporary and
reflecting the convergence process, and pointed to the large capital inflows as proof of
market confidence. Staff emphasized the widening external imbalances and the recent global
markets turmoil, which have raised vulnerabilities and heightened the risks to external
stability brought about by unbalanced domestic policies. Consequently, and in line with
earlier Fund advice (Table 1), staff underscored the need for policy-makers to act now to
limit the rising risks by adopting a policy mix that ensures macro and financial stability,
reduces imbalances and vulnerabilities, and supports growth through structural reforms.
A. Outlook and External Stability
15.
Under current policies, staff’s medium-term outlook points to persistent external
imbalances leading to rising indebtedness (Figure 7, Tables 3 and 11). According to staff’s
baseline scenario, real appreciation, insufficient progress on structural reforms, and loose
fiscal policies will dampen growth prospects (down to 5½ percent) and FDI inflows. With
restrictive monetary policy needed to contain inflation, the underlying current account would
improve only marginally—compounded by a deterioration in terms of trade reflecting
declining metal prices. Capital account vulnerabilities would increase along with rising
external debt and continued euroized credit growth (Appendix I).
16.
The authorities viewed staff’s outlook as too pessimistic, while agreeing that
competitiveness had deteriorated. They noted that continued FDI and expected proceeds
from divestiture of state-owned assets would facilitate the financing of current account
deficits. By generating productive investment, these would also address competitiveness
problems and foster sustained growth.
17.
Staff stressed that both upside and downside risks were significant. It
acknowledged that orderly resolution of the Kosovo status and rapid progress toward EU
accession would significantly improve economic prospects. This would lead to higher FDI
inflows and a pickup in investment, exports, and growth. However, given the uncertainties,
staff’s baseline projections did not incorporate changes in the political environment. Staff
also warned that downside risks would be aggravated in the event of disorderly resolution of
9

Discussions were held in Belgrade during October 25 – November 6 (see Informational Annex for details on
mission composition and counterparts).

13
the Kosovo status issue, and that increased global volatility raised uncertainties to the
economic outlook.
B. Restoring External Stability
18.
Despite broad agreement on the medium-term policy agenda and the need to
preserve macroeconomic stability, views differed on the urgency of short-term steps,
particularly the role of fiscal and monetary policies. Staff called for immediate and
significant policy adjustment to reduce the large imbalances, prevent a rapid build-up of
vulnerabilities, and ensure high and sustainable growth in the medium term. In particular, it
emphasized the importance of:
•

Accelerating structural reforms—notably privatization and bankruptcy reform—to
achieve higher economic and export growth and reduce the burden on demand
management;

•

Strengthening fiscal and wage policies to reduce domestic demand, restore external
competitiveness, and alleviate pressures on monetary policy;

•

Pursuing low inflation—critical for macro stability—through continued transition
towards inflation targeting; and

•

Ensuring the financial system’s stability and resilience to shocks.

19.
Staff presented a first-best reform scenario aiming at restoring external stability
through accelerated structural reforms supported by tight fiscal policy (Figure 7,
Table 11). In this scenario, accelerated privatization and bankruptcies would lead to
corporate restructuring and increase potential growth through higher corporate savings,
investment, and exports. Tight fiscal policy would help contain domestic demand (although
impacting growth in the short term) while allowing careful monetary relaxation. Combined,
these policies would help restore competitiveness and contribute to current account
adjustment.10 They would also lower the private debt ratio and increase the resilience of
external debt to exchange rate and FDI shocks, thereby reducing risks to external stability
stemming from the capital account.
20.
Staff emphasized the trade-off between fiscal and structural measures in the
medium term. Accelerated structural reforms are key, as they alleviate the burden on fiscal
policies. However, these take time to be reflected in rising corporate savings, and private
sector imbalances may persist on account of a continued credit boom. Thus, staff’s proposed
scenario called for a sharp and front-loaded fiscal adjustment to secure external

sustainability, while allowing a relaxation in the outer years—assuming that strong structural
measures are taken. Absent those, fiscal adjustment would have to be sustained longer.
21.
The government saw current fiscal and structural policies as sufficient to
address external imbalances, while calling on monetary policy to be more supportive of
external concerns. The government favored a more gradual fiscal adjustment strategy—
given favorable financing conditions, policies inherited from the previous government, and
the still unsettled political situation. In particular, it saw room to use privatization proceeds
to increase much-needed public investment. The government underscored its resolve to
accelerate privatization of socially owned enterprises, but noted that it needed time to
develop a reform strategy for large state-owned enterprises. Finally, while acknowledging
the NBS’ success in bringing down inflation, the government saw room for intervention to
avoid nominal exchange rate appreciation and, thereby, support exports.
C. Fiscal Policy
22.
While the authorities considered that they were making strong efforts to curb
discretionary spending, the 2008 fiscal stance is expected to turn out expansionary. The
budget information provided to staff implied a larger general government deficit in 2008 than
the expected 2007 outcome, despite cuts relative to the budget. Staff warned that with large
increases in the wage bill (mostly the result of carry-over wage hikes from 2007), hefty

15
pension benefit increases, and continued high NIP spending, fiscal policy would further fuel
domestic demand and widen external imbalances.11 The authorities emphasized that much of
the budget was predetermined by past wage increases and existing pension commitments,
and that reneging on those would weaken trust in government institutions.
23.
To help contain domestic demand, staff
recommended a fiscal surplus in 2008. Reducing
external imbalances would require sizeable fiscal
surpluses of 2–3 percent of GDP until the benefits of
structural reforms are reaped. Staff saw a rapid
move to such surpluses as essential to ensuring
external stability, and recommended that the budget
target a surplus of 1 percent of GDP already in 2008.
Experiences from other emerging European
countries show that such fiscal adjustment is
feasible.

There was broad agreement that
expenditure rationalization was key. Staff emphasized that fiscal consolidation should
focus on expenditure control, in particular on stronger wage control (both for the general
government and public enterprises) and better prioritization of the capital budget, subsidies,
and other current spending. Pension benefits should be indexed to price inflation only. Over
the medium term, these measures would be supported by broader civil service and pension
reforms. The authorities agreed that there was room to strengthen investment planning under
the NIP and in the planned public-private partnerships, and noted that they had started to
formulate an investment strategy.

25.
Staff discussed the authorities’ plans for restitution of assets confiscated after
World War II. Staff cautioned that the currently contemplated ceiling of €4 billion (over
10 percent of GDP) would, in the absence of compensating measures, significantly
deteriorate the fiscal position (Appendix II). In case of compensation through bonds, staff
deemed dinar denomination appropriate given the domestic nature of the assets, and a way to
limit government’s foreign exchange exposure.
D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
26.
Staff recommended continuing on the path towards full-fledged inflation
targeting. The NBS has achieved notable progress in bringing down inflation, establishing
11

The pension increase stemmed from a provision, valid until 2008, setting a floor on the ratio of the average
pension nationwide to the average wage.

16
the repo interest rate as the benchmark for dinar markets, and improving capacity in
modeling and forecasting inflation, foreign exchange operations, and communication.12
Nevertheless, formal adoption of inflation targeting would be premature since key
prerequisites—explicit government support and sound fiscal policies—were not yet in place.
27.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the real exchange rate was likely
overvalued, but views on the appropriate policy response varied. Staff urged resisting
calls on the central bank to stem dinar appreciation through active foreign exchange
intervention. The government supported such call, noting that the strengthening of the dinar
had aggravated external pressures and led to sizeable operating losses for the NBS. Staff
emphasized that competitiveness problems should be addressed at their roots through fiscal
consolidation and strengthened structural policies. Staff also pointed out that active
interventions could—given high euroization—undermine the central bank’s inflation
objectives, as well as the repo rate as the main policy instrument. Thus, it urged maintaining
exchange rate flexibility and limiting interventions to smoothing shocks, while using the
available scope for a more accommodative monetary stance in case the inflation target was
undershot.
28.
There was broad agreement that although the inflation objectives should not be
compromised, monetary policy should accommodate price level convergence. It was
agreed that the NBS should aim at the middle of the 3–6 percent core inflation target range
for end-2008. In determining the degree of ambition in longer-term objectives, the NBS
should balance the desire to further lower inflation and the need for structural convergence of
prices during transition.
E. Structural Policy
29.
Staff and the authorities agreed that reforming the corporate sector is the only
way to achieve durable growth, and should be accelerated. Wide-ranging privatization
and restructuring is needed to reduce financial losses in the state- and socially owned
corporate sector, thereby laying the ground for stronger growth, exports, and employment.
Progress was mixed, however.
30.
The authorities pointed to a significant acceleration of the privatization program
of socially owned enterprises. Since the summer, the number of companies offered for sale
has increased significantly, and proposed amendments to the privatization law are expected
to facilitate the sale or liquidation of the remaining ones by end-2008. Moreover, resolution
of the most difficult cases is under way, including through bankruptcies. Staff welcomed

12

17
these developments and supported strengthening of the bankruptcy framework along with
stepped-up initiation of bankruptcies through public authorities where appropriate.
31.
But there was less clarity on state-owned enterprises and utilities. The
government was discussing an ambitious plan to sell a part or a majority stake in the stateowned oil conglomerate and in the national airline, and to launch minority IPOs for the
electricity, telecom, airport, and pharmaceutical companies. While staff welcomed these
initiatives following stalled reforms over the past year, it regretted the apparent lack of
consensus within the governing coalition on these privatization plans, and encouraged rapid
progress—the only way to modernize and ensure the viability of these companies.
32.
There was broad recognition of the need to further improve the business
environment. This involved stepping up efforts to review and streamline a wide range of
legislation and regulations—which the authorities indicated they were preparing.
F. Financial Sector Policy
33.
There was broad agreement that the NBS’ tight macro-prudential stance is
appropriate, notwithstanding some distortions created within the financial system. The
tight macro-prudential stance is justified by the need to ensure that substantial capital
cushions the banking system’s vulnerabilities—partly manifested in rapid growth of
household non-performing loans—due to rapid credit expansion. Moreover, high euroization
and expansionary fiscal policies leave few alternative tools for curbing credit growth. It was
acknowledged, however, that high reserve requirements prompted some disintermediation
through increased cross-border borrowing. Nevertheless, it was agreed that macro-prudential
policies should remain restrictive until vulnerabilities subside.
34.
At the same time, staff urged a greater balance between tightening regulations
and enhancing cross-border supervisory coordination. The authorities pointed to
intensified consultation with banks and progress in signing Memoranda of Understanding
(MoUs) with foreign supervisors. But there was agreement that more could be done to
formalize coordination and improve the information flow.
35.
A strategy for developing Serbian capital markets is needed to help diversify the
financial system and contribute to greater stability. Currently, liquidity in the stock
market is shallow and domestic bond markets are largely inexistent. A benchmark
government yield curve would allow banks to better price dinar products with longer
maturities, paving the way for reduced foreign exchange borrowing. It would also strengthen
the effectiveness of the repo rate in monetary transmission, foster growth of the domestic
institutional investor base, and increase private savings. The authorities were working on a
strategy for capital market development, expected to be completed in 2008.

18
36.
In light of the recent turmoil in international financial markets, staff and the
authorities agreed on the importance of increased vigilance going forward. To safeguard
financial stability, staff underscored the need to continue strengthening the regulatory and
supervisory framework and to monitor banks’ risk management and resilience to shocks. The
authorities cited the work of the NBS’ new financial stability unit. They acknowledged,
however, that transition from a compliance-oriented regime to risk-based supervision was
likely to be gradual.
37.
The authorities have implemented the recommendations of the 2005 FSAP and
are addressing remaining concerns. Regulations on consolidated supervision and
implementation of IFRS standards were adopted. Of the two remaining large state-owned
banks, one was sold last year and the other was opened to a strategic investor. In light of
rapid market development and rising vulnerabilities, the authorities saw merits in an FSAP
update.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Economic growth in Serbia has been strong but unbalanced. Growth at an
estimated 7 percent in 2007 was impressive. While this was in part the welcome result of
structural reforms and privatization of the past, it also reflected high domestic demand fueled
by large wage increases, credit growth, and expansionary fiscal policies of last year.
Investment remains low, and with some of this short-term boost expected to wear out, growth
is likely to decelerate.
39.
Tight monetary policies have been successful in maintaining low inflation, but
wage growth has not moderated correspondingly. Inflation has come down, despite recent
supply shocks and rises in oil and other administered prices, and core inflation—which is
targeted by the NBS—remained well within the target range. But real wage increases of
20-25 percent were clearly in excess of productivity growth.
40.
In the meantime, vulnerabilities have increased. With excess demand translating
into a rapid growth of imports, the current account deficit widened to 16 percent of GDP.
Capital inflows continued, but less in the form of FDI and more as external borrowing,
resulting in a rising external debt. Meanwhile, credit—mostly euroized—grew rapidly.
41.
Under current policies, external imbalances will persist. The absence of a
coordinated policy approach, if continued, would dampen growth prospects while fueling
demand pressures. Thus, staff projects the current account deficit to remain large and
external debt to rise rapidly. The presently unbalanced policy mix of loose fiscal, tight
monetary, and until recently slow-moving structural policies is reflected in an overvalued
real exchange rate, although the size of the overvaluation is uncertain. This and the capital
account vulnerabilities raise concerns over external stability.

19
42.
Fiscal policy needs to be tightened significantly. Restrictive fiscal policy is the
main short-term macroeconomic tool available to reduce external imbalances. Targeting a
tight fiscal stance would help contain excess demand pressures and increase the likelihood of
a turnaround in the current account. It would support monetary policy and create space to
finance growth-enhancing infrastructure needs in the medium term.
43.
However, the fiscal stance for 2008, as laid out in the latest budget document, is
expansionary. Despite efforts in curbing discretionary spending, large public wage bill and
pension increases coupled with continued high NIP spending will fuel a further widening of
external imbalances.
44.
To help contain domestic demand, fiscal surpluses are needed in the years to
come, until the benefits of structural reforms are reaped. A quick move is essential and a
surplus of 1 percent of GDP should be targeted already in 2008, followed by surpluses of
2-3 percent in 2009–10, until the impact of structural reforms on growth and exports fully
materializes. Fiscal consolidation should focus on expenditure savings, in particular by
controlling public sector wages and pension benefits, streamlining subsidies, and prioritizing
capital spending.
45.
Low inflation should be entrenched, including by eventual formal adoption of
inflation targeting once government support and sound fiscal policies are in place. The
NBS should aim at the middle of the 3–6 percent core inflation target range in 2008,
balancing the objective of low inflation with the need for price convergence during
transition.
46.
Competitiveness should be restored through corporate restructuring and wage
moderation rather than exchange rate policies. Attempts to inflate away the loss of
competitiveness, which has its roots in excessive wage increases, slow structural reforms,
and loose fiscal policies, would damage credibility while providing no sustained relief for
exports. Staff supports exchange rate flexibility, with interventions limited to smoothing
shocks.
47.
Accelerating structural reforms is key, but will take time to bear fruit. Staff
welcomes the renewed efforts to accelerate privatization or bankruptcy of socially owned
enterprises and urges completion of the process as soon as possible. It supports opening the
capital of state-owned utilities to private sector participation, including by selling majority
stakes. Major efforts are needed to improve the business environment.
48.
Financial stability risks have so far been managed by building adequate buffers.
Rigorous prudential regulations were appropriate to address rapidly rising vulnerabilities. As
a result, the banking sector is well capitalized. Notwithstanding concerns about
circumvention, the prudential framework should remain restrictive until macro and financial
vulnerabilities subside. The recent turbulence in international financial markets and increased

20
volatility in Serbian markets due to political uncertainties underscore the need for stabilityoriented macro policies and contingency planning.
49.
The supervisory framework should continue to be strengthened. Vulnerabilities
stemming from rapid household credit growth are rising. Safeguarding financial stability
requires continued close monitoring of banks’ non-performing loans, risk management, and
resilience to shocks. Further progress involves continuing to build capacity and strengthening
the dialogue with banks and foreign supervisors. Developing capital markets will diversify
the financial system and contribute to its stability.
50.
Serbia’s statistical data are broadly adequate for surveillance. Staff encourages the
authorities to remove the remaining exchange restrictions. It is proposed that the next
Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Table 1. Serbia: Authorities’ Response to Past Policy Recommendations
Advice from the 2006 Article IV Consultation

Response

Fiscal policy
Sizeable surpluses for the consolidated general
government remain appropriate.

Fiscal deficits observed or planned in 2006–08.

Critical public investments should be funded by
efficiencies in current spending, rather than fiscal
relaxation.

In addition to fiscal relaxation, no drop in current
expenditure (in percent of GDP) between 2005
and 2007.

Structural policy
Acceleration of corporate restructuring and
completion of the privatization of socially owned
and state-owned companies are the central
response.

Privatization of socially owned enterprises to be
completed by end-2008. Privatization of stateowned enterprises stalled, but plans are now
being prepared by the new government.

Swift and consistent initiation of bankruptcy
procedures is required.

Only recent acceleration of bankruptcies.

Improvements in the business climate, increased
flexibility of labor market institutions.

Limited progress to date.

Financial sector policy
Strengthen banking supervision, including in
regard to the exposure of unhedged borrowers to
exchange rate risk.

Regulations strengthened in 2006-07. Further
measures aimed at tightening foreign exchange
exposure to be introduced in 2008. Work on NPL
data and financial stability analysis—including
stress tests—under way.

Strengthen competition in the banking sector;
consider issuing greenfield licenses.

Reform efforts aimed at completing restructuring
and privatization of the remaining state banks. No
new greenfield licenses issued.

Monetary and exchange rate policy
New monetary policy framework as an important
step toward eventual full-fledged inflation
targeting.

Continued progress in implementing the inflation
targeting framework, with the repo rate maturing
into the reference rate for dinar markets.

Scaling back foreign currency interventions to a
“leaning against the wind” role, with increased
exchange rate flexibility.

Limited foreign exchange interventions. Phasing
out of purchases from foreign exchange bureaus
by end-2007.

Appendix I. Serbia: External Debt Sustainability
1.
Reflecting unbalanced economic policies, Serbia’s external debt has been rising
since 2004 despite rescheduling operations and early repayments to some multilateral
creditors, including the Fund (Table A1).13 It reached $24 billion in October 2007, a
30 percent annual increase. The rise was led by private debt, which doubled since mid-2006.
In particular, nonbank private debt has been rising sharply in recent months (95 percent y/y
in dollar terms), as prudential regulation on
Serbia: External Stock of Debt, October 2007
bank activity became tighter. As a result, debt is
now mostly private, a sharp reversal from less

The associated vulnerabilities are considerable.

•

The debt remains vulnerable to a depreciation of the exchange rate, which could be
triggered for instance by political uncertainties or a disorderly resolution of the issue
of Kosovo’s status.

•

The impact of the depreciation shock would be compounded by large unhedged forex
indebtedness in the domestic banking system—the consequence of widespread
financial euroization. Household and corporate indebtedness could rise sharply, with
negative consequences for financial (notably banking) sector soundness.

13

14

See the related discussion in the 2006 Article IV report (IMF Country Report No. 06/384, Appendix III).

Notwithstanding this sharp rise in nominal debt, the external debt ratio has remained around 60 percent of
GDP over the past few years, partly on account of domestic currency appreciation.

43
•

In the medium-term, external debt and financing requirements are projected to
continue to rise significantly if economic policies are not rebalanced so as to reduce
the current account deficit. In addition, the sustainability of FDI is not assured, unless
“greenfield” investment takes over from “non-renewable” FDI (sale of assets). This,
in turn, would require a significant improvement in the business environment in
Serbia. Moreover, the pool of assets that can be sold (state-owned companies,
licenses) not only is finite, but the ability to sell public assets could also be threatened
by a degradation in the political climate.

3.

Standard and ad-hoc DSA tests illustrate these risks:

•

Standard bound tests show the sensitivity of the debt path to the current account
position and the exchange rate. (Figure A1). A larger deterioration of the current
account would rapidly contribute to further build up of external debt, and a 30 percent
nominal depreciation of the dinar would push the debt-to-GDP ratio above 90 percent
of GDP. In contrast, a scenario assuming key variables at their historical averages
shows a return to a sustainable path of external debt. This is because the deterioration
of Serbia’s external position is only recent, The tests also show low sensitivity to
interest rate and growth rate shocks.

•

Ad-hoc scenarios show a rapid increase in external debt (exceeding 100 percent of
GDP in the worst case) should FDI be lower than in the baseline scenario (Figure
A2). These tests include: (i) a standard bound test with FDI lower by half of the
historical standard deviation; (ii) stalled privatization; (iii) significantly lower
greenfield investment; and (iv) a combination of (iii) and (iv). In these scenarios, only
the direct effect of lesser non-debt creating flows was estimated, not the second round
effect on productivity and growth, which would worsen the debt profile.

Appendix II. Serbia: Public Debt Sustainability
General government debt in Serbia is sustainable under current fiscal policies and robust
GDP growth. However, its sensitivity to shocks—exchange rate shocks in particular—
highlights potential vulnerabilities. Sustainability is less assured if quasi-fiscal losses of
state-owned and socially owned enterprises are taken into account, or if the plan to provide
restitution for assets confiscated after World War II proves too costly.
1.
Under the baseline scenario, Serbia’s gross debt-to-GDP ratio would decline from
40 percent of GDP in 2006 and stabilize at 27 percent of GDP in 2012 (Table A1).15 The
sharp reduction in debt in 2006 reflects significant Paris Club debt relief (about
$600 million). The baseline assumes stabilization of the fiscal deficit at around 1½ percent of
GDP in the medium term. Thus, the decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio is due to projected real
GDP growth and the favorable terms on the current debt stock (most of public external debt
is on concessional terms). Real interest rates are assumed to increase over time, however, as
borrowing is contracted at market rates. The scenario assumes no privatization receipts: this
highlights the underlying debt path in the absence of these one-off receipts or if privatization
proceeds are spent.
2.
In the stress test using historical averages, the debt path would be somewhat higher
than in the baseline,16 while in the no-policy-change scenario (assuming a constant primary
balance), the debt-to-GDP ratio would decline slightly more than in the baseline. All other
tests result in less benign developments (Figure A1). A one-time real depreciation of
30 percent results in a significant increase in the debt ratio, demonstrating the sensitivity of
debt dynamics to the exchange rate, as about 90 percent of public debt is foreign currencydenominated (comprising mainly frozen currency deposits and debt to multilaterals and Paris
Club creditors).
3.
To evaluate the implications of quasi-fiscal losses incurred by state-owned and
socially owned enterprises—reported by the Solvency Center at significant levels—a
modified scenario takes into account these enterprises’ deficit, estimated for illustrative
purposes at 2 percent of GDP annually. Under this scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would
15

The debt stock includes gross general government and government-guaranteed debt of the Republic of Serbia,
including debt to non-Paris Club official creditors under negotiation and in non-convertible currencies.
16

Stress tests were conducted using the standardized methodology but with modifications due to data
constraints. Historical data for Serbia are incomplete prior to 2000 and those available thereafter are affected by
debt restructuring operations. Hence, five-year averages (2002–06) were used to replace historical averages for
all variables but the interest rate. The real interest rate was assumed at zero for the stress tests and the
1997-2001 data for 4 countries in the region (Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania) were used to derive its
standard deviation.

48
increase (to 40 percent of GDP), and the debt path would be much more sensitive to shocks.
The scenario also serves to illustrate that significant fiscal loosening would endanger
sustainability and increase the risk of public debt distress. This may materialize if spending
under the national investment program escalates or large public sector wage hikes become
entrenched.
4.
The government’s plan to provide restitution for confiscated assets after World War
II could potentially harm fiscal sustainability. The currently contemplated ceiling of
€4 billion (over 10 percent of GDP), in the absence of compensating expenditure measures,
will significantly deteriorate the fiscal position (public debt would increase to 42 percent of
GDP in 2012). Moreover, foreign exchange exposure of the government would increase if
the financial compensation through the issuance of bonds is be denominated in foreign
currency.

Annex II. Serbia: World Bank Group Relations
Partnership with Serbia’s Development Strategy
1.
Following the formation of the coalition government in mid-2007, the World Bank
has been discussing the policy reform agenda with the Government. Support for the
Governments’ development strategy from the World Bank and the IMF follow the agreed
upon division of responsibilities between the two institutions.
2.
The Fund takes the lead on macroeconomic policies (fiscal, monetary, and exchange
rate) aimed at facilitating sustainable growth, while the Bank takes the lead on structural
policy. In areas of direct interest to the Fund, the Bank leads the policy dialogue in: (i) public
expenditure management; (ii) macroeconomically important sectoral reforms (e.g., in the
energy sector); (iii) pension, health, and social assistance reform; (iv) restructuring and
privatization of enterprises; and (v) legal reforms with a bearing on the business
environment, including labor markets. The Bank and the Fund have jointly led the policy
dialogue in the financial sector, including on the restructuring and privatization of banks, and
in foreign trade.
The World Bank
3.
As of December 2007, total IDA credits and grants committed to Serbia by the Bank
since 2001 amount to approximately $740 million, with an additional $145 million in IBRD
commitments. The Bank has assisted Serbia to make progress against key objectives set out
in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY05–07: (i) streamlining the public sector
(the overall fiscal adjustment has been limited with early gains being reversed, but there has
been a trend toward higher capital expenditure); (ii) encouraging private sector growth
(annual growth averaging 6 percent, with Serbia the lead reformer in Doing Business 2006);
and (iii) reducing poverty (which fell from 12.7 percent in 2002 to 8.8 percent in 2006).
Serbia has now graduated from IDA status and will borrow on IBRD terms in the future.
4.
At end-2007, Serbia has a portfolio of 10 Bank-supported projects under
implementation with a total commitment value of $398 million (including IDA, IBRD and
GEF). Investment support focuses on (i) transport and energy infrastructure aimed at
encouraging regional integration and spurring economic growth; (ii) agricultural,
environment, and irrigation investments to improve production and help Serbia meet EU
standards; (iii) pension and health sector reform to strengthen the quality of service and
improve financial sustainability; (iv) strengthened land administration; (v) energy efficiency;
and (vi) regional development in the economically depressed former mining region of Bor.
5.
A new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was discussed by the World Bank Board
of Executive Directors on December 13, 2007. The CPS envisages base case IBRD lending
of $600 million over the period FY08–11. The CPS’ three main pillars are to (i) encourage

6
dynamic private sector-led growth to ensure that incomes continue to converge with European
levels; (ii) provide opportunities and broaden participation in growth; and (iii) manage
emerging environmental and disaster risks. To increase flexibility and responsiveness, the
Bank will deploy of a range of financial instruments beyond traditional lending, and will also
explore the use of innovative financial products. The CPS outlines a set of agreed investments
and analytical support for FY08 and FY09—decisions on interventions in the second half of the
CPS period will be made as part of a mid-term review process anticipated for late CY2009.
6.
Recent analytical work by the Bank includes a set of Policy Notes for the new
government submitted in July 2007, and reports on decentralization, poverty, labor markets,
and public expenditure and financial management. A country economic memorandum and a
public investment and expenditure management review are under preparation.
IFC
7.
As of December 2007, the IFC’s committed portfolio in Serbia was US$308 million
in 11 projects, the majority of which in the financial sector. In addition, IFC has financed
3 regional funds that include Serbia. Serbia is among IFC’s client countries which most
benefit from IFC’s technical assistance program.
8.
In the financial sector, IFC has contributed to the cleaning-up, rehabilitation, and
privatization of the banking sector through restructuring of IFC’s claims on Serbian banks.
IFC supported foreign strategic investors to establish strong financial institutions (Raiffeisen,
Banka Intesa, NLB), thus supporting mortgage, consumer, and SME finance. In addition,
IFC has supported development of microfinance institutions and introduced new products to
the market, such as credit lines to support energy efficiency investments, by investing in
ProCredit Serbia.
9.
In the corporate sector, IFC supported through its loan and equity investment and
advisory services Tigar Rubber company, a leading regional producer of car tires. IFC also
assisted Tigar’s SME suppliers with a high impact “Supply Chain Management” scheme.
IFC has assisted the expansion program of Mercator, the largest Slovenian food retailer, to
establish new supermarket stores in Serbia. Mercator’s expansion as a retailer is expected to
stimulate competition in the sector and improve the variety, price, quality, and delivery of
consumer goods.
10.
Advisory Services. IFC advisory services are concentrated in four business lines:
value addition to firms; business enabling environment; access to finance; and infrastructure
advisory operations. Recent activities include: (i) support to mediation centers and courts
engaged in the alternative dispute resolution; (ii) support to the Belgrade Stock Exchange in
drafting a new Corporate Governance Code and to companies that want to improve their
standards and join the A listing of the exchange; (iii) support to a growing number of
companies and underprivileged Roma communities engaged in recycling; (iv) support to

7
seven companies introducing international standards to increase their competitiveness and
exports; (v) working with four municipalities on administrative simplification; and
(vi) advising the city government on the concessioning of the Belgrade solid waste and
improving water services.
FIAS
11.
FIAS, a multi-donor service of the World Bank Group administrated by IFC, advises
member countries on improving their investment climate and on methods to attract FDI.
Under a joint World Bank project, FIAS is providing assistance to the government in
improving the quality of regulations affecting the cost and risk of doing business in Serbia by
developing and implementing tools for reviewing the flow of regulation. FIAS is also
implementing several multi-year technical assistance investment generation programs to
support Serbia in its efforts to attract FDI.
MIGA
12.
As of December 2007, MIGA’s outstanding portfolio in Serbia consists of 8 contracts
of guarantee with total gross exposure of $82 million. MIGA guarantees have primarily
supported the expansion of foreign financial institutions in the Serbian banking sector, with
some activity also in the manufacturing sector.
Prepared by World Bank staff. Questions may be addressed to Robert Jauncey or
Simon Gray.

Annex III. Serbia: Statistical Issues
1.
The statistical system has been successfully upgraded in recent years with the
assistance of the IMF and other bilateral and multilateral institutions. Although international
standards are not yet fully met, official data for all sectors are sufficiently good to support
key economic analysis and surveillance. In many areas, including monetary and balance of
payments sectors, internationally accepted reporting standards have been introduced.
However, the country still makes extensive use of definitions that were not updated during
the decade when it was isolated from international developments. A page for the Republic of
Serbia was introduced in the October 2006 issue of the International Financial Statistics
(IFS).
2.
In response to the authorities’ requests, the Fund provided a series of technical
assistance (TA) missions to improve the quality of macroeconomic statistics and support
policy analysis. Since 2001, STA conducted four TA missions on monetary and financial
statistics, three TA missions on national accounts, one multisector mission, and one balance
of payments mission.
A. Real Sector
3.
Real sector data are compiled by the Republic of Serbia Statistical Office (RSSO).
Annual current and constant price estimates of GDP by activity and by expenditure are
available for 1997–2005. In June 2005, the RSSO started publishing quarterly constant price
estimates of GDP using the production approach from 1999 onward. Quarterly GDP
estimates are available with a lag of three months after the reference quarter. The RSSO has
made commendable efforts to adopt the System of National Accounts (1993 SNA), but there
are still problems with the consistency of the GDP estimates from production and
expenditure sides. Data sources are still in need of improvement. Official statistics do not
incorporate estimates of informal activities, which the RSSO estimated at about 14 percent of
GDP in 2003.
4.
The RSSO compiles and disseminates monthly indices of retail prices, consumer
prices, cost-of-living, producer prices, industrial production, retail sales, and wages, as well
as unit-value price indices for imports and exports. The new CPI index, introduced in 2007,
appears in line with international standards.
B. Balance of Payments
5.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the National Bank of Serbia (NBS).
While the data compilation procedures appear appropriate, some components of the balance
of payments (e.g., remittances) suffer from substantial deficiencies. The NBS has made
commendable efforts to improve its estimation of actual flows. In current account reporting,
the NBS could further improve coverage, valuation and classification by adjusting trade and

9
services data for transactions not explicitly declared (e.g., repairs, shuttle trade, grants in
kind, and tourism). In reporting on financial account transactions, the NBS could improve
FDI statistics and remove exchange-rate effects from the estimation of certain financial
transactions, including reserves and arrears below the line.
C. Government Finance
6.
Government finance statistics are compiled by the Ministry of Finance and reported
on a monthly basis. Principal data sources are the Republican Treasury and the budget
execution reports of the spending ministries and first-level budget units.
7.
Since 2001, Serbia has made efforts to bring the existing budget reporting system in
line with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) methodology. But
full compliance has yet to be achieved as implementation of the new chart of accounts,
generally consistent with the classifications of the GFSM 2001, has not been completed.
Fiscal data reporting suffers from frequent re-classifications, especially at the level of local
governments and social funds. While the data on government payment arrears are available
on a quarterly basis, information on accrual of arrears is not available. Aggregate
reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data is not conducted on a regular basis. A September
2006 fiscal ROSC mission concluded that there was scope for improving quality, coverage,
and comprehensiveness of fiscal data.
D. Monetary Accounts
8.
Monetary and financial statistics are compiled by the NBS, broadly following the
methodology set forth in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, 2000 (MFSM), and
meeting the GDDS recommendations with respect to the periodicity and timeliness for the
financial sector data. Monetary data is currently reported in Standardized Report Forms.
9.
Some improvements could still be made. Depository corporations’ claims on clients
published in the NBS Statistical Bulletin are on a net-of-provisions basis, while those
reported for publication in IFS are on a gross basis, as recommended in MFSM. The coverage
of monetary statistics excludes (i) banks in liquidation (as their data are not available on a
timely or comparable, IAS-specified, basis) and (ii) a group of relatively small deposit-taking
institutions that the authorities designate as Other Financial Institutions. The March-April
2006 STA mission proposed that if these two groups of institutions are not covered in the
monetary/depository corporations’ survey, separate tables on their monetary accounts could
be included, for analytical use, in the NBS Statistical Bulletin. Activities of Other Financial
Institutions should be monitored and should they become analytically significant, these
institutions should be included in the coverage of the monetary/depository corporations’
survey. The mission also recommended that the banks’ claims on enterprises published in the
NBS Statistical Bulletin be disaggregated into claims on public and private enterprises. The
NBS began collecting data on nonperforming loans in September 2007.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
January 24, 2008
This statement provides information that has become available since the issuance of the staff
report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation. The new information does not alter the thrust of
the staff appraisal.
1.
Growth slowed in the third quarter of 2007, due in part to the impact of the
summer drought on agriculture, but less than expected. The Statistical Office projects
GDP growth of 7.5 percent in 2007, slightly higher than the staff’s projection of 7 percent.
2.
Inflation increased in December, driven by food and oil prices. End-2007 headline
and core inflation reached 10.1 and 5.4 percent respectively, slightly exceeding staff’s
projections. On December 27, the NBS raised the repo interest rate by 50 bps to 10 percent.
3.
The current account deficit widened to 16.6 percent of GDP between January
and November 2007, fueled by high import growth. The current account deficit for the full
year 2007 is likely to exceed staff’s projection of 16.1 percent of GDP.
4.
Credit also rose sharply. Its twelve-month growth, adjusted for inflation, increased
from 28 percent in October to 36 percent in November.
5.
Fiscal deficits could be larger than expected. Preliminary staff estimates for 2007
indicate that the deficit could exceed projections in the staff report by ½ to 1 percentage point
of GDP, due to high end-year spending on goods and services, capital investment, and
pension arrears. The 2008 budget, adopted on December 26, 2007, envisages a deficit that
exceeds the staff projection by about ¼ percentage point of GDP, largely on account of
higher spending by social funds.
6.
Financial markets have remained volatile since the end of 2007 amid global
financial turmoil and political uncertainties

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 5, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Serbia
On January 28, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Serbia.1
Background
Serbia continues to grow strongly—a welcome result of the structural reforms of the past. Real
GDP growth is projected to reach about 7 percent in 2007. Much has been done since 2000:
inflation has come down significantly; the banking sector was restructured; and hundreds of
companies were privatized. As a result, for the first time in years, the corporate sector posted
aggregate profits.
However, sustaining the reform momentum has been a challenge and weaknesses in the
corporate sector persist. Structural reforms stalled in 2006–07 and substantial progress—and
growth—has been achieved only in a handful of sectors. State- and socially owned enterprises
continue to drain domestic savings while fixed investment remains low. With slow job creation,
employment continued declining and unemployment remained high at 21 percent in 2006.
Nevertheless, capital inflows surged, particularly in 2006, boosted by privatization-related
receipts but also by foreign borrowing—mostly medium- and long-term. This led to rising,
particularly private, external debt.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The large inflows allowed for significant official reserve accumulation (7½ months of imports as
of November 2007), but also led to a surge in demand. This was compounded by rapid credit
growth and expansionary domestic policies—large wage increases in the public sector, income
tax cuts, and fiscal deficits in 2006–07. Given domestic supply rigidities—and a drop in
remittances—the current account deficit continued to widen, reaching 16½ percent of GDP in
the period January–November 2007.
Expansionary fiscal policies contributed to the widening of external imbalances. Driven by rising
expenditure, the fiscal balance has deteriorated by over 2½ percent of GDP since 2005. In
2006, the deficit reached 1½ percent of GDP—some 4 percentage points adrift of the target
envisaged in February 2006 under the Extended Arrangement with the Fund. In 2007, a deficit
of 1¾ percent of GDP is expected.
Despite prudential tightening, credit growth remained largely unabated, as competition in the
banking sector intensified. Coupled with high euroization of credit, this increased financial sector
vulnerabilities, although banking sector soundness has so far been preserved as rigorous risk
classification rules and high provisioning, reserve, and capital requirements have kept banks
well capitalized.
The new monetary policy framework introduced in mid-2006 has so far been successful in
achieving low inflation, as core inflation declined from 14½ percent at end-2005 to 5½ percent
at end-2007—within the 4–8 percent target range for the year—despite headline inflation
reaching 10 percent. The decline in inflation was aided by double-digit nominal and real
appreciation. Monetary policy remained conservative in 2007 as the nominal appreciation
persisted through most of the year.
A combination of weak structural, expansionary fiscal, and tight monetary policies in the past
two years have resulted in a loss of competitiveness. Large pay raises granted ahead of the
elections raised labor costs, and even in industry, wage growth outstripped productivity gains in
2006, although this was partly reversed in the first half of 2007. Nevertheless, export shares
remained on an upward trend despite the sharp real effective exchange rate appreciation over
the past year and a half.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the robust growth with moderate inflation in 2007, and
recognized that this performance reflected, in large part, the impact of tight monetary policies
and the authorities’ progress on structural reforms and privatization during the past 7 years of
transition. However, as a result of the rapid growth of domestic demand fueled by large wage
increases, credit growth, and expansionary fiscal policies, imbalances have increased, the
current account deficit has widened, private external debt has rapidly accumulated, and
vulnerabilities have risen. Directors, therefore, recommended a significant rebalancing of
policies, with enhanced structural reforms and tighter fiscal policy.

3
Directors noted that financial stability risks have been managed by building adequate buffers
and rigorous prudential regulations. Large capital inflows, while allowing significant official
reserve accumulation, have complicated macroeconomic management by boosting domestic
demand. Directors considered that international financial market turbulence, increased volatility
in domestic markets, and continuing political uncertainties have added to underlying
vulnerabilities, and underscored the importance of stability-oriented macroeconomic policies.
Several Directors agreed that the present policy mix of loose fiscal, tight monetary, and until
recently slow-moving structural policies are reflected in an overvalued real exchange rate,
although the size of the overvaluation is uncertain. Others, however, pointed to more benign
indicators of competitiveness. Directors cautioned that under such policies, external imbalances
are likely to persist, with a continuing large current account deficit and rising external debt.
Directors observed that fiscal policy is the main short-term macroeconomic tool available for
reducing Serbia’s external imbalances. They noted that targeting a tighter fiscal stance than that
set out in the budget document for 2008 will help contain excess demand pressures and
increase the likelihood of a turnaround in the current account. Fiscal restraint will continue to be
needed until the effects of structural reforms take hold to support monetary policy and create
space to finance growth-enhancing infrastructure needs. Fiscal consolidation should focus on
expenditure savings, in particular by curbing discretionary spending and subsidies, controlling
public sector wages and pension benefits, and prioritizing capital spending.
Directors welcomed the tight monetary policy, which has been successful in containing
inflationary pressures despite food and oil price shocks. They encouraged the authorities to aim
at keeping inflation at the middle of the 3–6 percent core inflation target in 2008, and to
entrench low inflation, including through the adoption of formal inflation targeting, once
necessary conditions are in place. Competitiveness concerns should be addressed through
corporate restructuring and wage moderation rather than exchange rate intervention, which
should continue to focus on smoothing shocks.
Directors viewed corporate sector reforms and further measures to improve the business
climate as key to enhancing growth and employment, while noting that these will take time to
bear fruit. They welcomed the renewed efforts to accelerate privatization and to implement
bankruptcy procedures of socially owned enterprises and urged completion of the process as
soon as possible. Directors supported opening stakeholding in state-owned utilities to private
sector participation.
Directors supported further strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory framework to
manage increasing financial sector risks. The prudential framework should remain restrictive,
particularly while macroeconomic and financial vulnerabilities persist. This requires continued
monitoring of banks’ non-performing loans, resilience to shocks, and cross-border supervisory
coordination. Developing domestic capital markets should also contribute to growth and
financial stability in the medium term.

Statement by Thomas Moser, Executive Director for the Republic of Serbia
and Srboljub Antic, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
January 28, 2008
1.
We thank staff for the comprehensive set of documents, which present a wellbalanced picture of the economic situation in Serbia. The report spells out very clearly the
significant challenges that the authorities continue to face during a very delicate period in
Serbia’s transition to a full-fledged market economy. On behalf of the authorities, we would
like to thank staff for the constructive policy discussions and the valuable recommendations.
As in the past, the Serbian authorities consent to the publication of the staff papers.
2.
The staff report calls attention to the increasing vulnerabilities and risks surrounding
the Serbian economy. Prolonged political elections and a demanding period ahead, during
which some long-standing and delicate political issues will be tackled, add to the rising
economic vulnerabilities. Our authorities are fully aware of the risks and will do their best to
balance them, while preparing for stronger policy actions for the rest of 2008.
3.
As the staff report points out, the Serbian economy is growing strongly with moderate
inflation. But large capital inflows are complicating macroeconomic management and
external and financial sector vulnerabilities are increasing. These vulnerabilities are rising
also in other regional countries. The authorities have implemented the recommendations of
the 2005 FSAP and continue to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework to
address the remaining financial stability concerns.
4.
The high and rising current account deficit is probably the main economic challenge
for Serbia. The authorities share the staff’s concern, but at this juncture there are some
differences with regard to the timing, the scale, and the composition of the needed policy
response. Particularly, the authorities would like to consider a combination of all available
policies and instruments to address the problem. These differences should be the subject of
continued dialogue with staff.
5.
The fiscal policy stance takes center stage in the staff’s recommendations. The
loosening of the fiscal policy stance has started in the second part of 2006, when the
government received large privatization revenues and decided to use them to meet urgent
infrastructure needs. Elections in 2007 and an extended period of government formation
created pressure for wage increases, which where implemented in mid-2007. Moreover, the
budget for 2008 was strongly influenced by political promises made before the parliamentary
elections, and the prolonged election cycle makes it difficult to address the needed
adjustment. A further component was the last increase in pensions based on the wage
component in the beginning of 2008 as a result of the change in the indexation mechanism to
cost of living only. We would like to stress that a rebalancing of the 2008 budget is still
possible.
6.
Strong fiscal and privatization revenues have created fiscal space to improve the
country’s infrastructure. Due to disinvestment in the 1990s and a very low level of public

2
investment after 2000, Serbia’s infrastructure is in poor shape. The increase in public
investment therefore is seen as an important contribution to the country’s development and
the improvement of the business climate. The size of the planned capital expenditure through
the National Investment Plan (NIP) in 2008 is around 4.5 percent of GDP.
7.
Although headline inflation was higher than projected due to energy and food prices,
monetary policy has kept core inflation well within the targeted range (4–8 percent).
Monetary policy will continue to be tight in 2008. The National Bank of Serbia (NBS) has
set the targeted range for the core inflation objective for 2008 at 3–6 percent. The level of the
inflation objective is thus lower and the targeted range narrower with the aim of achieving
price stability by a process of continued gradual disinflation. In choosing the new range, the
NBS has taken into account that the level should be high enough to allow for smooth
adjustment of the relative prices during the restructuring of the Serbian economy and to put
minimal pressure on the nominal exchange rate.
8.
The Serbian dinar has experienced increased volatility in Q4 2007. Pursuing a softmanaged floating exchange regime, the NBS intervened once in the foreign exchange market
to prevent excessive daily fluctuations. The size of intervention was small, but big enough to
stabilize the market. Regardless of this episode, the NBS will continue to move out of the
foreign exchange market, as shown in 2007 by the small number of days in which the NBS
was active on the foreign exchange market (only 17). The NBS clearly intends to make the
exchange rate more flexible and more dependent on market forces.
9.
Structural reforms have been reinvigorated after the new government took office in
May 2007. The number of auctions in the second half of 2007 has been doubled in
comparison with the first half of 2007. The number of tenders for big companies has also
substantially increased. However, the most important action was that bankruptcy procedures
were finally fully implemented in long standing cases. The prices achieved at some of the
bankruptcy auctions, mainly with companies at attractive locations and land for construction,
were unexpectedly high. The government plans to finalize the privatization process in 2008
with the exception of utilities.
10.
The utility sector will undergo some long overdue changes. The privatization of the
oil company (NIS) and the air carrier (JAT) will start in the first half of 2008. Shares of
5 utilities (energy and telecommunications) and the state pharmaceutical company will be
distributed to the public (15 percent) and current and past employees of the utilities
(2.5 percent). The process of share distribution will last 6 months, while some time
restrictions for the sale of shares will be applied.
11.
In conclusion, the authorities are aware that growing economic vulnerabilities should
be addressed in the near future. They would like to intensify the dialogue with staff in order
to formulate adequate answers to the vulnerabilities and risks, possibly in the form of closer
future relations with the IMF.
