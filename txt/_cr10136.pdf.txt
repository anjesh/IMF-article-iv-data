December 22, 2009
 Discussions: November 10–24, 2009, with Prime Minister and Finance Minister
Bainimarama, Reserve Bank Governor Reddy, Acting Minister of Finance SayedKhaiyum, Finance Secretary Prasad, other senior officials, representatives from the
private sector and donors.


Team: Messrs. Brooks (head), Dunn, Morales (all APD), Ms. Takahashi (FAD),
and Ms. Saeju (MCM). Ms. Vongpradhip and Mr. Toh (OED) participated in the
discussions. Ms. Ferguson (AsDB), Ms. Horscroft (World Bank) and Mr. Cuddihy
(World Bank consultant) joined part of the mission.



Focus of mission: Policies to maintain macroeconomic stability, address balance of
payments financing gaps, and raise growth over the medium term.



Past surveillance: The 2004 Article IV consultation was completed on
August 23, 2004 (http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2004/pn04102.htm). The
key issue was the pace of fiscal consolidation, with Directors divided between the
authorities’ approach and the staff’s suggested acceleration.



Delay of Article IV: The 2006 Article IV was delayed by a military coup (Fiji was
on a 24-month cycle). The 2007 Surveillance Decision contributed to a further
delay, as the authorities discussed staff concerns over the Fijian dollar being
significantly overvalued.



The exchange rate is pegged to a basket. Some controls constitute exchange
restrictions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII.



Outreach: Staff presented a seminar on the regional outlook to the Economics
Association of Fiji and held a press conference at the conclusion of the mission.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic growth in Fiji has been sluggish in recent years due to political developments,
delays in structural reforms, and worsening terms of trade. The economy is expected to
contract by 2½ percent in 2009, as the global crisis reduced exports, tourism and remittances.
In addition, floods damaged crops and tourist infrastructure in early 2009. As a result, foreign
reserves fell to low levels, prompting a devaluation of the currency by 20 percent in April
2009. GDP growth of 2 percent is likely in 2010, driven by a rebound in tourism, the global
recovery, and rebuilding after the floods.
Fiji, however, faces considerable downside risks. Increased liquidity in the banking system
poses risks of inflation and loss of competitiveness, while high government debt and
contingent liabilities (together 70 percent of GDP) raise concerns about fiscal sustainability.
The growth outlook remains highly uncertain due to political developments, volatility of
commodity prices, the risk of natural disasters, and the complex structural reform agenda.
Staff recommended tighter fiscal policy to safeguard macroeconomic stability and
ensure sustainability. Staff advised a reduction in the budget deficit to about 2 percent of
GDP in 2010––excluding the cost of civil service reform––with further consolidation over
the medium-term. The authorities agreed on the need for medium-term consolidation, but at a
gradual pace. The 2010 budget targets a small increase in the deficit to 3½ percent of GDP,
with consolidation planned for 2011 and beyond.
Staff and the authorities agreed that monetary policy should be tightened to ensure
inflation returns to low levels and protect foreign exchange reserves. The Reserve Bank
of Fiji (RBF) recently increased banks’ required reserves and removed ceilings on banks’
lending rates and spreads. The RBF is considering further steps to tighten liquidity, but did
not see the need for a substantial increase in interest rates given the fragile economic outlook.
The authorities are evaluating the possibility of a more flexible exchange rate
arrangement. Staff believe that a more flexible exchange rate would help absorb external
shocks and protect Fiji’s reserve position.
A comprehensive package of structural reforms is being prepared by the authorities to
spur growth and create jobs. This includes reforms to the civil service, public enterprises,
public pension fund, and land-lease system—together with price liberalization. Staff noted
the importance of well designed reforms to lift potential growth.
The authorities expressed interest in a Fund program to support structural reform and
help fill a financing gap of more than US$500 million projected for 2010–12. A program
could also catalyze donor support. The authorities have not made a formal request at this
stage and staff will follow up with them in early 2010.

4
I. BACKGROUND
A. Macroeconomic Developments
1.
Growth has been sluggish in recent years because of little progress on economic
reforms and worsening terms of trade (Figure 1, Table 1). Key land and sugar sector
reforms have been delayed, contributing to a decline in sugar output. The current account
deficit widened from 1½ percent in 2000 to 18 percent of GDP in 2008, as the terms of trade
worsened by more than 15 percent, because of lower export prices for sugar and higher oil
prices. The real effective exchange rate appreciated by 10 percent over the same period and
foreign exchange reserves fell to US$300 million in early 2009, less than two months of
imports. As a result of slow growth, the unemployment rate rose to 8½ percent, and would
have been higher if not for an increase in emigration.
2.
Economic performance has also been affected by political developments that
have strained Fiji’s international relations and hurt business confidence. Tensions
between indigenous Fijians and the local Indian community led to coups in 1987 and 2000,
while political differences within the indigenous Fijian community contributed to a further
coup in 2006. In April 2009, President Iloilo abrogated the constitution after courts ruled that
the removal of the government in 2006 was illegal. After being reappointed as Prime
Minister, Army Chief Commodore Bainimarama announced new elections for 2014. Political
developments resulted in Fiji being suspended from the Commonwealth and the Pacific
Forum and strained relations with some donors.
3.
Fiji’s economy is expected to have contracted in 2009, reflecting the adverse
impact of the global crisis on exports, tourism, and workers’ remittances. Staff expects
real GDP to decline by 2½ percent in 2009 and exports to fall by 30 percent, in line with
other Pacific Island countries (Figure 2). On the positive side, lower commodity prices have
reduced the import bill.
4.
The economy was also hit by flooding in January 2009 that damaged tourism,
crops, and infrastructure. A request for Emergency Natural Disaster Assistance was issued
to the IMF Executive Board in April, but was later withdrawn because of political events.
5.
RBF devalued the currency by 20 percent in April 2009 to stem the loss of
foreign exchange reserves. The RBF also intensified exchange controls, including on
dividend payments to foreign companies. Following the devaluation, weak economic activity
and lower commodity prices helped contain inflation (Figure 3).
6.
The devaluation helped reverse the sharp decline in foreign exchange reserves.
Reserves doubled between April and November 2009, to reach US$593 million, almost four
months of imports. About half the increase came from a pickup in remittances and an
improvement in the trade balance (Figure 4). Most of the remaining increase was due to the
SDR allocation (US$93 million) and repatriation of foreign assets of the Fiji National

Provident Fund (FNPF, a public pension fund). Tighter exchange controls also played a role
in the reserve accumulation.
7.
Tourist arrivals fell by almost 25 percent year-on-year in early 2009 because of
the global crisis and January floods, but recovered mid-year (Figure 5). A pickup in
Australian tourists drove the rebound, as the Australian economy recovered from the global
crisis and the devaluation of the Fijian dollar against the Australian dollar made Fiji a more
attractive destination.
8.
Recent developments have put considerable pressure on the budget. Tax revenue
was hit by the fall in economic activity, with a shortfall of about 10 percent relative to the
budget in the first 10 months of the year. Capital spending increased to address infrastructure
needs and rebuild after the floods, but was limited overall by weaknesses in implementation
capacity. Government also restrained current spending by containing wage increases.

9.
The fiscal deficit increased to about 3 percent of GDP in 2009 from near balance
in 2008 (Figure 6, Table 2). Preliminary data on financing shows that the FNPF provided
most of the funding, as bank lending to government reached sovereign exposure limits.
Central government debt is expected to rise to 53 percent of GDP by end 2009.
10.
Contingent liabilities arising from poor performance of public enterprises are
sizable. Net losses of the Fiji Sugar Corporation, Fiji Electricity Authority and Air Pacific
amounted to 1 percent of GDP in 2008/09 and entail fiscal risks, while central government
guarantees of public enterprise debt amount to 15 percent of GDP at end 2008.
11.
Bank liquidity has risen sharply in recent months but credit growth has slowed.
Banks’ excess reserves fell to near zero in early 2009 as foreign exchange reserves declined,
but have risen to historically high levels (more than 13 percent of deposits) as forex reserves
have recovered (Figure 7, Table 3). Bank credit to the private sector picked up in 2008, but is
likely to contract in real terms in 2009, as banks have taken a cautious approach in light of
heightened political and economic uncertainties. Nonbank lending expanded rapidly, with
FNPF’s new lending to the private sector and quasi-government agencies exceeding total
new lending by banks in the year to June 2009. However, FNPF’s management has since
restricted new lending.
12.
The RBF has begun to absorb excess liquidity and remove interest rate and
credit controls. To make loans affordable, RBF introduced ceilings on bank lending rates
(7¾ percent on average) and bank spreads (4 percent) in early 2009. However, these
measures discouraged banks from lending as they were forced to concentrate on low-risk
clients. In recent months, the RBF announced the removal of ceilings on banks’ lending rates
and spreads by January 2010 and removed bank-by-bank credit ceilings. The RBF also
increased the statutory reserve requirement on banks from 5 to 7 percent of deposits, to
reduce excess liquidity.
13.
The external current account deficit is expected to narrow to about 9 percent of
GDP in 2009, still high by regional standards (Figure 8, Table 4). Despite high current
account deficits in recent years, external debt is low at 13 percent of GDP in 2008, as deficits
were financed mainly by FDI in the tourism sector. External financing from official sources
has been limited since the 2006 coup. The AsDB approved an emergency assistance loan of
US$17½ million in August 2009 for flood damage. Loans for infrastructure of over
US$200 million are under negotiation with banks overseas.
B. Outlook and Risks
14.
GDP growth of 2 percent is likely in 2010. Growth will be driven by the rebound in
tourism, the global recovery, and rebuilding after the floods. Over the medium term, growth
is likely to settle at around 2½ percent assuming some fiscal consolidation and progress on
structural reforms (baseline scenario in text table and Table 5). Stronger growth could be

achievable with greater fiscal adjustment and significant progress on structural reforms,
especially civil service and land reform.
15.
There are considerable risks to macroeconomic and external stability if sound
policies are not pursued. A downside scenario would see a continuation of sluggish GDP
and export growth and a depletion of reserves, with heightened risks in 2011 when the
US$150 million sovereign bond falls due (text table). Main downside risks are:


Increased liquidity may translate into higher inflation, undermining macroeconomic
stability, and eroding competitiveness.



Slow progress in reducing the budget deficit could threaten fiscal sustainability.



Structural reforms may be delayed further if the political complexities of civil service
and land reforms are not resolved.



The economy is vulnerable to a variety of shocks, including a decline in external
demand for tourism and exports, higher oil prices, natural disasters, and political
tensions.



The reliance on tourism as the main source of growth increases Fiji’s vulnerability to
shocks. Moreover, environmental concerns may limit growth potential in tourism.

16.
The authorities broadly agreed with the outlook. They expect tourism arrivals to
pick up with new airline routes and business confidence to recover with progress on
structural reforms.

15
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy
17.
Staff commended the authorities for containing the overall deficit to about
3 percent of GDP in 2009 in the face of an unexpectedly sharp fall in revenue.
Expenditure restraint limited the deficit to about the level projected in the November 2008
budget, even though the flooding in early 2009 hit revenues and increased the need for
spending. Restraining expenditures was appropriate, though some spending cuts are not
sustainable.
18.
The authorities are targeting a deficit of 3½ percent of GDP in the 2010 budget.
Capital spending is projected to rise by more than ½ percent of GDP because of rebuilding in
flood-affected areas and upgrading of infrastructure. Current expenditure is budgeted to fall
relative to GDP, with no civil service wage increase and some redundancies as a result of
corporatization of the water authority, government printing and procurement. The deficit
would be about 3¼ percent of GDP excluding the cost of redundancy packages.
19.
To safeguard macroeconomic stability, staff advised a more substantial
reduction in the deficit to about 2 percent of GDP in 2010 (excluding the cost of civil
service reform). High central government debt and contingent liabilities (together about
70 percent of GDP excluding FNPF) call for a lower deficit to ensure fiscal sustainability. A
lower deficit would reduce the risk of RBF financing, which could be inflationary, and
reduce pressure on foreign exchange reserves, given limited external financing. Staff
supported an increase in capital spending to address infrastructure needs, but noted that cuts
in current expenditure are needed to limit the deficit. Staff also strongly recommended that
all capital expenditure be recorded in the budget.1
20.
Over the medium-term, the authorities intend to reduce the budget deficit
gradually and thereby lower central government debt to 50 percent of GDP by 2014. In
order to ensure sustainability, staff urged a faster pace of consolidation in line with the
authorities’ earlier plans (in the 2009 budget) to reduce central government debt to 45 percent
of GDP by 2014. A faster pace of fiscal consolidation would be necessary in the absence of
pension reforms at the FNPF (see below).
21.
Staff stressed that fiscal consolidation will require credible expenditure and
revenue measures. Substantial efforts are needed to reduce the wage bill through welldesigned civil service reform. In addition, there is potential to trim subsidies by better
targeting assistance to vulnerable groups and to improve expenditure management by
enhancing transparency and accountability (Table 6). Revenue can be strengthened by
1

Externally-financed infrastructure spending of 2–3 percent of GDP for 2011–13 is recorded outside the budget
to simplify procurement procedures for these projects.

16
eliminating tax holidays, streamlining tax incentives, and improving tax administration
(Table 7).2 Excise taxes on luxury goods and taxes on petroleum could be raised and the
VAT rate increased if necessary.
B. Monetary Policy
22.
Staff and the authorities project inflation to rise to 7–8 percent y/y by early 2010.
Staff pointed to the risk that inflation would not return to low levels if higher inflation
expectations fed into wage agreements. The authorities observed that wage increases have
been muted thus far, but business contacts were concerned about potential increases in
minimum wages.
23.
Staff argued for a tightening of monetary policy. A tighter stance is needed to
avoid a loss of foreign exchange reserves and lock in the competitive gain from the
devaluation by ensuring that inflation falls to about 3 percent by end-2010 (as in staff’s
baseline projection). Staff welcomed the recent increase in the statutory reserve deposit ratio
and the removal of the ceiling on banks’ lending rates and spread. But more action is needed
given that banks’ excess reserves have risen sharply. Excess liquidity should be mopped up
by further raising the reserve requirement, issuing RBF bills at market rates, and establishing
a standing deposit facility. In addition, RBF financing of the government should be strictly
limited.
24.
Staff advised a simplification of the monetary operations framework. This can be
achieved by making the interest rate on a new standing deposit facility the policy rate, that is
set in line with monetary policy objectives. To tighten policy at this point, the policy rate
should be higher than the RBF’s current minimum lending rate of 3 percent. In addition, the
RBF should discontinue the policy of directing lending to priority areas since this distorts
bank lending decisions.
25.
The authorities agreed on the need to tighten monetary policy and simplify the
framework. They are considering further steps to remove excess liquidity but did not see the
need for a substantial increase in interest rates given the fragile economic outlook.
C. Financial Sector Policy
26.
FNPF dominates the financial sector and its performance has weakened. FNPF
assets are equivalent to 60 percent of GDP, half of which are held in government debt.
FNPF’s nonperforming assets have increased to 20 percent of total assets. In the past year,
FNPF has been pressured to accept low interest rates on government debt, liquidate some
international assets, and fund losses of public enterprises.

2

Better tax administration reduced tax arrears from 3 to 2 percent of GDP in the past two years.

17
27.
Staff advised fundamental reform of the FNPF to make it actuarially sound. The
authorities are awaiting completion of a study by consultants before taking action and are
considering opening the superannuation industry up to competition. A fundamental measure
would be to reduce the generous rate of conversion of benefits to annuities to protect FNFP’s
reserves and thereby reduce the government’s contingent liability.3 Additional measures
include:


Making FNPF’s management independent of government and responsible to
beneficiaries.



Improving risk management as recommended by the RBF in their September 2009
supervision report.



Reducing government’s reliance on FNPF to finance its deficit and losses of public
enterprises since this undermines the fund’s soundness.



Curtailing lending to the private sector until new governance is in place, given
FNPF’s history of poor lending decisions.

28.
The RBF has enhanced bank supervision but further steps are needed. Banks
appear sound, with strong profits, low nonperforming loans and high capital (Figure 9).
Stress tests, however, show some vulnerabilities in smaller banks. These tests should be
reviewed with banks and timely remedial actions taken if needed, including by raising
capital. In addition, the RBF should enhance risk-based analysis and supervision of banks
and FNPF. Progress has been made on a number of recommendations of the 2006 FSAP
mission, including steps to make the RBF more independent (Table 8).
D. External Vulnerabilities and Financing Gap
29.
The external current account deficit is projected to remain sizable at 10–
12 percent of GDP over the medium term. This assumes that the real effective exchange
rate settles at 12–13 percent below the pre-devaluation level, tourism recovers, and that
financing is available on reasonable terms to fund the current account deficit.
30.
External vulnerabilities arise from natural disasters, the narrow export base,
and volatility of import prices.


3

Although reserves exceed total external debt, higher coverage than the current 3½–
4 months of imports would be prudent in light of the risk of natural disasters, such as
the flooding in early 2009 and the tsunami that hit Samoa and Tonga in late 2009.

The government contingent liability associated with FNPF arises primarily from the unfunded portion of
annuities. With the current rate of conversion of benefits to annuities of 15 percent, FNPF reserves could be
depleted by 2029. An actuarially fair rate of conversion would be around 10 percent.



Forex earnings rely on sugar, tourism, and remittances. Sugar prices have fallen as the
EU has lowered its preferential prices, and tourism earnings and remittances have
been volatile.



A sharp increase in oil prices would hit foreign exchange reserves. A US$10 per
barrel increase in world oil prices would increase the oil import bill by about
US$50 million.

31.
Given the external vulnerabilities, estimates of the financing gap are highly
uncertain. Staff’s baseline scenario is illustrative only and shows that additional external
financing of more than US$500 million is needed over 2010–12 to keep reserves at a
minimum of 3½ months of imports, assuming some fiscal consolidation and structural
reforms. More than half the gap arises in 2011 when a US$150 million sovereign bond
matures, as staff assume this bond is not rolled over and that there is no new financing from
international capital markets (text table). The extent of financing from this source depends on
the strength of the authorities’ economic policies and on political developments that may
affect investor confidence. The authorities believe they could fill the financing gap by
rolling over the sovereign bond and borrowing from donors or the IMF.

Debt sustainability analysis shows a number of vulnerabilities. Shocks to the
outlook could push central government debt to more than 60 percent of GDP by 2014
(Figure 10). While external debt is low at present, a combination of shocks to interest rates,
GDP growth and the current account could raise debt to almost 40 percent of GDP
(Figure 11).

E. Exchange Rate Policy
33.
The 20 percent devaluation in April 2009 reduced the degree of overvaluation,
which staff now estimates at 0–15 percent (Box 1). However, the exchange rate assessment
is complicated by weaknesses in balance of payments data and uncertainties about the size of
the external financing gap over the medium term, and how it will be filled.
34.
Staff supported the authorities’ intention to move toward a more flexible
exchange rate arrangement. The exchange rate peg to a basket has served as a nominal
anchor, but led to a substantial overvaluation by end-2008 because of adverse terms-of-trade
shocks. A move toward a more flexible exchange rate will help Fiji absorb external shocks
and protect its reserve position. Staff recommended adopting a band of ±2 or 3 percent
around the current peg and advised that the RBF be given autonomy to widen the band or
move the central parity as needed. A shift to a more flexible exchange rate regime would
need to be buttressed by tight monetary and fiscal policies, especially in the initial stage.
35.
Some exchange restrictions are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII.
Restrictions arise from tax certification requirements before foreign companies can remit
profits abroad and from limits on large payments (e.g., oil imports and dividends). Staff does
not recommend IMF Executive Board approval of these restrictions and advises that they be
removed.
F. Structural Reforms
36.
The authorities plan sweeping structural reform to ensure fiscal sustainability,
spur growth, and reduce poverty. Their priorities are reforms to the civil service, public
enterprises, sugar sector, and land-lease system, together with price liberalization. The AsDB
provided advice on civil service and public enterprise reform, and the World Bank on land
and sugar sector reform.4
37.
Fiscal sustainability rests on the implementation of a well-designed and
comprehensive civil service reform. Staff supported the authorities’ proposed study on
right-sizing of government (Box 2). Staff noted that actions to identify non-core service areas
that can be corporatized, privatized or outsourced should be continued.

4

The AsDB and the World Bank have no concrete plans to lend to Fiji at this stage.

23

BOX 1. FIJI: EQUILIBRIUM REAL EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE RATE
The April 2009 devaluation reduced
the degree of overvaluation. Standard
approaches suggest the currency is
overvalued by 0–15 percent, as the
current account deficit is projected to
remain high over the medium term.
Current account projections assume
regularization of dividend payments
(US$180 million) presently subject to
exchange control.
The macroeconomic balance
approach suggests an equilibrium
current account deficit of 7 percent of
GDP, implying an 11 percent
overvaluation. Also, a rough
application of the external sustainability
approach shows a 13 percent
overvaluation.
The ERER approach suggests that the
exchange rate is in line with
fundamentals. This assumes a further
decline in the terms of trade and a real
depreciation of 12–13 percent after the
exchange rate pass-through to domestic
prices is complete.

The rebound in tourism and foreign
reserves since April implies no
overvaluation at present. A simple
econometric analysis shows that a onepercent real depreciation leads to a
4 percent increase in gross reserves,
controlling for external demand (proxied
by Australian real income). This
suggests that most of the increase in
reserves since April (excluding the SDR
allocation and FNPF asset repatriation)
was due to the devaluation.

The authorities have taken some
steps to reduce the number of civil
servants. The retirement age was
reduced from 60 to 55 years in mid2009 releasing 2,200 officials
(7 percent of civil servants), but
40 percent of these vacancies have
already been filled. Water,
procurement, and printing services are
being corporatized, which will make
1,000 staff redundant.

30

An

Spending on wages and salaries for
civil servants is relatively high in
Fiji. The central government wage
bill is over 10 percent of GDP, about
the median for Pacific and Caribbean
countries, but the share of total
spending on wages and salaries
(nearly 40 percent) is relatively high.
This reflects both high pay rates and
the sizable civil service. Civil servants
are, on average, paid 3½ times GDP
per capita. While below the average
for Pacific countries, this ratio is still
high. In addition, the ratio of civil
servants to the population is above
comparator countries.

25
38.
Public enterprises are a source of significant fiscal risk. To eliminate losses and
encourage private investment in these areas, tariffs for all goods and services provided by
public enterprises should be raised to full cost recovery levels. For example, the Fiji
Electricity Authority’s tariffs—among the lowest in the region—should be raised to reflect
the cost of imported fuel and adjusted over time in line with changes in import costs. Tariff
adjustments should be accompanied by well-targeted transfers to protect the poor. The
authorities are considering raising tariffs, strengthening oversight of public enterprises, and
moving regulatory functions to an independent entity to improve governance.
39.
There is an urgent need to address Fiji Sugar Corporation’s (FSC) financial
difficulties. FSC is an inefficient public sector monopoly that processes sugar and suffered
losses equivalent to ¾ percent of GDP in 2008/09. The authorities are considering a number
of options, including privatization. Staff advised that viable sugar mills be privatized to allow
for competition, and unviable mills closed. For privatization to be successful the land-lease
system must be reformed and contracts between mills and growers should be commercially
based.
40.
Investment and job creation will be encouraged by land reform. As much as
40 percent of arable land is currently underused due to problems with the administration,
pricing and enforceability of leases. This discourages mechanization and the commercial use
of land, including as collateral to obtain financing. Increased certainty in land leases will spur
development and diversification of agriculture.
41.
Staff welcomed steps to liberalize prices, as these controls distort market signals.
The authorities recently removed price surveillance over almost 150 items and announced
that remaining price controls—mostly on basic food items—would be removed over the next
year. The 2010 budget introduced a food voucher program costing 0.1 percent of GDP to
help compensate vulnerable groups for price rises.
G. Other
42.
Fiji’s macroeconomic statistics are generally adequate for surveillance, but some
problems remain. Staff welcomed the recent revisions to the national accounts and balance
of payments. However, errors and omissions in the balance of payments remain sizable and
GDP expenditure-side data are not publicly available. Moreover, budget reporting lacks
transparency and no updates are published during the fiscal year. Staff of the Pacific
Financial Technical Assistance Centre is working with the authorities to address the
statistical weaknesses.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Economic performance has been weak in recent years due to political
developments, delays in structural reforms, and worsening terms of trade. The economy
is expected to contract by 2½ percent in 2009 but a recovery is likely in 2010, led by a

26
rebound in tourism. Growth over the medium-term should rise to 2½ percent with fiscal
consolidation and progress on structural reforms.
44.
Fiji, however, faces considerable downside risks. Excess liquidity in the banking
system and high government debt threaten macroeconomic stability. The economic outlook
remains highly uncertain because of political developments, volatility of commodity prices,
the risk of natural disasters, and the complex structural reform agenda.
45.
The authorities are to be commended for their efforts to limit the overall deficit
in 2009 to the budgeted level of about 3 percent of GDP. This is being achieved by
containing expenditure in the face of an unexpected 10 percent fall in revenue this year,
though some spending cuts are not sustainable.
46.
Concrete measures are needed to reduce central government debt over the
medium term to ensure fiscal sustainability. Limiting the 2010 budget deficit to around
2 percent of GDP—excluding costs associated with civil service reforms—would begin to
reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio. For the medium term, the authorities should adhere to their
earlier target of reducing central government debt to 45 percent of GDP by 2014. A faster
pace of fiscal consolidation would be necessary in the absence of pension reforms at the
FNPF. Expenditure can be contained through civil service reform and revenue can be
strengthened by rationalizing tax incentives, improving tax administration and raising excise
taxes.
47.
Monetary policy should be tightened to ensure inflation returns to low levels and
protect foreign exchange reserves. The recent increase in the statutory reserve deposit ratio
and the removal of ceilings on bank lending rates and spreads are welcome steps, but further
measures are needed to absorb excess liquidity.
48.
The 20 percent devaluation in April 2009 reduced the degree of overvaluation of
the exchange rate, but the external financing gap exceeds US$500 million for 2010–12.
The overvaluation is estimated at 0–15 percent but is complicated by data weaknesses and
uncertainties about the size of the financing gap over the medium term and how it would be
filled.
49.
Staff recommend a move toward a more flexible exchange rate to help Fiji
absorb external shocks and protect its reserve position. A shift to a more flexible
exchange rate regime would need to be buttressed by tight monetary and fiscal policies.
50.
The Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF, a public pension fund) should be
reformed to make it actuarially sound. The generous rate of conversion of benefits to
annuities needs to be reduced and management should be made independent of government
and responsible to beneficiaries. The government should also reduce its reliance on FNPF
financing.

27
51.
Recent improvements in bank supervision are welcome but further steps toward
risk-based supervision are needed. Stress tests of banks by the RBF show that some
smaller banks are vulnerable to adverse shocks. These tests should be reviewed with the
banks, and remedial action should be taken if needed, including by raising capital.
52.
Sweeping structural reform is crucial to ensure fiscal sustainability, spur
growth, and create jobs. Reforms to the civil service, public enterprises and land-lease
system—together with price liberalization—should help lift potential growth if they are
designed well and implemented fully. The social impact of redundancies should be mitigated
through retraining and/or voluntary packages.
53.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on a 12-month cycle.

Table 6. Status of Key 2004 Fiscal ROSC Recommendations
2004 ROSC
Clarify the status of the suspended 1999 Public
Finance Management Law.

Address weaknesses in compliance of legal and
regulatory requirements on budget implementation.
Simplify tax statutes, in particular, the Income Tax
Act, narrowing the room for administrative
discretion.

Strengthen the policy framework for publiclycontrolled financial institutions, such as FNPF, Fiji
Development Bank, and the Housing Authority.
Monitor the soundness of their financial positions.

Establish sound internal controls within ministries,
departments, and Fiji Islands Revenue and
Customs Authority (FIRCA), by: (i) upgrading the
capability of the current accounting system,
(ii) conducting basic reconciliation processes,
(iii) taking effective and timely disciplinary action
for contravention.
Introduce an internal audit unit and strengthen
FIRCA’s Internal Audit Committee.
Strengthen audit capacity.
Improve the quality and expand the scope of the
information provided in the annual budget
documents, in accordance with the GFS.

Introduce quarterly reporting by MOF on the fiscal
outturn and present a mid-year report on budget
implementation to parliament, including revised
spending and revenue forecasts.

Status
The 1999 law was replaced by the new 2004
Financial Management Act (the 2004 FMA) and
other instructions, providing a legislative framework
to support financial management reform, which
envisages performance budgeting, moving to actual
accounting over the medium term, and introducing a
new financial management information system
(IFMIS).
Compliance remains weak. A draft on accounting
protocols has been prepared.
The new Tax Administrative Decree (effective
January 1, 2010) harmonizes and simplifies
administrative provisions in Income Tax Act, VAT
Decree, Hotel Turnover Tax, Gambling Turnover
Tax, and Land Sales Act. However, there is still room
for discretional administrative decisions.
Financial reports are prepared quarterly by the
Ministry of Public Enterprises and annual audited
financial reports are submitted to the Cabinet.
However, oversight is not harmonized, with the
Ministry of Public Enterprises overseeing some
public enterprises, while the Ministry of Finance
oversees the Fiji Development Bank.
Not yet fully enforced.
(i) An Integrated Financial Management Information
System has been partly implemented (four ministries,
including the Ministry of Health, are yet to adopt it).
(ii) The reconciliation process is neither effective nor
timely. (iii) Disciplinary action is not taken in most
cases. Instructions are being reviewed to introduce
disciplinary measures for noncompliance.
Internal audit was introduced in 2008.
External Audit has been strengthened in the last few
years.
Public agencies and expenditures that are outside the
budget should be included, for example FIRCA, the
Housing Authority, and some large infrastructure
projects. In addition, some expenditure items are
misclassified, e.g., some capital transfers should be
reclassified as current transfers.
Quarterly information on revenue is published, but
no quarterly information on expenditure is available.
Internal monthly revenue and expenditure reports are
available for some areas. The quality of reporting
needs to be improved.

34
Table 7. Status of Key FAD Recommendations on Tax Policy and Administration
2009 TA on Tax Incentives

Status

Reduce the corporate tax rate to 25
percent in 2012.

The corporate income tax rate was reduced from 31 percent in
2008 to 28 percent in 2010 and 20 percent for companies listed
on the South Pacific Stock Exchange with more than 40 percent
local equity shareholding. No further CIT rate cuts are currently
planned, as streamlining of incentives has not been put in place.

Eliminate the provision of tax holidays
as of December 31, 2011.

Tax holidays have not been eliminated. However, no new tax
holidays were introduced in the 2010 Budget.

Restructure investment allowances by
replacing by, say, a 20 percent
investment allowance and providing a
higher, say, a 30 percent allowance for
key priority areas in 2012.

The 2009 Budget extended periods of some allowances.

Eliminate most sector-specific and
employment-related incentives.

The employment tax reduction scheme was extended to end
2010.

Eliminate discretion of the Minister of
Finance to provide ad hoc tariff
concessions.

Discretionary provisions under the Customs Tariff Act have
been maintained. Ad hoc tariff exemptions have been
temporarily suspended by the Minister.

Undertake a consultative process to
assess the tax system for the
development of the Northern Region.

The 2009 Budget sets up a Tax Free Region in the Northern
Region. A consultative process was undertaken with the private
sector and shareholders to review the incentives during the
Economic Summit held in Suva this year. The Fiji Trade and
Investment Board has set up an office in the region and has close
dialogue with the business and the authorities.

2008 TA on Tax
Administration

Status

Reorganize core tax and customs
functions of the Fiji Islands Revenue
and Customs Authority (FIRCA).

Early in 2009, FIRCA formed the Reform Steering Committee
on taxation and customs to study and implement
recommendations.

For domestic tax administration reform,
review all tax procedures, especially the
burdensome assessment regime, and
develop effective business processes.

Regarding tax procedures, the new Tax Administration Decree
(effective January 2010) harmonizes and simplifies
administration.

For customs, develop a comprehensive
reform plan and review business
processes under the new organizational
proposals.
Increase and unify the VAT threshold
and strengthen audits, given concerns
about fraudulent VAT refunds.

The authorities increased the VAT threshold in the 2010 Budget
(from F$30,000 to F$50,000 for goods and from F$15,000 to
F$50,000 for services).

35
Table 8. Fiji: Status of Key 2006 FSAP Recommendations
FSAP Recommendations

Status/Progress

Enhance supervision while
economizing on RBF’s
resources. Make greater use of
external and financial
institution internal auditors.

The RBF has made substantial progress in dealing with their staffing problems
and has filled all examiner and analyst positions. A challenge remains, however,
with high staff turnover. The RBF has made extensive use of external auditors.

Introduce risk-based
supervision to ensure that
supervision is focused on the
areas and institutions of greatest
concern, including matters other
than credit risk.

The RBF has made good progress in implementing risk-based supervision. The
cycle of onsite examinations has been done on a risk-based basis with pre-exam
information collected based on internal discussions of significant risk areas, and
integrated with offsite information. In-house stress testing is currently carried out
on an ad-hoc basis, but the RBF is working toward regular stress testing with the
help of Fund technical assistance provided in March 2009.
Market risks policies have yet to be developed but supervision units have started
examining these areas. In September, a draft Banking Supervisory Policy on
Minimum Requirements for Management and Operational Risk was circulated to
the industry for comments and will be finalized by year end. Supervisory actions
have been stepped up for the FNPF with recent onsite recommendations focusing
on strengthening corporate governance and risk management.

Sign MOUs with all relevant
foreign and domestic
supervisors.

A draft MOU with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has
not been finalized. The RBF is discussing a draft MOU with the Bank of Papua
New Guinea. The Capital Markets Development Authority (CMDA), an agency
responsible for regulating and supervising capital markets, has recently been
brought under the RBF.

Clarify the powers and
responsibilities of the RBF and
the MOF.
Strengthen liquidity forecasting
capacity to improve forecasting
of foreign reserves and the net
position of the government, and
improve the RBF’s ability to
undertake a systematic analysis
of the forecasting errors.

A new RBF Act has been drafted bringing it into line with international standards.
The draft Act has been reviewed by the Fund.

Improve government securities
primary issuance techniques
(auction frequency, advanced
calendar, benchmark issues,
consolidation).

No progress has been made on this front. The government still relies heavily on
the FNPF to finance its deficits and sees no immediate need to implement this
recommendation. The CMDA intends to incorporate these recommendations into
its master plan for capital market development.

Fiji National Provident Fund
(FNPF) strengthening and
reform.

The FNPF Board is considering the recommendations of an actuarial report
conducted by Mercer consultants. In addition, a paper has been drafted for
possible demonopolization of compulsory retirement savings. Plans are also in
place for a comprehensive review of the operations of the FNPF including an
overhaul of governance structure to ensure FNPF autonomy and long-term
sustainability. An expert on the Singapore’s Central Provident Fund (CPF) will
assist the authorities in coming months. A proposed action plan should be
finalized by the first quarter of 2010.

The RBF has discussed with MOF ways to improve cash flow forecasts. The RBF
monitors and analyzes daily forecast errors, and produces monthly forecasts to
year-end. However, the use of direct control instruments and the suspension of
open market operations since June 2007 made the liquidity forecasting exercise
practically irrelevant and thus halted its improvement.

Exchange Rate Arrangements:

Since April 1975, the exchange rate of the Fiji dollar has been linked to a basket of currencies
of Fiji’s five major trading partners: the U.S., Australian, and New Zealand dollars; the pound
sterling (replaced by the Euro at the beginning of 1999); and the Japanese yen. The weights
used in the basket, based mainly on the value of trade and tourist transactions are reviewed
annually. The exchange rate of the Fiji dollar against U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is
determined daily by the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) in relation to the currency basket. The
RBF’s buying and selling rates for transactions in U.S. dollars are communicated to
commercial banks. On April 15, 2009, the Fiji dollar was devalued by 20 percent against the
basket. The exchange rate was F$1.9059 per U.S. dollar as of November 30, 2009.
Exchange and capital controls were tightened significantly in 2000. Some of the exchange
restrictions have been eliminated and amended since then. Remaining restrictions subject to

3
Article VIII arise from the Fiji Islands Revenue and Customs Authority tax certification
requirements before foreign companies can remit profits abroad and from limits on large
payments (e.g., oil imports and dividends).
Approval of most current payments was delegated to commercial banks and foreign exchange
dealers in the late 1990s. However, the extent of delegation was tightened during periods of
stress on foreign exchange reserves, most recently in April 2009. In December 2009, the RBF
announced an increase in the delegated ceilings for commercial banks and foreign exchange
dealers for most current payments, effective January 1, 2010. There are also quantitative
restrictions in Fiji dollars on offshore portfolio and direct investments by the Fiji National
Provident Fund and other nonbank financial institutions, companies, and individuals.
VIII. Last Article IV Consultation
The 2004 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Suva during May 19–June 1, 2004.
The consultation (Staff Report No. 04/270 and 04/271) was completed by the Executive Board
on August 23, 2004. Fiji was on a 24-month cycle with the concurrence of the authorities.
Article IV consultation missions visited Suva in December 2007 and September 2008. The
consultations were not completed, however, as discussions with the authorities continued
concerning the staff’s view that the Fijian dollar was substantially overvalued.

Annex II: Fiji—Relations with the World Bank Group1
(As of December 21, 2009)
Fiji became a member of the World Bank Group in 1971, and has received 13 IBRD loans
totaling US$146.4 million for projects primarily in infrastructure, telecommunications, and
electric power sectors. The last IBRD loan closed in 1999, and was fully repaid by Fiji in
September 2009. Since the coup in December 2006, World Bank engagement with Fiji has
been guided by OP 7.30 (Dealings with De Facto Governments).
Energy
 The Bank supports Fiji’s long-term goals of increasing access to electricity and shifting
to renewable energy. On June 12, 2007, the Board approved US$9.5 million provided by
the Global Environment Facility for the Regional Sustainable Energy Financing Project.
The project supports renewable energy electricity supplies for rural communities in Fiji
and four other Pacific island countries. Of the total, US$0.7 million is available for Fiji,
and Fiji also potentially has access to $1.9 million in regional funds available under the
project.
Telecoms
 The Bank recognizes and supports government’s intention to liberalize the telecoms
sector, as well as enact the new legislation, as advised by the Bank, and establish an
independent regulatory authority. The government successfully negotiated the
termination of exclusive licenses in December 2007. It issued a Telecommunications
Promulgation (new law), effective August 2008 which, inter alia, established the
independent Telecommunications Authority of Fiji (TAF). The government has also
issued a new mobile telecommunications license and liberalized the internet and
international gateway. All these steps will in the medium-term contribute to the country’s
competitiveness and economic diversification.


The Bank has also approved in principle a grant to support the new TAF, through the
Institutional Development Fund. In the interim, the Bank continues to advise the
government on regulatory priorities.

Labor Mobility and Remittances
 Both New Zealand and Australia have opened their borders to the short-term supply of
labor from the Pacific. The Bank continues to advocate for greater labor mobility from
the Pacific and is working closely with a number of PICs to remove behind-the-border
constraints faced in export development. Alongside this, a strong M&E framework has

1

6
been established to measure the impact of greater labor mobility and to inform current
and future policies.


Remittances costs in the New Zealand-Fiji corridor were brought down from an average
of 25 percent to just under 4 percent, using formal banking channels. This development
was the culmination of a long process of diagnostics, dialogue, and reform led by the
World Bank. New Zealand modified its domestic financial regulations to enable Westpac
Bank and Visa International to launch a lost-cost remittance product in December 2008.
The Reserve Bank of Fiji worked in close collaboration with World Bank officials and
played a key role in opening up the remittance market to greater competition from
commercial banks.



The World Bank is now advancing similar regulatory reforms in Australia and bilateral
discussions are ongoing with the Attorney General’s department.

Economic Assessment
 The Bank is advising the Ministry of Social Welfare in relation to proposals to better
target and strengthen Fiji’s Family Assistance Program. Fiji is one of the leaders in the
region in social protection. The Bank stands ready to assist these reforms, contingent on
the continued commitment of the government.


The Bank has been providing advice to the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), in
respect of an actuarial review of the FNPF.

Investment Services
 IFC has no active investment portfolio in Fiji, though high development impact
investment opportunities engaging the private sector will continue to be considered on a
case-by-case basis. IFC, along with other entities including the AsDB and EIB, is an
investor in the Kula Fund II Ltd., which operates as a diversified fund investing in a
variety of sectors and industries in the Pacific region––including Fiji.
Disaster Risk Management
 The Bank will be providing support, through the Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience
Commission (SOPAC), to strengthen flood monitoring early warning systems in Fiji in
order to mitigate future flood damage.

7
Annex III: Fiji—Relations with the
Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre1
(As of December 2009)
Public Financial Management
In March 2004, Fiji’s ROSC was posted on the IMF website. PFTAC provided assistance in the
development of an action plan to strengthen public expenditure management over the medium-term,
which complements the authorities’ financial management reform program (supported by AsDB).
Treasury operations were reviewed, with advice on the appropriate structure, functions and
accounting procedures, as well as interim measures for strengthening internal controls. A peripatetic
consultant assisted the government in 2006 to set up a system of Performance Budgeting, and this
work was continued in 2007 and 2008 by the PFTAC PFM Advisor. A short-term mission to develop
staff capacity in Debt Strategy and Sustainability Analysis was undertaken in July–August 2007. In
addition, the PFTAC Advisor conducts regular monthly training courses in PFM for the staff of the
Budget Division. Permanent Secretary Finance also participated in the PFTAC organized study visit
to the US Treasury, in August 2008.
A Fiji participant attended the two-week PFM program in September 2009, organized by PFTAC in
India. The PFM Advisor conducted a scoping study on Accrual Accounting in September 2009,
following which a consultant worked, in November 2009, on the next steps to improve cash
accounting, before moving toward accrual accounting.
Tax Administration and Policy
In March 2008, FAD recommended changes to FIRCAs (Fiji Islands Revenue and Customs
Authority) operations, i.e., reorganize core tax and customs functions; review all tax procedures,
especially the burdensome assessment regime; develop effective business processes; customs to
develop a comprehensive reform plan and review business processes under the new organizational
proposals; increase and unify the VAT threshold; and strengthen audits.
FIRCA have adopted all but a few of the recommendations. Terms of reference for the implementation
have been finalized and steering committee and project teams formed. Following a request for technical
assistance, PFTAC is discussing where it is able to assist FIRCA further.
In February 2009, Tax Policy Department evaluated the investment tax incentives of Fiji and
recommended a strategy for reforming the tax incentive system and an institutional framework for
tax policy making.

1

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji, is a regional technical assistance
institution operated by the IMF with financial support of the AsDB, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand. The
Centre’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and financial management that can be
sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati,
Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and
Vanuatu.

8
LEG prepared a draft omnibus Administration Bill in 2006 which, excluding some discrete Customs
provisions, amalgamated all revenue administrative provisions and the FIRCA Act. Following some
changes the Fiji cabinet endorsed the tax administration decree in November 2009.
Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
The PFTAC Advisor provides advice as needed to the RBF regarding financial supervision and
regulation, as PFTAC is located in the RBF building. In March 2005, the Advisor provided guidance
to the RBF in relation to establishing a supervisory framework for the FNPF. In November 2005, the
Advisor participated in a LEG mission to strengthen Fiji’s AML/CFT regime. The Advisor has
provided AML/CFT training to RBF bank supervisors and in September 2007 he assisted the RBF to
undertake an AML/CFT on-site examination of a bank. The Advisor has also made presentations to
supervisory staff on future directions and challenges for RBF’s supervisory department.
In 2008, TA in respect of supervision of the national provident fund was provided by MCM. In
September 2009, RBF hosted a regional training seminar by STA on Financial Soundness Indicators
and reporting requirements under the IMF Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. In March 2009,
RBF and PFTAC hosted a regional training seminar by MCM on Stress Testing.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
In December 2009, PFTAC provided assistance to the RBF on reform of monetary policy operations
and the exchange rate arrangement.
Economic and Financial Statistics
GDDS metadata for Fiji, prepared with assistance from PFTAC, are posted on the IMF website. A
multi-year action plan developed in 2002 was reviewed and updated in early 2008, to strengthen both
the organization and content of statistics. In response to subsequent requests by the authorities,
assistance has been, and will continue to be, provided to assist the transition of balance of payments
(BOP), government finance, monetary and national accounts statistics to the latest international
standards, and to improve the quality of these statistics. During 2007 and early 2008 a series of
missions by an STA expert focused on strengthening the monetary and financial statistics.
The PFTAC Multisector Statistics Advisor and short-term experts have undertaken nine missions
during 2008 and 2009 to assist in improving balance of payments, national accounts, and
prices statistics. As a result of this support, the Fiji Islands Bureau of Statistics has recently released
quarterly BOP estimates and annual international investment position statistics. The coverage and
quality of national accounts estimates have been significantly improved and constant price estimates
have been rebased to 2005 prices.
The consumer price index has been rebased to 2005 weights, an imports’ prices survey has been
implemented and import price indexes are being compiled. Assistance is currently being provided
to develop good quality estimates of GDP by expenditure share, quarterly GDP, and producer price
indexes.

9
Annex IV: Fiji—Relations with the Asian Development Bank
(As of December 18, 2009)
To date, the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) has approved 18 loans totaling $303.6 million
and, most recently, an emergency assistance loan of US$17.5 million in August 2009 for flood
damage. The Fiji government has provided sufficient counterpart funding for AsDB-financed
projects. While AsDB-financed projects have not experienced significant counterpart resource
constraints to date, the sustainability of the absorptive capacity of various government agencies
particularly as a result of the migration of skilled staff to implement programs is a long-term
concern.
The AsDB has approved 80 TA projects, totaling $27.0 million since 1970. There are 5 TA
initiatives ongoing, including PPTAs for preparing the Renewable Power Sector Development
Project and the Fourth Road Upgrading project. TAs are being implemented satisfactorily. The
AsDB continues to be involved in helping to improve the policy framework in infrastructure,
private sector development, and economic management.
Monitoring and Evaluation
AsDB opened a Pacific subregional office in Suva in June 2004. Generally, Fiji has complied
with project loan covenants, including submission of regular progress and audit reports in the
past. While there had been some delays in submission of audit reports for two projects, Suva
Nausori Water and Sanitation Project and Fiji Road Upgrading Project, these are now up to
date.
Lending Level Proposed
Following the military coup of December 5, 2006, AsDB’s disbursements and TA operations
were suspended. In April 2007, AsDB adopted a Reengagement Approach for Fiji Islands
under which it was decided that “no new loan or TA processing, nor resumption of formal
discussions on a new Country Partnership Strategy will take place until further guidance is
received from Management.” AsDB’s ongoing program as set out in the Country Strategy and
Program Update, 2006–08 was reactivated. Periodic reports are prepared assessing the
conditions to engage in new operations under the Reengagement Approach.
When the conditions for reengagement are in place, a Country Partnership Strategy will be
prepared. Possible areas for future operations include areas where there is a clear poverty
alleviation focus, such as transport, power, and water and sanitation. Grant cofinancing and
opportunities for commercial cofinancing and guarantees will be sought where appropriate.
This will be complemented by appropriate technical assistance for project preparation, private
sector enabling environment, and other areas addressing binding constraints to growth.

10

Annex V: Fiji—Statistical Issues
As of December 18, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Despite significant shortcomings in some areas, especially GDP and balance of
payments data, core economic and financial data provided to the Fund are generally adequate
for surveillance. Macroeconomic data are slowly improving, owing in part to the
considerable technical assistance provided by the Fund and PFTAC in recent years.
The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) publishes the Annual Report, the Quarterly Review, and the
Monthly Economic Review. The Fiji Bureau of Statistics (BoS) publishes a quarterly Current
Economic Statistics and a monthly Statistical News. The Ministry of Finance and National
Planning (MoF) issues the Budget Address and the Supplement to the Budget Address on an
annual basis. All of these publications are received by APD on a regular basis.
Formal participation in the GDDS commenced on May 9, 2000, marked by the posting of the
metadata on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. The metadata were last
updated in November 2002. The country has maintained its commitment to use the GDDS as
a framework for statistical development.
National Accounts: Production-side estimates of GDP at current and constant prices are
available up to 2008. Revised data were published in late 2009 that use the 2002 Household
Income and Expenditure Survey, a new business census, and estimates of the informal sector.
Expenditure-side GDP data in constant prices are not available and expenditure-side GDP
data in current prices are only available through 2005. In addition, GDP broken down by
income is only available through 2005.
Price statistics: The BoS is updating the CPI weights from the current 1993 base using
results of the 2002 Household Expenditure and Income survey. There have been persistent
difficulties in compiling export and import unit value indexes, mainly due to lack of
continuity that resulted from a switch to ASYCUDA for customs processing late in 1999.
The BoS plans to re-introduce trade price indexes with a starting period of 2002 (to coincide
with the new benchmark year for national accounts).

Government finance statistics: Following a PFTAC supervised project, reporting of data
for publication in the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook has resumed. Data
include a statement of sources and uses of cash for budgetary central government,
subdivisions of receipts and payments by economic category, and outlays by function. Data
for 2006 in the format of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 are available.

11
Some inconsistencies remain between the GFS data and fiscal data provided to APD,
especially in the areas of nontax revenue, wages and salaries, other purchases of goods and
services, and subsidies and transfers. Public debt data remain weak. Other problem areas
include a lack of transparency in budget reporting, with some agencies outside the budget,
including the Fiji Islands Revenue and Customs Authority; and an absence of published
updates on the budget outcome.
Monetary statistics: Data on the monetary authorities and the deposit money banks are
comprehensive and provided to APD and STA on a regular and timely basis. Data on
nonbank financial institutions, including the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), are less
regular, timely, and reliable. With FNPF representing a large part of the financial sector, the
unavailability of a consolidated financial survey hampers economic and financial analysis.
The RBF is in the process of broadening its monetary survey into a depository corporations
survey and compiling a financial survey that covers nonbank financial institutions. A
November 2005 expert mission, during a PFTAC monetary statistics workshop, reviewed the
compilation procedures and provided training and a work plan for the RBF to comply with
the methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and to report using the
standardized report forms (SRFs). A follow-up February 2008 mission provided advice on
introducing the SRFs and developing an integrated monetary database that will meet the data
needs of the RBF, APD, and STA.
Balance of payments: The BoS is nearing the end of a major PFTAC assisted project to
compile new balance of payments data and revise historical data back to 2000 consistent with
the IMF Balance of Payments Manual (fifth edition). Revised annual balance of payments
data were published in late 2009 that significantly reduced errors and omissions in 2008 from
over 10 percent of GDP to about 6 percent of GDP. Initial estimates of quarterly balance of
payments data and the annual investment position were published in December 2009, but
contain a number of weaknesses, including inconsistency of the stock and flow data. A
separate project to publish data on international trade in services is also nearing completion,
while technical assistance to address problems in the capital and financial accounts will start
shortly. Balance of payments data for the period up to end-2006 were reported to the
Statistics Department for publication in the 2007 Balance of Payments Yearbook. Problems
remain in the measurement of external debt, due to the absence of a consistent framework
and insufficient coordination between the RBF, the BoS, and the MoF.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Fiji is a GDDS participant. The statistics advisor based at PFTAC in Suva is the GDDS
Project Manager for the Pacific region.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 25, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Fiji
On January 11, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Fiji. 1
Background
Growth has been sluggish in recent years because of delays in economic reforms,
worsening terms of trade, and political developments that have strained Fiji’s
international relations and hurt business confidence. Fiji’s economy is expected to have
contracted by 2½ percent in 2009, reflecting the adverse impact of the global crisis on
exports and tourism. The economy was also hit by flooding in January 2009 that
damaged tourism, crops, and infrastructure. As a result of slow growth, the
unemployment rate rose to 8½ percent, and would have been higher if not for an
increase in emigration.
The real effective exchange rate appreciated by 10 percent between 2000 and 2008 as
the terms of trade deteriorated by 15 percent because of lower export prices for sugar
and higher oil prices. The current account deficit widened from 4 percent to 18 percent
of GDP over the same period, and in early 2009, foreign exchange reserves fell to
US$300 million, less than two months of imports. In April 2009, the Reserve Bank of Fiji
(RBF) devalued the currency by 20 percent and intensified exchange controls. Following
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
the devaluation, weak economic activity and lower commodity prices helped contain
inflation.
Tourist arrivals fell by almost 25 percent year-on-year in early 2009 because of the
global crisis and January floods. However, tourism recovered mid-year, as the
devaluation of the Fijian dollar against the Australian dollar made Fiji a more attractive
destination.
Foreign exchange reserves doubled between April and November 2009, to reach
US$593 million, almost four months of imports, explained by a pickup in remittances and
an improvement in the trade balance. About half of the increase was also explained by
the SDR allocation (US$93 million) and repatriation of foreign assets of the Fiji National
Provident Fund (FNPF, a public pension fund). Despite high current account deficits in
recent years, external debt is low at 13 percent of GDP in 2008, as deficits were
financed mainly by foreign direct investment (FDI) in the tourism sector.
Recent developments have put considerable pressure on the budget. Tax revenue was
hit by the fall in economic activity, with a shortfall of about 10 percent relative to the
budget in the first 10 months of the year. Government restrained current spending,
including by containing wage increases, and the fiscal deficit increased to about
3 percent of GDP in 2009 from near balance in 2008, in line with the budget. Central
government debt is expected to rise to 53 percent of GDP by end 2009. Central
government guarantees of public enterprise debt and contingent liabilities arising from
poor performance of public enterprises amount to about 70 percent of GDP (excluding
the public pension fund).
Bank liquidity has risen sharply in recent months to more than 13 percent of deposits as
foreign exchange reserves have recovered. However, credit growth is likely to have
contracted in real terms in 2009, as banks took a cautious approach in light of
heightened political and economic uncertainties. The RBF increased the statutory
reserve requirement on banks from 5 percent to 7 percent of deposits to reduce excess
liquidity. It has also removed bank-by-bank credit ceilings and announced the removal of
ceilings on banks’ lending rates and spreads by January 2010.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Fiji’s economic performance in recent years has been
negatively affected by a difficult political situation, delayed structural reforms, natural
disasters, and the global crisis. Faced with increasing budget pressures, the authorities
have made commendable efforts to restrain current spending and limit the overall fiscal
deficit in 2009, while the devaluation of the Fijian dollar has helped reverse the sharp
decline in foreign exchange reserves. The economic situation nevertheless remains
challenging, and downside risks remain high. Directors therefore stressed the need for
further decisive actions to restore macroeconomic stability and implement structural
reforms needed to lift growth and ensure debt sustainability over the medium-term.
Directors agreed that a substantial reduction in the fiscal deficit is necessary to ensure
macroeconomic stability and stabilize public debt. While acknowledging the difficult

3
economic situation, most Directors recommended a faster pace of consolidation starting
from 2010 than is currently envisaged. They considered that infrastructure rebuilding
needs should be offset by expenditure measures, including civil service reform, while
revenue could be strengthened by rationalizing tax incentives, improving tax
administration and raising excise taxes. Directors encouraged the authorities to adhere
to their earlier target of reducing central government debt to 45 percent of GDP by 2014.
Directors supported a tight monetary policy to ensure that inflation returns to low levels
and to protect foreign exchange reserves. They welcomed the recent increase in the
statutory reserve deposit ratio and the removal of ceilings on bank lending rates and
spreads, and called for further measures as needed to absorb excess liquidity.
Directors encouraged the authorities to move toward a more flexible exchange rate.
They considered that the shift to a more flexible exchange rate regime will help Fiji
absorb external shocks and protect its reserve position. Directors noted that exchange
rate flexibility should be accompanied by a strengthening of monetary and fiscal policies.
Directors welcomed recent improvements in bank supervision. They expressed concern
about the vulnerability to adverse shocks of some smaller banks and recommended
remedial action where appropriate. Directors called for fundamental reform of the FNPF.
In particular, they stressed the importance of measures to put the FNPF on a sound
actuarial footing, of an independent management responsible to beneficiaries, and of
strengthened supervisory oversight.
Directors considered that structural reforms are crucial to ensure fiscal sustainability,
address competiveness problems, lift potential growth and create jobs. They called for
well-designed reforms of the civil service, of the public enterprises with a view to
eventual privatization, and of the land-lease system, accompanied by price
liberalization. Well-targeted measures should help address the social impact of these
reforms.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to work closely with the Fund on the design
and implementation of their economic policies. They noted that a Fund-supported
program would require continued strong commitment to macroeconomic adjustment and
structural reforms to address remaining vulnerabilities, close the external financing gap,
and attract donor support.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Ms. Duangmanee Vongpradhip, Executive Director for Fiji
1.
On behalf of the Fiji authorities, we wish to express our gratitude and appreciation
to Mr. Brooks and his team for the very fruitful and constructive discussions held during
the Article IV Mission to Fiji between November 10 and 24, 2009. The mission was
indeed timely and highly welcomed by the authorities, as it came at a time when Fiji as a
small island economy is struggling to recover, not only from the global crisis, but also
from the destructive effects of the worst floods in its history in early 2009. Fiji remains
vulnerable to such natural disasters as seen by Cyclone Mick in December 2009. Our
authorities recognize the support that the Fund has shown in the recent period to small
island economies in the region, and specifically wish to convey their utmost appreciation
to the Fund for its concern, support, and engagement with Fiji.
2.
Our authorities agree with the broad thrust of the Staff Report, which has
appropriately highlighted the significant economic and policy challenges facing the
economy. The Report is also welcomed as it provides sound advice and useful ideas at a
time when the Government of Fiji is actively formulating and implementing an ambitious
package of reforms to strengthen macroeconomic stability and position the economy for
growth. Indeed some of the reforms suggested by Staff had been announced in the 2010
Budget which had been scheduled shortly after the conclusion of the mission, reflecting
the strong commitment and ability of the Government to expedite action. This statement
thus seeks mainly to briefly highlight the current economic developments in Fiji to
reinforce Staff’s assessment, and elaborate on the authorities views in a few areas.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
3.
Economic growth, which averaged 0.4 percent between 2006 – 2008, is expected
to have contracted by 2.5 percent in 2009, reflecting the combined effects of the severe
floods in January 2009 and the global crisis. The extensive flooding inflicted
considerable damage to infrastructure, farms and livestock, schools, and properties.
Human lives were lost, whilst water and electricity supply were disrupted for weeks
following breakdowns to machinery and electrical equipment. The two largest sectors in
Fiji, the sugar and tourism industries, bore the brunt of the impact, adding acute stress on
the balance of payments position as exports declined. The cost of the devastation is
estimated at around F$113 million, equivalent to 1.9 percent of GDP. Remittances also
declined sharply in the first quarter of 2009, further slowing economic activity. The
unemployment rate is estimated to have exceeded 8 percent by end-year.
4.
The intense strains on the external position in the first quarter of 2009 led to
foreign reserves declining to a low of US$239 million, less than 2 months of imports.
Subsequently, the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) devalued the currency by 20 percent in
April 2009. Restrictions on external outflows were also introduced to smooth out

2
payments and moderate the impact on the reserves position. The devaluation in the
exchange rate was also in line with a key recommendation of past Staff missions to
facilitate external adjustment. These measures helped reverse the sharp decline in foreign
reserves. Reserves reached US$568 million by end December 2009, almost four months
of imports, reinforced substantially by the SDR allocation and a turnaround in trade
balance and remittance flows. Given the improvements, a number of the exchange
restrictions were relaxed in November – December, with a view to eventually eliminating
exchange controls.
5.
In part anchored by Fiji’s low and stable inflation record (inflation averaged 3.1
percent in the last decade), inflation did not rise substantially as a result of the
devaluation, due also to a relatively quick and limited pass-through, weak demand
conditions and muted wage developments, and lower commodity prices compared to
2008 when inflation recorded a high of 6.6 percent. From a trough of -0.3 percent in
April 2009 prior to the devaluation, price increases have likely peaked at around 7
percent by end-2009, despite the recent loosening of price surveillance for a number of
items, with all forms of price controls to be removed from January 2010 as announced in
the 2010 Budget. Inflation is expected to decline thereafter to about 2 percent in 2010,
although further global crude oil price increases are acknowledged as a risk to the
forecast.
6.
For 2010, the authorities expect economic growth of 1.9 percent, close to the Staff
forecast. This modest recovery would be supported in part by recovery in trading partner
economies and would be driven largely by tourism and related industries, including the
wholesale and retail trade and hotels and restaurants sectors. However, growth will be
muted or negative in public administration and defense, education, and the health and
social work sectors due to lower government spending in real terms in line with the
government’s commitment to consolidate the fiscal position further.
7.
Nonetheless, the external position is expected to come under strain again going
forward into 2010, as imports pick up in line with the economic recovery and oil prices
trend higher, as well as lower transfers. The current account deficit, which narrowed from
17.7 percent of GDP in 2008 to 8.7 percent in 2009, is expected to widen again to about
10 (9.2 to be precise) percent of GDP. Dividend repatriation flows, part of which had
been retained in 2009, are expected to rise, and the reserves position will be further
impacted by a bullet repayment of a $150 million sovereign bond falling due in 2011.
Notwithstanding the substantial current account deficits in recent years, external debt
remains low at about 13.6 percent of GDP. Nonetheless, the anticipated financing gap is
of concern to the authorities.

Policy Discussions
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
8.
Monetary policy conducted by the RBF has focused on safeguarding foreign
reserves and maintaining stable prices to create an environment conducive for growth and
investment. During the early part of 2009 when liquidity was tight amidst declining
foreign reserves, the RBF reduced its lending rate to banks and lowered the Statutory
Reserve Deposit (SRD) ratio to inject liquidity into the system. With liquidity in the
system increasing amidst subdued credit demand and higher levels of foreign reserves,
the RBF raised the SRD ratio to 7 percent effective December 2009. The credit ceiling on
banks that was introduced in December 2006 was removed on 1 September 2009. The
ceiling on banks’ lending rates and interest spread, introduced in April 2009 to increase
the affordability of credit, were also removed from 1 January 2010. Specific exchange
control transactions have been re-delegated to commercial banks and foreign exchange
dealers with increased limits since 1 January 2010.
9.
As the economy recovers, the RBF agrees with Staff on the need to further
normalize monetary conditions and is keen to simplify the framework for monetary
policy to increase its effectiveness. Nonetheless, in light of limited fiscal space and with
monetary costs being a significant practical constraint due to the negative “carry” from
low international interest rates, possibly for an extended period, changes in policy also
need to balance the impact in various respects. With both inflation and credit growth
expected to remain subdued, and with the portfolio flow channel typically limited in
Fiji’s small financial markets, the need to sharply tighten monetary policy needs careful
consideration, and our authorities are weighing the different options to best achieve the
desired outcomes.
10.
On exchange rate policy, our authorities have shown interest in reforming the
current exchange rate regime, and are actively studying the matter with technical
assistance from Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) and in
consultation with MCM. They recognize that changes in the exchange rate regime have
the best chance of success if implemented in a consistent way together with changes in
the monetary operations framework and in coordination with fiscal policy.
Financial Sector Developments
11.
As noted by Staff, progress has been made in enhancing bank supervision,
including implementing a number of recommendations of the 2006 FSAP. All major
banks are adequately capitalized, with good profit performance and manageable nonperforming loans. The RBF is exploring further actions to strengthen financial stability,
including increased use of risk-based analysis and expanding on the granularity of

4
information collected. They are also open to conduct capital-raising for banks that are
shown to be vulnerable in stress tests. Efforts to increase financial inclusion by the
provision of microfinance through the branch network of the banking system are also
being undertaken.
12.
The authorities share the concerns expressed by Staff on the Fiji National
Provident Fund (FNPF) and the Government is taking action to reform the FNPF to
position it for long-term sustainability. The Government has received an actuarial
valuation from Mercer, and building on a previous assessment by the World Bank,
intends to make changes in the Fund, including on conversion rates for pension annuities
and reviewing its governance structure. The FNPF is further receiving consultancy
assistance through the Singapore Economic Cooperation in applying useful experiences
from Singapore’s Central Provident Fund to bring reforms forward.
Fiscal Policy
13.
Our authorities share the Staff’s assessment on the need to consolidate the fiscal
deficit further, and are broadly in agreement with the key measures to be undertaken. As
Staff have noted, the fiscal authorities showed commitment to achieve the budgeted 3
percent target for 2009 by exercising expenditure restraint in the face of an unexpected 10
percent fall in revenues. This was done by withholding wage increases and successfully
reducing operating budgets.
14.
The Government’s deficit target of 3.5 percent of GDP for 2010 reflects the need
to undertake some flood-related rebuilding and infrastructure work, and sustain necessary
social expenditures and support for vulnerable groups given the weakness in the domestic
economy. Poverty alleviation programs are being expanded and assistance is being
increasingly targeted, including for food vouchers and bus fares. On the revenue side, the
Government has announced that it would raise public service fees and charges, and is
further exploring a number of measures, including those proposed by Staff of
streamlining tax incentives and improving tax administration. The new Tax
Administration Decree came into force on January 1, 2010, which combined with the
new taxpayer portal, would further increase efficiency in tax collection and operations. In
the medium term, the Government aims to reduce central government debt to 50 percent
of GDP by 2014, with an earlier adjustment if the opportunity arises.
Structural Reforms
15.
The Government has set out a substantive agenda for reforms covering civil
service reform, public enterprise reform and land reform, areas that Staff have also
identified as priorities. On civil service reform, the authorities are pushing ahead to
refocus on core areas of government and right-size the government further, which will

5
result in substantial reductions in current expenditure over time. A comprehensive study
on civil service human resource requirements will be conducted in 2010. In addition to
redundancies due to reductions in the retirement age, the water, procurement, and
printing services are being corporatized, which in total account for around 10 percent of
the civil service workforce. Several mergers of departments have been undertaken
already, including the merger of Price and Incomes Board and Department of Fair
Trading with the Commerce Commission. The incorporation of the Capital Markets
Development Authority into RBF operations is another example. Outsourcing of some
capital and maintenance works is also being considered.
16.
Reforms in public enterprises are also in the train, with a focus on the Fiji Sugar
Corporation due to its large impact on the economy and substantial employment base.
Measures being discussed include privatization and closure of unviable mills. The Fiji
Electricity Authority is also being reviewed to strengthen its financial position.
17.
Land tenure reform is a key priority of the Government’s reform agenda. It is also
an area that Staff and other multilateral institutions also consider as vital to raising the
economic growth potential of the economy given large areas of unutilized arable land.
The Government has formed a task force that will facilitate utilization of idle land for
productive use. Land will be available for leases under this effort from the first quarter of
2010.
Political Developments and Governance Reforms
18.
Given the current focus on the economic challenges, the Government has publicly
committed to resume parliamentary elections latest by September 2014. In preparation for
this, the National Dialogue Forum, which aims to bring together broad segments of
society to discuss Fiji’s political future, will commence on 1 February 2010 and is being
held in preparation for a constitutional forum by September 2012.
19.
The Government is committed to uphold the rule of law and strengthen the
judiciary. Several laws have been promulgated since October 2009, including
modernizing the criminal code to reflect aspects of current practice in the region,
addressing a range of offences including human trafficking, theft and fraud, and financial
information offences.
Engagement with the International Community
20.
The Fiji Government has sought to actively engage the international community
on assistance for its wide-ranging reforms to secure sustained economic growth and
poverty reduction for the people of Fiji, and is deeply grateful for the support shown so
far. It has continued to engage significantly with PFTAC through a number of TAs and

6
advice in a number of areas, including public financial management, tax administration
and policy, financial regulation and supervision, monetary and exchange rate policy, and
economic and financial statistics. A recent notable development was the obtaining of an
emergency assistance loan of US$17.5 million by the Asian Development Bank (AsDB)
in August 2009, by a unanimous approval of the AsDB’s Board. AsDB has also recently
approved an additional supplementary loan for road and water/sewerage upgrades. AsDB
and World Bank representatives also participated in several meetings of the mission team
with the authorities.
21.
Given the significant challenges going forward for the balance of payments
position, coupled with the critical reforms needed in the economy in the period ahead, the
support and assistance of development partners and multilateral institutions will be
crucial. As noted by Staff, negotiations for several bilateral loans for infrastructure are
currently underway. The Fiji Government has indicated its intention to request a Fund
program, and looks forward to receiving the good support of the international community
in undertaking the arduous task ahead of reforming the economy to bring sustained
development to the people of Fiji.
Conclusion
22.
The Fiji authorities are thankful to the Fund for the continuous support and policy
advice provided. They wish to thank the Executive Board, the Management, and Mr.
Brooks’ mission team for the excellent advice and professionalism in assisting them in
this challenging period. They will continue to work closely with the Fund in monitoring
developments and designing and implementing macroeconomic policies that will
facilitate a more stable balance of payments position in the medium-term. The authorities
welcome an annual Article IV Consultation with Fiji.
