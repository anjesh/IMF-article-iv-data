IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Latvia

On June 10, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Latvia.
GDP growth picked up to 2.7 percent in 2105, up about 0.25 percent over the previous year,
despite a weak external environment. Private consumption grew by 3.3 percent, spurred by gains
in employment and real wages, but weak external conditions, combined with lingering
geopolitical tensions had a dampening effect. Investment saw a modest turnaround, growing at
2.1 percent following a contraction of almost 5.5 percent over 2013–14. Exports grew by only
1.4 percent, reflecting tepid growth in the euro area and the prolonged recession in Russia,
although Latvian businesses proved resilient and able to penetrate alternative markets. Inflation
remained well below target, falling to 0.2 percent, driven by the decline in oil and food prices
and low inflation in the euro area.
The general government deficit was around 1.3 percent of GDP in 2015, 0.3 percentage points
higher than targeted in the budget, but still consistent with domestic and EU fiscal rules. The
higher outturn was the result of a previously agreed change of plan from long-term renting to
purchasing the newly built offices of the State Revenue Services. Tax revenues were supported
by strong wage growth and improved tax compliance.
Bank balance sheets continued to strengthen. Capital adequacy increased and the ratio of nonperforming loans declined. Credit continued to shrink, with the stock of bank credit to the private
sector declining by 2.2 percent (y-on-y) at end 2015. Non-resident deposits (NRDs) in the
banking system were stable. On the regulatory front, the authorities took a series of steps to
clamp down in anti-money laundering (AML) cases, including bank closures, fines and
personnel actions.
Executive Board Assessment2
1

2

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

Executive Directors commended the steady economic progress in Latvia, and the generally
favorable macroeconomic conditions despite the current slowdown. They noted that the mediumterm outlook is broadly positive; however, higher productivity and additional fiscal space are
needed to support inclusive growth and employment.
Directors emphasized the need for continued structural reforms across a wide range of areas to
enhance productivity, maintain competitiveness, and improve equity. This would be vital to
maintain the pace of income convergence with the rest of Europe. Reforms are needed to
improve the investment climate; enhance public infrastructure; strengthen the governance of
state-owned enterprises; improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the judicial system and
insolvency regime; and encourage innovation. Measures are also needed to improve labor
participation and align education and vocational training with market demand. Directors urged
the authorities to monitor wage developments and their impact on competitiveness. They
generally considered that increases in the minimum wage should not exceed productivity growth
over the medium term, while complementary policies should address inequality and poverty.
Directors noted that the gray economy is preventing Latvia from achieving its full potential by
hindering the efficient allocation of resources, creating an unfair playing field, and curtailing
budget revenues. They called for further efforts to improve participation in the formal economy
alongside measures to enhance public services and garner public support.
Directors noted with satisfaction that Latvia’s banking system is well capitalized and profitable.
However, they expressed concern that the persisting weakness in bank credit constrains
investment and growth. They encouraged the authorities to address the legal and structural
constraints hampering lending to SMEs and households, and to use the benchmarking exercise to
review banks’ risk models. Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to strengthen
AML/CFT regulations and supervision, and urged continued vigilance to mitigate risks,
especially those related to non-resident deposits. They urged the authorities to focus on
implementation of the enhanced regulations and to continue to align the framework with
international standards.
Directors considered the fiscal stance to be broadly appropriate, while noting that vigilance will
be needed to ensure adherence to targets and EU rules. They also noted that additional fiscal
space is needed over the medium term to strengthen the social safety net, promote social
inclusion, and boost productive public spending. They welcomed the authorities’ plan to raise tax
revenue, and recommended using the ongoing reviews of tax and expenditures as an opportunity
to consider comprehensive reforms to improve incentives and recalibrate the tax burden
equitably.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Macroeconomic conditions are broadly favorable: the output gap is almost
closed; the fiscal and current account deficits are at sustainable levels; and
unemployment continues to fall. Nevertheless, GDP growth has slowed recently,
hampered by a weak external environment, diminishing productivity gains, and delays in
EU funds absorption. Credit growth remains elusive, wage pressures have surfaced, and
the gray economy remains pervasive.
Challenges. In the medium-to long-run, structural reforms to enhance productivity and
maintain post-crisis competitiveness gains will be necessary to maintain the pace of
income convergence with Western Europe. A resumption of credit growth is needed in
the near term to support investment and support the consumption led recovery. More,
and better targeted, resources are required to strengthen the social safety net, and
support inclusive growth and employment.
Staff views.


Structural reforms must progress—in areas such as the judiciary, business
environment, education, infrastructure, and labor markets—to support
competitiveness and productivity.



Actions to address the gray economy will be crucial to promote the efficient
allocation of resources and enhance revenues.



Concerted efforts by the authorities and banks are needed to facilitate lending,
especially to SMEs, to support growth.



Continued vigilant supervision remains vital to mitigate real and reputational risks, in
particular in the non-resident deposit (NRD) banking sector.



Reviews of tax and expenditures provide an opportunity to improve incentives,
recalibrate the tax burden equitably, and explore options for opening fiscal space

Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with the assessment of the outlook,
risks, and challenges facing Latvia. In particular, they agreed with the need to make
continued progress on structural reforms to support competitiveness and productivity.

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

CONTEXT
1.
Latvia continues to make steady economic progress in terms of stability and growth,
but per capita GDP remains well below the Western European average. Macroeconomic
conditions are generally favorable. The output gap is
almost closed, the current account is broadly in line
with fundamentals, and unemployment continues to
decline. The fiscal deficit has been reduced to a
sustainable level, and public debt is among the
lowest in Europe. Nevertheless, GDP growth has
slowed significantly over the last three years amid
weak external conditions and diminishing
productivity gains, credit growth remains elusive,
and wage pressures have surfaced with tightening
labor market conditions. And while income per
capita continues to rise, it remains around 40 percent below the EU-15 average.
2.
A number of the 2015 Article IV policy recommendations have been broadly
implemented. Notably, measures have been adopted to increase the revenue envelope and make
the tax system more progressive. The development of credit bureaus and reforms to insolvency
procedures and the court system are ongoing. Close supervision of non-resident deposit (NRD)
specialized banks continues and anti-money laundering (AML) supervision has been stepped up. The
minimum wage in 2016 was raised in line with productivity growth, and reforms in education to
reduce skills mismatches are progressing. Nonetheless, shifting the tax burden towards property
taxation, improving SOE governance, and strengthening infrastructure are still to be addressed.
3.
A new government was appointed on February 11, 2016 and OECD accession is
scheduled. The new Prime Minister, Māris Kučinskis, who is from the same center-right coalition,
but a different party, has indicated that there will be policy continuity. On May 11, the OECD invited
Latvia to join the organization following 3 years of accession discussions.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Growth picked up somewhat last year despite a weak external environment. GDP
growth rose to 2.7 percent, up about ¼ percent over the previous year. A short-lived reopening of
Liepajas Metalurgs (LM)—a large steel manufacturer—gave the economy a boost early in the year,
and private consumption grew by 3.3 percent, spurred by gains in employment and real wages.
However, weak external conditions, combined with lingering geopolitical tensions, had a dampening
effect, as did the effective cessation of production by LM later in the year. Investment saw only a
modest turnaround, at 2.1 percent following a contraction of almost 5.5 percent over 2013–14.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

5.
Exports grew by only 1.4 percent, reflecting
tepid growth in the euro area and the prolonged
recession in Russia, although Latvian businesses
proved resilient and able to penetrate alternative
markets (Box 1). The real effective exchange rate
remained broadly in line with fundamentals, with the
euro depreciation against the dollar offsetting the ruble
depreciation (Box 2). The current account deficit
narrowed to 1.2 percent of GDP, as imports fell faster
than exports.
6.
Inflation remained well below target, falling
to 0.2 percent, driven by the decline in oil and food
prices and low inflation in the euro area. Downward
pressures were partially offset by the liberalization of
electricity tariffs for smaller enterprises and households.
Core inflation averaged 1 percent, supported by strong
wage growth. Producer price growth remained negative,
reaching -1.6 percent.

month in 2013 to EUR 360 in 2015). However, the
recorded wage increase is likely to comprise some measurement error: some workers under-report
their official earnings, claiming to earn only the minimum wage to evade taxes, and the recent
minimum wage increases will therefore result in large recorded official wage increases for such
workers even though their actual wages would not change.
8.
The financial sector continued to strengthen, as did private sector balance sheets.
Banks further improved their balance sheets, bringing the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio down to
5.4 percent in March, and the capital adequacy ratio up close to 23 percent. Bank profits were robust
and liquidity abundant. More broadly, asset prices are gradually recovering, while household and
corporate debt continues to fall and borrowers’ repayment capacity improves. On the supervisory
front, the Financial and Capital Market Commission (FCMC) took a series of steps to clamp down in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

anti-money laundering (AML) cases, including bank fines and personnel actions, and revoking the
license of a small bank—Trasta Komercbanka—in early March due to breaches of AML requirements.
The bank, which accounts for only 1.4 percent of total banking sector assets, does not pose a risk to
financial stability, and its remaining assets are expected to cover over 90 percent of its liabilities,
including all deposits covered under the deposit insurance guarantee. Furthermore, on the
recommendation of the authorities, the banks have commissioned in depth audits of their AML/CFT
procedures with a number of US law firms. Rietumu Banka is undergoing an AQR ahead of the
transition of its supervision responsibility to the SSM, reflecting its emergence as Latvia’s third
largest bank.
9.
Yet credit growth remains elusive.
Latvia’s credit-less recovery continues, outlasting
its neighbors’, and broader historical, experience.
The stock of bank credit to the private sector fell
by 2.2 percent (y-on-y) at end-2015 compared
to a drop of 7 percent at end-2014. The loan to
deposit ratio continues to fall, albeit more
slowly, due to a continued fall in the stock of
loans as well as a robust growth of resident
deposits at 9 percent (y-on-y), reflecting strong
wage growth as well as precautionary
sentiments. The stock of NRDs (at constant
exchange rates) increased by just above
1 percent y-on-y in December 2015, compared
to 15 percent a year earlier, and there has been a
modest outflow in Q1 2016.

10.
The general government deficit was around 1.3 percent of GDP in 2015, 0.3
percentage points higher than targeted in the budget. The higher outturn is the result of a
previously agreed change of plans from long-term renting to purchasing the newly built offices of
the State Revenue Services. Tax revenues were supported by strong wage growth and improved tax
compliance, albeit showing signs of weakening in the first quarter of 2016. With the output gap
slightly negative, staff estimates that the 2015 structural deficit was at 1.1 percent of GDP, in line
with the Fiscal Discipline Law (FDL) and Latvia’s European Union commitments.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
Growth is expected to slow slightly in 2016 to 2½ percent. The economy, particularly the
construction sector, decelerated markedly at the end of 2015 and in early 2016, reflecting delays in
investment due to a slow start-up of projects related to the new 2014-2020 European Structural
Funds program, continued economic and geopolitical uncertainty, and weak economic performance
in the Euro Area and Russia. Growth is forecast to pick up later this year and into 2017, bolstered by
robust real wage growth and higher disposable income due to low inflation, improved external
conditions, and a pickup in investment and credit, partly triggered by the coming on stream of EU6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

funded projects. Inflation is expected to remain well below target at 0.2 percent in 2016, but is
forecast to rise to 1.7 percent in 2017, reflecting primarily an upswing in oil prices and base effects,
and the pick-up in growth.
The growth path is subject to uncertainty, despite being
forecast to rise to potential …

the downside especially in the nearer term…

12.
Over the medium term, the economy is projected to grow by 4 percent per year, based
on the authorities’ commitment to, and track record of, delivering reform. This growth rate is
roughly the average attained over the last fifteen years.1 Growth would be led by exports and
investment, and buttressed by continued robust private consumption. This outlook is predicated on
implementation of structural reforms to promote investment and productivity, alleviate the
tightening labor market, and on the resumption of credit growth (see Policy Discussions).
13.
The baseline outlook is subject to significant downside risks (see Risk Assessment
Matrix, Box 3). Prolonged weak growth in the Euro Area and Russia would adversely impact exports
and lower confidence, while protracted geopolitical tensions could disrupt trade and heighten risk
aversion. Global financial volatility could raise the cost of parent bank financing, further hindering
credit growth, while non-resident deposits (NRDs) could be susceptible to sudden reversals in the
event of a sufficiently large shock. Failure of credit to pick up would dampen investment and
growth. Looking further ahead, a failure to tackle the structural reform agenda would impede
productivity growth and further erode competitiveness, undermining growth performance and the
convergence agenda. The external assessment projects a downward trend for the debt-to-GDP ratio
over the medium term, but a severe growth or current account shock could reverse this (Annex II
External Debt Sustainability Analysis).

1

This outlook is also consistent with the rate of potential growth identified in a recent selected issues paper (see
Selected Issues Paper, IMF Country Report No. 15/111).

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

The authorities broadly concurred with the outlook and assessment of risks. Regarding the
outlook, while noting that growth could indeed be more modest, especially given the external
environment, they pointed out that there was a considerable downward risk stemming from the
economic developments in Russia, and also from sluggish investment activity. They also noted
that demographic developments will weigh on the economy in the coming years. On an upside,
they noted that a stronger recovery in the Euro Area or acceleration in the absorption of EU
structural funds could provide boost to economic activity. The overall balance of risks reinforced
their view of the importance of prudent policymaking.

While Latvia continues to make
steady economic progress, a key
challenge will be to generate the
growth necessary to sustain the pace
of income convergence with Western
Europe. This will require a broad twopronged strategy based on macrostructural reforms to enhance
productivity, maintain competitiveness,
and improve equity in the medium-to
long-run; and macro-financial policies to
resuscitate credit to support investment
and growth, especially in the short-run.

Sources: Eurostat and IMF staff calculations.

15.
Actions to address the gray—informal—economy will also be crucial. The pervasive gray
economy, which by some estimates may amount to 20-25 percent of GDP,2 is preventing Latvia from
fulfilling its potential. In particular, it is hindering the efficient allocation of resources, including
access to capital, creating an unfair playing field, and limiting revenues that are necessary to develop
the country to everyone’s benefit.

A. Productivity
16.
Productivity growth is key to maintaining the pace of income convergence. Latvia’s PPP
per capita GDP now stands around 60 percent of the EU-15 average. The rapid income convergence
over the past two decades was driven largely by productivity growth, which averaged 4 percent over
the period. As the labor force is projected to decline, the burden of future income convergence will
need to be shouldered by investment and continued TFP growth.

Latvia has ample scope to raise productivity, but this will require further structural
reform. Maintaining productivity growth will not be simple, as easy gains have likely already been
exhausted and firms are approaching their technology frontiers. Indeed, firm level data suggest that
productivity growth since 2010 was largely due to “catch-up” by less productive firms (see Selected
Issues Paper). Nonetheless, there is ample scope for further gains, if Latvia can move towards the
“productivity frontier” set by others. Latvian labor productivity across all sectors in 2014 (measured
in 2010 euros) remains at about a third of the EU15 average, with agriculture doing relatively better
and manufacturing relatively worse. Closing such gaps will require continued progress on structural
reforms, notably to improve state-owned enterprise (SOE) governance and strengthen the business
environment, upgrade public infrastructure, and modernize legal systems (see Text Box).
 Improving SoE governance and the business environment. SoEs are dominant in a
variety of network sectors, such as electricity, postal services, airlines, railways and telecom,
potentially creating barriers to entry. Given Latvia’s size, many of these represent natural
monopolies, but initiatives to foster competition by unbundling services such as generation,
transmission and distribution in the energy markets are welcome. Furthermore, SoE
governance exhibits non-transparent accountability and shareholder power, hindering
efficiency.3 In this context, the re-introduction of independent boards and annual reporting
from 2016 for the largest SOEs is welcome. While a framework law to strengthen SOE
governance was passed in October 2014 and a new cross-sectoral coordination unit has
been set up, implementation will be key. Furthermore, reduction in the complexity of
regulatory procedures, simplification of license and permit systems, and removal of
compulsory chamber membership in professional services would be important to strengthen
business environment.4

 Enhancing public infrastructure would help attract FDI and associated technological
knowhow. An important area where reforms are both necessary and well-identified is ports:
Riga and Ventspils ports both remain overly dependent on low-value added bulk traffic and
face strong competition, especially from Russian ports. Rail connectivity, both cargo and
passenger is limited, and while major roads that are eligible for EU investment have
improved in quality and are well maintained, the majority of local roads are in a poor
condition with limited funding for repairs. Energy costs, particularly those related to
transmission and distribution, are relatively high and links to the wider European energy
markets are still being developed. In this context, initiatives to improve connectivity such as
Rail Baltics, and efforts to further integrate regional energy markets can boost efficiency and
reduce costs.
 Improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the insolvency regime will benefit firms,
individuals, and the financial sector. Recent steps to strengthen the insolvency regime and

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

institutions including efforts to consolidate court districts, training for judges and
administrators on insolvency issues, and subjecting insolvency administrators to greater
income disclosure and stricter supervision, are starting to bear fruit. The length of in-court
proceedings has fallen from 3 to 1.5 years in the past 5 years, and clearance rates have risen.
Nonetheless, banks continue to report concerns about lengthy procedures and low recovery
rates. Staff stressed that effective implementation of the recent reforms is vital to fully realize
efficiency gains, 5 and called on the authorities to monitor developments and report on
progress. Effort is also needed to further strengthen the transparency of, and procedures for,
case assignment.

Sustaining growth in the longer
term will likely require further structural
transformation with an emphasis on high
connectivity sectors and diversified and
sophisticated exports.6 Economies that
have been successful at maintaining the pace
of convergence, such as Czech Republic,
Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Korea, Singapore,
and Taiwan Province of China, all shifted
from low-skilled labor-intensive activities to
developing the national innovation systems
required to compete with high-income
countries in more sophisticated products and
pushing the global technological frontier.7

 Improvements in innovation and research and development could lay the ground for
such a transformation and help Latvia move up the value chain. R&D intensity remains
well below the EU average and the share of high-technology exports remains small (9.2
percent in 2014). The New Industrial Policy and Smart Specialization Strategy seek to
address these deficiencies but are in the initial stages of implementation. Staff supports the
authorities’ aim to more than double R&D spending, from the current 0.6 percent of GDP to
1.5 percent by 2020, largely through enhanced private sector spending, supported by EUfunded innovation and R&D schemes. However, achieving this target may be difficult,
particularly as the total amount of financing for R&D and innovation has not been boosted.
R&D and innovation incentive schemes are in place but greater uptake is needed, and
industry-science links need to be strengthened.

The authorities agreed with the need for reforms across various sectors to support
productivity and growth. In particular they noted that progress was being made strengthening
SOE governance, with the appointment of independent boards under way; gas market
liberalization is planned for 2017; important progress is being made in implementing the new
insolvency regime and is beginning to bear fruit; and detailed strategies under the National
Development Plan and Smart Specialization Strategy have been formulated for the technological
transformation of the economy. They also noted that while the goal to increase R&D spending to
1.5 percent of GDP is ambitious, relevant schemes were being redesigned based on past
experience.

B. Labor Competitiveness
19.
Rising wage pressures pose risks to competitiveness. Recent wage increases are partly
the consequence of the long period of strong productivity gains and an unwinding of the wage
restraint that prevailed in the aftermath of the 2009 recession. However, real unit labor costs have
already risen past their 2005 pre-crisis level, and wage pressures are likely to persist over the
foreseeable future, as the labor force is expected to continue to decline, due to a low birth rate and
emigration, and to a lack of skilled workers. These pressures would then raise labor costs of
production and erode Latvia’s competitive edge if not matched by productivity gains and supported
by appropriate macroeconomic policies.
Real wages have outpaced productivity in recent years...

 Minimum wage increases should not exceed productivity growth over the medium
term (see Cross Country Report on Minimum Wages, www.imf.org). Recent hikes, well in
excess of labor productivity, have raised the minimum wage to about 44 percent of the
average wage in 2015, an increase of almost 4 percentage points from 2013. While the
minimum wage provides support to the most vulnerable and can help reduce income
inequality, staff estimates that at the current level, minimum wage increases in excess of

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2015

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

labor productivity can be detrimental to employment—a minimum wage increase of
5 percent in excess of labor productivity could cause a 1 percent loss of employment among
low-income earners. In this regard, the authorities are to be commended for putting on hold
plans for further steep hikes, and raising the minimum wage appropriately by about
2.5 percent in 2016 in line with productivity. At the same time, complementary policies
should be employed to address inequality concerns.
 Further reforms are needed to alleviate the tightening labor market. The authorities
have already taken some steps to raise the participation rate and reduce structural
unemployment. The statutory retirement age is being raised gradually towards 65 years by
2025—it currently stands at 62½, and the criteria for early retirement and disability have
been tightened. Female labor force participation is already relatively high by regional
standards, at 55 percent. Several ongoing projects are targeted at various segments of the
unemployed population, including a project to facilitate regional labor mobility. Staff argued
that in-work tax credits and improvements in tapering of benefits when working is needed
to enhance work incentives and further encourage labor participation. Active labor market
policies (ALMPs) should continue to be strengthened, and more effort should be made to
attract high-skilled foreign workers.

The authorities agreed that competitiveness needs to be preserved, and that action is
needed across various fronts. They recognized that tightening labor market conditions need to
be addressed, and that effective education reform would be crucial. They also noted that as the
economic situation in Latvia improves, and wage differentials narrow, net migration may well
reverse as Latvian emigres begin to return. They noted that the labor participation rate is expected
to continue to rise over the medium term and that their education agenda is bearing fruit in
addressing skills mismatches. They pointed out in particular, that whereas the overall student
population has been declining, the number of students in sciences and technology was stable.
They agreed that the minimum wage should move in line with productivity over the medium term.

C. Financial Sector
20.
Latvia’s banking sector is bifurcated, and dominated by commercial banks with strong
cross border linkages (see Selected Issues Paper). The two segments follow very different business
models: the foreign (largely Nordic) banks deal mainly with domestic clients and provide the lion’s
share of domestic lending (more than 85 percent); while the domestic banks rely mostly on nonresident deposits, and their assets are composed of highly liquid foreign assets.

together these suggest that Latvia is likely towards the end of the repair stage of the credit cycle.
This assessment is supported by an index of financial conditions in Latvia, which suggests a return to
neutral conditions.8 Against this background, the absence of credit growth is especially concerning
as rising wage pressures could erode companies’ ability to self-finance the investment that is
needed to support growth both now and in the future.9

The FCI is constructed using various indicators of financial conditions (NPLs, credit growth, profitability, house
prices and funding ratios). For Latvia it explains more than 75 percent of the covariance of the data.

22.
While demand factors explain subdued lending activity to larger firms, supply factors
are likely more important for SMEs and households. For SMEs and households, banks cite lack of
documentable income as an important factor constraining their ability to lend. In 2007, legislation
was introduced prohibiting lending to natural persons against income other than that reported to
the State Revenue Services, a practice that was commonplace before the crisis. This (sound)
requirement likely makes some households with undocumented income ineligible for borrowing. A
lack of collateral or sufficient cash flow are important constraints on SME lending. For instance,
according to one bank, out of the 200 thousand companies registered only 15–20 thousand are
potentially eligible borrowers, once those firms that are loss making or have negative equity are
eliminated. The larger banks have also adopted a much more cautious attitude towards lending,
given their experience with the slow bankruptcy procedures and low recovery rates post crisis. This
leaves most of the domestically focused banks competing over a few large and collateral rich firms,
where, in fact demand seems to be lacking as investment plans are held back in the face of
economic and geopolitical uncertainties, and in some cases delays in the startup of a new round of
EU structural funds.

 Access to credit for SMEs should be facilitated. The SME sector is particularly credit
constrained. If well designed to address market failures, Government programs such as loan
guarantee schemes and subordinated loans through the Single Development Institute, are
welcome. Nevertheless, these programs cannot alleviate the problem for those firms or
individuals that are part of the gray economy. Staff suggested that the authorities explore
the experience in other jurisdictions where supervisors have defined a code of conduct for
lenders in an attempt to prevent discrimination against lending to SMEs, for instance, the
Credit Review Office in Ireland.
 Lending by Nordic subsidiaries could be better-attuned to Latvian conditions. There is
some evidence that centralized risk management by parent banks could be contributing to
overly-constrained lending in Latvia. Given Latvia’s recent crisis experience, and hence the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

higher probabilities of default, and rates of loss given default, it may be that banks’ internal
risk models place too much weight on the recent historical episode, relative to current
conditions. Indeed, after a sharp tightening since the onset of the crisis, bank lending
standards have not changed substantially.10 Also, subsidiary level data suggests that Nordic
banks’ lending is more procyclical in Latvia (and the rest of the Baltics) compared to the
home country. Based on this, staff urged the Latvian prudential authorities to use the results
of the benchmarking exercise11 of banks’ risk models conducted with their European
partners to ensure they appropriately capture risk, and that crisis legacies and associated risk
aversion do not unduly constrain lending.
23.
The authorities’ recent actions to combat financial fraud and mitigate AML/CFT risks
are commendable, yet safeguarding financial stability requires ongoing vigilance and action.
 The risks associated with non-resident deposits (NRDs) warrant continued vigilance.
NRD banks account for about 50 percent of total deposits, of which over 80 percent are
estimated to originate from Russia and CIS countries. The NRD banks12 enjoy high liquidity
ratios and stress tests suggest they can withstand outflows of close to 60 percent.
Nevertheless, NRDs could be vulnerable to sudden reversals, and as required by EU law,
they are covered by the state deposit guarantee scheme and thus represent a contingent
fiscal liability. That said, to date there are few signs of volatility in NRD inflows (Box 1), and
risks to the domestic economy are mitigated by various factors. NRD banks hold close to
60 percent of their assets in liquid instruments, and are appropriately subject to higher
capital and liquidity requirements,13 and higher contributions to Latvia’s deposit guarantee
scheme per dollar of deposits.
 The authorities have stepped up their anti-money laundering (AML) efforts, but
more is needed. As noted previously, the FCMC recently imposed fines against two banks,
requested board replacement of one, while revoking the license of another. More
importantly, the authorities have taken steps to address some of the recommendations of
the OECD’s Working Group on Bribery, including widening the definition of Politically
Exposed Persons (PEP). The FCMC has also adopted a risk-based supervision strategy, has
already, and is planning to increase further internal resources, and has employed external
resources for in-depth analyses of banks’ procedures in order to impose minimum
standards on their risk monitoring systems. Staff commended these efforts, encouraged
the authorities to bring the AML/CFT framework in line with the FATF standard, and ensure

that sufficient resources are allocated to AML supervision activities, in line with the
recommendations of the OECD’s Working Group on Bribery.
The authorities agreed that the banking system is robust, and that a resumption of credit
will be vital to future growth. They shared the view that demand and supply factors were likely
relevant for different segments of borrowers to varying degrees, and that a multifaceted approach
should be explored while ensuring financial stability. They welcomed the suggestion of using the
benchmarking exercise conducted with their European partners to review banks’ internal risk
models. They were also open to exploring approaches from other jurisdictions. In addition, they
plan to review their post-crisis financial sector measures to see if any had outlived their
usefulness. They agreed with the critical importance of vigilant supervision to mitigate both real
and reputational risks, including those associated with the NRD sector. In this context, they
underscored their recent enhanced efforts to address AML issues. They agreed that continued
effort was needed to improve the operation of the insolvency regime.

D. Fiscal Policy
24.
The 2016 budget is broadly appropriate. The 2016 budget, by targeting a structural deficit
of 0.9 percent of GDP, takes a close-to-neutral stance, balancing the sluggish economic environment
and the need to stay within domestic and EU fiscal rules.14 Increases in defense and social spending
of about ½ percent are offset by revenue-enhancing measures, including the introduction of a
solidarity tax on high-income earners, increases in excises duties, and measures to broaden the tax
base and improve tax compliance, as well as lower current expenditures.15 Automatic stabilizers
should be allowed to operate fully in the event that economic growth falls below the forecast.

Looking further ahead, additional
fiscal space will be needed over the
medium term to strengthen the social
safety net and boost productive public
spending. Social spending in Latvia is
currently over 10 percentage points of GDP
lower than the EU average, and together
with public spending on healthcare, is
among the lowest in Europe (as a share of
GDP or per inhabitant), putting at risk
vulnerable segments of the population and
hindering the buildup of human capital.

Latvia’s Fiscal Discipline Law sets a medium-term objective (MTO) of 0.5 percent of GDP, but allows a deviation of
about 0.5 percent of GDP this year for revenue transfers to the privately managed Pillar II pension fund.

The “Solidarity Tax” effectively amounts to the removal of the cap on social security contributions for income
earners over EUR 4050 per month which was introduced in 2014 but without the corresponding accumulation of
benefits.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

Planned spending increases, for example on defense or pensions, place additional demands on
available resources. The authorities’ ambitious plan to bring tax revenue up to a third of GDP by
2020 is commendable, and will require sustained efforts to improve tax collection and policy.
Greater efforts are needed to strengthen the social safety net, including in particular the Guaranteed
Minimum Income (GMI) benefits as recommended by the World Bank
26.
The authorities’ reviews of tax and expenditures, and tax compliance are welcome. The
large tax-wedge in Latvia tends to discourage work and imposes a significant burden on households
at the lower end of the income distribution, while the corporate income tax rate is among the lowest
in the EU and tax exemptions and non-compliance are extensive. At the same time, income
inequality in Latvia is among the highest in the EU, while revenues and expenditures are among the
lowest. The reviews offer the chance to consider reforms comprehensively to improve incentives,
recalibrate the tax burden equitably, and explore options for opening fiscal space.
 At the same time as seeking to boost revenues, the tax burden should be shifted towards
growth friendly taxation, including property taxation, which currently accounts for about
0.8 percent of GDP in revenue (less than half the OECD average). This should be
accompanied by implementation of the recent cadastral valuation reform, with
appropriate exemptions for the poorest households. A more gradual tapering of benefits,
which currently fall one-for-one with income, would improve work incentives among lowincome earners. Reforms are also needed to the current micro-enterprise tax regime which
has lent itself to considerable abuse. Options for the authorities to consider to create fiscal
space could involve raising the CIT given its low starting point, a PIT surtax on high income
earners, reducing the minimum non-taxable threshold for pensioners, and better-targeting
of tax allowances and expenditures, such as child benefits.
 On the spending side, efforts could focus on better means testing to help achieve social
protection objectives most efficiently, and progress could also be made to rationalize
spending and improve efficiency, for instance in education.
 Some progress has been made in combating the gray economy, but more is needed. In
this regard, further efforts to boost tax compliance will be important, while measureable
improvements in public services can help build public support.

The authorities agreed with staff that the budget should be implemented flexibly in accordance
with the FDL, and that the revenue envelope should be boosted over time. They cautioned that given
the risks to the outlook, prudent fiscal policy will be needed to maintain compliance with fiscal rules, while
concurring with staff that automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate. They noted that income
inequality has declined recently, partly due to the higher minimum wage, and that social spending,
particularly on healthcare, is planned to increase over the medium term. They indicated that work is
ongoing to revise the Guaranteed Minimum Income law, which would also allow gradual tapering of
benefits in some cases, and cadastral valuation which would take into account households’ ability to pay.
They agreed with the adverse effects of the current micro-enterprise tax regime, noting that it is also
currently under review.

STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
Despite the current slowdown, growth is expected to pick up, but the timing is
uncertain. Growth is expected to slow slightly to 2½ percent in 2016 due to delays in absorption of
EU-funds and continued geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties. Nevertheless, growth
momentum is expected to build later this year and into 2017, as EU programs start up and the
global economy strengthens, though the exact timing is uncertain. The outlook is subject to
significant downside risks, including a prolonged slowdown in key trading partners, a heightening of
geopolitical tensions, failure of credit to resume, or of structural reforms to be advanced.
28.
An average growth rate of 4 percent is feasible going forward, but will require
sustained structural reforms. Structural reforms are needed to promote investment and
productivity growth, and safeguard competitiveness in the face of adverse demographic trends and
slowing productivity gains. Key reform areas include: infrastructure and SOE management;
increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation of the judicial system and insolvency
regime; tax policy to improve incentives to work; and education and vocational training to reduce
skills mismatches. In light of the current level of the minimum wage to average wage ratio, increases
in the minimum wage should not exceed productivity growth over the medium term, while
complementary policies should address inequality and poverty.
29.
Actions to address the gray economy will also be crucial. The gray economy is
preventing Latvia from fulfilling its potential. Further efforts to boost tax compliance will be
important, while measureable improvements in public services can help garner public support.
30.
Credit flows need to resume to support investment and growth, but constraints are
multifaceted. A multi-pronged response is needed to address impediments to credit growth while
ensuring financial stability. Elements should include firm implementation of court and insolvency
reforms, along with reporting on progress made; an analysis based on the results of the
benchmarking exercise of banks’ risk models, conducted in cooperation with their European
partners, to ensure they appropriately capture risk, and that crisis legacies and associated risk

aversion do not unduly constrain lending. An expansion of public sector initiatives to catalyze SME
lending could also be considered.
31.
While the 2016 budget is broadly appropriate, fiscal space is needed over the medium
term to strengthen the social safety net and boost productive public spending. The authorities’
plan to raise tax revenue to one third of GDP is commendable and will require tax policy changes,
sustained efforts to improve compliance, along with improvements in public services to garner
support. The authorities’ review of tax policy and compliance and expenditures are an opportunity
to consider reforms comprehensively to improve incentives, recalibrate the tax burden equitably,
and explore options for opening fiscal space. In particular, while also seeking to boost revenues, the
tax burden should be shifted towards more efficient and growth friendly taxation, including property
taxation.
32.
Strengthened AML/CFT efforts are commendable, but continued vigilant supervision is
required to mitigate real and reputational risks, especially for NRD banks. The authorities should
focus on implementation of the enhanced regulations, as well as ensuring that sufficient resources
are allocated to AML supervision activities, in order to strengthen the reputation of the Latvian
financial sector.
33.

Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard

12-month cycle.

Box 1. Evolving Role of Russia
Trade linkages with Russia are strong but diminishing in importance. Trade linkages strengthened in
the past decade due to the faster growth of the Russian economy compared to Latvia’s other trading
partners and at its peak in 2013, Russia accounted for around 11 percent of Latvia’s exports of goods and
services. However, since then the share of Russia in total exports have diminished somewhat due to ongoing
geopolitical tensions and significantly weaker economic performance in Russia. Russia’s share of total
Latvian exports in 2015 stood at below 8 percent in 2015, with EU and other countries picking up the slack.

Russian counter-sanctions have had only a marginal impact on Latvia’s economy. The Russian
measures were directed at Latvian food exports. However, the share of food products under sanctions to
total Latvian exports to Russia was less than 10 percent in 2014. Moreover, Latvian food exporters were able
to diversify and find new markets to substitute the loss of the Russian market. While the export of food
products under sanctions (measured at the 2-digit industry level) declined 77 percent in 2015, overall
exports in this category only showed a marginal decline of around 3 percent. Exports to alternative markets
such as Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, and the Euro area more generally, largely cushioned the impact of
the sanctions.
Geopolitical tensions have had little discernible impact on the Latvian banking system. As a regional
banking center, Latvia receives a large amount of Russian deposits. More than 80 percent of non-resident
deposits (NRDs) in the Latvian banking system come from CIS countries, mostly Russia. The average (over
four quarters) growth rate of NRD deposits in 2015 was 19 percent, higher than the 12 percent seen in 2014.
However, given that over 60 percent of NRDs are in US dollars, this figure incorporates significant valuation
effects from the euro’s movement against the dollar. After correcting for such valuation effects, the average
growth rate in 2015 was 6.5 percent compared to 11.5 percent in 2014. Overall there was no evidence of
disruption of NRD inflows, albeit following a strong pickup in the last quarter of 2014 and the first half of
2015, the pace of growth slowed down, leaving the stock of NRDs (at constant exchange rates) in December
2015 just 1 percent above the stock a year earlier. This trend continued in 2016, with the first quarter
witnessing a modest outflow of 3.7 percent on a y-o-y basis.

Russian FDI to Latvia has accelerated since 2014. Russia’s share in inward FDI has grown to around
7 percent in 2015, up from 6 percent in 2014 and higher than around 4.5 percent in 2012–13. This is
consistent with strong NRD inflows, suggesting that the incentives of Russian investors to allocate their
deposits and capital to Latvia have not so far been harmed by geopolitical tensions.

Box 2. External Sector Assessment
The macroeconomic imbalances of the pre-crisis period have been largely addressed. The current
account is close to balance, and although it is projected to deteriorate somewhat in 2016 and 2017 due
to continued consumption demand and an expected pick-up in investment, it should narrow in the
outer years as exports pick up as growth returns in Latvia’s major trading partners. The external debt as
a share of GDP has been on a declining trajectory. It stood at 138 percent of GDP at end-2015 and is
projected to decline to about 112 percent of GDP by 2021 (see external debt sustainability framework).
The gross external debt figure somewhat overstates the debt levels due to large short term liabilities of
the banking sector (to their parents). Net external debt stood at 26 percent of GDP at the end of 2015.
Gross public debt is comfortably below the Stability and Growth Pact threshold at 39 percent of GDP
and corporate debt is modest at 25 percent of GDP.
Staff assess the real exchange rate to be broadly in line with fundamentals. Direct assessment of
the exchange rate, using EBA-lite IREER model finds a small overvaluation of around 3 percent, which is
broadly consistent with the evolution of the REER (Figure 5) and rising unit labor costs. The EBA-lite
methodology also concludes that Latvia’s policies are broadly appropriate and estimates a small policy
gap of around 1 percent of GDP, mostly driven by depressed credit in the economy, suggesting that
Latvia’s fiscal, external (reserves and capital account), and financial policies are broadly appropriate. But
the current account norm is estimated as -4.8 percent of GDP, much larger than the actual 2015 CA
deficit of -1.2 percent, and results in an

position of 60 percent of GDP, which
would deteriorate further if the actual current account deficit were in line with the model’s estimated
current account norm. The underlying model does not appear to capture well the specifics of the
Latvian experience, in particular, the overheating of the economy prior to the crisis (with a CA deficit in
excess of 20 percent), the subsequent collapse in output and demand, and the large internal
devaluation that was instrumental in rebalancing the economy.

Medium

Low/Medium

Sharp asset price decline and decompression of
credit spreads as investors reassess underlying risk
and respond to unanticipated changes in growth
and financial fundamentals in large economies, Fed
policy rate path, and increases in U.S. term premia,
with poor market liquidity amplifying volatility.

Could lower funding for Nordic parent banks
reliant on wholesale funding, raising the cost of
financing and hindering credit growth.

High/ Medium
Structurally weak growth in key advanced and
emerging economies. Weak demand and
persistently low inflation from a failure to fully
address crisis legacies and undertake structural
reforms, leading to low medium-term growth and
persisting financial imbalances.

Euro area monetary policy is first line of
defense against liquidity stress, supported if
needed, by activation of backstops and
resolution mechanism.

Escalating sanctions/countersanctions could
threaten other sectors of the Latvian economy
(apart from food exports, which are already
sanctioned). Non-resident deposits (NRDs) could
be susceptible to sudden stops or reversals in case
of a sufficiently large shock.

An exit could pose major challenges for Europe
an extended period of heightened uncertainty

failures, and ensure appropriate macroprudential policy settings.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF
staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below
10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the
source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize
jointly.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
As of January 1, 2014, the currency of Latvia is the euro, which floats freely and independently against
other currencies. Prior to 2014, the currency of Latvia was the lat, which was introduced in March 1993
to replace the Latvian ruble. The exchange rate was pegged to the SDR from February 1994 to
December 2004, within a ±1 percent band. On January 1, 2005, the lat was re-pegged to the euro at
the rate 1 euro = 0.702804 lats, and on April 29, 2005, Latvia entered ERM II, maintaining the previous
band width. Latvia maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the payments or transfers for
current international transactions. Exchange restrictions maintained for security reasons have been
notified to the Fund for approval most recently in January 2013 (see EBD/13/3, January 28, 2013).
Previous Article IV Consultation:
Latvia is on the 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on
May 4, 2015 (IMF Country Report No. 15/110). The Executive Board assessment is available at
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2015/cr15110.pdf.
Safeguards Assessment:
The safeguards assessment completed on July 8, 2009 concluded that the Bank of Latvia (BoL)
operates robust internal audit and control systems. The assessment recommended clarifying the
respective roles of the BoL and the Treasury in holding, managing, and reporting to the Fund audited
international reserves data. It also recommended amendments to the mandate of the BoL’s audit
committee and improvements to the financial statements' disclosures. The authorities have already
taken steps to implement these recommendations, notably by establishing a formal arrangement
between the BoL and the Treasury, revising the audit committee charter and expanding the existing
accounting framework.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
A joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission conducted an assessment of Latvia’s
financial sector as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) during
February 14–28, 2001. The Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) report was discussed at the
Board on January 18, 2002, together with the 2001 Article IV staff report (Country Report No. 02/10).
An AML/CFT assessment mission took place during March 8–24, 2006, and the report was sent to the
Board on May 23, 2007. A joint IMF-World Bank mission conducted an FSAP Update during
February 27–March 9, 2007. A World Bank mission conducted an FSAP development module during
November 8–18, 2011. Moneyval conducted a follow-up assessment during May 9–13, 2011, and the
mutual evaluation report was adopted on July 5, 2012.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund for surveillance purposes is classified as adequate (A). Latvia is a
subscriber of the SDDS (Special Data Dissemination Standard) and a link to Latvia’s metadata is available at the
IMF’s website for the DSBB (Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board).
National Accounts: The CSB compiles and publishes quarterly national accounts with the production and
expenditure approaches on a regular and timely basis. Since September 2011, national accounts are calculated
with the NACE rev. 2 classifications, determined by the European Commission. However, there are
discrepancies between the GDP estimates based on production and those based on expenditure. The
statistical discrepancy is included in changes in inventories on the expenditure side.
The underlying data for the production approach are obtained primarily through a survey of businesses and
individuals, and are supplemented by data from labor force surveys and administrative sources. The CSB
believes that the basic data understate economic activity, particularly in the private sector, and there is an
ongoing effort to increase coverage. Additional data for the expenditure-based accounts are obtained from
household budget surveys and other surveys from the State Treasury and ministries.
Government finance statistics: Fund staff is provided quarterly with monthly information on revenues and
expenditures of the central and local governments and special budgets. With some limitations, the available
information permits the compilation of consolidated accounts of the general government. The Government
Finance Statistics database in the IMF’s eLibrary website contains cash data in the GFSM 2001 format. Quarterly
general government data on an accrual basis are provided through Eurostat for the International Financial
Statistics on a timely basis.
Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics could provide more detail in the liabilities of depository corporations
by subsectors of the general government in line with international standards.
Balance of payments: The BoL assumed responsibility for compiling the balance of payments statistics from
the CSB in early 2000. The data collection program is a mixed system, with surveys supplemented by monthly
information from the international transactions reporting system (ITRS), and administrative sources. Contrary
to international standards—but similar to a number of other EU countries—the BoL includes provisions for
expected losses of foreign-owned banks. Between Q4 2008–Q2 2010, this treatment led to the recording of
negative reinvested earnings (i.e., losses) of foreign-owned banks as negative outflows. These “inflows” in the
income account of the balance of payments thus gave a positive contribution to the current account.
Data Standards and Quality: Latvia is a participant in the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard since
November 1, 1996. A Data ROSC was published in June 2004.
Reporting to STA: The authorities are reporting data for the Fund’s International Financial Statistics,
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, the Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
June 10, 2016
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the Staff
Report was circulated to the Executive Board on May 18, 2016. The information does not
alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Q1 GDP data confirm the economy is slowing, broadly in line with staff
estimates. 2016Q1 GDP growth in Latvia came in at 2.1 percent year on year, stronger than
the flash estimate of 1.8, and broadly in line with staff estimates. While representing a
deceleration from the 2.7 percent year on year growth in the last quarter of 2015, on a quarter
on quarter seasonally adjusted basis GDP increased by 0.1 percent in 2016Q1 after
decreasing by 0.4 percent in 2015Q4. Annual GDP growth remained driven by private
consumption growth of 3.7 percent, with government consumption rising 2.2 percent. The
slowdown primarily reflects a 16.4 percent decline in gross fixed capital formation. Imports
rose 4.6 percent, supported by higher consumption, while exports fell by 2.9 percent due to
weakness in key trade partners.
3.
Amendments to the Credit Institutions Law were passed by Parliament. The
amendments, passed on June 2, strengthen the AML/CFT framework, providing for bigger
fines in the event of breaches of anti-money laundering or combatting terrorist financing
requirements.
4.
Prime Minister Kučinskis signed the Agreement on Accession of Latvia to the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on June 2.
Following ratification of the agreement by Parliament, which is expected in mid-June, Latvia
will become the 35th member of the organization.

Statement by Thomas Ostros, Executive Director for Republic of Latvia
and Agnija Jekabsone, Advisor to Executive Director
June 10, 2016
On behalf of the Latvian authorities I would like to thank staff for the candid and
productive discussions during the Article IV mission in Riga. The authorities highly
value staff's contributions. The external expertise provided by the Fund always plays a
significant role in Latvian policy discussions. The report and the accompanying
Selected Issues papers appropriately reflect the current state of the Latvian economy
highlighting key growth bottlenecks of the economy. The authorities agree with the
thrust of staff appraisal, but would also like to offer some comments on issues raised
in the report.
Outlook
Despite the difficulties, the Latvian economy is making headway, and doing it in
a balanced manner. Against the backdrop of continuing geopolitical tensions and
sluggish growth outlook in the EU, the 2.7 percent GDP growth rate posted in 2015
can be considered good news. In particular, since this growth rate was achieved with
the current account balance in line with fundamentals, and public and private debt
dynamics causing no concern.
Growth slowdown in last two quarters, however, provides some food for thought
about the prospects of convergence with Western Europe. Over the last two
quarters – the last quarter of 2015 and the first of 2016 – GDP growth has slowed and
turned negative. Although this deceleration was mostly due to temporary factors,
reflecting a combination of delays in the absorption of EU funds and problems in one
large steel manufacturer, staff rightly points out that medium-term growth will hinge
on the ability to implement meaningful structural reforms.
An average growth of 4 percent is indeed attainable, but it would require effort
on the part of the authorities to set off additional sources of growth. The last time
the economy's growth rates reached or exceeded 4.0 percent was in 2011-2012,
rebounding from a more than 20 percent drop during the crisis. In the absence of
structural reforms and stronger credit expansion, growth rates of such magnitude seem
challenging.
Labor Competitiveness
The authorities share staff's concerns about rising wage pressures. Some of the
increase is indeed offsetting the long period of wage restraint after the crisis. Also, it
contains some measurement error due to tax evasion. However, that can only explain
part to the rise; the other part points to renewed pressures in the labor market.
Minimum wage increases in excess of labor productivity growth could potentially
hurt competitiveness and should be avoided in the future.
Further reforms in vocational and higher education remain a core part of our
strategy to strengthen competitiveness. In order to improve labor flexibility, work
on revising the Guaranteed Minimum Income law, allowing for a gradual tapering of
benefits, as advised by staff, is ongoing. Also, the authorities plan to introduce

measures aimed at improving regional labor mobility. However, free movement of
labor within the EU imposes limits to how much can be achieved by measures
containing wage pressures. Against this backdrop, the authorities see measures aimed
at building a more skilled workforce – namely improvements in higher and vocational
education – as key to guaranteeing future growth.
Financial sector
Overall, the analysis on the reasons for low credit is in line with the authorities'
views – sluggish credit growth is likely hampering growth. Both demand and
supply factors are hindering growth, albeit for different groups. While for larger
enterprises and more established enterprises demand factors matter, credit supply for
SMEs and households remain tight.
Lending by Nordic subsidiaries could indeed be better attuned to Latvian
circumstances. The analysis in the Selected Issues paper clearly sets out the reasons
for sluggish growth and can serve as a good ground for a discussion. The suggestion
to use the benchmarking exercise conducted with their European partners to review
banks’ internal risk models is worth considering.
However, the role of other, domestic, factors should not be underestimated. In the
report, staff highlights the importance of the insolvency process. It is indeed vital to
continue progress in this area; however, the authorities see that a broader approach,
focusing not only on the insolvency process, but strengthening the whole legal
environment and judiciary system is necessary. Strengthening the authorities’
investigative capacity, combating and preventing corruption, as well as maintaining
high standards of ethics and business culture among all stakeholders – particularly
state authorities and insolvency administrators – are of paramount importance. As in
other policy areas, grey economy remains an important factor holding back credit
recovery.
The authorities acknowledge the importance of vigilant supervision and
mitigating of risks in the NRD sector. The FCMC has taken important steps to
mitigate anti-money laundering and terrorism financing (AML/CFT) risks. In this
context, independent reviews of AML/CFT compliance in NRD banks have been
carried out by competent US consultancy firms in April and May.
As a minor point, the authorities do not share the view that limited lending of the
NRD sector to the domestic economy implies that a large part of the economy has
limited access to credit (as Selected Issues, p.27, Paragraph 17 seems to indicate).
Given the volatile nature of the main funding sources of NRD banks, their
engagement in lending for residents might be unwelcome from the financial stability
perspective. It is the resident-servicing banking sector that is essential in this process.
Fiscal policy
The fiscal position remains sustainable. The 2015 fiscal deficit was 1.3 percent and
in 2016 it is envisaged at 1.1 percent. Public debt remains low by EU standards and is
projected to trend downwards over the medium term.

Additional fiscal space will be needed to support reforms in the education and
health sectors and to strengthen the social safety net in the coming years. The
authorities' envisaged review of tax and expenditures provides an opportunity to
examine options for opening fiscal space. At the same time, one should be realistic
about what can be achieved at the current stage of development. While social
spending is among the lowest in EU and should gradually be increased, the EU is a
rather high-bar reference group in this respect. As can be inferred from the chart on
page 17 of the report, social spending has a tendency to correlate with GDP per
capita. Latvia still remains one of the poorest countries in the EU in need of setting
the right conditions for catching-up. That said, the authorities are aware of the need to
increase targeted social spending, in addition to health care and education reform, and
plan to do it in the coming years.
Concerning options for opening fiscal space, the authorities see more potential in
combating the grey economy and less in recalibrating the tax burden. The
authorities have doubts that some of the measures suggested by staff (like the PIT
surtax on high income) would constitute a 'growth friendly taxation'. High share of
grey economy implies that any re-calibration aimed at taxing the higher income share
of population would fall disproportionally on the shoulders of remaining non-grey
economy high wage earners. Also, it would increase the relative costs (vis-à-vis
similar countries) of attracting high-skilled employees. Combating the grey economy
remains the authorities' main priority. Over the last few years, the authorities have
been fairly successful in this area and will continue to implement measures
strengthening the taxation framework and the capacity of tax authorities. Moreover,
the ongoing tax system review will assist the authorities in developing a medium-term
tax strategy focusing on policy goals such as maintaining the competitiveness of the
tax system, analyzing options to improve equality and identifying options to increase
government revenues to finance increased spending needs.
