Executive Summary
Economic developments in Pakistan in fiscal year 2006/07 were generally good, but the
external current account deficit widened. Real GDP growth increased to 7 percent, the
debt-to-GDP ratio continued to decline, and gross international reserves rose to
US$14.3 billion (4½ months of imports). Average inflation, however, remained relatively
high at close to 8 percent. Notwithstanding a significant decline in import growth, the current
account deficit widened to 4.9 percent of GDP, owing mainly to significantly slower export
growth. The deficit was more than covered, however, by record-high capital inflows,
including foreign direct investment. Political uncertainties continue in light of the
government’s recent declaration of a state of emergency and questions about the timing of
parliamentary elections. The authorities were of the view that the reforms and institutional
changes introduced in recent years would be maintained by the government that will be
elected by the new parliament, regardless of its political orientation.
The discussions focused on the prospects for 2007/08 and the policies needed to reduce
the current account deficit to a more sustainable level over the medium term. The
authorities’ economic program for the current fiscal year envisages a reduction in the fiscal
deficit to 4 percent of GDP, from 4.3 percent in 2006/07. A recent tightening of monetary
conditions is expected to lead to slower broad money growth, with average inflation targeted
to decline to 6½ percent.
Although the outlook for 2007/08 remains favorable, the authorities’ policies may not
be sufficient to achieve their inflation target and reduce the external current account
deficit significantly. Real GDP growth is projected by the staff at 6½–7 percent in 2007/08.
Capital inflows would more than cover the current account deficit, but there are risks that
some inflows could be delayed. Against this background, the staff recommended a stronger
fiscal adjustment effort accompanied by a somewhat tighter monetary stance and greater
exchange rate flexibility. The authorities considered it very difficult to implement a greater
fiscal effort given the political calendar, and thought that exchange rate stability was
important at this juncture to maintain confidence. Although they saw no need to increase
interest rates in the immediate future, they said that rates would be kept under review to
ensure that their objective of reducing net central bank credit to the government was met.
Looking beyond 2007/08, the authorities agreed with the staff on the need to reduce the
external current account deficit gradually to about 3½ percent of GDP over the
medium term. There were some differences of view, however, with respect to the fiscal
effort necessary to achieve this objective. Although the authorities recognized the importance
of strengthening revenue mobilization, they envisaged a less ambitious effort than the staff.
Discussions on structural issues focused on reforms to deepen domestic financial markets,
public financial management and fiscal reporting, and trade issues.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Pakistan has experienced a remarkable turnaround in its economic performance
since 2001/02. Sound macroeconomic management and wide-ranging structural reforms have
contributed to high real GDP growth, a reduction in the debt burden, and an improved
business climate, while implementation of pro-poor policies has helped lower poverty rates.
Increasingly, foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio flows have become an important
source of external financing. Looking ahead, the key challenge is to maintain the growth
momentum, while addressing external vulnerabilities and further reducing inflation.
2.
Political uncertainties are likely to continue until after the upcoming
parliamentary elections. On October 6, 2007, President Musharraf was elected for a second
five-year term by parliamentary majority. On November 3, he declared a state of emergency.
Parliamentary elections were expected to take place in January 2008, but there are
uncertainties about their timing. A caretaker government will be put in place two months
before the elections, and a new government will be formed from the members of the new
parliament. After increasing in July 2007 owing to political factors and turmoil in the
international financial markets, the EMBIG spread for Pakistani debt fell to 370 basis points
by end-October, before rising again in early November following the declaration of the state
of emergency. The Karachi stock market reached new all-time highs in October, but fell
significantly in early November. The exchange rate and foreign reserves have remained
stable.
3.
The implementation of recent Fund advice on macroeconomic policies and
structural reforms has been mixed. The macroeconomic policy stance in recent years has
generally been more expansionary than recommended by staff. As a result, the current
account deficit has widened and progress in reducing inflation has been limited. At the same
time, high foreign exchange inflows have allowed the central bank to greatly improve the
import coverage of reserves. In addition, in line with staff recommendations, the State Bank
of Pakistan (SBP) ceased lending to the government in 2006/07. Tax revenues have risen
owing to the buoyant economic activity and improvements in tax administration, but little
progress has been made in broadening the tax base. While direct privatizations stalled in
2006/07, the government has been able to sell part of its shares in some entities through the
issuance of Global Depository Receipts (GDRs).
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
•

Economic conditions in 2006/07 (fiscal year ends June 30) remained favorable.
Real GDP growth accelerated to 7 percent, from 6½ percent in 2005/06, with a recovery
in agriculture and a strong performance of large-scale manufacturing and services.

5
•

The disinflation process slowed, however, with average inflation persisting near
8 percent and core inflation at 6¼ percent, both largely unchanged from the previous year
(Table 1). Average inflation was 7.1 percent in the first quarter of 2007/08.

Strong capital inflows led to a surplus in the overall balance of payments, but
the current account deficit widened for the third consecutive year.
•

The growth of exports and private transfers slowed in 2006/07, offsetting a significant
decline in import growth in response to a deceleration in credit to the private sector. As a
result, the current account deficit reached 4.9 percent of GDP (US$7 billion), one
percentage point higher than in 2005/06.

A surge in FDI flows (excluding privatization proceeds) and portfolio inflows resulted in
a record-high surplus in the financial account. The government raised US$2 billion at
favorable terms from Eurobonds and from GDRs against its holdings in the Oil and Gas
Development Corporation (OGDC) and United Bank (Box 1).

Overall, gross official reserves increased by US$3.5 billion to US$14.3 billion by
end-June 2007,1 with the import cover ratio improving to 4½ months of next year’s
imports of goods and services (Table 2).

The rupee continued to fluctuate within a narrow band against the U.S. dollar, and the
real effective exchange rate remained broadly stable.

Progress in structural reforms has been instrumental in these developments. Regulatory
impediments have been relaxed significantly. With the recent amendments to the Foreign
Private Investment Promotion and Protection Act, the possibility of acquiring full ownership
and repatriate profits has been extended to foreign investors in all economic sectors, with some
exceptions remaining for agriculture and services. Administrative procedures and red tape have
been streamlined and more flexibility has been introduced in working hours, improving the
business climate.

Broad money growth picked up to 19 percent, from 15 percent in 2005/06, and interest
rates remained broadly unchanged.

•

The SBP was able to offload some of its holdings of treasury bills to the commercial
banks for the first time in four years, without raising the cutoff rates for government
paper at the biweekly auctions. The corresponding pickup in the commercial banks’
credit to government offset a deceleration in credit to the private sector to 17 percent,
from 23 percent a year earlier (Table 3).

The fiscal stance was kept broadly unchanged.

•

The fiscal deficit (excluding grants) is estimated to have remained unchanged at
4.3 percent of GDP in 2006/07, broadly in line with the budget target.

•

Current expenditure overruns—the largest stemming from a bullet interest payment on a
maturing obligation that had not been foreseen in the budget—were fully offset by a
strong performance of revenues (especially nontax) and underspending on investment
projects.

•

The deficit was financed in roughly equal shares from external and domestic sources;
lower-than-envisaged external financing led to a pickup in domestic borrowing—mainly
from commercial banks—relative to 2005/06 (Tables 4a and 4b).

•

The public debt ratio declined by almost 3 percentage points to 54.6 percent of GDP,
reflecting favorable debt dynamics.

8.

Progress on privatization and other structural reforms was mixed.

•

Privatization stalled after the Supreme Court annulled the sale of Pakistan Steel Mills in
June 2006 owing to procedural problems, but placements of GDRs went ahead as
planned.

•

Electricity tariffs were adjusted by 10 percent in February 2007 for the first time in
almost two years, unlocking World Bank loans and preparing the ground for greater
private participation in electricity generation.

•

In the financial sector, the regulations regarding the broker financing of share trades were
strengthened, but the main features of the “Badla” system of stock trade financing remain
in place.2

•

In September 2007, the central bank issued a circular removing a remaining exchange
restriction in the form of a 50 percent limit on advance payments for some imports.

•

The authorities have been working on their second PRSP, which is expected to be
completed by the spring of 2008.
III. THE GOVERNMENT’S ECONOMIC PROGRAM FOR 2007/08

9.
The authorities’ economic program for 2007/08 envisages an increase in real GDP
growth to 7.2 percent; and an average annual inflation target of 6.5 percent. A Private Sector
Development Strategy is being prepared focusing on productivity, innovation and growth. As
part of this strategy, the government plans to emphasize public-private partnerships in order
to increase investment in key sectors.
10.
The budget deficit target (excluding grants) for 2007/08 has been set at 4 percent
of GDP, slightly below last year’s outcome. Buoyancy of tax revenue, together with tight
control of current expenditure, is expected to create room for raising capital expenditure to
above 5 percent of GDP in 2007/08.
11.
Monetary policy has been tightened. The authorities target a decline in broad
money growth to 13.7 percent in 2007/08, with credit growth to the private sector remaining

“Badla” is a modality for financing share purchases extended by brokerages and banks, which allows buyers to

10
at about 17 percent. In its Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) for the period
July–December 2007, released in late July, the SBP announced a package of measures that,
overall, supports a tightening of the monetary stance. The package includes:
•

An increase in the discount rate from 9½ percent to 10 percent.

•

A reduction in the stock of subsidized SBP credit to the textile industry and exporters,
together with the requirement that commercial banks contribute 30 percent of their own
funds to any new loans to those sectors.

•

The opening of a new facility for long-term financing of industrial development projects.

•

The recommendation that during 2007/08 the government retire PRs 62 billion of its
holdings of treasury bills currently in the SBP’s balance sheet (PRs 250 billion), adopt
quarterly ceilings on new borrowing, and issue more long-term debt.3
IV. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS

12.
The consultation discussions focused on the policy adjustments needed to lower
the external current account deficit and reduce the associated vulnerabilities,
particularly in light of the uncertainties associated with the domestic political transition and
current conditions in global financial markets. On the structural front, the focus was on key
reforms to sustain high growth and employment creation, and continue reducing poverty over
the medium term. As a general point, the authorities were of the view that the important
reforms and institutional changes introduced in recent years would be maintained by the new
government, regardless of its political orientation.
13.
The authorities recognized the need to lower the external current account deficit
gradually over the medium term, but indicated that the room to further tighten
macroeconomic policies in 2007/08 was very limited, in light of the political calendar. There
were also some differences of view with respect to the required medium-term fiscal
adjustment, with the authorities envisaging a less ambitious revenue effort than the staff.
A. Economic Outlook and Policies for 2007/08
14.
Real GDP growth should remain strong in 2007/08, and the authorities are
confident that external flows, including FDI, will continue at relatively high levels. In
response to slower aggregate demand growth, staff believes that output growth will be in the
range of 6½–7 percent. The surplus in the financial account of the balance of payments
would remain high at about US$10 billion, as a decline in FDI flows relative to the previous

Other measures announced in the MPS include: lowering (from 3 percent to 0 percent) the reserve
requirements on time deposits, and allowing Islamic banks to use cash and deposits with the National Bank of
Pakistan to meet liquidity requirements.

11
year would be largely offset by higher disbursements of multilateral and bilateral assistance
and larger proceeds from GDRs, including from the sale of shares in OGDC and the National
Bank of Pakistan.
15.
However, the authorities’ policy stance, if not strengthened, may fall short of
achieving a significant reduction in the external current account deficit and inflation.
The recent tightening of monetary policy and the projected reduction in the fiscal deficit to
4 percent of GDP may not rein in aggregate demand sufficiently to significantly reduce the
external current account deficit and achieve the authorities’ inflation target of 6½ percent.
The external current account deficit is projected to decline slightly to 4.8 percent of GDP in
2007/08. Following the slowdown in 2006/07, export growth is expected to register a
moderate recovery, while import growth could slow to about 7 percent. With the high
projected surplus in the financial account, the gross international reserves of the SBP are
projected to increase further by US$1.9 billion, to near US$16.2 billion (4.8 months of next
year’s imports of goods and services) by year’s end.
16.
There are, however, significant risks that some capital inflows could be delayed
until the second half of the year or the following fiscal year. The overall external
financing envelope for 2007/08 could turn out lower than expected if the current global
market conditions and domestic political uncertainties persist. Moreover, a large portion of
the proceeds from GDRs and a possible placement in the Eurobond market are likely to take
place in the second half of the fiscal year, which could force the government to resort to
significant domestic financing in the coming months. Even assuming that the external
financing envisaged for 2007/08 as a whole materializes, the government’s domestic
borrowing requirement would be in the order of PRs 150 billion (1½ percent of GDP) in
2007/08, only slightly lower than last year.
17.
Against this background, the staff called for an additional fiscal effort of at least
0.3 percent of GDP in 2007/08, but the authorities considered it very difficult to
implement a tighter fiscal policy. The authorities indicated, however, that some factors
could lead to an overperformance on the budget deficit target. In particular, they cited
capacity constraints to implement the budgeted increase in capital spending, and pointed out
that the transition government would not be able to disburse funds for new projects during
the period preceding the parliamentary elections. Given that the sources of external financing
are likely to be limited in the first half of the fiscal year, the authorities agreed on the need to
restrain expenditures in the coming months and indicated that they would seek to accelerate
disbursements of multilateral assistance. They also intend to increase reliance on long-term
instruments (Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs)) to cover the government’s domestic
borrowing requirement in 2007/08, which would help lengthen the maturity of government
debt and deepen the securities market.
18.
In light of prevailing uncertainties about money demand, a somewhat lower
money growth target, supported by further fiscal adjustment, would enhance the

12
possibility of lowering average inflation toward the target of 6½ percent.4 The authorities
recognized that it would be difficult to achieve the targeted reduction in average inflation,
particularly in view of significant recent pressures on food prices (including wheat) driven by
global market developments. They were of the view, however, that reducing the broad
money growth target below 13.7 percent could have a negative impact on growth. At the
same time, the authorities agreed with the staff that the decision to reduce SBP’s net credit to
the government required that interest rates on treasury bills and other government paper be
sufficiently flexible to ensure that the government’s domestic borrowing requirement is
covered entirely by commercial bank or nonbank sources. In this regard, although they saw
no need for a further increase in the cut-off rates at treasury bill auctions in the immediate
future, they indicated that interest rates would be kept under constant review during the year.
19.
Pakistan’s de facto exchange system has remained a conventional peg. Staff
called for greater exchange rate flexibility to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy
and facilitate the policy response in case of shocks. The authorities argued that exchange rate
stability was important at this juncture to promote confidence and encourage capital inflows.
They noted, however, that they would continue reducing the SBP’s direct provision of
foreign exchange to oil importers by shifting it gradually to the interbank market, in order to
enhance the determination of the exchange rate by market forces.
20.
The authorities considered the level of the real exchange rate as broadly
appropriate; this view is confirmed by the staff’s exchange rate assessment (Box 2). The
authorities pointed to the recent stability of the real effective exchange rate owing to the
depreciation of the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis major currencies and the appreciation of the
currencies of some of Pakistan’s main competitors, such as India and China. They were
confident that the implementation of reforms aimed at enhancing the economy’s productivity
(including through the development of infrastructure and human capital), the establishment
of export processing zones and industrial zones, and continued high levels of FDI would
contribute to strengthening Pakistan’s export potential in the coming years. In particular, the
authorities thought that, following a period of mergers and consolidation and with a more
level playing field among regional competitors, the medium-term prospects for the textile
industry were favorable. They also indicated that some new export sectors, such as cement,
marble and jewelry, were already experiencing very high growth rates, albeit from a
relatively low base.
B. The Medium-Term Outlook
21.
Looking beyond 2007/08, the staff prepared a medium-term scenario consistent
with reducing the current account deficit to 3½ percent of GDP by 2011/12. Under the
4

Notwithstanding the de facto peg to the U.S. dollar, the limited degree of capital mobility prevailing in
Pakistan continues to allow monetary policy to have some effectiveness in influencing domestic demand.

sustainability approach suggests that the real effective
exchange rate is 9 percent more appreciated than the
value that would be consistent with the current account balance that stabilizes the net foreign liabilities to

Estimates obtained from the macroeconomic balance (MB) approach, in turn, suggest that the REER is
consistent with its equilibrium value in the staff’s medium-term scenario (paragraphs 21 and 22). In that
scenario, Pakistan’s current account deficit would narrow to about 3½ percent of GDP by 2011/12, in
line with the equilibrium current account balance (“norm”) implied by Pakistan’s fundamentals (a deficit
of 3.4 percent of GDP). Staff has also prepared estimates under the MB approach based on current
policies. In this case, the fiscal deficit for 2007/08, stripped of earthquake-related expenditures and a
large interest bullet payment, was calculated at below 2½ percent of GDP. Maintaining this fiscal deficit
over the medium term is estimated to correspond to an underlying external current account deficit of
3.8 percent of GDP, which would imply an overvaluation of less than 2 percent calculated against a
current account “norm” (a deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP) estimated on the basis of current policies.
Taking into account the statistical margins of error, the estimates under the three methodologies suggest
that Pakistan’s real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with its equilibrium level.

staff’s scenario, real GDP growth is assumed to average 6½–7 percent a year over the
medium term, while inflation is projected to decline gradually to 4½ percent by 2011/12, in
response to the maintenance of a tight monetary policy supported by fiscal adjustment (text
table and Tables 5 and 6). The staff’s scenario envisages the implementation of a stronger
fiscal effort, starting in 2007/08. As a result, the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) is projected
to decline gradually from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2007/08 (compared with 4 percent in the
current budget) to about 2 percent in 2011/12, with the primary surplus increasing from
0.3 percent of GDP to 0.6 percent over the same period.5 Given the need to increase
government spending in infrastructure and the social sectors, the scenario incorporates a
strong effort to increase the tax-to-GDP ratio by more than 2½ percentage points of GDP
during 2007/08–20011/12. To achieve this objective, measures to be considered include fully
taxing services under the GST, broadening the income tax to cover commercial agriculture
and capital gains, and a vigorous effort to reduce tax exemptions. Debt sustainability
analyses (and the associated bound tests) corresponding to the staff’s scenario are presented
in Tables 7 and 8, and Figures 1 and 2, respectively.
22.
The authorities agreed on the need to reduce the external current account deficit
to a more sustainable level of 3½ percent of GDP by 2011/12. They believe, however, that
this objective could be achieved by relying on a less ambitious improvement of the fiscal
position, to a deficit of about 3 percent of GDP by 2011/12. The authorities stressed the
importance of increasing spending on infrastructure and education, but indicated that it
would be very difficult to strengthen tax revenue by more than 1½ percentage points of GDP
over the next five years. The staff noted that achieving the same medium-term current
account objective by relying on a less ambitious fiscal effort was likely to require higher real
interest rates than in the staff’s scenario, in order to narrow the gap between private
investment and savings. A stronger fiscal effort would also contribute to limiting pressures
on the real exchange rate and improving external competitiveness.
23.
In the years ahead, Pakistan will continue to depend heavily on the availability
of large capital inflows to finance its current account deficit and further strengthen its
international reserves position. The authorities indicated that they would rely primarily on
active demand management policies, particularly monetary policy, to address potential
financing shortfalls and protect international reserves.

C. Key Structural Reforms
24.
Discussions on structural issues focused on four areas of critical importance to
increase savings and investment and sustain growth and poverty reduction:
25.
•

Deepening domestic financial markets
The authorities pointed to the continued strong profitability and financial soundness of
the banking system (Tables 9 and 10). They argued that the system had strengthened
further over the last year owing to increases in minimum paid-up capital requirements
and FDI. The authorities attributed the high spreads between lending and deposit rates to
limited competition among the major banks, but pointed out that competition would
increase as new financial institutions seek to increase their market share.

16
•

Progress has been made in modernizing the Central Directorate of Savings (CDNS), and
the authorities intend to complete the corporatization and computerization of CDNS
operations by the end of the current fiscal year. Looking ahead, it would be important
that the new entity to be established (Pakistan Savings) have greater autonomy in
managing human resources and determining the interest rates on its instruments, in order
to better integrate the National Savings Schemes with domestic financial markets.

26.
Increasing government revenues. Pakistan’s tax revenue-to-GDP ratio, at
11 percent of GDP in 2006/07, is still relatively low, which limits the resources available for
infrastructure and poverty alleviation. The Central Bureau of Revenue (CBR) has improved
tax administration significantly in recent years, and its imminent transformation into an
autonomous body (Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR)) would contribute to further increasing
its efficiency and strengthening tax audits. Notwithstanding this progress, however,
substantive tax policy measures are needed to broaden the tax base. The authorities
recognized that expanding taxation of the agricultural and service sectors and eliminating
nonstandard exemptions could greatly enhance revenue collection, but underscored the need
to proceed gradually in this area, taking into account political considerations.
27.

Strengthening financial reporting and public financial management

•

Limited progress has been made in financial reporting, an area of critical importance to
enhancing the transparency of the budget and its usefulness as a tool for economic policy
making. In particular, a long-standing problem of double-counting of spending at the
provincial and local government levels has not yet been resolved. Work is under way to
produce a new chart of fiscal accounts with World Bank assistance, which would allow
an economic classification of budget line items.

•

The authorities indicated their intention to implement a number of recommendations
made by a recent FAD technical assistance mission on budget formulation, cash
planning, and management.

28.
Trade liberalization. Pakistan has made substantial progress in reducing import
protection in recent years, and its simple average tariff rate is estimated at around
14.3 percent in 2006. The authorities indicated that they plan to rationalize and further
reduce tariffs over the medium term. Presently, the government’s main efforts are
concentrated in expanding market access by concluding bilateral preferential trade
agreements with Pakistan’s major trading partners, including duty free entry into the United
States for products produced in Reconstruction Opportunities Zones and negotiations to
facilitate preferential access to the European Union. In addition, an FTA with China to be
implemented gradually in two phases came into effect, with the first phase of tariff
reductions starting in July 2007. Pakistan is also actively participating in the Doha round of
multilateral trade negotiations.

17
D. Other Issues
29.
Pakistan’s data are broadly adequate for effective surveillance, but further
improvements in the availability and timeliness of key economic statistics would help
policy analysis and formulation. The authorities pointed to progress in their efforts to
subscribe to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination System (SDDS). In particular, work is
ongoing on producing quarterly national accounts, which would be completed with a
rebasing of the national accounts to the year 2005/06. In addition, a recent update of the
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) published in February 2007
identified significant improvements in the monetary statistics.
30.
In September 2007, an ordinance was promulgated by President Musharraf
enacting regulations for anti-money laundering and financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT). The ordinance reflects substantially the terms of the AML bill, which is
currently in parliament. While the promulgation of the ordinance is a positive development,
this remains a temporary measure which will lapse after four months, unless it is reissued.
The authorities are currently working on making the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU)
established by the SBP in June 2007 fully operational, and clarifying outstanding issues
regarding reporting and accountability of the FMU.
31.
The authorities indicated that they have continued to work on finding a satisfactory
resolution to outstanding debt obligations with Russia.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Pakistan’s economy continued to perform strongly in 2006/07. Real GDP growth
accelerated, the international reserves position strengthened further, and debt ratios
continued to decline. Average inflation, however, remained relatively high. The external
current account deficit widened further in 2006/07, but it was more than covered by recordhigh capital inflows, including FDI and portfolio flows. In particular, the government was
successful in accessing the Eurobond market at favorable terms and selling part of its shares
in some entities through the issuance of GDRs.
33.
Looking ahead, the key challenge is to maintain the high growth momentum of
recent years while reducing the external current account deficit to a more sustainable
level and further lowering inflation. This requires an appropriate policy mix to increase
savings and investment while addressing external vulnerabilities. Non-debt-creating capital
inflows, including FDI, are expected to remain large over the medium term, but some inflows
may not materialize or could be delayed in 2007/08 owing to domestic political uncertainties
and tighter conditions in global markets.
34.
The authorities’ macroeconomic policies for 2007/08 envisage a limited reduction
in the fiscal deficit through further improvements in tax administration and current

18
expenditure restraint, and a tightening of the monetary stance based on actions announced in
the SBP’s Monetary Policy Statement of July 2007, including an increase in the discount rate
and a reduction in the role of the central bank in financing the government and providing
export refinance.
35.
The authorities’ policies for 2007/08 are in the right direction, but may not be
sufficiently strong to put the external current account deficit on a clear downward path
and achieve the inflation target. In particular, more concrete fiscal measures are needed to
both support the current fiscal program and strengthen it to lower the deficit beyond the level
envisaged in the budget. This could be achieved through a combination of revenue and
expenditure actions, including by eliminating some exemptions and reducing subsidies, in
particular energy subsidies. Attention should also be paid to any possible fiscal risks
associated with the planned public-private partnerships.
36.
The measures announced recently by the SBP constitute an important step in the
direction of slowing monetary growth and increasing the operational independence of
the central bank. However, supporting the tighter monetary policy stance with a stronger
fiscal effort would enhance the possibility of achieving a significant reduction in inflation. It
is also important that interest rates on treasury bills and other government paper be
sufficiently flexible to ensure that the government’s domestic borrowing requirement is
covered entirely by commercial banks or nonbank sources. At the same time, consideration
should be given to allowing greater exchange rate flexibility to enhance the effectiveness of
monetary policy. As part of this process, the SBP should move forward with its plan to shift
gradually the demand of foreign exchange for oil imports to the interbank market. The
authorities are also encouraged to link the interest rate on the new facility for long-term
financing of industrial development projects to market levels.
37.
Looking beyond 2007/08, macroeconomic policies should be geared at keeping
the current account deficit on a declining path. A policy mix relying on further fiscal
consolidation would contribute significantly to this objective while lessening pressures on
real interest rates. The fiscal effort should rely primarily on strengthening revenue
mobilization substantially to reduce the deficit, while allowing for increased spending in
infrastructure, human capital, and poverty alleviation. Towards this end, the new government
should move ahead vigorously with reforms to expand taxation of the agricultural and
services sectors and reduce tax exemptions.
38.
Even with the envisaged reduction in the current account deficit over the
medium term, Pakistan will continue to depend heavily on the availability of large
capital inflows. Therefore, a high degree of flexibility in economic policymaking would be
required to respond quickly to external shocks. In particular, given the need to continue
strengthening the international reserves position, the authorities should adhere to their plans
to rely primarily on active demand policies in response to external financing shortfalls.

19
39.
The staff shares the authorities’ view that the real effective exchange rate is
broadly in line with fundamentals. Going forward, fiscal adjustment, accompanied by
higher levels of investment and a vigorous implementation of structural reforms to increase
the economy’s productivity, constitute the main avenues to improve external
competitiveness. The recent removal of the remaining exchange restriction in the form of a
50 percent limit on advanced payments for some imports is welcome.
40.
In addition to strengthening tax revenues, priority should be given to other
structural reforms of critical importance to increase savings and investment. Pressing
ahead vigorously with the reform of the energy sector’s regulatory and tariff framework will
contribute to increasing productivity, strengthening public sector savings, and enhancing the
prospects for privatization of the power companies. There is also a need to complete the
ongoing reform of the National Savings Schemes to facilitate their integration with local
financial markets; adopt a system of regular margin financing in line with major stock
exchanges; and move forward with current plans to shift away from the use of short-term
government financing instruments into long-term securities, in order to improve debt
management and encourage the development of the local bond market. Strong efforts are also
necessary to strengthen public financial management and enhance the role of the budget as a
tool for policy making. Furthermore, pressures to reinstate ad hoc import tariff and nontariff
barriers should be resisted, and the authorities are encouraged to move ahead with their plans
to further reduce tariffs and rationalize them.
41.
The recent enactment of AML/CFT ordinance is welcome. Going forward, the focus
should be on issuing the AML bill, which remains outstanding in parliament, and on making
the FMU fully operational and clarifying reporting and accountability issues.
42.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Pakistan take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

2/ General government gross debt; excludes external military debt, commercial debt, and short-term loans.
3/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of
foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 3/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 3/ as ae(1+r).
6/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
7/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

Exchange System

On May 19, 1999, the dual exchange rate system was unified, with all international
transactions conducted at the interbank market exchange rate (FIBR). Pakistan is classified
as having a de facto conventional peg to the U.S. dollar. Since late December 2004, the
nominal exchange rate has remained in the range of 59 to 61 rupees per U.S. dollar and the
observed daily changes in that rate have been within a ± 1 percent band. In their formal
notification, the authorities classify Pakistan’s exchange rate regime as a managed float with
no predetermined path for the exchange rate. As of September 28, 2007, the FIBR was
PRs 60.69 per US$1. Pakistan has accepted the obligations of Article VIII. The remaining
exchange restriction on payments for current international transactions that was subject to
Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2a (which resulted from limitations on advance
payments for certain imports) was eliminated in September 2007.
VIII.

Last Article IV Consultation

The last Article IV consultation (Country Report 06/426) was discussed by the
Executive Board on November 22, 2006.
IX.

Safeguards Assessments

In accordance with the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the State Bank of Pakistan
(SBP) was subject to a full safeguards assessment under the Stand-By Arrangement that
expired on September 30, 2001. This assessment, which included a safeguards mission to the
SBP, was completed on February 13, 2001. The staff's findings and recommendations were
reported in Country Report No. 01/58, Appendix IV. The authorities have implemented all of
the recommended remedial measures that were included under SBA conditionality, and no
new critical vulnerabilities have been identified under Pakistan's subsequent PRGF
Arrangement.
The latest information received at the beginning of 2007 indicates that the SBP continues
selective application of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in combination
with the Board-approved accounting policies; that financial statements are audited in
conformity with the auditing standards applicable in Pakistan and published on the SBP
website; and that a revised organizational structure has enhanced the SBP’s internal control
systems.

ANNEX II. PAKISTAN: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
Thomas Buckley, Senior Country Officer, Telephone: (202) 473-0075
1.
Pakistan is among the largest recipients of World Bank financial assistance. In
FY2007, World Bank support to Pakistan totaled US$985 million, making it the seventh
largest borrower in the world. The World Bank Group program in Pakistan consists of an
integrated package of financial support, including IBRD lending, concessional IDA credits
and IFC investments, along with complementary analytical and advisory services.
2.
The Bank Group’s Board of Directors endorsed a new Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for Pakistan on June 1, 2006, covering fiscal years 2006 through 2009. The CAS
outlines the Bank’s strategic approach to helping Pakistan achieve its development goals
over a four-year period. Despite recent good economic performance, Pakistan’s development
challenges remain formidable. The strategy addresses the key challenge of sustaining rapid
growth in order to further reduce poverty. This will require accelerating human development
so that the poor can participate in and benefit from growth. Sustained growth will also
require sound macroeconomic management along with improvements in the investment
climate, including regulatory reform and significant investment in infrastructure.
3.

The CAS is designed around three main pillars:

•
Sustained Growth and Improved Competitiveness: The principal focus of this
pillar will be to support investments and reforms needed to improve the business
environment for trade and investment and sustain rapid, private sector–led growth. The Bank
will provide support to key sectors such as agriculture and infrastructure, and help the
government strengthen macroeconomic management through improving public expenditures
and supporting ongoing tax reforms.
•
Strengthened Governance and Service Delivery: Priorities in this area will be to
support further reforms and investment to increase efficiency, transparency, and
accountability in the use of public resources, while supporting cross-cutting reforms needed
to improve service delivery at all levels of government—with particular attention to health,
education, water and sanitation, safety nets, and municipal services.
•
Improved Lives and Protection of the Vulnerable: The Bank will focus on
increased investment in the education and health sectors to help build the skilled, healthy
work force needed to sustain strong growth. This area of the CAS also features targeted
interventions to help the poor, including strengthened safety nets and targeted interventions
and community-based approaches in rural areas.

6
4.
In line with Pakistan’s recent performance and the government’s request for
increased Bank Group support, the CAS outlines a substantial increase in the volume of
lending to Pakistan through FY2009. The expansion in lending will take place primarily in
infrastructure (mainly in energy, water, and transport) and human development. One priority
will be to continue to assist in addressing the impact of the October 2005 earthquake—up to
US$1 billion will be used to support reconstruction and recovery. Overall, a flexible lending
program of up to US$6.5 billion is set forth in the CAS. About half of this amount
(US$3.1 billion) will take the form of IDA credits. Policy-based lending will account for up
to half of planned financial support.
5.
The IFC strategy in Pakistan, as expressed in the CAS, seeks to increase investments
with a target range of US$500–600 million during the FY2006–09 period. IFC activity will
focus on three main sectors: financial, SME and infrastructure. IFC has also initiated a
substantial TA program in Pakistan to build capacity and address constraints of the SME,
infrastructure and financial sectors.

ANNEX III. PAKISTAN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data are broadly adequate for effective surveillance, but further improvements in the
availability and timeliness of key economic statistics would help policy analysis and
formulation. The Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)—Data Module,
a Response by the Authorities, and a Detailed Assessment Using the Data Quality Assessment
Framework (DQAF) were published on the IMF website in December 2004. A ROSC
reassessment focusing on monetary statistics was conducted in November 2006 and published
on the IMF website in February 2007.
2.
Pakistan participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since 2003,
meeting the recommendations for the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of most GDDS
data categories. The only exceptions are the timeliness of the GDP and the lack of annual data
on wages/earnings. For subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS),
Pakistan will need to disseminate (a) quarterly employment and unemployment data with a
timeliness of one quarter; (b) monthly data on central government operations with a
timeliness of one month; (c) quarterly data on the national accounts, wages/earnings, and
external debt, all with a timeliness of one quarter; (d) more detailed breakdown of data on
central government debt and external debt; and (e) update and expand the metadata on
compilation and dissemination practices.
3.
In 2004, the Federal Bureau of Statistics (FBS) completed a revision of the national
accounts statistics to bring them in line with the concepts and definitions of the 1993 System
of National Accounts (1993 SNA). As noted by the December 2004 data ROSC, informal
economic activities need to be better captured, while newly emerging activities, such as in the
information technology sector, continue to pose challenges. The FBS is currently working on
producing quarterly national accounts (QNA), which would be completed with a rebasing of
the national accounts to the year 2005/06. In mid-2005, an IMF mission provided technical
assistance on the development of QNA and the consumer price index (CPI). With respect to
labor market statistics, the FBS has recently started to compile quarterly employment/
unemployment data (although not with the frequency required for subscription to the SDDS)
and is investigating the feasibility of disseminating data on wages/salaries.
4.
The FBS produces three price indices: the CPI, the wholesale price index (WPI), and
the sensitive price indicator (SPI). The CPI and WPI are compiled on a monthly basis. The
SPI is compiled on a weekly basis and consists of 46 essential commodities that are consumed
by the lowest income group. The concepts and definitions of the CPI and WPI follow
international guidelines. Plans have been made to introduce the classification of individual
consumption by purpose (COICOP) and to complete the work to develop a Producer Price
Index (PPI), with base year 1999/2000; an IMF mission also provided some advice in this
regard.
5.
The concepts and definitions used in compiling GFS are broadly based on the
methodology prescribed in A Manual on Government Finance Statistics, 1986 (GFSM 1986),

8
except that the treatment of privatization proceeds resembles the methodology of the
Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2001 (GFSM 2001). The scope of central government
data is further limited because it does not cover the activity of extrabudgetary funds.
Classification and sectorization in source data follow GFSM 1986 standards to a limited
extent. The classification of expenditure deviates from GFSM 1986 methodology because the
economic and functional classifications are mixed in reporting, with defense and government
administration expenditures not clearly identified according to economic classification. The
basis of recording GFS is on, or close to, a cash basis. Transactions are recorded on a gross
basis. Corrective transactions are not necessarily made in the original period, as required by
GFSM 1986. Plans for improvement of GFS are taking place within the context of the Project
for the Improvement of Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA). The authorities have
indicated their intent to adopt the methodology of Government Finance Statistics Manual
2001 over the medium to long term. Budgetary central government operations data are
regularly reported for inclusion in the GFS Yearbook, and use the GFSM 2001 framework.
However, no data are reported on transactions in nonfinancial and financial assets and
liabilities. The authorities do not report higher frequency data for inclusion in the IFS.
6.
The ROSC mission found that the scope of the monetary statistics is comprehensive.
The classification and sectorization of the monetary survey compiled by the State Bank of
Pakistan’s (SBP) Statistics Department for reporting to the IMF and for internal use are
broadly in line with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The basis for
recording flows and stocks is largely consistent with the MFSM, and the SBP has indicated its
intention to adopt the MFSM in order to further improve monetary statistics. The ROSC
mission that conducted the reassessment of monetary statistics in November 2006 found that
the authorities had implemented the MFSM guidelines on the sectorization of institutional
units, classification of financial instruments, and the recording of securities repurchase
agreements (repos). Also, a new reporting framework for other depository corporations has
been designed and is being implemented. Further progress is needed in resolving
discrepancies in the data on interbank positions between the SBP and scheduled banks. The
implementation of the Standardized Report Form framework for reporting monetary data to
the Fund is yet to be completed.
7.
Starting in the third quarter of 2003 (July–September), Pakistan’s balance of
payments statements have been prepared according to the methodology of Balance of
Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). The presentation of the balance of payments in the
publications and the website of the SBP is based both on the BPM4 and BPM5. In general, the
scope of the balance of payments pertaining to residency conforms to BPM5. The exceptions
include the enterprises operating in the export processing zones and offshore banks, which are
regarded as nonresidents, and Pakistani nationals residing abroad but owning a dwelling in
Pakistan, who are considered residents. Classification and sectorization systems also follow
BPM5 to some extent, while the basis for recording transactions follows best international
practices. The 2004 ROSC identified shortcomings in the treatment of oil exports under
product sharing agreements and the estimation of reinvested earnings. The report also noted
the absence of revision studies. Differences between the two sources of trade data (customs
records for FBS and exchange records for SBP) for exports and imports have been widening.
Most of the differences can be reconciled ex post (see SBP’s Second Quarterly Report for
FY2006), and the authorities are working to narrow these differences before the publication

9

PAKISTAN: TABLE OF COMMON INDICATORS REQUIRED FOR SURVEILLANCE

10

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
December 17, 2007

1.
This statement summarizes information that has become available since the issuance
of the staff report on November 8, 2007. The new information does not change the thrust of
the staff appraisal. However, the rise in international oil prices reinforces the importance of
promptly addressing energy subsidies, while higher inflation and the reemergence of State
Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) financing of the budget point to the need to increase interest rates
in the auctions of treasury bills.
2.
Political uncertainties remain. President Musharraf appointed a caretaker government
on November 15. After relinquishing the position of army chief of staff, he was sworn in for
a second five-year term on November 29. General elections are scheduled for January 8. The
economic team under the caretaker government remains unchanged. The stock market has
largely recovered the losses it suffered following the declaration of a state of emergency.
However, the EMBIG+ spread for Pakistani international bonds was 433 basis points as of
December 11, compared with 214 basis points at end-June, and international rating agencies
have changed the outlook on Pakistani debt from “stable” to “negative.”
3.
The economy has shown considerable resilience to the domestic political tensions and
the turbulence in international financial markets. Provisional data for activity in large-scale
manufacturing show a growth of 7 percent in the first quarter of 2007/08. In the agricultural
sector, the cotton harvest is estimated to have fallen short of last year’s good performance;
however, a bumper sugar cane crop could make up for most of the shortfall. But inflationary
pressures have intensified. The 12-month rate of inflation increased to 9.3 percent in October
owing mainly to a substantial rise in food prices, with nonfood, nonenergy (core) inflation
rising to 7.4 percent. As a result, average inflation was 7.6 percent in July–October 2007.
4.
Based on the revised (higher) WEO oil prices of November 2007, the staff estimates
that the external current account deficit could be 0.5 percentage points of GDP higher
throughout the medium term than in the projections included in the staff report. However,
preliminary information provided by the SBP for July–October 2007 suggests that the current
account deficit narrowed relative to the same period of 2006. Export growth recovered to
11 percent, remittances and other transfers increased by 27 percent, and import growth
moderated. Official disbursements and foreign direct investment increased slightly relative to
the same period of 2006, but portfolio inflows reversed in November. Net international
reserves fell by US$980 million since end-June 2007, to US$13.3 billion as of December 10,
with the decline concentrated in November owing mainly to large oil and debt payments. The
Pakistani rupee has depreciated by 1.2 percent since end-October, as the SBP has allowed for
some exchange rate flexibility.
5.
The fiscal position has deteriorated, owing mainly to expenditure overruns. The cash
fiscal deficit reached 1.6 percent of annual GDP in the first quarter of 2007/08, compared
with 0.5 percent in the same period of the previous fiscal year. Total revenue rose by

2

19 percent, but tax revenue turned out lower than originally anticipated. At the same time,
total expenditure increased by 52 percent due to strong growth of development spending and
higher than envisaged interest payments and energy subsidies. In the absence of adjustments
in fuel prices and electricity tariffs, subsidies could exceed the amount budgeted for the fiscal
year by more than 1½ percentage points of GDP. The authorities recognize the need for
adjustments in energy prices and are taking steps to reduce the pace of development
expenditures.
6.
Broad money and reserve money growth (year-on-year) slowed to 18.4 percent and
14.1 percent, respectively, as of November 24, 2007, with credit to the private sector growing
by 14.9 percent. During July–September, domestic financing of the government was
provided mainly by commercial banks, and the SBP was able to offload some of its holdings
of government securities. Starting in October, however, SBP’s financing of the government
increased markedly, as commercial banks reduced their demand for treasury bills and
investment bonds at prevailing interest rates. To reduce pressures in the foreign exchange
market, in early December the SBP lowered temporarily the reserve requirement on foreign
currency deposits from 20 percent to 10 percent.
7.
Global Depository Receipts issues for government shares in two of the largest
commercial banks are ready, but their launching has been postponed to early 2008 in view of
current conditions in global financial markets.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 20, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Pakistan
On December 17, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2007 Article IV consultation with Pakistan.1
Background
Pakistan has experienced a remarkable turnaround in its economic performance since
2001/02. Sound macroeconomic management and wide-ranging structural reforms have
contributed to high real GDP growth, a reduction in the debt burden, and an improved
business climate. Adherence to pro-poor policies has helped lower poverty rates. Increasingly,
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and portfolio flows have become an important source of
external financing.
Economic developments during the fiscal year ending in June 2007 remained favorable. Real
GDP growth increased to 7 percent, with a recovery in agriculture and a strong performance
of large-scale manufacturing and services; the debt ratio continued to decline; and the
international reserves position strengthened further. The disinflation process, however, slowed
somewhat, with average inflation persisting near 8 percent.
Strong capital inflows boosted the overall balance of payments, but the current account deficit
widened for the third consecutive year. The growth of exports and private transfers slowed,
offsetting a significant decline in import growth. As a result, the current account deficit reached
4.9 percent of GDP (US$7 billion) in 2006/07. A surge in FDI flows and portfolio inflows
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
resulted in a record-high surplus in the financial account. Overall, gross official reserves
increased by US$3.5 billion, to US$14.3 billion by end-June 2007. The rupee continued to
fluctuate within a narrow band against the U.S. dollar, and the real effective exchange rate
remained broadly stable.
Although lending to the government by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) ceased in 2006/07,
reserve money and broad money grew by about 20 percent, driven by the accumulation of
international reserves and lending to commercial banks for subsidized credit to the textile
industry. The SBP was able to offload some of its holdings of treasury bills to the commercial
banks for the first time in four years. The corresponding pickup in commercial banks’ credit to
government offset a deceleration in credit to the private sector to 17 percent, from 23 percent
a year earlier.
The fiscal stance was kept broadly unchanged in 2006/07, with the fiscal deficit (excluding
grants) estimated at 4.3 percent of GDP, the same as in 2005/06. Current expenditure
overruns were fully offset by a strong performance of revenues (especially nontax) and
underspending on investment projects. The deficit was financed in roughly equal shares from
external and domestic sources. The public debt ratio declined by an additional 3 percentage
points to about 55 percent of GDP.
Progress on privatization and other structural reforms was mixed. Privatization stalled after the
Supreme Court annulled the sale of Pakistan Steel Mills in June 2006, but placements of
Global Depository Receipts went ahead as planned. Electricity tariffs were adjusted by
10 percent in February 2007, unlocking World Bank loans and preparing the ground for greater
private participation in electricity generation. In the financial sector, the regulations regarding
broker financing of share trades were strengthened. The authorities have also been working
on their second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which is expected to be completed by the
spring of 2008.
The authorities’ economic program for 2007/08 envisages real GDP growth of 7.2 percent. The
budget deficit target has been set at 4 percent of GDP, below last year’s outcome, and in its
July Monetary Policy Statement the SBP announced tighter monetary conditions to slow broad
money growth to 13.7 percent by the end of 2007/08.
The economy has shown considerable resilience to recent domestic political uncertainties and
the turbulence in international capital markets, with provisional data for activity in large-scale
manufacturing showing continued strong growth in the first quarter of 2007/08. Owing mainly
to the increase in food prices, the 12-month rate of inflation was 8.7 percent in November. The
stock market has recovered from losses suffered in early November. However, the spread for
Pakistani international bonds over 10-year U.S. Treasuries as measured by the J.P. Morgan
Emerging Markets Bonds Index Global was 400 basis points as of December 14, compared
with 214 basis points at end-June.
Preliminary balance of payments information provided by the SBP for July–October 2007
suggests that the current account deficit narrowed relative to the same period of last year, with
export growth recovering and remittances showing a strong increase. Net international

3
reserves fell by US$1 billion since end-June 2007, to US$13.3 billion as of December 14, with
the decline concentrated in November owing to large oil and debt payments and some portfolio
outflows. The fiscal position deteriorated in the first quarter of 2007/08 relative to the same
period of 2006/07, due mainly to strong growth of development spending and higher than
envisaged interest payments and energy subsidies. During July–September 2007, domestic
financing of the government was provided mainly by commercial banks, but starting in October
SBP’s financing of the government increased markedly as commercial banks reduced their
demand for treasury bills.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed that Pakistan’s economy continued to perform strongly in
2006/07. Real GDP growth increased, the international reserve position strengthened, and
debt ratios declined. The favorable economic performance and structural reforms to improve
the business climate have spurred capital inflows in recent years. At the same time, Directors
noted that inflation remains relatively high, the external current account deficit has widened,
and Pakistan’s external financing needs remain large. Continued vigilance is required to
reduce vulnerabilities and maintain investor confidence in light of recent political uncertainties
and developments in the global credit markets.
Looking ahead, Directors considered Pakistan’s main challenge to be the maintenance of high
growth while lowering inflation and reducing the external current account deficit to a more
sustainable level. This will require continued tight fiscal and monetary policies. In this regard,
Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen the fiscal program for 2007/08 to
complement monetary tightening, particularly by reducing energy subsidies and capital
spending.
Directors welcomed the tightening of the monetary stance since mid-2007. They regretted the
re-emergence of central bank financing of the budget, and stressed the need to adjust the
interest rates in treasury bill auctions as needed in order to ensure that the government’s
2007/08 domestic borrowing requirement is fully met through the commercial banks or
nonbank institutions. Many Directors called for greater exchange rate flexibility, to enhance the
effectiveness of monetary policy and better absorb external shocks, while some Directors felt
that exchange rate stability is important at this juncture to maintain investor confidence.
Looking beyond 2007/08, Directors stressed that further fiscal consolidation will be required to
reduce inflation and the external current account deficit while lessening pressures on real
interest rates. In this regard, they noted the low ratio of tax revenue to GDP, and
recommended to press ahead with reforms to increase revenue so that it can reduce the fiscal
deficit while boosting spending on infrastructure and poverty alleviation. Directors called for a
broadening of the tax base, including through expanding taxation of the agricultural and
services sectors and reducing tax exemptions. They also supported the use of public-private
partnerships in infrastructure development, but cautioned that any contingent liabilities should
be fully identified and incorporated in the budget.

4
Directors agreed that the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with Pakistan’s
economic fundamentals. They underscored that fiscal adjustment accompanied by higher
levels of investment and vigorous implementation of structural reforms constitute the main
avenues to improve external competitiveness. Directors welcomed the central bank’s intention
to gradually shift direct provision of foreign exchange to oil importers to the inter-bank foreign
exchange market, with a view to fostering a market-determined exchange rate.
Directors encouraged the authorities to vigorously implement structural reforms in order to
sustain growth and poverty reduction. They underscored the need to modernize the energy
sector’s regulatory and tariff framework and revive the privatization process. It will also be
important to reduce subsidized central bank credit to certain sectors and disengage the central
bank from development financing, to further deepen domestic financial markets and enhance
the efficiency of financial intermediation, and to move forward with plans to shift from the use
of short-term government financing instruments to long-term securities. Directors urged action
to strengthen public financial management. They also encouraged the authorities to resist
pressures to reinstate ad hoc tariff and nontariff barriers, and to press ahead with their plans
for further trade liberalization.
Directors welcomed the recent enactment of regulations governing legislation to combat
money laundering and terrorism financing. They underscored the need to obtain parliamentary
approval of such legislation, make the Financial Monitoring Unit fully operational, and clarify
related reporting and accountability issues.

Statement by Abbas Mirakhor, Executive Director for Pakistan and
Daïri Mohammed, Alternate Executive Director
December 17, 2007
As illustrated in the concise and well written staff report, the economy of Pakistan has
performed well in recent years, owing to prudent macroeconomic policies and far-reaching
structural reforms aimed at laying the foundation for strong private sector-led growth and
poverty reduction. The economy has grown at an average 7 percent over the past four years,
while concurrently strengthening its resilience. The latter has been manifested in the fact
that despite intense regional tensions, domestic political challenges, external shocks, and
setbacks to the two major crops, cotton and rice, growth in in the current year is expected to
continue at the same brisk pace, including from buoyant activity in the large-scale
manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. The financial sector remains sound and
profitable, and there is a steady improvement in debt indicators. Although the current
account deficit has increased somewhat in 2006/07, it has been financed by large FDI and
other capital inflows, allowing net international reserves to build up to $13.5 billion at the
end of November, 2007. Recent data suggest a strong export recovery that should have a
positive impact on the current account balance. Though the central bank has pursued a tight
monetary policy stance since April 2005, progress in reducing inflation has been a challenge
in view of the sharp increase in international oil and food prices, compounded by supply
bottlenecks.
Against the backdrop of intense domestic political activities in the run-up to the elections in
January 2008, downside risks stem from the impact of the global rise in both oil and food
prices (including wheat, palm oil, and soybean), which, together, constitute an important
component of the country’s imports and CPI basket. These risks are expected to be
mitigated, not only because, as underlined in the staff report, the economy has shown a
remarkable resilience, but because all political players competing in the upcoming elections
have made commitment to staying the course of prudent policies and structural reforms that
have contributed to past good performance.
The need for an appropriate policy mix between fiscal and monetary policies to reduce
domestic demand and improve the external account position and inflation performance is
recognized; the focus will be placed on fiscal consolidation that would not only reduce the
external account deficit, but also obviate the need for borrowing from the central bank and
lessen pressures on real interest rates. The fiscal deficit is estimated to be broadly in line
with the budget target in 2006/07, despite an overrun of current expenditure attributed
mainly to a bullet interest payment on a maturing obligation that was not foreseen in the
budget. The fact that the authorities succeeded in offsetting this expenditure overrun
through a strong revenue collection effort attests to their strong commitment to fiscal and
external sustainability. The government debt-to-GDP ratio fell by almost 3 percentage
points to 54.6 percent, significantly below the 60 percent ceiling stipulated in the 2005
Fiscal Responsibility Law. The authorities recognize that the significant increase in
spending in the first quarter of the current fiscal year is not sustainable. Delays in the passthrough of energy prices to consumers and the increase in fuel and other subsidies reflect

2

the authorities’ tight margin of maneuver under current political and social conditions. The
authorities are taking steps to reduce the rapid pace of capital spending, as indicated in the
staff statement. The deficit target for 2007/08 has been set at 4 percent of GDP, below last
year’s outcome. Moreover, continued improvement in tax revenue is expected to create
room for raising capital and social spending and achieving more equitable growth, in line
with the authorities’ medium-term plan, which calls for additional spending on poverty
reduction, while allowing for a further reduction in the fiscal deficit. Following progress
achieved by the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) in improving tax administration, its
imminent transformation into an autonomous agency should contribute to increasing its
efficiency and strengthening tax audits.
Exogenous as well as temporary factors have contributed to less-than-satisfactory
inflationary outcome. In addition to the increase in international food prices, domestic supply
problems, especially in the distribution channels for wheat and flour, have also generated a
surge in food prices. The monetary authorities are mindful of the adverse consequences of
rising prices. To this end, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has targeted a decline in money
growth to 13.7 percent in 2007/08 and has adopted a number of measures noted in the staff
report, including an increase in the discount rate from 9.5 percent to 10 percent in July 2007
and a reduction in the stock of subsidized credit to the textile industry and exporters, together
with the requirement that the commercial banks contribute 30 percent of their own funds to
new loans to those sectors. It has also recommended to the Government to retire borrowings
from the central bank by PRs 62.3 billion by the end of fiscal year 2007/08 in addition to the
adoption of quarterly ceilings. The most recent data indicate that the tightened monetary
policy stance is paying off as the 12-month rate of inflation has declined from 9.3 percent in
October to 8.7 percent in November 2007. Monetary authorities continue to monitor price
developments closely and stand ready to implement additional necessary measures.
The external current account deficit is modestly lower in July-October 2007, compared to the
same period of last year, reflecting a strong export pickup, a substantial rise in workers’
remittances, and a slowdown in import growth. The capital account recorded a somewhat
higher surplus, including from higher official financing and FDI. The momentum of foreign
flows is expected to pick up in the coming months, supported by the projected floatation of
global depository receipts, once post-election political stability is achieved.
The increasing level of foreign exchange flows has resulted, meanwhile, in visible changes in
the country’s foreign exchange markets, which have grown substantially in capacity. The
authorities have raised the bases for calculating the foreign exchange exposure limits of
commercial banks from 10 percent to 15 percent of their paid-up capital, thereby facilitating
their ability to manage and price large volume transactions for their customers and paving the
way to shifting gradually the demand of foreign exchange for oil imports from the State Bank
to the interbank market. The authorities note with satisfaction that staff share their view that
the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, with a greater degree of
flexibility capturing market dynamics in exchange rate determination. This is reflected in a
higher variation in the exchange rate; the coefficient of variation was 0.45 for July–
November 2007 compared to 0.32 for the entire 2006/2007.

3

Turning to medium-term prospects, the authorities recognize that the key policy challenge
facing the government emerging from the forthcoming electoral process will be to lower
inflation, while maintaining the high growth momentum of recent years and placing the
external current account deficit on a downward trajectory. Meeting this challenge will require
a steady pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, already in train,
for raising both savings and investment through increasing government revenue,
strengthening public financial management, formulating and implementing sound monetary
policy, deepening domestic financial markets, and further improving the investment climate.
The ultimate aim of these reforms remains acceleration of growth, strengthening further the
gains from poverty alleviation efforts and significant improvement in living conditions of the
Pakistani population at large.
Many initiatives have been taken to allow resources to be directed toward social programs as
well as to provide room for private investment. Progress has been made in deepening the
financial markets and strengthening the soundness and profitability of the banking sector.
The authorities plan to give a further boost to the considerable progress in modernizing the
Central Directorate of Savings by completing its corporatization and computerization of its
operations by the end of the current fiscal year. Export growth, which moderated last year,
has recovered strongly in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. The average export value
growth since 2000 has been around 12 percent a year, which compares favorably to Pakistan
competitors, except China and Sri Lanka. Progress in enhancing the economy’s productivity
through the development of infrastructure and human capital has been instrumental in this
performance. Other factors contributing to the good performance include the relaxation of
regulatory impediments and the establishment of export processing zones. The Foreign
Private Investment Promotion and Protection Act has extended to foreign investors the
possibility of acquiring full ownership in all economic sectors, with few exceptions in
agriculture and services. The expected continuation of the high levels of FDI should
contribute to a further strengthening of the export potential. Substantial progress has been
made in reducing import protection—the simple average tariff rate is estimated at 14.3
percent in 2006—and the authorities have indicated that they plan to rationalize and further
reduce tariffs over the medium term.
