May 22, 2007
Objectives: A mission visited Togo February 28–March 13, 2007, for the 2007 Article IV
consultation discussions and review of the staff-monitored program (SMP).
Country representatives: The mission met with President Faure Gnassingbé, Finance
Minister Boukpessi, National Director of the BCEAO Gbéasor, other senior officials,
donors, trade associations, banks, enterprises, and the media. The new Finance Minister,
Mr. Ayassor, met with staff at the Spring Meetings in Washington.
Mission team: The mission team comprised Mr. Mumssen (head), Mr. Gijon,
Mr. Haacker, Ms. Larangeira, and Mr. Rosa (all AFR). Mr. Yao, the Fund’s resident
representative, and Mr. Assimaidou, Alternate Executive Director for Togo, participated
in the discussions. The mission was joined by World Bank staff and overlapped with a
Fund technical assistance mission focused on bank restructuring.
Article IV consultation: The discussions focused on reforms to revive economic growth,
achieve a sustainable fiscal position, and strengthen the banking sector. A debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) was prepared jointly with World Bank staff (Supplement I).
Data weaknesses continued to hamper the effectiveness of surveillance (Supplement II).
Exchange arrangements: Togo has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,
3, and 4. Togo shares a common currency (CFA franc), pegged against the euro, with
other WAEMU members. The BCEAO conducts monetary and exchange rate policies for
the region. Banks are supervised by the WAMU Banking Commission.
Use of Fund resources: Successful performance under the SMP (Country Report 07/22)
through end-June 2007 could pave the way for a PRGF arrangement (the most recent
arrangement expired in 1998) and HIPC debt relief. Togo is current on its obligations to
the IMF, but has large arrears to the World Bank, the AfDB, and others.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Over the past 12 months, Togo has embarked on major political and economic reforms.
The upcoming parliamentary elections are seen as a milestone in the national reconciliation
process. The authorities have initiated important economic reforms, monitored under a ninemonth SMP (October 2006–June 2007).
A nascent economic recovery is underway, and performance under the SMP has been
good. The improved political climate and strong services growth have offset the drag on
growth caused by the collapse of the cotton sector and the deepening energy crisis. All SMP
targets through February were met, reflecting recent reforms to strengthen fiscal governance.
Program risks are high in the run-up to the elections. A disruption of the election process
would jeopardize economic confidence and donor support. Pre-election fiscal pressures and
delays in structural reforms could derail SMP performance. To mitigate fiscal risks, the
authorities pledged to strengthen expenditure controls and backload nonpriority outlays.
Togo’s central medium-term challenge is to revive economic growth after a quarter
century of decline. The authorities stressed that ending the political crisis and reengaging
with donors will be critical to advance growth-oriented reforms, including measures to
reallocate fiscal spending toward education, health, and infrastructure; resolve the energy
crisis; develop the financial sector; and improve the regulatory and legal environment.
To boost competitiveness within the existing exchange rate regime, the authorities plan
to pursue productivity-enhancing reforms. Despite recent real appreciation, there is little
evidence that Togo’s exchange rate is significantly misaligned. Reducing external
imbalances will require fiscal adjustment and the removal of infrastructure and regulatory
bottlenecks.
Fiscal adjustment, higher external assistance, and debt relief will be required to achieve
fiscal and debt sustainability. The authorities plan to increase revenues and reallocate
spending to secure a small primary surplus in the medium term. HIPC and MDRI debt relief
would help bring debt to a sustainable level. The authorities stressed that a large increase in
external assistance will be needed to implement the I-PRSP.
Banking sector vulnerabilities are another key challenge. The authorities plan to
restructure several ailing banks in line with the recommendations of the regional Banking
Commission and IMF technical assistance. The mission urged the BCEAO to take corrective
action if the ongoing monetary boom started to fuel inflation or imprudent lending practices.
Successful performance under the SMP could pave the way for a PRGF arrangement
later this year, but Togo’s large external arrears are still a significant obstacle.

4
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Togo faces enormous development challenges after 25 years of economic decline.
The long-lasting socio-political crisis and withdrawal of donor support have taken a toll on
Togo’s economy, infrastructure, and institutions. Traditional export sectors have been eroded
by adverse terms of trade, real exchange rate appreciation, and the mismanagement of stateowned enterprises. Governance problems and banking sector difficulties have inhibited
private investment. Weak fiscal management has led to the rapid accumulation of debt and
arrears. Past Article IV consultations have stressed the need to improve expenditure
management, reform public enterprises, and address banking sectors problems.
2.
Over the past 12 months, Togo has embarked on major political and economic
reforms. A central goal is to end the socio-political crisis by holding free and transparent
parliamentary elections for the first time in decades. The authorities have also stepped up
their efforts to reengage with the donor community and have initiated important economic
reforms, broadly consistent with past Article IV recommendations. Economic policies are
monitored under a nine-month SMP, which could pave the way for a PRGF arrangement and,
eventually, debt relief under the HIPC initiative and the MDRI.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE SMP
3.
The upcoming parliamentary elections are seen as a milestone in the political
reform process. A multiparty agreement in August 2006 led to the formation of a national
unity government and the preparation of parliamentary elections, envisaged for the summer
of 2007. Free and transparent elections are seen as critical for the resumption of large-scale
donor support to Togo. Logistical and financial challenges remain, and the EU has signaled
its readiness to finance a large part of the election costs.
4.
A modest economic recovery is underway following the slump in 2005. Real GDP
grew an estimated 2 percent in 2006, as the improved political climate and dynamism in
trade-related services offset the drag on growth caused by the crisis in the cotton sector and
daily electricity outages. The current account deficit rose modestly, to about 6 percent of
GDP, reflecting the impact of higher oil prices and lower cotton exports. Appreciation of the
euro (and thus the CFA franc) against the U.S. dollar and deteriorating terms of trade have
weakened Togo’s external competitiveness.
5.
Despite large inflows of liquidity, inflation has been subdued. Broad money grew
22 percent in 2006, as the improved political climate led to a surge in remittances and traderelated capital inflows. While these inflows boosted the banking system’s net foreign assets,
they did not translate into higher domestic credit. They also did not have a discernible impact
on domestic prices. Inflation fell to 2¼ percent in the 12 months to February 2007, as food
prices moderated due to improved agricultural supply conditions in neighboring countries.

Fiscal policy improved markedly in the second half of 2006, and all quantitative
SMP targets were comfortably met (Table 1). Revenue performance was strong, partly
reflecting recent reforms in tax and customs administration, including the replacement of the
tax and customs directors and closure of bank accounts used to divert revenues for offbudget
operations. Revenues exceeded the end-2006 SMP target by ¾ percent of GDP due to strong
tax arrears recovery and a large exceptional profit transfer from the BCEAO. The
government tightened expenditure control in the second half of 2006 by curtailing offbudget
operations. The proceeds from the February 2006 regional bond issue were mostly used to
improve public infrastructure and reduce arrears to civil servants and cotton farmers. The
domestic primary deficit for 2006 was contained at 1 percent of GDP, below the program
ceiling of 1¾ percent, and domestic arrears were reduced for the first time in years.

The 2007 budget aims to anchor macroeconomic stability in an election year. It
envisages a reduction in the primary fiscal deficit to ½ percent of GDP, representing an
underlying fiscal adjustment of about 1 percent of GDP (net of one-off revenues from the
BCEAO windfall in 2006). The adjustment would come from a sharp reduction in
discretionary spending, supported by reforms to minimize the use of exceptional spending
procedures. Allocations for health, education, and public infrastructure would remain broadly
unchanged. To bolster revenue collection, the government is implementing further reforms,
including tax audits and computerization of customs.
The 2007 budget envisages moderate fiscal adjustment.

All structural benchmarks under the SMP through February 2007 were met, but
delays are expected going forward (Table 2). Unlike in previous years, spending
commitments and payment authorizations under the 2006 budget were closed before
December 31, which will help control spending in 2007. In February 2007, the cabinet of
ministers adopted a decree establishing internal and external audit programs at the tax
department. The mission discussed with the authorities the broad principles of an arrears
clearance strategy based on a draft audit that validated domestic government debt and arrears
of about 21 percent of GDP at end-2005. The authorities have strengthened monitoring of
bank liquidity. A preliminary report of SOTOCO’s financial audit has been issued, but its
completion and the preparation of a strategic audit are taking longer than envisaged.
Procurement delays have held up the computerization of customs, originally envisaged for
end-April 2007, but the authorities were confident that the reform would be completed soon.

III. NEAR-TERM CHALLENGES
9.
The economic recovery should continue in 2007, but risks remain high given
energy supply disruptions and the looming parliamentary elections. Real GDP growth is
projected at 3 percent in 2007, driven by higher public investment, a rebound in cotton
production, and continued strong growth in services related to regional trade. However, the
recovery could falter if the energy crisis deepens or the elections are disrupted, which could
erode economic confidence and prevent the return of donors and investors. The unexpected
replacement of the finance minister in mid-March 2007 underscored the still-fluid political
environment; however, President Faure Gnassingbé and the new Minister of Finance, Adji
Ayassor, reaffirmed their strong commitment to economic reform and to the understandings
reached for the SMP.
10.
The authorities acknowledged the need to contain fiscal pressures in the run-up
to the elections. They were particularly concerned about the cost of organizing the elections,
recently estimated at 1½ percent of GDP. While confident that the EU and other donors

8
would provide most of the financing, the authorities acknowledged that a delay in grants
would open a large, if temporary, financing gap under the SMP.1 They agreed to strengthen
the monitoring of budget execution and reduce reliance on exceptional payments procedures
to prevent fiscal slippages. They also plan to delay nonpriority spending until later in the
year to ensure that sufficient resources are available for the electoral process, the timely
payment of salaries, and the clearance of SOTOCO’s arrears to cotton farmers ahead of the
planting season. Backloading nonpriority spending will also mitigate the budget risks
associated with potential delays in identifying external budget support to cover the full-year
financing gap (1¼ percent of GDP) and potential restructuring costs for state-owned banks
and enterprises.
11.
The authorities considered that current monetary policies were appropriate,
notwithstanding the recent surge in money growth. The BCEAO noted that the rapid
monetary expansion in 2006 had not translated into inflation, as the additional liquidity was
channeled into net foreign assets rather than
domestic credit. They also saw the drop in

or imprudent lending practices.
12.
Understandings were reached on a bank restructuring strategy. Several banks are
severely undercapitalized, primarily reflecting nonperforming loans to the troubled cotton
and phosphate sectors. The mission underlined the grave macroeconomic risks associated
with the undercapitalization and recurring liquidity problems at one large bank. An
overlapping IMF technical assistance mission, in consultation with World Bank experts,

To accommodate domestic bridge financing of election costs for which grants are received after June, the
TMU (Country Report 07/22, Attachment II) was amended to include an adjustor that raises the net domestic
financing ceiling and lowers the domestic primary fiscal balance floor by the amount of fiscal spending on the
organization of the elections above the budgeted CFAF 5 billion that is not financed through grant
disbursements by end-June 2007, subject to a cap on total adjustment of CFAF 12 billion.

9
prepared a plan to strengthen and restructure three banks, consistent with existing
recommendations of the WAMU Banking Commission. The authorities pledged to
implement a restructuring strategy in line with these recommendations (see Section IV.E).
13.
The mission urged the authorities to accelerate reforms of state-owned
enterprises. The preliminary findings of SOTOCO’s financial audit point to pervasive
commercial and financial mismanagement across all layers of the company, leading to large
financial losses and mounting debts, including arrears to cotton farmers. The authorities
pledged to: (i) repay the remainder of these arrears by June 2007 to restore confidence;
(ii) strengthen financial controls, following the replacement of SOTOCO’s senior
management in 2005; (iii) complete the financial and strategic audits as soon as possible; and
(iv) initiate work on a broader restructuring strategy for the cotton sector, ideally with World
Bank assistance. The authorities also intend to audit the phosphate sector and seek a new
strategic investor once a legal settlement with the current investor is reached.
14.
There was consensus among policymakers and private observers that the
deepening energy crisis has become the most important obstacle to economic growth.
Daily power outages are disrupting most sectors, including telecommunications. Regionwide
power shortages have sharply reduced exports of electricity from Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana to
the Benin-Togo energy company (CEB), two countries with little generation capacity and
high production costs. A recent intergovernmental meeting identified large financing needs
to cover the losses of CEB. While the recent interconnection with Nigeria’s grid and
improved hydropower conditions during the rainy season could provide temporary relief, a
long-term solution would require a regionwide upgrading of capacity. The Togolese
government is exploring with private investors the scope for upgrading electricity generation,
including by linking to the planned Nigeria-Ghana gas pipeline.
IV. MEDIUM-TERM REFORM AGENDA
A. Overview: Key Challenges
15.
The Article IV discussions focused on three central medium-term challenges:
(i) reviving economic growth and external competitiveness, (ii) moving toward fiscal and
debt sustainability, and (iii) strengthening the banking sector.
16.
Togo’s overriding economic challenge is to revive growth. Despite initially
favorable social and economic conditions, Togo’s growth performance has been among the
weakest in sub-Saharan Africa, with per capita income declining by an average of 1 percent a
year since the early 1980s. The authorities attributed the poor growth record primarily to the
long-lasting socio-political crisis and the related withdrawal of donor support, which have
eroded public institutions and infrastructure. Other obstacles to growth have included
adverse relative price movements, mismanagement of state-owned enterprises and banks,
weak fiscal policies, mounting arrears, and governance problems.

Raising growth and reducing external imbalances will require steps to restore
competitiveness. Two traditional export sectors, cotton and phosphates, have all but
collapsed due to terms of trade shocks, failed sector policies, and mounting losses and arrears
of public monopolies. External competitiveness has also been hampered by real exchange
rate appreciation, decaying infrastructure, and a poor business environment. The goods and
services deficit has risen markedly since 2003, largely owing to higher oil prices and lower
cotton exports, with over half of the increase financed by short-term capital inflows.
The recent increase in the trade deficit was partly financed
by capital inflows that may not be sustainable.

Public debt is unsustainably high, and external arrears have continued to
accumulate. Togo is in debt distress, with public debt of 103 percent of GDP at end-2006, a
third of which was in arrears. As shown in the DSA prepared jointly by the staffs of the Fund
and the World Bank (Supplement I), the net present value of external public debt is about
twice the applicable policy-dependent debt sustainability threshold. The DSA shows that

debt would remain unsustainable in a no-reform scenario, while it could become sustainable

relief.

Weak expenditure management and lack of external financing have squeezed
social spending and public investment. In terms of revenues, wage bill, and fiscal balances,
Togo is closer to the WAEMU convergence criteria than most other member countries.
However, expenditures on health, education, and public investment are far below regional
averages, largely reflecting the low external assistance, whereas other outlays are relatively
high, reflecting weak expenditure management. Boosting social and investment spending
within a sustainable fiscal framework would require a large increase in donor assistance
combined with higher fiscal revenues and reduced nonpriority spending.
Several fiscal indicators have been more favorable than
the WAEMU average (2005 data).

B. Medium-Term Scenarios
20.
The authorities concurred with the mission that without continued reforms,
economic growth would remain anemic. In the staff’s no-reform scenario (Table 3), real
GDP growth would revert to its 25-year average of 1¾ percent (below the population growth
rate), external assistance would remain low, and the fiscal adjustment envisaged in the 2007
budget would not materialize. As a result, social and investment spending would remain
inadequate, fiscal deficits and arrears would increase over time, public debt would remain
unsustainably high, and external imbalances would persist. Moreover, without reforms, the
economy’s vulnerability to financial and external shocks would grow, while institutional
capacity and human development indicators would continue to erode.
21.
The authorities are developing a comprehensive reform strategy to revive
economic growth and improve social conditions. The reform agenda is based on Togo’s
Interim PRSP (I-PRSP), which is currently being finalized with technical assistance from
donors. Its key strategic pillars include: (i) political and economic governance, including
political and legal reforms, and steps to strengthen public finances and budget execution;
(ii) structural reforms, including steps to improve the business environment, restructure stateowned enterprises, raise agricultural productivity, build infrastructure, and develop the
financial sector; and (iii) social reforms, including wider access to education, health, and safe
water. The authorities agreed with the mission on the need to prioritize reform measures and
estimate their costs.
22.
The authorities’ central macroeconomic reform scenario is based on structural
reforms, fiscal adjustment, higher external assistance, and debt relief. The initial
economic recovery is assumed to be driven by an increase in foreign-financed public
investment, measures to alleviate the crisis in the cotton sector, and improved business
confidence following the parliamentary elections. Over the medium term, real GDP growth
of about 4 percent per year (about 1½ percent on a per capita basis) could be sustained only
with higher foreign direct investment, greater availability of credit to the private sector, and
an upgrade of public infrastructure, in particular the energy sector. This will require
implementation of key governance and structural reforms outlined in the I-PRSP. A threefold
increase in external assistance (to the regional average), higher fiscal revenues, reduction of
nonpriority spending, and HIPC/MDRI debt relief would create additional space for growthoriented spending. The fiscal adjustment would help restore policy consistency and prevent
new budgetary arrears, creating a more predictable environment for suppliers, creditors, and
investors.

C. Reviving Economic Growth and External Competitiveness
23.
There was consensus that a recovery of the traditional export sectors alone could
not sustain economic growth. Cotton output has fallen to a quarter of the 2001–05 average,
and a rebound would restore a vital source of cash for many small farmers. However, cotton
and phosphate now make up only a small share of GDP, and their revival might have only a
temporary impact on economic growth. Cross-country studies point to deeper reasons for
Togo’s poor growth record, including weak institutions.2 This suggests the need for broader
reforms to foster private sector growth across all sectors, including agriculture and the
service sector, which could benefit from Togo’s role as a regional trade hub.
24.
The mission stressed the need to improve external competitiveness, which has
been eroded by structural bottlenecks and changes in relative prices. Competitiveness
has been undermined by a poor business environment (among the weakest in the region) and
deteriorating public infrastructure. While terms-of-trade shocks and real effective exchange
rate appreciation have also hampered competitiveness in recent years, there is little evidence
to suggest a significant exchange rate overvaluation (Box 1). The authorities emphasized that
labor costs are still very low and suggested that the long-lasting political tensions and the
deepening energy crisis are largely to blame for the lack of investment and growth.

Togo has been included in cross-country regressions on the determinants of growth (e.g. Block, Journal of
Development Economics 2001, Easterly et al., American Economic Review 2004, Ndulu et al., Challenges of
African Growth, The World Bank Group, 2006). The data indicate that Togo shares some growth-inhibiting
characteristics with other African countries (low life expectancy, high fertility rates), and that its low per capita
growth might be explained by below-average scores on institutional quality, infrastructure, and fiscal spending.

15
Box 1: Is Togo’s Exchange Rate Overvalued?
The CFA franc, which is pegged to the euro, has gradually appreciated against the U.S. dollar in
recent years. Nonetheless, the real effective exchange rate (REER) for the region as a whole is still
broadly in line with its estimated long-run equilibrium value, as discussed in the recent Article IV
consultation for the WAEMU area. Togo’s REER has tracked the regional average closely
since the 1994 devaluation and is still 15 percent below the pre-devaluation level. However,
Togo has also experienced persistent low growth and external imbalances since the early 1980s, its
REER had appreciated relative to other WAMU members prior to 1994, and its terms of trade have
deteriorated more drastically than the regional average.
Export performance has been hampered by real effective
exchange rate appreciation and terms of trade deterioration.

A closer examination suggests that Togo’s exchange rate is not likely to be significantly overvalued.
First, exports of goods and services are relatively high as a share of GDP and have grown strongly
over the past decade. Second, Togo’s current account deficit, 5-6 percent of GDP in 2005–06, is well
below the regional average. Third, wages are among the lowest in the WAEMU region (unskilled
workers earn about $50 a month), with minimum wages and civil servant salaries frozen for more
than a decade. Fourth, Togo’s per capita GDP at purchasing power parity exceeds the cross-country
average (including WAEMU members) in relation to nominal per capita income levels, suggesting a
comparatively low price level for nontradables.

25.
The authorities intend to rely on fiscal adjustment and structural reforms to
boost growth and competitiveness within the existing exchange rate regime. Membership
of the WAMU currency union remains Togo’s main anchor of stability, with significant
benefits in terms of low inflation and access to regional markets. As Togo’s wages are
already comparatively low and regional labor mobility limits the scope for reducing real
wages further, the authorities and staff agreed that the policy focus should be on raising
productivity growth in tradables, including through steps to:

16
•

reallocate spending toward public infrastructure, education, and health
(Section IV.D), while reducing nonpriority outlays;

•

raise agricultural productivity. The authorities intend to improve rural infrastructure
to reduce production bottlenecks, enhance marketability, and diversify production;

•

improve the broader business environment, including by strengthening governance
and simplifying regulations, to attract foreign direct investment. To restore
confidence of local suppliers, the authorities intend to avoid new arrears and develop
a repayment strategy for past arrears, following the recent debt audit;

•

restructure ailing banks and develop the private financial sector to enhance access to
credit and lower lending rates (Section IV.E);

•

reform state-owned enterprises, starting with the clearance of arrears to cotton
farmers and audits of SOTOCO. The authorities are also seeking a strong strategic
investor for the phosphate sector. Broader reforms might be delayed until the World
Bank can fully reengage with Togo; and

•

work with regional partners and private investors to alleviate capacity constraints on
energy generation and imports.
D. Moving Toward Fiscal and Debt Sustainability

26.
Togo faces a heavy public debt burden and looming medium-term spending
pressures. As shown in the DSA (Supplement I), debt could become sustainable through a
combination of economic reforms, fiscal adjustment, and HIPC/MDRI debt relief. However,
the completion point would not be reached before 2010, and debt service in cash terms could
increase substantially in the period between PRGF approval and the HIPC decision point.
Moreover, to raise economic growth and improve social conditions, large additional budget
allocations (including a higher wage bill) will be necessary for health, education, and
infrastructure. The restructuring of state-owned banks and enterprises is also expected to be
costly.
27.
The authorities envisage a gradual domestic fiscal adjustment based on a
gradual increase in revenues and a reallocation of spending toward priority areas. They
pointed to the strong revenue performance in 2006 and the adoption of a prudent budget for
2007 as first steps in this direction. They concurred with the mission that further adjustment
is needed to achieve a sustainable fiscal position, in particular by:
•

raising fiscal revenues to about 18 percent of GDP in 2010, based primarily on
administrative reforms (see below) that could boost revenues by about ½ percentage
point of GDP per year;

17
•

reallocating domestically financed expenditures from nonpriority areas toward health,
education, and infrastructure investment, while also supporting the restructuring of
state-owned enterprises and banks; the total reallocation would amount to about
3 percentage points of GDP in 2006–10 within a stable overall domestic primary
spending envelope of about 17 percent of GDP. A first step was taken in the 2007
budget, which aims to reduce nonpriority spending by about 1 percentage point of
GDP; and

•

targeting a primary fiscal surplus of about 1 percent of GDP by 2010, from a deficit
of 1 percent of GDP in 2006, to avoid new arrears and provide resources for (postHIPC) external debt service and domestic arrears clearance, while minimizing new
borrowing.

28.
The authorities stressed that higher external assistance and comprehensive debt
relief will be critical to reconcile spending needs with fiscal and debt sustainability. The
decade-long disengagement from donors has weakened the state’s institutional capacity,
limited education and health services, and eroded Togo’s public infrastructure. The domestic
fiscal adjustment effort discussed above would thus not suffice to make room for the large
social and infrastructure spending needs identified in the I-PRSP. There was consensus that
meaningful progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) within a
sustainable fiscal framework would require, at a minimum:
•

raising external assistance to the regional average of 6 percent of GDP by 2010,
which would add another 4 percent of GDP for priority spending on social sectors,
infrastructure, and capacity building. The authorities stressed that this would still fall
well short of the resources needed to achieve the MDGs;

•

ensuring that at least two-thirds of foreign aid is disbursed in grants rather than loans,
which would support a reduction in the overall fiscal deficit from 2¾ percent of GDP
in 2006 to 1¾ percent in 2010, a broadly sustainable fiscal position; and

•

securing comprehensive debt relief under the HIPC initiative and the MDRI, which
staff estimated would reduce annual external debt service from over 2½ percent of
GDP in 2006 to about 1 percent of GDP from 2010 onwards, and ensure long-run
debt sustainability (see DSA in Supplement I).

29.
The authorities intend to underpin the fiscal adjustment with comprehensive
reforms to strengthen fiscal governance. To support the increase in revenues, they are
planning a broad set of administrative reforms, including computerization, improved audit
procedures, and simplified procedures for taxpayers. The mission suggested that the
authorities also review the scope for streamlining tax policies, including by limiting
exemptions. The authorities noted that further tax harmonization across the WAEMU region
is under consideration and that they have stepped up tax audits to control the abuse of tax

18
exemptions. To improve expenditure control, the authorities intend to reinstate proper
commitment and payments procedures, including by limiting exceptional payment
authorizations and eliminating those without prior budget line identification. The mission
urged the authorities to set up a system that allows real-time monitoring of budget execution,
which would improve cash management and help policymakers make informed spending
decisions. Improved expenditure tracking and procurement procedures would facilitate
renewed donor financing. In the medium term, the authorities intend to rely on
computerization and an improved accounting system to support budget preparation and
execution. Technical assistance will be critical to support these reforms.
E. Strengthening the Banking Sector

(Percent of total loans)

30.
Despite repeated liquidity injections, several large banks remain fragile and pose
a risk to macroeconomic stability. Togolese banks have the highest nonperforming loan
(NPL) ratio in the WAEMU area, reflecting primarily past lending to loss-making enterprises
in the cotton and phosphate sectors. In 2004–
Nonperforming loans are the highest in the WAEMU area.
06, the government took over NPLs of about
45
4 percent of GDP in exchange for government

obligations. Although this reduced the

sector’s NPL ratio from 42 to 28 percent (still

31.
The regional banking supervisor stressed that efforts to address Togo’s banking
problems are ongoing. The WAMU Banking Commission has made wide-ranging
recommendations to strengthen the financial position of Togo’s ailing banks, including steps
to improve: (i) internal accounting and information systems; (ii) corporate and management
structure; (iii) credit allocation and risk evaluation mechanisms; (iv) NPL recovery; and
(v) provisioning. The authorities noted that one state-owned bank had made good progress in
implementing many of these measures and strengthening its financial position over the past
few years. They acknowledged, however, that another large bank had severe financial
problems, with recurring breaches of prudential regulations and corporate governance
weaknesses. The Banking Commission’s formal request that the government strengthen the
bank’s governance and financial position has not yet been implemented.

19
32.
Understandings were reached on a plan to strengthen and restructure several
banks. An overlapping Fund technical assistance mission helped the authorities prepare a
restructuring plan for three undercapitalized banks, which account for about 60 percent of
private sector deposits. It found that two were relatively easy to restructure, whereas another
would require significant governance changes and a large capital injection by the state, with
annual budget costs estimated at about ½–¾ percent of GDP over five to eight years. The
restructuring plan is based on recommendations of the Banking Commission and is broadly
supported by the ministry of finance, the BCEAO, and World Bank experts. Given the fragile
situation of the banks, the mission stressed the urgency to start preparing and implementing
the recommended actions.
33.
There was agreement that broader financial sector reforms should complement
bank restructuring. Banking sector deposits in the sector have grown rapidly in recent
years, reflecting high inflows of remittances and trade-related capital. However, most of the
additional liquidity has been channeled into net foreign assets, while access to credit for the
private sector has remained scarce and lending rates high. To enhance financial
intermediation and lower interest rates the authorities agreed with the mission on the need to:
•

restructure and privatize state-owned banks;

•

improve the legal environment, in particular property registration, arbitration
procedures, contract enforcement, and the ability of banks to recover collateral;

•

develop microfinance to enhance access to financial services for SMEs and
households; and

•

increase the liquidity and depth of the primary and secondary securities markets.
V. MOVING TOWARD A PRGF ARRANGEMENT

34.
The authorities intend to request a PRGF arrangement to anchor their economic
reform program and pave the way for HIPC debt relief. A PRGF-supported program
could start in the second half of 2007 subject to: (i) fully satisfactory performance under the
SMP; (ii) understandings on arrears clearance with all official creditors and financing
assurances from donors; and (iii) an agreed medium-term reform strategy, based on the IPRSP.
35.
Togo’s large arrears to multilateral creditors, particularly the World Bank, are
a significant obstacle to a possible PRGF arrangement. Substantial coordination will be
needed to prepare for renewed financial support from major donors and creditors in the
second half of 2007. The EU is preparing several large grants that could be used in part to
clear Togo’s arrears to the European Investment Bank (about $20 million). It is not yet
known how the AfDB plans to address Togo’s arrears (about $15 million). World Bank staff

20
is preparing a development policy needs review and is examining options for arrears
clearance. Togo’s $105 million in arrears at end-2006 (Table 8) far exceed its IDA
allocation, and arrears clearance would thus require exceptional treatment and/or possible
help from donors. The authorities intend to intensify their dialogue with multilateral creditors
and approach the Paris Club to request a rescheduling of bilateral debt and arrears.
VI. PROGRAM RISKS
36.
The main near-term risks are related to the upcoming elections and the
weakness of the banking sector. SMP performance could be derailed by fiscal pressures in
the run-up to the parliamentary elections, including possible shortfalls in donor financing,
spending overruns, and a slowdown in economic activity and fiscal revenues.
Implementation of SMP structural benchmarks may also suffer in the pre-election period.
Another risk, with potentially longer lasting economic consequences, is that a possible
disruption or dispute in the election process could derail the national reconciliation process,
undermine economic confidence, and prevent reengagement with donors. The precarious
financial position of several banks is another substantial macroeconomic risk factor, with
possible adverse spillovers to the regional level. Over the medium term, a key risk is that
lack of political consensus and weak institutional could stand in the way of the envisaged
economic reform program.
VII. DATA ISSUES
37.
Data weaknesses hamper surveillance and program monitoring (Informational
Annex in Supplement II). The mission discussed with the authorities a revision of the
balance of payments series to correct for underestimation of service receipts and remittances,
which helped to reduce the overestimation of unrecorded net capital inflows. The mission
noted the importance of upgrading national accounts data sources and reducing the twomonth lag for monetary and fiscal data. The authorities stressed the need for technical
assistance to upgrade Togo’s statistical capacity.
VIII. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
The recent political and economic reforms are a welcome break from the past.
The formation of a national unity government and the preparations for parliamentary
elections have helped restore economic confidence and supported a nascent economic
recovery. Performance under the SMP has been good so far, reflecting renewed fiscal
discipline and progress in strengthening governance.
39.
A key near-term challenge is to contain fiscal pressures in the run-up to the
elections. To mitigate the risks of expenditure overruns or shortfalls in donor support, it will
be critical to strengthen spending controls, improve the monitoring of budget execution, and

21
backload nonpriority expenditures. A smooth election process will be important for
economic confidence and renewed donor support.
40.
Reducing external imbalances within the existing exchange rate regime will
require fiscal adjustment and productivity-enhancing reforms. Notwithstanding recent
real exchange rate appreciation, there is little evidence for a significant exchange rate
misalignment. To prevent a widening current account deficit and make progress toward
external sustainability, it will be important to increase productivity growth, especially in
tradables. This will require wide-ranging structural reforms and improved fiscal governance
to ensure macroeconomic stability and policy predictability.
41.
Togo’s overriding medium-term challenge is to revive economic growth,
following a quarter century of decline. The long-lasting political crisis and withdrawal of
donor support have eroded Togo’s infrastructure and institutions. To revive economic
growth, it will be critical to: (i) improve governance and advance the political reform
process; (ii) reengage with the donor community; (iii) reallocate budgetary resources toward
health, education, and infrastructure; (iv) reform public enterprises in the cotton and
phosphate sectors; (v) raise productivity in agriculture; (vi) work with regional partners to
address energy shortages; (vii) develop the financial sector, including by restructuring ailing
banks; and (viii) improve the business environment, including through legal and regulatory
reforms.
42.
A combination of domestic fiscal adjustment, higher external assistance, and
debt relief will be required to achieve Togo’s economic and social objectives within a
sustainable fiscal framework. Continued reforms to strengthen fiscal governance will be
critical to increase revenue collection and reallocate spending toward health, education, and
infrastructure. A gradual primary fiscal adjustment combined with HIPC debt relief could
help bring debt to sustainable levels and prevent the accumulation of new arrears.
Meaningful progress toward the MDGs will require a substantial increase in external
assistance.
43.
There is an urgent need to strengthen and restructure ailing banks. The
undercapitalization and liquidity problems of several large banks pose a significant risk to
macroeconomic stability. The authorities’ recent commitment to implement the
recommendations of the WAMU Banking Commission and IMF technical assistance mission
is thus welcome and should be followed up as soon as possible. It is also important to
monitor closely the factors driving the current surge in money growth and consider raising
reserve requirements if it starts to fuel inflation or imprudent lending practices.
44.
Successful SMP performance could become the basis for a PRGF arrangement,
but significant obstacles remain. The main near-term program risks are possible fiscal
slippages in the pre-election period, delays in structural reforms, and banking sector
problems. If end-June SMP targets are met, a PRGF arrangement could start later this year,

22
based on an agreed medium-term economic program consistent with the finalized I-PRSP
and external financing assurances. However, Togo would first have to reach understandings
with official creditors, including the World Bank, on a mechanism and resources to clear
arrears.
45.
Data weaknesses continue to hamper surveillance. The authorities should

SUPPLEMENT I—Joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis

This debt sustainability analysis (DSA), prepared jointly by the staffs of the IMF and the
World Bank, applies the low-income country template to the staff’s projections under a noreform scenario and a reform scenario, the latter also factoring in potential debt relief under
the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and MDRI. The analysis shows that Togo is in debt distress,
with large arrears to the World Bank and other official creditors and NPV-of-debt ratios
projected to remain well above the country-specific thresholds over the long term. The
reform scenario illustrates the potential gains associated with possible debt relief, fiscal
adjustment, and economic reforms. Different stress tests indicate that public and external
debt would remain sustainable under the reform scenario; in the absence of fiscal and
structural reforms, however, key debt indicators would revert to an unsustainable path.
Introduction
1.
Togo is currently participating in a staff-monitored program (SMP) with the IMF,
which could lead to a Fund-supported program under the Poverty-Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) and, eventually, debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and MDRI.1
The staffs have therefore prepared two scenarios, a no-reform scenario characterized by low
growth and high fiscal deficits, and a reform scenario describing an economic recovery
supported by structural reforms, higher external assistance, and potential debt relief. The
former scenario is used to determine the extent of Togo’s debt burden. The latter scenario
illustrates the potential impact of reforms and debt relief and is used to discuss the robustness
of the projected debt indicators (post-debt relief) to various shocks.
Current debt situation
2.
Togo’s public sector debt, including arrears, was estimated at US$2.3 billion as
of end-2006, corresponding to 103 percent of GDP. External debt was estimated at
US$ 1.8 billion (81 percent of GDP), of which the World Bank and Paris Club creditors
account for the lion’s share, with about US$0.7 billion each. Arrears now account for almost
a third of total external debt. Togo’s debt to the IMF is relatively modest (US$8.2 million as
of end-2006), and it is current on this debt. While public debt has been declining since 2000,
this occurred mainly because the CFA franc (pegged to the euro) has appreciated against the

1

Togo belongs to the “ring-fenced” countries that met the end-2004 income and indebtedness criteria under the
Enhanced HIPC Initiative and would potentially be eligible for debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative
and MDRI. With domestic revenues exceeding 15 percent of GDP, and an export-GDP ratio exceeding
30 percent, Togo would qualify for debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative under the “fiscal window;”
and a NPV of debt-to-revenue threshold of 250 percent would apply.

U.S. dollar and other currencies.2 Without this appreciation, debt-to-GDP ratio would have
been about 20 percent above its current level.

3.
Togo is in debt distress. Togo is in arrears to the World Bank, the African
Development Bank, and other multilateral and bilateral creditors (but not the IMF). At end2006, the net present value (NPV) of external debt to exports ratio was estimated at
162 percent, and the ratio of the NPV of debt to revenue at 388 percent, in both cases well
above the applicable indicative thresholds (Table 1). Moreover, because Togo has not
serviced most of its external debt in recent years, arrears on principal and interest have
accumulated rapidly and now account for a substantial proportion of overall debt (Figure 2).
The indicators of debt service relative to exports or domestic revenues are below the
applicable thresholds, partly because a substantial proportion of debt is in arrears.3

2

Between end-2000 and end-2006, the CFA franc appreciated against the U.S. dollar by 42 percent, from
729 CFA francs per U.S. dollar to 513 CFA francs per U.S. dollar.

3

If an imputation for repayment of arrears is included, assuming a 20-year period repayment period and an
interest rate of 4 percent, debt service would amount to 11 percent of exports and 26 percent of government
revenues (excluding grants) in 2006, the latter exceeding the applicable indicative threshold.

All debt indicators refer to the NPV of public and publicly guaranteed external debt, and
relate to the“no-reform scenario” described in Table 2.
2
Policy-dependent debt-sustainability threshold over which countries with similar
evaluations of policies and institutions would face a probability of about 20 percent of
experiencing a prolonged incident of debt distress in the coming year. The thresholds
shown relate to low-income countries with poor institutional quality, reflecting Togo’s
score in the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA, average
2003–05), which lies within the lowest quintile among the countries covered.

Long-term economic macroeconomic outlook
4.
Togo’s growth performance has been very weak, with per capita income
declining since the early 1980s. Political turmoil and weak governance have undermined the
investment climate, while access to credit has been hampered by the poor performance of
state-owned banks. In the absence of comprehensive economic reforms and increased
external assistance, this is unlikely to change. The no-reform scenario (illustrated in Table 2)
therefore projects GDP growth to hover around its long-term average of 1¾ percent (below
population growth), an overall fiscal deficit exceeding 5 percent of GDP, continued
accumulation of arrears, and large external imbalances. In this scenario, debt indicators
related to the NPV of debt remain well above the indicative thresholds shown in Table 1 and
Figures 6−7. Debt sustainability indicators related to the debt service due remain below the
applicable thresholds (see, for example, Fig. 8), largely because a substantial proportion of
debt is in arrears, with no debt service scheduled.
5.
The more favorable outlook in the reform scenario (Table 2) is based on the
implementation of a comprehensive reform program, coupled with increased external
assistance and the estimated impact of potential debt relief through the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative and MDRI. Real GDP growth rises to around 3½-4 percent per year, sustained by
an increase in foreign direct investment, greater availability of credit to the private sector,
and upgrades to critical infrastructure. To achieve this, the scenario envisages an increase in
external assistance to 6 percent of GDP (with two-thirds in grants), steps to improve
efficiency through improved governance, reallocation of fiscal spending toward public
investment; steps to improve the business environment; reform of state-owned enterprises;
and banking sector reform.

6.
As a prerequisite for a PRGF arrangement, Togo would have to reach
understandings on the clearance of outstanding arrears on official external debt. In this
regard, the EU is preparing several large grants that could be used in part to clear Togo’s
arrears to the European Investment Bank (about $20 million). The World Bank staff is
preparing a development policy needs review and is examining options for clearing arrears,
which stood at about $105 million at end-2006. The authorities intend to intensify their
dialogue with multilateral creditors and approach the Paris Club to request a rescheduling of
bilateral debt and arrears.
Debt Sustainability Analysis
7.
Projections of public debt and debt service under the no-reform scenario show
that Togo’s public debt is unsustainable in the absence of policy adjustments and debt
relief (Figures 3-8, and Tables 3-4). In this scenario, the NPV of total public debt (external
and domestic) is projected to rise from 88 percent of GDP in 2006 to 114 percent of GDP in
2027, and from 520 percent of government revenues (excluding grants) to 714 percent
(Figures 3−4). Debt service would rise from 15 percent of government revenues (excluding
grants) to 25 percent over the same period (Figure 5). A similar picture emerges for external
debt. While the NPV of external debt would decline slowly from 388 percent of government

34
revenues in 2006 to 329 percent in 2027, it would remain well above the indicative threshold
of 200 percent, as illustrated in Figures 6−7. The ratio of the NPV of external debt to exports
would also remain above the indicative threshold of 100 percent (falling from 162 percent in
2006 to 133 percent in 2027), while external debt service would increase somewhat (to
8 percent of exports, by 2027).
Figures 3−8. In the no-reform scenario, debt indicators remain well above the applicable thresholds,
while the reform scenario with debt relief envisages a very substantial decline.

The reform scenario projects a steep decline in external and total public debt,
owing to debt relief in the context of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and MDRI, but also an
improved macroeconomic and fiscal outlook in the longer run, owing to the implementation
of a comprehensive reform program. In this scenario, the NPV of total public debt is
projected to decline to 27 percent of GDP (148 percent of government revenues) by 2027,
while the NPV of external debt falls to 16 percent of GDP, or 32 percent of exports and
85 percent of government revenues (Table 5). External debt service declines steeply owing to

35
debt and arrears rescheduling and cancellation, including under HIPC/MDRI, between 2007
and 2010, and then increases modestly to around 3 percent of exports (Table 7). All debt
indicators remain substantially below the applicable debt thresholds shown in Table 1.
9.
Stress tests focus on debt sustainability and the robustness of the key debt
indicators under the reform scenario after debt relief. All shocks are thus assumed to
occur from 2011 on. Stress tests are summarized in Figures 9−11 and Table 6 (for total
public debt), and in Figures 12−14 and Table 8 (for external debt).
10.
Debt indicators remain below the applicable thresholds under most stress tests
that simulate temporary shocks or policy reversals. Under most temporary shocks and
reversals, debt increases in 2011–12 and gradually declines thereafter, reaching a sustainable
level in the long term (see bound tests in Tables 6 and 8). External debt is particularly
sensitive to stress test B4 (Table 8), which envisages a debt-financed shortfall in private
transfers from abroad and FDI totaling about 20 percent of GDP spread over two years. In
this case, the NPV of external debt rises above the relevant indicative threshold (Figure 12),
but eventually reverts to a sustainable level. Under a severe output shock (bound test B1 of
Table 6), with two successive years of real GDP growth set at 5½ percentage points below
trend, public debt as a share of GDP would increase and would not revert to a lower level.
Debt may revert to an unsustainable path (even after debt relief) in case of a
permanent reversal in fiscal/economic reforms or a permanent economic shock without
an adequate policy response. As shown in the alternative scenarios in Tables 6 and 8
(Figures 9-14), if key variables (such as growth, fiscal balances, external flows) revert to
their historical averages, debt will generally increase over time and, in some cases, exceed
indicative thresholds by 2027. Similarly, bound test B5 in Table 6 shows that a one-off
increase in public debt by 30 percent would result in a gradually rising level of debt over the
long term. This underlines that debt relief alone is insufficient to ensure debt sustainability if
economic and fiscal reforms are not sustained. It also shows that permanent economic shocks
will require fiscal adjustment beyond the policies assumed in the reform scenario to ensure
debt sustainability.

Exchange Arrangement

Togo is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and has
no separate legal tender. The exchange system, common to all WAEMU countries, is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
The union’s common currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at a rate of
CFAF 655.957 = EUR 1, consistent with the official conversions rate of the French franc to
the euro and the previous fixed rate of the CFA franc to the French franc of CFAF 100= F 1.
On April 28, 2006, the rate of the CFA franc in terms of SDR was CFAF 769.68 = SDR 1.0.
Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been
reclassified to the category of conventional pegged arrangement from the category of
exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the
behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack
of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus only reflects a definitional change, and
is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime
or other policies of the currency union or its members
VIII. Safeguards Assessments
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union. The most recent safeguards
assessment of the BCEAO was completed on November 4, 2005. The assessment indicates
that progress has been made in strengthening the bank's safeguards framework since the 2002
safeguards assessment.
The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements and improvements have
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place, mechanisms for
improving risk management and risk prevention have been established and follow-up on
internal and external audit recommendations has been strengthened.
The new assessment identified a number of areas where further steps would help solidify the
progress made. The main recommendations relate to improvements in the external audit
process (including the adoption of a formal rotation policy), further enhancement of the
transparency of the financial statements by fully adopting IFRS, and further strengthening of
the effectiveness of the internal audit function. The status report of the implementation of
recommendations, received from the bank in March 2007, indicates that some progress was
achieved.

II—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(Updated May 7, 2007)
1.
Over the last decade, Togo has been trapped in a vicious cycle of sociopolitical
impasse, economic decline, rising poverty, and donor disengagement. Togo has been in
nonaccrual status with the International Development Association (IDA) since May 2002,
with arrears of US$106.6 million as of March 2007. During the current non-accrual period,
the Bank has continued to conduct analytical and advisory activities (AAA) on key aspects of
socioeconomic development. Together with other partners, the Bank also supported the
government’s efforts to prepare its I-PRSP and development strategies in such sectors as
health, education, agriculture and rural development, and HIV/AIDS.
2.
The World Bank Executive Board discussed on December 14, 2004, a Country Reengagement Note (CRN) for Togo. It provides a joint strategy for Bank and UNDP reengagement and a framework for strengthening donor assistance that could lead to a
clearance of Togo’s arrears to IDA and other major creditors and a full resumption of Bank
operations in the country.
3.
In July 2005, the Bank approved a US$2.8 million grant under the Low Income
Country Under Stress (LICUS) Initiative for a community-driven Emergency Program for
Poverty Reduction (EPPR), which aims at helping to halt extreme poverty and the
deterioration of social indicators. As of September 2006, approximately $1 million has been
disbursed and financed the completion of some 30 projects (primary schools, health posts,
small community infrastructures and community training); the training of some 750 people
on community approaches to development and project management; and the establishment of
a Bureau de Liaison National, to ensure donor coordination and liaison with Government
authorities. Following positive results of an internal evaluation including independent
consultants in October 2006, the last phase of the EPPR is in negotiation.
4.
On the analytical side, the Bank conducted a Public Expenditure Management and
Financial Review (PEMFAR) and a Financial Sector Review (FSR) in the last quarter of
2005. The Bank is working closely with the IMF on a Financial Sector Assessment, an Urban
Sector Stocktaking Study, and an Agricultural Development assessment. In addition, the
Bank is supporting the government as it strengthens its poverty diagnosis, information
systems, and statistical capacities. A Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire survey was
carried out in 2006 to provide for up-to-date and more reliable statistics. A development
policy needs review is planned during the current fiscal year.

47
III—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Weaknesses in the quality and timeliness of data hamper the effectiveness of
surveillance. National accounts and balance of payments statistics are compiled based on
very limited information, with only few surveys and scarce data on primary agriculture and
private sector services. Moreover, government finance statistics are derived from a weak
accounting system, and monetary data are reported by the BCEAO with a two-month lag.
2.
Togo participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
November 2001. Metadata on the national statistical system, including plans for
improvement posted to the Fund’s Dissemination Standard Bulletin Board in January 2004,
have not been updated since then. Authorities do not report any fiscal data for publication in
the International Financial Statistics (IFS) or the Government Financial Statistics (GFS)
Yearbook.
National accounts and consumer price index (CPI)
3.
Activity in the informal and service sectors is underestimated, due to the lack of
reliable data sources. A full set of national accounts are currently compiled by extrapolating
the results of the last comprehensive exercise in 1993. Annual GDP data are compiled with a
six-month delay. The CPI uses 1996 weights and its geographical coverage is limited to the
city of Lomé.
Balance of Payments
4.
Balance of payments data are compiled based on banks reports, a survey on
enterprises, and data from customs. Informal trade, trade in services, and remittances are
underestimated. Statistics are compiled with a six-month delay and are revised twice a year.
Government accounts and public debt data
5.
Government finance statistics are derived from a weak accounting system. The monthly
TOFE (Table of Central Government Financial Operations) is based on a mixture of
administrative and accounting data and is sent to AFR with a two-month lag. Current budget
nomenclature does not permit the economic and functional classification of expenditure.
There are inconsistencies in domestic arrears records held by different units of the Ministry
of Finance and the stock of domestic debt is in the process of being audited. Comprehensive
external debt data and projections on a loan by loan basis are compiled regularly.
Monetary statistics
Monthly data for Togo, as well as other member of the West African Monetary Union
(WAMU) are regularly provided to and disseminated by the Central Bank of the West
African Monetary Union (BCEAO) and its national agencies. However, data are
disseminated with a two-month lag, and sometimes later. Data on interest rates applied by

48
domestic banks on their lending and borrowing operations are not compiled. In August 2006,
as part of the authorities’ efforts to implement the methodology in the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual, the BCEAO reported to STA monetary data for June 2006 for
all member countries using Standardized Report Forms (1SR-central bank, 2SR-other
depository corporations, and 5SR-monetary aggregates). These data were reviewed in STA
and comments were provided to the authorities.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Togo
On June 8, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Togo.1
Background
1.
Togo faces enormous development challenges after 25 years of economic decline. The
long-lasting socio-political crisis and withdrawal of donor support have taken a toll on Togo’s
economy, infrastructure, and institutions. Traditional export sectors have been eroded by
adverse terms of trade, real exchange rate appreciation, and the mismanagement of stateowned enterprises. Governance problems and banking sector difficulties have inhibited private
investment. Weak fiscal management has led to the rapid accumulation of debt and arrears,
and debt is now at unsustainably high levels.
2.
Over the past 12 months, Togo has embarked on major political and economic reforms.
A central goal is to end the socio-political crisis by holding free and transparent parliamentary
elections for the first time in decades, which are also seen as crucial for the resumption of
donor support. The authorities have initiated important economic reforms, including steps to
strengthen fiscal governance. Economic policies are monitored under a nine-month SMP,
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

51
which could pave the way for a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement
and, eventually, debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).
3.
A modest economic recovery is underway following the slump in 2005. Real GDP grew
an estimated 2 percent in 2006, as the improved political climate and dynamism in traderelated services offset the drag on growth caused by the crisis in the cotton sector and daily
electricity outages. The current account deficit rose modestly, reflecting the impact of higher oil
prices and lower cotton exports. Appreciation of the euro (and thus the CFA franc) against the
U.S. dollar and adverse terms of trade have weakened Togo’s external competitiveness in
recent years. Despite large inflows of liquidity, inflation has been subdued. Broad money grew
22 percent in 2006, as the improved political climate led to a surge in remittances and traderelated capital inflows. While these inflows boosted the banking system’s net foreign assets,
they did not translate into higher domestic credit. They also did not have a discernible impact
on domestic prices. Inflation fell to 2¼ percent in the 12 months to February 2007, as food
prices moderated due to improved agricultural supply conditions in neighboring countries.
4.
Fiscal policy improved markedly in the second half of 2006. Revenue performance was
strong, reflecting recent reforms in administration, tax arrears recovery, and an exceptional
profit transfer from the Banque Centrale des Etats de l’Afrique de l’Ouest (BCEAO). The
government tightened expenditure control in the second half of 2006 by curtailing offbudget
operations. The proceeds from the February 2006 regional bond issue were mostly used to
improve public infrastructure and reduce arrears to civil servants and cotton farmers. The
domestic primary deficit for 2006 was contained at 1 percent of GDP, and domestic arrears
were reduced for the first time in years. External arrears continued to accumulate, reflecting
Togo’s unsustainably high public debt (about 103 percent of GDP). The 2007 budget aims to
anchor macroeconomic stability in an election year by reducing the primary fiscal deficit to ½
percent of GDP. The adjustment would come from a sharp reduction in discretionary spending,
supported by reforms to minimize the use of exceptional spending procedures. Allocations for
health, education, and public infrastructure would remain broadly unchanged.
5.
The authorities have embarked on important structural reforms, in particular steps to
strengthen fiscal governance. Revenue administration reforms started in mid-2006 with the
replacement of the tax and customs directors and closure of bank accounts used to divert
revenues for offbudget operations. This was followed by the establishment of internal and
external audit programs in the tax department and steps to introduce advanced software in the
customs department. Unlike in previous years, spending commitments and payment
authorizations under the 2006 budget were closed before December 31, which will help control
spending in 2007. A recent audit has validated domestic government debt and arrears of about
21 percent of GDP at end-2005. Audits of the state-owned cotton company the Société
Cotonnière du Togo (SOTOCO) are underway, and the government has continued to repay
SOTOCO’s arrears to farmers.

52

6.
Despite repeated liquidity injections, several large banks remain fragile and pose a risk
to macroeconomic stability. Togolese banks have the highest nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio
in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) area, reflecting primarily past
lending to loss-making enterprises in the cotton and phosphate sectors. Although the
government took over some of the NPLs, several banks have remained severely
undercapitalized and one has experienced liquidity problems. The authorities have recently
strengthened monitoring of bank liquidity and prepared a strategy to strengthen and
restructure the ailing banks, in collaboration with the WAMU Banking Commission and IMF
technical assistance.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the recent political and economic reforms in Togo, which mark
an important break from the past. Directors noted that the formation of a national unity
government and progress toward organizing free parliamentary elections have helped restore
economic confidence and supported a nascent economic recovery.
Directors welcomed Togo’s good performance under the SMP. They commended the progress
made in restoring fiscal discipline and strengthening governance, in particular the reforms to
strengthen tax and customs administration and improve expenditure control. Directors also
noted the recent audits of domestic debt and of the state-owned cotton company. They
encouraged the authorities to complete the remaining structural benchmarks under the SMP
and to minimize delays.
Directors cautioned, however, that downside risks to the economic outlook remain substantial,
including from possible disruptions in the election process, financial sector weaknesses that
could also have adverse spillovers to the regional level, and the deepening problems with
energy supply.
Directors stressed the importance of containing fiscal pressures in the run-up to the elections.
They noted that the problems of the energy, cotton, and the banking sectors might create
additional pressures. To mitigate the risks of expenditure overruns or possible shortfalls in
donor support, Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen spending controls, improve
the monitoring of budget execution, and backload nonpriority expenditures to the extent
possible.
Directors stressed the need to make progress toward fiscal and debt sustainability. Continued
reforms to strengthen fiscal governance will be critical for increasing revenue collection and
reallocating spending toward health, education, and infrastructure. A gradual primary fiscal
adjustment combined with comprehensive debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI could
help bring debt to sustainable levels and prevent the accumulation of new arrears. Directors

53
noted that progress toward the MDGs would require a substantial increase in external
assistance from the current low level. Improved public expenditure management was seen as
an important prerequisite for securing additional aid flows.
Directors considered that Togo’s membership in the WAEMU currency union provides an
important anchor of stability. They expressed concern, however, about Togo’s loss in external
competitiveness over the past two decades, largely caused by weaknesses in governance,
deteriorating infrastructure, terms of trade shocks, and—more recently—real exchange rate
appreciation. Nevertheless, given Togo’s comparatively low wages, Directors saw little
evidence of a significant exchange rate overvaluation. At the same time, they stressed the
need to improve external competitiveness in order to support higher economic growth and
prevent a widening current account deficit. The policy focus should be on raising productivity
growth, which will require improving the investment climate through structural reforms,
infrastructure investment, and improved fiscal governance.
Directors saw Togo’s overarching medium-term challenge as reviving and sustaining economic
growth, following a quarter century of decline. They noted that ending the long-lasting political
crisis and reengaging with donors will be critical for reviving growth. Reforms of public
enterprises in the cotton and phosphate sectors are additional challenges, alongside policies
to diversify and raise productivity in agriculture. Directors encouraged the authorities to work
with regional partners and donors to alleviate energy shortages, which are increasingly
hampering economic activity. They also highlighted the importance of developing the financial
sector, including by restructuring ailing banks, and improving the business environment,
including through measures to improve governance.
Directors stressed the need to strengthen and restructure several undercapitalized commercial
banks, whose financial problems—including the still high level of nonperforming loans—pose a
significant risk to stability and constrain the development of the private sector. They were
therefore encouraged by the authorities’ commitment to implement the recommendations of
the WAMU Banking Commission and of IMF technical assistance. Directors also encouraged
the authorities to monitor closely the current surge in money growth and be prepared to take
corrective policy action in case of emerging inflationary pressures or imprudent lending
practices.
Directors noted that successful performance under the SMP could pave the way for
consideration of a PRGF arrangement later this year, based on an agreed medium-term
economic program consistent with the finalized Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(I-PRSP). They stressed that this would require understandings with official creditors, including
the World Bank, on a mechanism to clear Togo’s large external arrears.

54
Directors noted that the long-lasting political crisis and withdrawal of donor support had
weakened Togo’s institutional capacity and highlighted the importance of enhanced technical
assistance, including in the fiscal area and in economic statistics.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Togo
June 8, 2007
At the outset, I would like to express the appreciation of my Togolese authorities to the
Executive Board, Management and Staff for their valuable support and advice since they
embarked on implementing the current Staff Monitored Program. I also would like on behalf
of my authorities to thank staff for the fruitful dialogue held during the recent discussions
under the 2007 Article IV consultation and review of the SMP, as well as for the helpful set
of papers which well documents Togo’s economic developments and performances.
Since October 2006, my authorities have within the framework of SMP embarked on
macroeconomic and structural reforms designed to restore macroeconomic stability, and
achieve sustained growth in order to make inroads in poverty reduction and achieving the
MDGs. Despite the unfavorable economic environment due in particular to the increase in oil
prices and difficult situation in the energy and cotton sectors, my Togolese authorities have
maintained determined implementation of the SMP and as evidenced in the staff report have
met all performance criteria.
Following the slump recorded in 2005, a 2 percent real GDP was achieved in 2006. Inflation
was also significantly reduced as the consumer price index dropped from 6.8 percent in 2005
to 2.2 percent in 2006.
Fiscal performance has been strong. Revenues exceeded the end-2006 target, on account of
reforms in tax and customs administration as well as the strong recovery of tax arrears, and
expenditure control was tightened by curtailing off budget operations. Consequently, the
domestic primary deficit for 2006 was contained at 1 percent of GDP, below the program
target of 1.75 percent and domestic arrears were reduced for the first time in years. All
structural benchmarks under the SMP through February were met. To help control spending
in 2007, all spending commitments and payment authorizations under the 2006 budget were
closed before December 31, 2006. In February 2007, the authorities adopted a decree
establishing internal and external audit programs in the tax department. The principles of an
arrears clearance strategy based on a draft audit were discussed with the IMF mission. The
preliminary financial audit report on SOTOCO has been also issued. The authorities are
implementing further reforms, including tax audits and customs’ computerization, in order to
enhance revenue collection.
With regard to the external sector, the gross international reserves increased to 3.2 months of
imports from 2.0 months in 2005. However, the adverse impact of higher oil prices and lower
cotton exports led to the widening of the current account deficit to 6 percent of GDP.
On the political front, my authorities have also made important achievements in building
governance institutions and democratization. In August 2006 a global political agreement

57
involving all major political parties was signed followed by the formation of a national unity
government in September 2006. Free and fair legislative elections will be organized before
the end of 2007 by an independent national electoral commission established in October
2006.
In spite of these performances, the authorities still face daunting challenges in order to revive
economic growth, reduce external imbalances and eradicate poverty after more than two
decades of decline. In order to overcome these challenges and based on the policy
implementation performances made under the SMP as well as their strong commitment to
pursue sound policies and reforms, my Togolese authorities are requesting a PRGF
arrangement in order to enable them to mobilize broader donor aid support and debt relief.
Program for 2007
In 2007, real GDP growth is projected at 3 percent, driven mainly by higher public
investment, increase in cotton production and continued strong growth in services related to
regional trade. A higher and sustainable economic growth is needed in order to make
significant inroads in poverty reduction. To this end, the authorities are developing a
comprehensive reform strategy based on the Interim PRSP. This reform strategy covers (i)
political and economic governance, including political and legal reforms, and steps to
strengthen public finances and budget execution; (ii) structural reforms with actions to
improve business environment, restructure state-owned enterprises, raise agricultural
productivity, build infrastructure and develop the financial sector and (iii) social reforms
including wider access to education, health, and safe water.
Fiscal Policy and Reform
My Togolese authorities remain strongly committed to fiscal discipline and sound budgetary
processes. To support the increase in revenue collection, they are planning a broad set of
administrative reforms designed to strengthen tax administration and reduce fiscal risks. This
reform includes computerization, improved audit procedures and simplified procedures for
taxpayers. To restore confidence of local suppliers, the authorities intend to avoid new
arrears and develop a repayment strategy for past arrears following the recent audit. They
also envisage a gradual domestic fiscal adjustment based on a gradual increase in revenues
and a reallocation of spending towards priority area, namely public infrastructure, education
and health. In view of the heavy public debt burden, the authorities call on higher external
assistance and comprehensive debt relief, in order to meet spending needs in the context of
fiscal and debt sustainability. The lack of external support for more than a decade has
significantly weakened the country’s institutional and human capacity and eroded its physical
infrastructure, whose rehabilitation requires substantial financial support in addition to the
domestic fiscal adjustment effort.

Monetary Policy and Banking Sector Reform
The current exchange rate regime has served the economy well, with significant benefits in
terms of low inflation and access to regional markets. The Togolese banking sector remains
fragile. The authorities are aware that this situation could jeopardize the macroeconomic
stability. In their efforts to strengthen the sector, the authorities have significantly reduced
the NPL ratio from 42 to 28 percent. The regional banking commission has made wide
ranging recommendations to step up the authorities’ efforts to address the problems
experienced by the Togolese banks. Good progress has been made in implementing many of
Commission’ measures, and the authorities are committed to press ahead with further
strengthening the banks’ governance and financial position.
Structural Reforms and Competitiveness
The authorities aim to make further progress in the structural reforms, with a view to boost
higher growth and revive the external competitiveness of the economy. In this regard, the
authorities intend to improve the broader business environment, including by strengthening
governance and simplifying regulations to attract foreign direct investment. They will also
speed up reforms of state-owned enterprises with the clearance of arrears to cotton farmers
and audit of SOCOTO as well as seeking a strong strategic investor for the phosphate sector.
In their efforts to address problems in the energy sector, the authorities plan to work with
regional partners and private investors to alleviate the main constraints. To enhance financial
intermediation and lower interest rates, the authorities intend to restructure and privatize the
state-owned banks, develop microfinance to enhance access to financial services for the
SMEs and households and increase the liquidity and depth of primary and secondary
securities markets. Further steps will also be undertaken to improve the legal environment
and the ability of banks to recover credit collaterals.
Regarding the urgent need to upgrade the country’s statistical capacity, my Togolese
authorities call on the Fund for a technical assistance in the areas of the balance of payments,
and national accounts as well as monetary and fiscal data.
Conclusion
My authorities fully share the staff’s analysis on debt sustainability which shows that Togo is
in debt distress and highlights the need for increased external assistance coupled with
benefiting from HIPC Initiative and MDRI.
My Togolese authorities remain determined to pursue steadfastly the implementation of good
policies. Once again they would appreciate Directors support of their request for a PRGF
arrangement, in order to back their efforts towards poverty alleviation and achieving the
MDGs.
