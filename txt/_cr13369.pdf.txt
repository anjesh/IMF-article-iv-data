STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 31, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Economic context. Growth was strong in 2012, and the economy is overheating from
expansionary macroeconomic policies. The current account deficit has deteriorated
significantly, a product of a currency appreciation in real effective terms, a growing fiscal
deficit, and strong domestic demand. International reserves are inadequate for
precautionary needs. Credit growth has declined, but remains excessive, raising financial
stability concerns. Inflation is accelerating, and could become more broad-based.
Outlook and risks. Growth is projected at 8¼ percent in 2013 before reverting toward
potential of about 7½ percent in the medium-term. Inflation is projected to remain
elevated, a result of excess demand. A recent tightening of public wages should reduce
the headline fiscal deficit to 4 percent of GDP in 2014, although the current account
deficit is expected to remain high. FDI inflows should be vigorous, but reserve levels
would remain inadequate. The economy is vulnerable to trading partners’ growth and
terms-of-trade shocks, and policy slippage. Banks’ asset quality could also deteriorate.
Policy focus. There was broad agreement that policies should be tightened to replenish
international reserves and manage a soft landing while building the foundations for
broader-based growth. Restoring economic stability is a key priority.
Fiscal policy. A comprehensive medium-term budget strategy anchored around a
nonmining fiscal deficit target of no more than 5 percent of GDP beginning this fiscal
year would ensure debt sustainability and reduce existing vulnerabilities. Further
tightening through revenue administration, public employee compensation restraint
along with civil service reform, and possibly a VAT rate hike, will be needed.
Monetary, exchange rate, and financial sector policies. The USD/kip exchange rate
should move more flexibly in line with market conditions with a view toward gradually
building up international reserves. Domestic monetary conditions should be tightened to
moderate credit growth and inflation. Financial supervision requires strengthening, with
prudential measures to reduce leverage and balance sheet mismatches.
Building broader-based growth. Efforts to improve the business climate and accelerate
legal compliance with the WTO will bolster trade integration and private-sector growth,
enhance productivity in the nonresource sector, thereby improving economic resiliency.
Public sector financial management reform will improve the quality of public spending.
Upgrading health and education infrastructure will help reduce inequality.

Backdrop. In concluding the 2012 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors recommended
a tightening of monetary policy to stem the risks from rapid credit growth and to replenish
international reserves. Moreover, they urged restraint in civil service compensation increases to
protect the fiscal buffers to deal with future shocks. Since then, the economy has been overheating
from expansionary macroeconomic policies. The fiscal budget has come under stress, credit growth
remains excessive, international reserves have declined further and are inadequate for precautionary
needs, and signs of foreign currency shortage have emerged. Against this backdrop, the 2013 Article
IV consultation focused on policies to return the economy toward macroeconomic and financial
stability while building the foundations for broader-based growth.

PRESSING CHALLENGES, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
3.
An overheating economy. Spurred by the fiscal expansion and rapid credit growth, the
economy is growing beyond short-term capacity constraints. Real GDP expanded by 8 percent in
2012, buoyed by investment and private consumption. Investment in hydropower, infrastructure,
and real estate—some related to the 2012 Asia-Europe Meeting—significantly lifted construction
activities and imports. Strong expansion in the services sector and nonresource imports reflected
robust domestic consumption and tourism activity. Growth is projected to rise to 8¼ percent in
2013 and moderate to 7½ percent in 2014 on account of a less expansionary fiscal stance. Staff’s
medium-term baseline projection (Table 5) is predicated on the authorities’ announced policy
intentions, which are weaker than staff’s recommendations, particularly with regard to a reloosening of public employee compensation. It also depends on vigorous resource-related FDI
inflows, growing electricity demand from neighboring countries, a gradual pickup of investment
inflows into nonresource sectors following recent WTO accession, and progress on tax system and
administration reforms.

4.
A vulnerable external position. The current account deficit surged from 15½ percent of
GDP in 2011 to 28½ percent of GDP in 2012, a product of strong domestic demand, a growing fiscal
deficit, a moderate terms-of-trade deterioration, and a sharp currency appreciation in real effective
terms. International reserves decline further to 0.8 month of prospective imports (June 2013), and
remain inadequate for precautionary needs (Box 1). While FDI remained strong in 2012, covering
approximately 54 percent of the current account deficit, the portion of the current account not
financed by FDI or official development assistance—the core balance of payments—is estimated to
be in deficit at 10½ percent of GDP. These developments confirm staff’s model-based assessment of
a growing real exchange rate overvaluation relative to medium-term fundamentals. Looking ahead,
the current account deficit is expected to remain close to 30 percent of GDP in 2013–14 before
large-scale power projects come on stream in 2015–16 and lift medium-term exports. Although FDI
inflows are expected to be vigorous over the next two years, reserve levels would be inadequate by
low-income country (LIC) metrics at less than 1½ months of imports.
5.
Rising price pressures. After easing
considerably in 2012, headline inflation accelerated to
6.9 percent (y/y) in September 2013, mostly a result
of fresh food prices. The appreciation in the nominal
effective exchange rate and sluggish adjustment in
the prices of publicly provided goods and services
have kept core inflation in check. Nevertheless, core
inflation has picked up momentum during the past
few months. As economic activity expands beyond
potential, consumer price inflation is projected to
reach 7½ percent by end-2013 and average at that
level in 2014.

current account approach indicate that the
underlying current account deficit is significantly higher than the norm estimated using cross-country panel
regressions with a 24 percent real depreciation (in effective terms) necessary to bring the deficit down to the
current account norm, ceteris paribus. Similarly, the external sustainability approach finds that a 16 percent real
depreciation would be needed to stabilize net foreign asset (NFA) at the levels estimated in 2012. Targeting a
healthier NFA position of -80 percent of GDP would imply a degree of overvaluation of 30 percent.
In contrast to the current account approach, the equilibrium exchange rate approach indicates no misalignment

These reserve coverage levels are the lowest among Asian LICs, and significantly below the traditional metrics of

strengthening through fiscal consolidation, the tightening of domestic monetary conditions, and structural
reforms to improve productivity over time, particularly in the nonresource sectors.

gold prices. As a result of the wage increase, public sector wage bill has risen to 50 percent of
revenue, and is now well above LIC average (Box 2). With the suspension of additional benefits
payment to public sector employees and the reduction in capital spending announced in September
2013, the headline deficit is projected to decline to around 4 percent of GDP in 2014 (nonmining
deficit of 6½ percent of GDP). The headline deficit is expected to rise to around 5½ percent of GDP
in 2015 (FY2014/15) on account of further increases in public sector salaries, before declining
gradually to 3½ percent of GDP over the medium term. Public sector debt, which remains elevated
compared with regional LICs, has risen sharply, and is expected to peak at 64 percent during
2014–16. Staff expects additional bond issuance in Thailand following the US$50 million issuance
this year, which was oversubscribed.

high at 11 percent of total deposits (June 2013), though signs of foreign currency liquidity shortage
in the banking system have emerged. Reflecting this shortage, the parallel foreign exchange market
has been trading at a premium over the BOL’s reference exchange rates since mid-August. Foreign
currency lending capacity will become more constrained, as banks’ claims on the economy have
exceeded 90 percent of deposits.

capacity and risk management practices at banks
may not be robust enough to ensure high lending
standards, raising concerns about domestic banking
sector soundness. Furthermore, the capital of two
state-owned commercial banks is well below the
regulatory minimum, potentially a fiscal risk.

Box 2. Lao P.D.R.: Increase in Civil Service Compensation1
A large increase in salaries and benefits for public
employees was implemented in 2013, as part of the
stated plan to increase the compensation of public
employees over three years:
•
The civil service salary index rose by
37 percent in 2013 and is expected to rise by the
same percent each year in 2014 and 2015.
•
Benefits (salary supplements) rose by
140 percent in 2013; this increase was reversed in
2014, bringing benefits back to the level of 2012. For
2015 they are assumed to rise with inflation.

Evidence for the increase is mixed. The increase
has been justified to attract workers with the required skills and to discourage turning to outside
employment to supplement incomes. A World Bank study, published in 2010, found that compensation from
the formal salary for civil service workers was well below private sector comparators. However, when the
calculation took into account intangible benefits, such as fewer hours worked and lower work demands,
more stable employment and earnings, in-kind benefits, housing and education allowances, and
opportunities to supplement incomes through per-diems, the private sector premium disappeared.

Nevertheless, the study also documented a strong perception among civil servants that their remuneration
was not sufficient to cover even basic expenses.2
The increase brings civil service compensation well above the average level for international
comparators. Public compensation doubled from 5 percent of GDP in 2012 to 10 percent of GDP in 2013,
well above the level of 6.3 percent for LICs.3 In terms of revenue, compensation rose over the same period
from 25 percent to 50 percent, well above the low-income average of 28 percent. Finally, in terms of
expenditure, compensation rose from 24 to 38 percent, above the low-income average of 35 percent.

Identifying a credit boom in the making.
Benign credit growth episodes can be
distinguished from those that could undermine
financial stability by observing the deviation in
percentage points of credit-to-GDP from trend.
This credit gap measure signals a valid warning,
producing a low noise-to-signal ratio. Specifically,
the credit gap threshold of 4 percentage points
enables us to predict past financial crises correctly
within three years with close to 80 percent
probability, including 5 out of 9 banking crisis
episodes in LICs.

stances, lack of macro-prudential attention,

lack of macro-prudential control have been identified as significant contributors to the probability of
future financial distress. These indicators currently suggest that credit overheating in Lao P.D.R merits
close monitoring.

borrowing and favorable long-term GDP growth outlook, the risk of external public debt distress
remains moderate (see the Debt Sustainability Analysis). Nevertheless, compared to last year’s
assessment, the external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt level is closer to its safety
threshold, which leaves few buffers in the near term in case of an adverse shock. Staff’s analysis also
shows that the external PPG debt-to-GDP ratio could be pushed beyond sustainable levels under
certain stress scenarios, including sharp currency devaluation, less favorable FDI inflows, a significant
deterioration in domestic and external environment, and higher borrowing costs which may be
associated with new infrastructure mega-projects.
10.
Risks to growth and stability. Although trade and investment reforms could be accelerated
to take full advantage of recent WTO membership, thereby increasing foreign-funded nonresource
investment and growth relative to the baseline, on balance, risks to the outlook are skewed toward
the downside (see the Risk Assessment Matrix). The external position is vulnerable to a slowdown in
trading partners’ growth and terms-of-trade shocks. Moreover, the heightened vulnerabilities have
subjected the outlook to considerable uncertainty. Policy slippage beyond an already weak baseline
scenario could raise near-term pressures on the balance of payments and inflation, and further
deplete international reserves. This would bring into question the sustainability of the exchange rate
anchor, domestic banking sector soundness, and undermine the prospects for high-quality growth
and attaining middle-income status by 2020.


External spillovers. A deeper-than-expected slowdown in China, Thailand, and Vietnam could
weaken nonresource exports and foreign investment flows to Lao P.D.R. A sharp slowdown in
China, in particular, could depress world mineral prices and neighbors’ electricity demand,
putting further pressure on Lao P.D.R.’s fiscal revenue, export earnings, international reserves,
and the exchange rate, raising concerns over external debt sustainability.



Financial sector risks. A deterioration of banks’ asset quality would erode capital, which could
become future contingent liabilities for the state. In the most adverse scenario—assessed to be
of medium likelihood—a loss of confidence in the domestic banking system could be
precipitated by a large loss of international reserves and sudden currency devaluation. The initial
impact would be limited for dollarized economic entities, but the degrees of currency mismatch
in the balance sheets of the economic sectors remain unknown. Given the elevated external debt
position and considerable foreign currency lending, credit risks would increase. The impact on
business, bank, and household balance sheets would be difficult to endure, also putting into
doubt the sustainability of public debt.



Fiscal risks. The pressure to meet social spending targets or respond to natural disasters in the
presence of higher public sector wage bills could weaken the fiscal position more than already
expected. This could worsen the public debt dynamics, and give rise to larger off-budget capital
spending and more contingent liabilities down the road. The pressure for financing could further
undermine the BOL’s monetary control.

11.
Authorities’ view. There was broad agreement that the medium-term outlook for Lao P.D.R.
remains generally favorable, but the growing vulnerabilities, including low international reserves
cover, have significantly raised the uncertainty around the near-term outlook. The authorities noted
that international reserves coverage remains around 2½ months of officially reported nonresource
imports, which are significantly lower than trading partners’ export data that staff uses. While the
authorities share concerns about regional spillovers, terms-of-trade, and fiscal risks, they
emphasized the ongoing efforts to contain financial sector risks, pointing to the slowly declining
credit growth and efforts to ensure that lending is channeled toward productive use. The authorities
would continue to monitor financial market conditions closely for signs of distress. Moreover, they
expressed confidence that international reserves would rise toward the end of 2013 from scheduled
foreign banks’ registered capital increase and domestic foreign currency debt repayment to the BOL.

ENGINEERING A SOFT LANDING
12.
Key policy recommendations. The tightening of fiscal and monetary policies is an urgent
priority for reducing external and financial sector vulnerabilities, replenishing international reserves,
and restoring macroeconomic stability to ensure high and sustainable medium-term growth.
Success will require an acceptance that the short-term growth outcome could be lower than the
8 percent annual target. Fiscal policy needs to be put back on a consolidation path during the next
few years. This will require improving tax collection by broadening the tax base, eliminating
exemptions, and possibly a VAT tax rate increase, while rationalizing expenditure to concentrate on
priority social spending and investments and postpone further civil service pay increases. Given the
extent of the estimated real effective exchange rate overvaluation and loss of external
competitiveness, the kip nominal exchange rate should be allowed to move in line with market
conditions with a view toward enhancing competitiveness and gradually building up international
reserves. The credit and M2 growth targets should be lowered to contain inflation. Financial sector
supervision will need to be strengthened and regulatory measures put in place to reduce leverage
and balance sheet mismatches. If implemented, this mutually supporting policy package would
result in lower near-term growth than staff’s baseline projection, but it would also reduce current
vulnerabilities and enhance macroeconomic and financial sector resiliency, supporting robust,
sustainable medium-term growth.
13.
Authorities’ view. The authorities attached great importance to achieving Vision 2020, and
were receptive to staff’s call for policy tightening. They indicated that the bulk of near-term
adjustments would be borne by fiscal policy, and have undertaken action to boost revenue as well
as limit capital spending and civil service compensation increase. There is room for the USD/kip
exchange rate to move within the current band, in line with market conditions and external
developments. The credit and broad money growth targets would be lowered as public investment
demand softens going forward.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

A. Fiscal Policy
14.
Deficit targets. Fiscal consolidation is essential to reduce excess demand, credit growth,
and the current account deficit. It will also enable capital to be put to more efficient use, which in
turn will enhance the resiliency of the financial system. Staff recommends a medium-term budget
strategy that is anchored around a nonmining fiscal deficit target of no more than 5 percent of GDP
starting in FY2013/14 to reduce public debt to 40 percent of GDP by 2020. In the process, the saving
of mining revenue will help ensure a smooth expenditure path and a comfortable level of
government deposits. The authorities’ announced plans are, however, less ambitious—the
nonmining deficit would fall from 6½ percent of GDP in FY2013/14 below 5 percent of GDP only by
FY2017/18 under staff’s baseline projection.
15.
Expenditures. Staff recognizes the need for an increase in civil service pay to compensate
for cost-of-living increases, enhance competitiveness with the private sector, especially in health and
education, and to combat graft. But containing overheating pressures and ensuring fiscal
sustainability will require a more measured pace of future compensation increases. Moreover, there
is an urgent need for progress on civil service reform and for rationalizing other spending to reduce
the burden on the budget. In addition to controlling nonwage current expenditures, the government
should also trim capital spending in FY2013/14 to the average level of the previous two years
(equivalent to 7 percent of 2014 GDP) and draw up a plan to eliminate arrears. This would also be
more in line with implementation capacity, reduce off-budget financing, and enhance monetary
discipline. Public sector financial management reforms are needed to enhance control over
spending and efficiency at all levels of government.
16.
Revenues. Meeting the authorities’ deficit target over the next few years would require
raising revenue (excluding grants) from about 18 percent of GDP to at least 19½ percent of GDP by
2015. This will require an additional tax effort of 1–1½ percent of GDP, which can be achieved by
moving decisively on ongoing reforms of the tax system and administration. Specifically, these will
require efforts to simplify the tax system and enhance compliance, including a simplification to the
VAT system, profit tax rate unification across firms, the introduction of a lump-sum tax for small
businesses, as well as taxes on property value, and increases in petrol and vehicle excise duties.
Building on recent IMF TA recommendations, the government should also reform customs and
natural resources revenue administration, and the management of large taxpayers. To achieve staff’s
recommended fiscal consolidation, however, a VAT rate increase (from the current 10 percent) may
also be needed starting in the emerging fiscal year.
17.
Authorities’ view. The authorities acknowledged that the fiscal expansion from public
sector pay increases in FY2012/13 was sharper than they originally expected and posed serious risks
to macroeconomic stability. While the near-term focus would be on addressing liquidity challenges,
the government also recognized the need to formulate a comprehensive medium-term budget
strategy and impose stricter expenditure control. Action has been taken to contain domestically
financed current and capital spending, broaden the tax base, limit tax exemptions for new
investment contracts as well as for imports of vehicles and fuel, reduce off-budget spending, and
pay down wage arrears. The authorities also recognized that revenue mobilization would have to go

11

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

hand in hand with technology and staff capacity, which would take time to improve. With these
measures in place, they believed that the headline fiscal deficit would not exceed 5 percent of GDP
on average over the medium term.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
18.
Exchange rate management. Staff continues to support the use of the USD/Kip exchange
rate anchor within a band, which is reasonably wide and adjustable annually. However, to maintain
this nominal anchor, especially during a turbulent period when the US Federal Reserve is expected
to exit from unconventional monetary policy, the BOL will need to: (i) make full use of exchange rate
flexibility in line with market conditions with a view toward building a considerably larger
international reserves cushion; and (ii) tighten domestic monetary conditions. These measures will
lessen the need for tighter administrative measures, such as limits on commercial bank supply of
foreign exchange, which could undermine the confidence in the kip and fuel one-way depreciation
expectations, potentially reversing de-dollarization gains (Box 4).
19.
Monetary policy. Given that output is

of quasi-fiscal lending operations to local
government entities and SOEs. It will be
important to ensure access to bank reserves (including foreign currency) through BOL facilities and
interbank borrowing to avoid financial market disruption. In tandem, the BOL should raise interest
rates at its lending facilities. Over the medium term, interest rates should play a central role in
monetary policy conduct. Toward that end, staff encourages the BOL to make use of technical
assistance to help strengthen the monetary policy framework, liquidity forecasting and liquidity
management, and interbank market development.
20.
Authorities’ view. The BOL agreed with the need to allow the exchange rate to adjust
flexibly within the current band to preserve international reserves. In their view, as international
reserves are expected to increase by end-year, the current foreign currency liquidity shortage should
be temporary, and the resulting parallel market premium is unrepresentative of market expectations.
With the government already committed to stop borrowing for new development projects and
eschew from central bank deficit financing, monetary discipline will be enhanced and credit
expansion should be weaker in 2014.

Box 4. De-dollarizing the Lao P.D.R. Economy
Substantial progress made. Over the past decade, Lao P.D.R has made substantial gains in de-dollarization.
The dollarization rate, as measured by foreign currency deposits as a ratio of broad money, declined from
76% in 2000 to 43% in 2012, far outperforming regional comparator countries. The decline in the
dollarization rate is consistent with a significant improvement in macroeconomic stability. In particular,
inflation has fallen markedly, from a peak of 128% in 1999, to an average of around 5% in 2005–12.
Confidence in the Kip has increased, as suggested by the uptrend in both the NEER and the REER over the
past five years. The authorities have also actively taken measures to promote Kip usage.

Further de-dollarization requires sustained macroeconomic stability. International experience shows
that reversing dollarization is a protracted process, requiring sustained prudent macroeconomic policies.
Countries such as Israel and Poland that have been identified in the literature as having successfully dedollarized with minimal side effects and capital flight have implemented and persisted in economic
stabilization programs. Conversely, countries that exhibited repeated bouts of high inflation over the past
decade generally have been less successful in reducing dollarization rates.
Risks associated with dollarization. A partially dollarized financial system carries with it specific risks. First,
banks will not be able to accommodate persistent withdrawals of foreign currency deposits, given limited
holdings of liquid foreign assets, and the central bank’s ability to act as a lender of last resort in these events
is constrained. Second, vulnerabilities may result from currency mismatches in banks’ balance sheets, as
borrowers’ currency mismatches could expose banks to foreign currency-induced credit risk.
Risk mitigation. To mitigate these risks, robust banking sector supervision and higher international reserves
are required. In addition to measures that limit currency mismatches on bank balance sheets and moving
towards risk-based supervision, the central bank should have sufficient foreign exchange reserves to forestall
a run on foreign currency deposits.

C. Bank Supervision and Prudential Policies
21.
Achievements and challenges. The entry of new foreign and private banks in recent years
has brought in technical skills, expanded access to banking services, and helped create a more
commercially oriented banking sector. The depth of the financial system has increased significantly,
but financial access by small and medium enterprises remains limited. The existing body of the law is
reasonably constructed to provide for appropriate supervisory authorities and sound commercial
bank requirements. External auditing requirements have been introduced, and a depositor
protection system established. That said, much work remains to build a resilient financial sector.
Given that financial activities are driven largely by the government’s development objectives, there
are concerns that supervision and regulatory enforcement and bank risk management practices
could be compromised. Furthermore, weaknesses remain in the regulatory framework, in particular
the lack of a clear and uniformly applied accounting framework and an effective and prompt debt
resolution process.
22.
Strengthening financial supervision. Staff reiterates the need to ensure that the pace of
financial deepening is in line with progress in regulatory and supervisory capacity. At this stage, a
more rigorous application and enforcement of laws and regulations is needed to ensure consistent
compliance. To reduce balance sheet vulnerabilities, staff supports the BOL’s strict monitoring of
banks’ compliance with the regulation on net open foreign exchange positions, as well as enforcing
the limits on foreign currency lending to borrowers without sufficient foreign currency income.
Furthermore, the BOL’s requirement for banks to publish their balance sheets online should be
enforced, and financial soundness indicators should be updated and complete. In addition to the
required increase in commercial banks’ registered capital, which will be completed in 2014, riskier
banks should be required to maintain higher capital-to-asset (CAR) ratios than the minimum
mandated CAR of 8 percent. This measure would also contribute to leverage control. More urgently,
under-capitalized banks should not continue to increase their loan portfolios, and potentially incur
additional risk. In this light, a prompt corrective action framework should be developed. It will also
be critical to develop a forward looking, risk-based approach to supervision to identify and mitigate
emerging risks at an early stage. Staff also urges the BOL to prepare a contingency plan for the
banking sector in the event of financial distress, and enhance the size and operational readiness of
the Depositor Protection Fund. Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to move forward on the
Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Law to address
deficiencies identified by the Financial Action Task Force during the upcoming fiscal year, and
continues to encourage their participation in an FSAP.
23.
Authorities’ view. The authorities agreed with staff’s overall assessment and
recommendations, although the plan to require riskier banks to maintain higher CAR than the
regulatory minimum would need to be considered carefully. They noted that internal CAMEL-based
financial soundness indicators point to a generally sound banking system. Furthermore, the BOL has
already started to tackle some of the supervisory weaknesses raised by staff, including strengthening
the loan origination process based on income flow projection as well as collateral, and will receive

resiliency.

26.
A statistical strategy for growth. Modernizing and upgrading the quality and
comprehensiveness of economic and financial sector data is a key priority. Data weaknesses have
obstructed monitoring and analysis of risks, and led to shortcomings in policy formulation and
policy evaluation. Staff welcomes the government’s commitment to implement the Strategies for the
Development of the National Statistical System, and the intention to collaborate with the IMF in
moving Lao’s macroeconomic statistics closer to the international standards, including using the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in compiling and disseminating data.

in access to markets. Even though the Gini coefficient is
still low compared to regional emerging markets, inequality has increased substantially since 1990.
Determinants. Overall, rapid economic growth has benefited the poor. Major drivers of poverty reduction include
liberalization of the private sector, which increased access to markets for trade and employment, increasing access
to electricity, and expansion of the road network. Increased integration with regional neighbors benefited a
significant part of the population, especially those along the regions bordering Thailand, China, Myanmar and
Cambodia. Rural poverty reduction lags behind largely due to fewer livelihood options, and pockets of urban
poverty are emerging. The benefits of growth have been especially limited to those in geographically
disadvantaged areas.
Policy focus. The Seventh National Socio-Economic Development Plan (2011–2015) has a strong focus on
sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction, and the government is making efforts to tackle disparities.
Strategies include providing basic infrastructure and services in remote areas, improving skills of local populations,
providing incentives to government workers serving in remote areas, promoting measures to improve food
security and nutrition in the uplands, supporting Farmer Organizations, and increasing the commercialization of
the agriculture sector. The government is also taking special measures to address concerns about the threat facing
rural livelihoods as agricultural lands are converted into land used for FDI projects. For example, the government
has established special revenue-sharing arrangements for the Nam Theun II Hydroelectric Project (funds for health,
education, rural infrastructure and environment) and direct intervention schemes (e.g., funds for village poverty
eradication and small entrepreneurs in the poorest districts).
Challenges. At the national level, reform of education and training systems are necessary to develop wellfunctioning labor markets that meet investors’ needs and long-term economic goals. Targeted interventions are
needed for the poorest groups, where the lack of access to infrastructure, markets and services remain barriers to
growth and poverty reduction. These interventions should include specific strategies to increase access to
resources and markets, health insurance, and ensuring long-term investments in education and skills training. As
human development and gender relations are structurally different across ethnic groups, policies should be
tailored to specific needs, capabilities and gender gaps.

driver of growth, with government support, especially in the areas of agriculture and tourism. The
strategy for growth will increasingly rely on fostering human capital through investment in health
and education, spotlighting on expanding networks of rural health clinics and vocational training to
anticipate future labor market demand. Decisions on public investment would be based more on
expected social returns and reducing wastefulness. Moreover, the authorities realize the importance
of high-quality and timely statistics in realizing Vision 2020, and the need for producing and
disseminating these statistics in line with the international guidelines. They intend to make more use
of IMF TA in national accounts, prices, government finance statistics, monetary and financial
statistics, and balance of payments statistics.

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Outlook and risks. Lao P.D.R. continues to make impressive development progress, and
medium-term prospects remain favorable. The near-term outlook, however, is clouded by growing
vulnerabilities induced by current macroeconomic policies, particularly the pressures from public
sector employee compensation which is already well above the LIC average. These heightened
vulnerabilities have manifested themselves in the recent fiscal stress and foreign currency liquidity
shortage. Inflation pressures are expected to persist over the next two years. The current account
deficit is expected to widen in 2013–14, and although FDI inflows should remain vigorous, reserve
levels would remain inadequate. A deterioration of banks’ asset quality from excessive credit growth
could erode capital, raising concerns about domestic banking sector soundness. In addition to these
policy-induced risks, the external position is also vulnerable to a slowdown in trading partners’
growth and terms of trade shocks.
29.
The time to act is now. These escalating pressures argue forcefully for the immediate
tightening of fiscal and monetary policies to support the exchange rate anchor, replenish
international reserves, build up fiscal buffers, and guide the economy toward a soft landing. To shift
firmly toward a more sustainable growth path, the authorities would need to accept a more
moderate near-term growth outcome than under the baseline projection. After macroeconomic
stability is restored, continued institutional reforms to enhance private sector-led competition will
lead to higher productivity and broader-based growth over time.
30.
Fiscal policy. The commitment to fiscal consolidation is central to restoring macroeconomic
stability. It would also bolster Lao P.D.R.’s moderate risk of external debt distress status and its
ability to absorb future shocks. Communicating this commitment clearly will send a strong signal to
investors, and facilitate future external debt issuance. Staff supports the authorities’ determination
to formulate a comprehensive medium-term budget strategy. This strategy should be anchored
around a nonmining fiscal deficit target of no more than 5 percent of GDP starting from the current
fiscal year to lower public debt to 40 percent of GDP by 2020. This target, which requires further
tightening efforts, will help reduce near-term inflation and balance-of-payments pressures. In
addition to measures to improve tax collection, which the authorities have started, staff would
support a VAT rate increase. A political consensus is also needed to moderate the pace of future
compensation increases and implement civil service reform. This would restore the fiscal space

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

necessary for adequate level of capital and human development spending, including for paying
down arrears related to public investment and poverty reduction outlays.
31.
Monetary and exchange rate policy. The authorities’ commitment to maintaining a
stabilized exchange rate within a reasonably wide and adjustable band has contributed to increased
confidence in the kip and de-dollarization efforts during the past decade. This exchange rate anchor
now needs to be bolstered by tighter macroeconomic policies. Moreover, given the extent of the
estimated real exchange rate overvaluation, the kip should be allowed to move in line with market
conditions with a view toward gradually building up international reserves to four months of import
cover. This exchange rate strategy along with the lower credit and broad money growth targets
amid tighter fiscal policy will enhance financial sector resiliency and restore macroeconomic stability.
To achieve a lower credit growth target, it will be necessary to mop up excess kip liquidity in the
financial system, accelerate the unwinding of quasi-fiscal lending operations, and raise policy
interest rates. In addition, the BOL should continue to reduce currency mismatch on the balance
sheets of banks and their borrowers.
32.
Financial supervision. Efforts to strengthen financial supervision should be intensified, with
regulatory measures put in place to reduce leverage. All banks should be required to achieve the
minimum mandated CAR of 8 percent, with riskier banks required to maintain higher CARs. The BOL
should develop detailed plans to address supervisory weaknesses as well as a crisis contingency plan
for the banking sector, and seek sustained technical assistance. Over time, these efforts along with a
clear and uniformly applied accounting framework and an effective and prompt debt resolution
process will help foster a resilient financial system. The IMF is ready to provide further technical
assistance and training on financial stability and crisis management frameworks, as well as stress
testing, and encourages the authorities’ participation in an FSAP.
33.
Sustainable and inclusive growth. The authorities’ achievement in poverty reduction and
progress toward MDGs is laudable. The focus on upgrading health and education infrastructure is
the right one, and will contribute toward reducing inequality. Public sector financial management
reforms will be crucial to improve the quality of public spending, and the IMF stands ready to
provide technical assistance in this area. Looking forward, international trade integration will
promote economic competition, which will in turn improve the business climate, promote
institutional reform, statistical upgrades, and offer potential to make growth more productivitydriven and broader-based.

Appendix 1. Lao P.D.R.: Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) 1/
Risk
Protracted economic and
financial volatility,
especially for emerging
markets (triggered by
prospective exit from UMP).

Likelihood
High
Prospects of higher interest
rates in advanced
economies could trigger a
sustained reversal of capital
flows from the region,
intensifying foreign
currency liquidity strains.

Potential Impact
Medium
Pressure on international
reserves and the exchange
rate, with effects on balance
sheets, and potentially, a
reacceleration of
dollarization.

Policy Response
Allow the currency to
depreciate and refrain from
domestic demand stimulus
to preserve limited
international reserves and
contain inflation.

Lower than anticipated
emerging market growth
potential (earlier maturing
of the cycle and incomplete
structural reforms with
spillovers to LICs and
advanced economies).

Medium
Growth relies to a large
extent on trade and FDI
links with other Asian
countries, particularly
China, Thailand and
Vietnam.

Allow the currency to
depreciate and avoid
stimulating domestic
demand to preserve limited
external buffers and contain
inflation. Over time, take
advantage of WTO to
diversify export
destinations.

Loss of confidence in the
domestic banking system
caused by a sharp loss of
international reserves.

Medium
International reserves are
low and expansionary
monetary and fiscal policies
threaten to deplete them
further.

Medium
Slowdown in trading
partner growth will put
pressure on the balance of
payments as exports
decline and domestic
demand continues to be
stimulated by expansionary
policies. Could lead to
further pressure on
exchange rate and
international reserves.
High
Loss of confidence in the
currency leading to
currency substitution,
capital flight and exchange
rate pressure, with effects
on bank and corporate
balance sheets and a
prolonged downturn in
growth.

Terms-of-trade shock
(particularly declining
global copper and gold
prices).

Medium
Growth relies on exports of
commodities and imports
of intermediate goods and
petroleum products.

Medium
Pressure on the balance of
payments, exchange rate
and international reserves.

Reversal of fiscal
consolidation

Medium
Pressure for greater
spending and response to
external shocks or natural
disasters could lead to an
increase in the debt ratio.

Medium
Crowding out of public and
private productive
investments and social
spending, and
overvaluation of the real
exchange rate could lead to
a slower or stagnating
growth in the mediumterm.

Increase exchange rate
flexibility and avoid
stimulating domestic
demand to preserve limited
international reserves; Over
time, diversify exports.
Continue fiscal
consolidation, improve
nonmining revenue
collection, and rationalize
expenditure, with a focus
on fostering physical and
human capital.

Activate banking sector
contingency plan, including
depositor protection. Inject
kip liquidity to solvent
banks. Preserve
international reserves by
allowing the currency to
depreciate and limiting
fiscal expansion. Strengthen
banking supervision.

1/ Assumes no policy response to external shocks. The RAM shows events that could materially alter the baseline
path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s
subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below
10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 percent and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or
more). The RAM reflects staff views on the sources of risks and the overall level of concern as of the time of
discussion with the authorities.

Lao P.D.R.’s risk of debt distress remains moderate.2 Although all external debt distress
indicators remain below the policy-dependent indicative thresholds during the projection
period under the baseline scenario, the thresholds are breached in the presence of certain
shocks. Compared to last year’s DSA, the PV of external debt to GDP ratio is closer to the
threshold, leaving few buffers in case of any adverse shock. Also, while debt service ratios
remain within the policy-dependent indicative thresholds, primarily because of the high
level of concessionality of official borrowing, composition of concessional funds is
expected to shift away from grants and towards loans at lower levels of concessionality.
Since the country might rely more on loans with commercial terms as it graduates from
the low-income status, it will be necessary for the authorities to strengthen fiscal
management, upgrade debt and cash management capacity, and scale upwards the
country’s public investment management capacity.

This DSA has been prepared by IMF and World Bank staffs, in consultation with the Lao P.D.R. authorities.

The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and
institutions allow countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels for debt indicators
are policy-dependent. In the LIC-DSF, the quality of a country’s policies and institutions is measured by the
World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index and classified into three categories:
strong, medium, and weak. Lao P.D.R.’s policies and institutions, as measured by the CPIA, averaged 3.34 over
the past 3 years. Since its average CPIA index has been above 3.25 for two years in a row, Lao P.D.R.’s policy
performance remains classified as medium according to the “Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the
Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-income Countries”
(www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2010/012210.pdf). Therefore, the relevant indicative thresholds for this
category are: 40 percent for the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 150 percent for the PV of debt-to-exports ratio,
250 percent for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 20 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and
20 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are applicable to public and publicly
guaranteed external debt.

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

BACKGROUND
1.
The 2012 Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) reclassified Lao P.D.R.’s risk of debt distress
from high to moderate.3 This change was mainly driven by the enhancement in Lao P.D.R.’s Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index, which raised the indicative debt distress thresholds
significantly while the debt dynamics remained largely unchanged from the 2011 DSA.
2.
This LIC DSA for Lao P.D.R.
continues to classify the risk of debt
distress as moderate. Lao P.D.R.’s CPIA
index continued to improve slightly in 2012,
thus the classification of its policy
performance stays moderate and the
indicative debt distress thresholds remain the
same as in the 2012 DSA. All external debt
distress indicators stay below policydependent indicative thresholds during the
projection period under baseline
assumptions.

3.
Lao P.D.R.’s external public and publically-guaranteed(PPG) debt remains elevated
compared to other LICs in Asia, and the debt level has been rising since 2012. The nominal stock of
external PPG debt increased from US$3.7 billion in 2011 to US$4.2 billion in 2012, mainly due to rapid
increase in borrowing from China and Thailand. As a result, even with high real GDP growth and the kip’s
appreciation vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, the PPG external debt-to-GDP ratio climbed from 44.8 percent of GDP
to 46.1 percent of GDP in 2012. The corresponding net present value (PV) of debt at end-2012 was
32.5 percent of GDP, up from 29.8 percent of GDP in 2011.
4.
The high level of concessionality of official borrowing helps keep the external debt service
ratios at manageable levels, with public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) external debt stock indicators
expected to remain below the policy-dependent indicative thresholds throughout the entire projection
period under the baseline scenario. However, the PV of debt to GDP ratio is very close to its safety
threshold in the near term. Shocks to the domestic and external environment or excessively loose
macroeconomic policies could easily push the stock of external public debt beyond sustainable levels, with
some debt distress indicators breaching their respective thresholds under certain stress tests.4 In this regard,
debt dynamics are most sensitive to large depreciation of the kip relatively to baseline in 2014, as external
debt is predominantly denominated in foreign currency.
3

See the joint IMF-WB DSA for 2012: IMF Country Report No.12/286.

4

Stress tests include sharp exchange rate depreciation, more adverse terms of additional foreign financing, and
reductions in GDP growth among others shocks.

for 47 percent of total external debt. The
on nonconcessional terms
importance of bilateral creditors has increased
significantly vis-à-vis multilateral creditors. Although small, the share of nonconcessional external PPG debt
has increased steadily in the last several years, standing at 6.7 percent in 2012. This increase resulted from
heavy investments in hydropower and electricity generation projects, including the need by the public
sector to finance its equity stakes in these investment projects.
6.
The rising external debt to GDP ratio underscores the need to strengthen debt management
capacity. It is particularly important to ensure that debt sustainability considerations are taken into account
when new debt is contracted, especially given that the country will rely more on external loans with market
terms as it is graduating from low income status. Additional external borrowing to finance infrastructure
mega-projects, for example, could easily push the debt-to-GDP ratio over the indicative debt stress
threshold, potentially jeopardizing debt sustainability. A mitigating factor for Lao P.D.R.’s external debt
burden lies in the prospective returns on the hydropower and mining projects that have been financed in
part by external PPG debt. The long-term power purchase agreements that are signed for these projects
and the resulting government revenues in the form of royalties, dividends, and profit tax payments
arguably reduce the risk of debt distress in the long run. However, many of these projects face construction
and implementation challenges, and will not generate significant return in the near term.
7.
Recorded domestic public debt rose to 15.8 percent of GDP in 2012, up from 8.9 percent of
GDP in 2011. The Bank of the Lao P.D.R. (BoL) continued to disburse loans to finance local government’s
off-budget infrastructure projects. Lending from the BOL to local governments represents about half of the
recorded total domestic debt, with the remainder including government bonds related to the
recapitalization of state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs). Total domestic and external PPG debt stood at
61.8 percent of GDP in 2012, up from 56.2 percent the year before. This increase is related to a more
expansionary fiscal policy in 2012 including central government financing of large public investment
projects. The stock of BOL loans to local governments is projected to peak in the near future as these
quasi-fiscal operations are phased out.

2013 before reverting toward
potential of about 7½ percent in the medium term. With economic activity expanding beyond potential
and a further increase in public employee payrolls in 2013–15, price pressures are expected to increase.
Consumer price inflation is projected to be around 7 percent on average in the medium term.
9.
However, the baseline projects significant deterioration in medium-term external and fiscal
position compared to the 2012 DSA. Due to the surge of imports and weaker export growth momentum
in 2012, the current account deficit widened significantly to 28.4 percent of GDP from 15.5 percent of GDP
in 2011, and is expected to further deteriorate to 29.5 percent of GDP in 2013. The fiscal position in
FY2012/13 also deteriorated significantly due to high financing of off-budget public investment projects
and public sector compensation increase. Over the long run, the baseline path of the fiscal positions has
worsened compared to the 2012 DSA due to continued expansionary fiscal policy.
10.
As a result, a higher level of external financing is assumed. To meet the country’s financing
needs, higher level of new borrowing is projected. This is consistent with the authorities’ disbursement
projection over 2013-2018. The external financing is assumed to remain largely on concessional terms over
the medium term. In the long run, as Lao P.D.R. graduates from low-income country status, grant financing
is expected to decline relative to loans from bilateral creditors as well as from commercial sources, and thus
the share of commercial external PPG debt is projected to rise over the long term. It is worth noting that as
the domestic financial market deepens, the private sector will be able to rely more on domestic financing,
lowering the needs for foreign borrowing. This would bring down the share of external private debt in total
external debt, which, along with declining overall external debt stock in percent of GDP, would reduce the
contribution from nominal interest rate in the longer run.

A. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
11.
The PV of the external debt-to-GDP ratio remains below the policy-dependent indicative
thresholds during the projection period under baseline conditions (Figure 1 and Table 1), but is much

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

higher than in previous DSA and is very close to the thresholds in the near term. This change is driven
by the higher debt stock at end-2012, as well as projected higher new borrowing because Lao P.D.R.’s
current account deficit is expected to narrow only gradually over the projection period. Similar to last year’s
DSA, all three external debt stock indicators are projected to remain more or less flat until about 2018, as
large projected disbursements are expected to be counteracted by a combination of debt repayment and
high GDP growth during the next several years. In line with the previous DSA, debt service ratios under the
baseline scenario are projected to fall below policy-dependent thresholds during the projection period.
12.
Exchange rate movements and shocks to the cost of new loans present the most important
risks to external debt sustainability. Table 3 and Figure 1 illustrate how a one-off 30 percent depreciation
of the kip vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar would lead to a sharp rise in the PV of debt-to-GDP and the PV of debtto-revenues. In both cases the policy-dependent thresholds are breached. A rise in the cost of additional
financing (by 200 basis points relative to the baseline) would increase the PV of debt-to-exports ratio by
around 29 percentage points in the long run relative to the baseline. However, even under this extreme
scenario, there would be no breaches of the corresponding threshold.
13.
Debt dynamics continue to be markedly worse under an alternative scenario in which key
variables are either set at their historical averages or subject to shocks, such as one-time exchange
rate depreciation and a temporary decline in FDI inflows. Through 2016, debt dynamics are more
favorable under this historical scenario—which takes into account the appreciation of the kip relative to the
U.S. dollar experienced during 2003–2012.5 In later years, however, this effect is outweighed by the higher
historical average of the current account deficit (16 percent of GDP compared to 9.4 percent of GDP in the
baseline), and the lower historical average for FDI (5.1 percent of GDP compared to 9.3 percent of GDP in
the baseline). The historical scenario thus assumes around 9 percentage points of GDP more in debt
accumulation than the baseline, putting Lao P.D.R. on an unsustainable path in the long run. Therefore, a
negative shock to FDI in Lao P.D.R. would force it to reduce substantially its current account deficit in order
to avoid external debt distress.
14.
An illustrative scenario involving a high-speed railway megaproject linking Lao P.D.R. and
China shows that the country’s debt sustainability indicators would breach their indicative policydependent thresholds. Under this scenario: (1) the additional external borrowing amounts to
US$ 6.7 billion over 5 years (adding to US$ 1.34 billion per annum), starting in 2014; (2) the financing terms
are: 2 percent fixed rate debt, with 20-year maturity, 10-year grace period, and loan denominated in USD;
and (3) a fiscal multiplier of 0.5 during the construction period.6 As a result, the overall external PPG debt
would peak at around 80 percent of GDP in 2022, and exceed 60 percent of GDP for the next decade, while
the total external debt would surpass 125 percent of GDP in 2014, and remain above the 100 percent mark
for the next decade. Also, the ratio of debt service to revenue exceeds the 20 percent threshold in 2021 and
remains elevated for the entire projection period.

The kip appreciated 2.4 percent per year on average during this period.

This value is an upper bound given a heavy reliance on imported inputs.

Box 1. Baseline Scenario—Underlying Assumptions (2012–32)
The baseline macroeconomic framework assumes that the economy is overheating due to expansionary fiscal and
monetary policies. Although long-term growth is still anchored by the vigorous energy production sector,
vulnerabilities have heightened.
Real GDP growth is projected to average 7.8 percent during 2013–18. The near-term outlook is spurred by the
fiscal expansion, real GDP growth is projected to rise to 8.2 percent in 2013 before reverting toward potential of
about 7½ percent in the medium term. This outlook depends on continued accommodative monetary policy,
rising public sector employee compensation, vigorous resource-related FDI inflows, rising electricity demand from
neighboring countries, and a gradual pickup of investment inflows into nonresource sectors following Lao P.D.R.’s
recent WTO accession. Over the longer term, assumed structural reforms would create a better environment for
private investment, broadening the sources of growth. Real GDP is expected to moderate to 6.7 percent on
average during 2019–33, as production in the resource sector reaches maturity. Over time, the share of agriculture
in GDP is expected to decline, as the transition to a market based economy is accompanied by the rising
importance of the industry and services sectors. Graduation from low-income status could be achieved in the
second half of the projection period.
Inflation is projected to average about 6.5 percent in 2013, and reaches 7.5 percent in 2014. With economic
activity expanding beyond potential and a further increase in public employee payrolls in 2013–15, price pressures
are expected to increase. Over the medium term, inflation is expected to decline further, but it is projected to
remain above 5 percent until 2018.
The balance of payments continues to be driven by developments in the resource sector, which has an important
bearing both in the current account and the capital and financial account. The current account deficit is expected
to widen to about 29.5 percent of GDP in 2013–14, as the nonresource deficit remains elevated and the resource
deficit temporarily increases before large-scale power projects come on stream in 2015–2016. FDI inflows are
assumed to be vigorous over the next two years, driven by growing investment inflows into both resource and
nonresource sectors following Lao P.D.R.’s recent WTO accession. However, reserve levels would be inadequate by
low-income country (LIC) metrics at less than 1½ months of imports. The current account is projected to improve
over medium and long term, assuming that nonresource exports and services will gradually pick up driven by solid
recovery in advanced economies, strengthened regional integration, supported by improvements in the
investment climate, streamlining of business regulations, and the prevalence of trade commitments.
External financing is assumed to remain on largely concessional terms over the medium term. In the long-run,
however, grant financing decreases with economic development.

Multilateral creditors: Projected loan disbursements in the medium term are relatively low, since IDA
and AsDB have a pipeline of operations financed on grant terms. Over the longer term, project loans are assumed
to increase moderately.

Bilateral creditors: For 2013–18, project loan disbursements also increase, as donors provide support to
the government’s development agenda. Over the medium and longer term, greater participation by new emerging
market creditors results in an increased role for bilateral finance, including for lending to state-owned enterprises.

Commercial creditors: Over the medium term, commercial disbursements are relatively small, principally
used to finance a portion of the government’s equity stake participation in the new hydropower projects. In
addition, the initiative of bond issuance in Thailand market is incorporated in the DSA assumptions. A 50-million
USD bond was issued in 2013, and two 100-million USD bond issuances are being planned for 2014 and 2015. The
share of commercial loans in total PPG external debt has risen in 2012, and is expected to continue rising over the
long term as the country becomes more market-based.
Fiscal policy is projected to be expansionary in the near term, and then shift back to the consolidation path. The
primary deficit is projected to peak at 4.3 percent of GDP in 2013, up from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2012, then
decline gradually to around 1.3 percent of GDP in 2018. Over the long-term the primary deficit is expected to
stabilize at around 2 percent as improvements in nonmining revenue collection are counteracted by declines in
mining and resource related revenue, while expenditure remains constant as a percent of GDP.
Domestic debt decreases over the medium term driven by repayments of the lending to local governments from
the BOL. In the long term, net external finance declines relative to GDP, and a larger share of budget deficits is
financed domestically, pushing domestic debt to higher but sustainable levels.

B. Public Sector Debt Sustainability
15.
In line with the previous DSA’s projections, the PV of total PPG debt in percent of GDP and
in percent of revenue are both projected to decline markedly over the long run under baseline
assumptions (Figure 2 and Table 2). Domestic debt is expected to peak at 17.3 percent of GDP in 2016,
rising from 15.8 percent of GDP in 2012. This is driven by the worsening fiscal position related to large
increases in public employee remuneration. Domestic debt is projected to decline starting in 2017.
Accordingly, the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio is also projected to decline starting in 2017, as revenue
administration reforms take hold and expenditure control is maintained after the large increases in public
employee remuneration.
16.
Public debt ratios are particularly sensitive to a depreciation of the kip over the medium
term (Figure 2 and Table 4). Similar to the results in last year’s DSA, a 30 percent depreciation of the kip
against the US dollar in 2014 would immediately raise the PV of public debt-to-GDP and the PV of public
debt-to-revenue. While the debt service-to-revenue ratio is relatively stable under the baseline scenario, it
would increase permanently by a substantial margin if the kip were to depreciate sharply. It should be
noted that this scenario is likely to overstate risks given that a significant share of GDP, including most of
the natural resource GDP, is earned in foreign currency.
17.
The debt ratios are also sensitive to the realization of contingent liabilities. Public investment
projects at the local government level could become liabilities of the central government if projects to do
not perform as expected. While the baseline scenario assumes that the BOL will phase out its quasi-fiscal
lending completely by 2014, there is a risk that these operations could continue.
18.
Alternative scenarios show less positive debt dynamics over the longer term, which
highlights the importance of fiscal consolidation over time. In the historical scenario, where real GDP
growth and the primary balance are at their historical average, the PV of public debt-to-GDP ratio rises
above 39 percent by 2033, while under the baseline, the ratio of the PV of public debt to GDP remains at
around 30 percent in 2033. This is because the projected primary deficit in the baseline is lower (1.9 percent
of GDP in baseline compared to 2.9 percent of GDP in the historical scenario). If the primary balance is fixed
at the level projected for 2013, the PV of debt-to-GDP would be much higher than the baseline in the long
term (55.6 at 2033).

THE AUTHORITIES' VIEWS
19.
The authorities broadly agreed with the overall assessment but emphasized that the debt
service ability should be more important in measuring debt sustainability. They expect better access
to official financial resources which will improve their ability to finance capital needs. On the basis of
information provided by local contracting parties, the authorities anticipated an increase in disbursements
of new funds from some bilateral donors between 2013 and 2018 which has been incorporated into this

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

DSA.7 Since Lao P.D.R. is expected to rely more on commercial funds as it graduates from its low-income
country status, the authorities expect better access to nonconcessional loans in the future, and attach great
importance to fiscal consolidation..
20.
The authorities highlighted that an important part of the external debt is related to viable
large projects in the resource sectors. They believe that resource-related projects will generate high and
stable economic returns upon completion. In addition, the relatively long maturity profile of the loans
would help mitigate the risks of debt distress. Finally, new borrowing to implement large-scale
infrastructure projects is expected to be made without unduly raising debt sustainability concerns.

CONCLUSION
21.
Although the Lao P.D.R.’s risk of debt distress remains moderate, the PV of external PPG
debt to GDP ratio comes very close to the policy-dependent indicative thresholds in the near term.
While the thresholds are not breached by any of the debt distress indicators under baseline scenario, the
PV of debt to GDP ratio approaches the threshold in the near term, driven by the rising debt stock at end2012 as well as higher projected new borrowing in the future due to the expansionary fiscal path, leading
to higher domestic and external financing needs. The buffers in case of any adverse shock are very limited.
22.
Moreover, these results are still sensitive to assumptions regarding investment and
performance of the resource sector, as well as large swings in the exchange rate. The debt dynamics
reflect current and planned large-scale investments in hydropower and mining projects that will only
deliver returns over the medium term. Despite long-term contracts with fixed prices for energy exports to
neighboring countries, Lao P.D.R.’s economy remains exposed in the medium term to fluctuations in
copper and gold prices, as well as to economic developments in its main trading partners (China, Thailand
and Vietnam).8 Lower growth in Lao P.D.R., a weaker balance of payments, and sharp depreciation of the
kip9would worsen debt dynamics significantly. Thus, there is a need to tighten macroeconomic-fiscal
policies to support external debt sustainability. Fiscal policy needs to be put back on a consolidation path
during the next few years. Cautious assessment and monitoring of large-scale projects and private external
debt will be required to mitigate the risks posed to external and public debt sustainability, especially if
some of these projects are financed from commercial sources, such as bonds backed by future revenues.

7

The staff assumes the US$961 million of projected disbursements from China between 2013–2018, which is based
on information provided by the authorities. These disbursements are much larger than the 2012 DSA assumptions
($600 million). Coupled with higher borrowing projection from Thailand, it results in a higher PV of debt to GDP ratio.
However, the debt distress indicators under baseline remain below their policy-dependent thresholds, and thus there
is no material change in the overall assessment of debt distress.

8

In a customized scenario where commodity prices decline by 10 percent in 2013 and 2014, debt stock indicators
breach their policy-dependent thresholds, illustrating the vulnerability of Lao P.D.R. to commodity price shocks.
However, this customized scenario poses less of a threat to debt dynamics than the historical scenario.

23.
To remain sustainable, external borrowing should mostly be obtained on concessional terms
and fiscal and quasi-fiscal liabilities should be carefully managed with a view to establishing buffers
against vulnerabilities. Prudent debt management, cash management, as well as cautious assessment
and monitory of large-scale projects, will be required to mitigate the potential risks of adverse debt
dynamics under stress scenarios. Fiscal risk could arise if these projects fail to generate the expected
returns, including to the government’s own equity stakes. In this light, enhancing the government’s public
investment management capacity will go a long way toward increasing the benefits derived from debtfinanced public investments.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
3/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The de jure arrangement is floating. The kip followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar
within a 2 percent band from mid-April 2013. Therefore, the de facto arrangement is reclassified
retroactively as crawl-like from its previous classification as stabilized, effective April 18, 2013. The
authorities’ objective is to limit currency fluctuations vis-à-vis major currencies, including the
U.S. dollar and Thai baht, within ±5 percent per annum. The Bank of the Lao P.D.R. (BOL) sets a daily
official reference rate, which is calculated as a weighted average of the previous day’s interbank
rates. Commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus are required to maintain their buying and
selling rates within ±0.25 percent of the BOL’s daily reference rate for the U.S. dollar. For the euro
and baht, the buying and selling rates may not exceed a margin of 0.5 percent. For other currencies,
a margin of 2 percent applies.
On May 28, 2010, Lao P.D.R. accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and 4,
following the elimination of one restriction subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII arising
from a requirement to obtain tax payment certificates for some transactions. Lao P.D.R. now
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions, except for restrictions imposed solely for the preservation of
national or international security notified to the Fund pursuant to Decision No. 144-(52/51).
Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation discussions were held in Vientiane during June 26–July 5, 2012 and
were concluded by the Executive Board on August 31, 2012. The staff report (Country Report No.
12/286) was published on October 18, 2012.
Technical Assistance
Over the past three years, Lao P.D.R. has received technical assistance in the areas of customs and
tax revenue administration; price statistics; external sector statistics; and the national accounts. A
new Bangkok-based IMF office that will facilitate technical assistance to Lao P.D.R. as well as
Myanmar was set up in September 2012.
Resident Representative
Mr. Sanjay Kalra assumed the Resident Representative post for Vietnam and Lao P.D.R., based in
Hanoi, on October 16, 2011.

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
The World Bank and the IMF country teams for Lao P.D.R. met on August 30, 2013 to discuss the
economic outlook for Lao P.D.R. and the two teams’ work for FY2014. The teams were led by Ms. Keiko
Miwa (Country Manager, EASPR, World Bank), and Mr. Ashvin Ahuja (IMF Mission Chief for Lao P.D.R.).
The teams agreed that although Lao P.D.R. had made significant progress, macroeconomic policies
have been overly expansionary, resulting in growing macroeconomic and financial sector vulnerabilities.
Prudent fiscal and monetary policies, and a strengthening of policy frameworks, are essential to restore
fiscal buffers, replenish international reserves, and safeguard banking sector soundness. Most urgently,
fiscal policy needs to be put back on a consolidation path over the next few years, which will require
lower growth in civil service compensation as well as reforms to public sector financial management.
In the longer run, a key challenge is to achieve more diversified growth, and ensure that the country’s
natural resource wealth is developed in a sustainable way that benefits the entire population.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
The Asian Development Bank’s (AsDB) current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2012–2016 is
aligned with the government's development strategy (National Socio-Economic Development Plan
(NSEDP, 7th Five-Year Plan)), and seeks to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth and
poverty reduction. The country assistance program evaluation, 2000–09, concluded that the AsDB’s
assistance was successful, relevant, and effective. The CPS is designed to help the government
diversify the economy in a sustainable and inclusive manner through agriculture and natural
resources, education, energy, urban development, and public sector management. The CPS aims to
maximize efficiency and sustainability through larger operations implemented over a longer period;
maximize synergies with the Greater Mekong Subregion program; and increase responsiveness to
emerging issues in a rapidly changing economy. It highlights four thematic areas that will influence
the design and focus of activities, including private sector development, governance, gender equity,
and regional cooperation and integration. The CPS focuses on four core sectors: education,
agriculture and natural resources, water supply and other municipal infrastructure and services, and
energy. Strengthening public sector management is a crosscutting issue, key to efficient and
effective development in Lao P.D.R. The performance-based allocation of the Asian Development
Fund (ADF), based on the country performance assessment (CPA) finalized in 2012, provided
Lao P.D.R. with an ADF allocation in the amount of US$156.01 million for the biennial period
2013–14. The CPA for the next allocation period (2015–2016) will be finalized by the end of 2014.
As of end-2012, cumulative loans/grants approved stood at US$752.94 million, out of which a
cumulative amount of US$313.84 million was awarded for contracts. During 2012, US$68.61 million
were disbursed and US$73.65 million of contracts were awarded. Four new technical assistance (TA)
projects for a total of US$3.8 million were approved in 2012, including project preparation; TA
projects related to the water supply and sanitation project; human resource development strategy;
capacity building TA to strengthen the National Commission for Advancement of Women,
supporting decentralized rural infrastructure and implementing regulatory impact assessment.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance, especially
regarding national accounts, government finance, financial sector and external sector statistics.
These shortcomings are due to a lack of capacity. During the recent Article IV mission, senior staff
from STA held a high level seminar with government officials to discuss a strategy for improving
statistics to support the country’s development goals. A comprehensive technical assistance (TA)
and training program was agreed to address the specific needs, covering the areas of national
accounts, prices, government finance statistics, monetary and financial statistics, and external sector
statistics.
National accounts:
National accounts (NA) comprise annual estimates of GDP by activity at current and constant prices
(base year =2002), broadly following the System of National Accounts (SNA) 1993. The present
methodology for compiling annual GDP by activity at current and constant prices largely uses
outdated indicators and ratios, which has affected the accuracy and the quality of GDP. A program
of surveys has been set up to improve the situation. The Lao Statistics Bureau (LSB) conducted an
economic census in 2012–2013 with the aim of constructing a business register to be used for an
annual establishment survey for NA compilation. Lao P.D.R. participates in the IMF’s Statistics
Department (STA) project to implement the SNA and International Comparison Project (ICP), funded
by the government of Japan, and has received technical assistance (TA) to improve annual national
accounts and develop quarterly national accounts (QNA). Following a February 2013 TA mission
under this project, collection of quarterly data is scheduled to commence in March 2014, and the
LSB plans to implement some methodological improvements at the same time. The first set of QNA
is planned to be released early 2015. GDP by expenditure has not been published since 2005. Based
on advice provided by a December 2011 mission, the LSB has compiled preliminary GDP by
expenditure in current prices for 2007–2011 with 2007 as the base year. Compilation of GDP by
expenditure at constant prices is in progress based on deflators discussed during the February 2013
mission.
Prices statistics:
Lao P.D.R. compiles a monthly CPI (December 2010=100) using weights based on the 2007/08 Lao
Expenditure and Consumption Survey. A monthly producer price index (PPI), which is to be compiled
on a quarterly basis, is currently under development. Its coverage is restricted to mining and
quarrying, manufacturing, and electricity. In the medium term, coverage is to be expanded to
include tourism and construction activities, and in the long term, to include agriculture, services and
other activities.
Government finance statistics: Government finance statistics remain weak. The timeliness of fiscal
reporting needs significant improvement. Off-budget activities are not included in the fiscal data,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

although they have expanded rapidly. Annual budget and outturn data formats do not follow
international standards for government finance statistics. Except for the annual data disseminated in
the Official Gazette, no fiscal data are disseminated in the country. A mission took place during July
2013 to initiate participation in the Government Financial Statistics TA project funded by the
Government of Japan through the Japan Administered Account for Selected IMF activities (JSA) and
to launch an enhanced GFSM2001 compilation system starting with an in-country training workshop
in August 2013.
Monetary statistics: The classification of monetary data by institutional sector and by financial
instrument as well as valuation principles need to be strengthened. The Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs), which embody the IMF-recommended framework for compiling monetary statistics, have yet
to be introduced. The authorities have requested a one-week MFS training mission that is planned for
late January 2014.
External sector statistics:
Data gaps in external sector statistics include the need to implement BPM6, the compilation of the
capital account, IIP and external debt statistics (EDS), and there are issues with the periodicity and
timeliness of reporting. Limitations on financial resources and the number of compilers have
constrained the LSB and the Bank of Lao PDR (BOL) from achieving progress in the compilation of
IIP and EDS as initially expected.
Data Standards and Quality
Lao P.D.R. is currently not a General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) participant. The government
has expressed its intention to collaborate with the IMF in moving Lao’s macroeconomic statistics
closer to the international standards, including to join the IMF’s GDDS, and use it as a framework for
development of the national data compilation and dissemination practices. No Data ROSC mission
has been conducted.
Reporting to STA
Government finance statistics reporting for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS)
and the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, which was initiated in early 2009, is limited to
budgetary central government and has been irregular and with long delays. Lao P.D.R. reports
quarterly and annual summary budget data in the GFSM 2001 format for publication in IFS and the
GFS Yearbook, with a time lag of six months or more, and on an irregular basis.
The reporting of monetary data is irregular and also with long delays. Quarterly BOP data are
reported once a year in a highly aggregated format. The last published data in the IFS and the
Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook correspond to 2011.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with
Lao People’s Democratic Republic

On November 15, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Lao P.D.R.
Background
Lao P.D.R. continued to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) and became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2013. Over the past
year, however, the economy has been overheating from expansionary macroeconomic policies.
The fiscal deficit is estimated to have widened to 6½ percent of GDP, mainly from a doubling of
public sector employee compensation and higher capital spending. Government liquidity is tight,
and wage and other arrears of 2–3 percent of GDP have emerged. Monetary policy has been
accommodative, and credit growth remains vigorous. Real GDP growth is projected at
8¼ percent this year, led by investment and private consumption, and consumer price inflation is
projected to rise to 7½ percent by year-end. The current account deficit is expected to remain
close to 30 percent of GDP, and despite strong foreign direct investment inflows, international
reserves—amounting to US$0.5 billion (0.8 month of prospective imports) in June 2013—are
very low.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually

every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

While medium-term growth prospects remain favorable, based on robust natural resource exports
and post-WTO expansion in the non-resource sectors, heightened vulnerabilities have subjected
the outlook to considerable uncertainty. A recent tightening of public employee compensation
and public investment should reduce the headline fiscal deficit to 4 percent of GDP in 2014,
although the current account deficit is expected to remain high owing to an overvalued real
effective exchange rate, and reserve levels would remain inadequate for precautionary needs.
After years of rapid credit expansion, banks’ asset quality could deteriorate. If policies remain
expansionary, near-term pressures on the balance of payments and inflation could escalate,
further depleting international reserves, and putting at risk the sustainability of future growth and
the authorities’ objective to achieve middle-income status by 2020.
Executive Board Assessment2
The Executive Directors commended the authorities for their impressive economic growth record
and the significant progress made toward achieving the MDGs. While medium-term economic
prospects remain broadly favorable, expansionary macroeconomic policies have led to a sharp
deterioration of fiscal and external balances. To address growing vulnerabilities, Directors
emphasized the immediate need to further tighten fiscal and monetary policies to support the
exchange rate anchor, replenish international reserves, build up fiscal buffers, and guide the
economy toward a soft landing.
Directors stressed that fiscal consolidation is central to restoring macroeconomic stability. They
agreed that a more ambitious tightening, anchored by a nonmining fiscal deficit of no more than
5 percent of GDP, would help to restore the fiscal space necessary for adequate capital and
human development spending, and would safeguard debt sustainability. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ intention to restrain the increase in public sector compensation in 2014, and
recommended that future increases be implemented at a more measured pace. A medium-term
budget strategy and continued improvements in tax collection would be important components of
any fiscal consolidation effort. Directors further underscored that cautious assessment of
large-scale projects and strengthening of public debt management capacity will be required to
mitigate debt sustainability risks.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of

Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

Directors recognized that the authorities’ commitment to a stabilized exchange rate within a
reasonably wide and adjustable band has contributed to increased confidence and to
de-dollarization over time. They emphasized that the exchange rate anchor requires lower broad
money and credit growth, and in this context they urged the authorities to mop up excess
liquidity, accelerate the unwinding of quasi-fiscal lending, and raise policy interest rates. Noting
that the exchange rate is assessed to be overvalued, and given inadequate reserves, Directors
recommended that the kip be allowed to move in line with market conditions with a view toward
replenishing international reserves.
Directors noted that years of rapid credit expansion and possible currency mismatches on bank
balance sheets pose risks to financial sector stability. They underscored the need for further
efforts to strengthen financial supervision, improve compliance with macroprudential regulation,
and raise banks’ capital. Directors encouraged the authorities to participate in an FSAP, and to
use Fund technical assistance to address supervisory weaknesses and strengthen financial
stability and crisis management frameworks. They welcomed efforts to strengthen the
anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism regime.
Directors welcomed Lao P.D.R.’s recent WTO accession, which should facilitate greater
economic diversification. They encouraged further efforts to enhance the business climate,
upgrade economic and financial statistics, and improve health and education infrastructure,
which would contribute to more inclusive and broader-based growth and would support the
authorities’ goal of attaining middle-income status by 2020.

Statement by Mr. Abdul Ghaffour, Alternate Executive Director for Lao P.D.R. and
Ms. Nithiwadee Soontornpoch, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
November 15, 2013

1. Our Lao authorities wish to express their appreciation to Mr. Ahuja and his team for
the constructive discussions and comprehensive assessment, as well as valuable
recommendations made during the recent Article IV consultation. This year’s
consultation focused on the challenges of sustaining economic growth, while
safeguarding macroeconomic and financial stability in the face of inflation and balance
of payment pressures. The authorities broadly agree with the staff appraisal and will
thoughtfully consider the policy recommendations therein.
2. Fifteen years after first sought membership, Lao PDR became the 158th member of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) on February 2, 2013. Accession to the WTO will
provide Lao PDR with more market opportunities by diversifying list of trading
partners, help realize higher gains from trade, and enhance investor confidence. As
Lao PDR enters the third year of the seventh five-year National Social and Economic
Development Plan (7th NSEDP, 2011-2015), the midterm review have found that the
plan has been successful in improving the people’s livelihood. Substantial progress
towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been achieved especially on
poverty headcount that dropped further to 20 percent in 2012. The government
remains committed to press ahead with necessary policy actions to overcome
remaining obstacles to achieve the 2015 MDGs target and graduate from least
developed country status by 2020 (Vision 2020).
Recent Economic Development and Outlook
3. Despite the weaker global growth and external uncertainties, the Lao economy
continued to grow in line with the medium-term target of 8 percent in 2012,
significantly driven by thriving investment projects in hydropower, infrastructure, and
real estate construction as well as domestic consumption. Mining production has
increased significantly from the operation of new gold and silver mines and the
expansion of existing minerals projects. With the continued strong growth of FDI, the
authorities expect to maintain the same pace of expansion in 2013, fueled by
hydropower and labor-intensive sectors, including construction, manufacturing,
agriculture and services.
4. Although fiscal revenue collection exceeded the target in 2012, fiscal deficit has
deteriorated in fiscal year 2012/2013 due to the increase in wages and monthly
allowance for civil servants and lower-than-targeted revenue collection. Nevertheless,
the authorities are committed to rein in fiscal deficit at 5 percent of GDP by stepping
up efforts in tax administration and collection along with expenditure measures. The
authorities are more optimistic on the prospect of higher tax revenue for fiscal year
2013/2014 from new foreign investment projects and other income measures including
the unification of corporate income tax rates, the introduction of a lump-sum tax for

2
SMEs, taxes on property transfer, as well as increases in petrol and vehicle excise
duties.
5. The average inflation in 2012 was moderate at 4.26 percent, but has escalated to
6.22 percent over the period of first nine months of 2013 due to prices of food and
nonalcoholic beverages category, particularly meats and rice, going up by 12.3 percent
caused by the shortage of livestock and the effects of flooding on agriculture. In
addition, price index of restaurant-hotel category, as well as housing, water supply,
electricity and fuel category also increased by 8.6 percent and 7.7 percent,
respectively. Nonetheless, the authorities expect that more stable prices of fresh food
and fuel in the last quarter will bring inflation to an annual average of 6.34 percent.
6. The kip’s nominal exchange rate appreciated 0.26 percent in 2012 and 0.62 percent in
09/2013 (y.o.y) against the US dollar. The authorities view that the kip appreciation is
broadly in line with the movement of regional currencies and remains flexible within
the target band. As noted in the staff report, they have carefully monitored and
observed the phenomenon in the parallel exchange market, which has been trading at a
premium over the Bank of the Lao PDR (BOL)’s reference rate since August 2013.
Such irregularities were attributable to (i) temporary FX liquidity shortage of some
commercial banks to fulfill customers’ request; and (ii) market’s misperception that
the BOL might adjust its policy on foreign exchange transactions administration,
which currently allows daily FX transaction up to kip 20 million per person. As a
result, the gap between official and parallel markets was widened from less than
0.04 percent pre-August to a peak of 3.4 percent in early September. However, after
the BOL continuously communicated their exchange rate policy stance to public and
consistently adhered to the announced policy, the gap has narrowed down to
0.7 percent in late October. The international reserves level has declined, but
gradually risen recently and is expected to increase to a more comfortable level by the
end of 2013.
7. Growth of credit to the economy is expected to decelerate further to about 20.7 percent
in 2013 from 26.6 percent last year. Notwithstanding a decelerating pace of credit
growth and low NPL ratio, the authorities constantly strengthen its prudential
regulations and banking supervision to ensure that financial system is safe and sound.
8. The authorities reiterate their steadfast commitment to pursue structural reform and
attract quality foreign investments to drive sustainable development and more
diversified economy. In conjunction with this effort, the government has temporarily
suspended new land concessions for gold and copper mining projects until 2015 to
conduct review and evaluation of the existing projects. Such assessment will ensure
compliance with regulations and maximize its benefit to meet socio-economic
development objectives.
9. The authorities share staff’s views that several emerging challenges could pose
downside risks to the economic outlook, and thus attach high priority to strengthening
macroeconomic and financial stability. They generally agree that policy tightening
may be warranted to address potential pressures on the external position and ensure
inflation remains contained. To this end, the authorities will stay vigilant on any
possible external shocks and stand ready to respond as appropriate.

3
Fiscal Policy
10. The authorities recognize the importance of fiscal prudence and concur that fiscal
consolidation is crucial for preserving macroeconomic stability and public debt
sustainability. They are aware that steps to rebuild fiscal buffers are needed to ensure
fiscal sustainability as well as cushion adverse shocks and unavoidable events in the
period ahead. However, the path of consolidation proves challenging due to the
committed increase in civil service wages and unexpected revenue underperformance
from sharply declined commodity export prices.
11. Against this backdrop, the authorities have promptly implemented measures to
enhance tax collection and curb other non-critical public spending to compensate for
larger wage bill envelope. On revenue front, the authorities are mapping out effective
strategies to intensify its revenue collection and widen tax base. Tax administration
has been strengthened by strictly enforcing compliance with investment promotion law
regarding tax and duty exemption and VAT deductibles, as well as effectively
implementing the revised tax law.
12. With regard to the expenditure, the government has temporarily halted the monthly
living allowance payment to civil servants, which will help to reduce expenditure more
than 2 percent of GDP. The authorities will carefully reconsider the policy on future
civil servant salary compensation taking into account staff’s recommendation of a
more measured pace. In addition, the authorities have cut low-priority current
expenditures and suspended state infrastructure development projects that are
commissioned by local governments, financed by private contractor and repaid by the
government upon completion of the projects. They will further carefully review
procurement process and strengthen project management regulations according to the
State Investment Law before lifting such suspension.
13. Over the medium-term, the authorities recognize that challenges remain in securing a
more sustainable revenue stream especially from non-resource sector and enhancing
the capacity on public financial management. Among others, they are in the process of
imposing new valuation method for automobile and fuel imports, which would
contribute to higher customs duty and tax collection. A new 5 percent tax on value of
real estate transactions has also taken effect in 2013. The full implementation of the
revised tax law which has been approved in 2011 will contribute to higher income tax
from new foreign investment projects.
14. Despite higher pressures on fiscal accounts, the authorities are committed to keep
public debt on a sustainable path and target to reduce level of external debt to be less
vulnerable to external shocks. The bath bond issuance in Thailand, which is a pilot
project to access the external financial market under the ASEAN+3’s Asian Bond
Markets Initiative (ABMI), has been a resounding success as proved by almost three
times oversubscription. The Debt Management and Financial Analysis System
(DMFAS) has been rolled out which will significantly improve public debt data
recording and strengthen debt management capacity.

4
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
15. On the back of heightened inflationary pressures, monetary policy has been geared
towards preserving macroeconomic stability. The authorities take note of staff’s
recommendation that monetary policy should be tightened by lowering M2 growth to
the level consistent with a sustainable nominal GDP growth in order to anchor
inflation.
16. The BOL has tightened monetary policy by continuously issuing central bank bills,
hiking repurchase interest rates - from 3.5 percent to 6.55 percent for kip and from
2.65 percent to 3.93 percent for FX, strictly enforcing FX net open position regulation,
as well as rationally providing FX liquidity support to commercial banks. Under
current circumstances, the BOL deems raising banks’ reserve requirement ratios as a
last resort. The BOL’s bills are regularly used to absorb liquidity and mobilize funds
from excess liquidity in banking system and can be additionally issued as necessary.
17. The BOL remains committed to keep exchange rate flexible and in line with financial
and economic conditions. In light of recent irregular movements in FX market, rules
and regulations on foreign currency related operations are enforced more actively.
Commercial banks must pay up the registered capital in foreign currency according to
capital adequacy regulation, and may extend credit in foreign currency only for the
activities that can generate revenues in foreign currency. These efforts specifically
aim at containing risks of currency mismatches in bank balance sheets. On this note,
the BOL is preparing to request for a technical assistance in the development of the
interbank market.
18. The authorities welcome staff’s assessment that the current exchange rate policy is a
generally appropriate anchor, which has contributed to increased confidence in the kip.
The authorities are committed to maintain a stabilized exchange rate scheme while
pursuing de-dollarization objective and promoting greater use of the kip. In addition,
the authorities are taking steps to enhance the mechanism for regulating foreign
exchange transactions to be able to monitor daily trading activities in a more real-time
basis.
19. Realizing the importance of safeguards against external uncertainties, the BOL has
stepped up their efforts to augment international reserve. Measures that have been
implemented include an abortion of foreign currency lending to local governments and
state-owned enterprises since last year, collecting outstanding loans, and intensifying
enforcement of foreign currency related regulations. In spite of the widening current
account deficit, the authorities are more optimistic that current international reserve
level remains adequate at 2.9 months of officially reported imports data in June 2013.
More importantly, the level of foreign reserves has gradually increased recently and is
expected to reach a more comfortable level at the end of the year. The authorities are
of the view that 2013 import figures would slow down from 2012, which witnessed
high import volume related to the ASEM meeting preparation. They also urge staff to
be cautious in using trading partners’ export data as proxy for Laos’ import, as a
significant part of the unrecorded import content is re-exported to other countries. That
said, the authorities are in agreement that there could be scope for exploring the

5
discrepancy in the measurement of imports and enhancing the authorities’ data
collection system.
Financial Sector
20. The BOL considers sound and robust financial system crucial for efficient allocation
of financial resources for long-term economic development. The overall banking
sector remains sound with strong capital adequacy, ample liquidity, and low NPL.
The authorities view credit growth as a positive move toward financial deepening,
which is a driver of economic growth and poverty alleviation. Nonetheless, the BOL is
aware of potential risks from extended period of rapid credit growth, thus has
tightened prudential regulation for banks to closely monitor credit quality and
supervisory interventions to ensure good quality underwriting standard, especially for
banks with NPL ratio of more than 3%. Regulations to control single lending limit to
mitigate concentration risk and prohibit connected lending to shareholders, directors
and subsidiaries have recently been issued.
21. More importantly, plans are underway to adopt Basel II capital standard with technical
support from the WB and the Bank of Thailand. In tandem, supervisory capacity and
regulatory framework are being strengthened to preserve a safe and sound banking
system. These efforts along with ongoing enhancement of the regulatory framework
under the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework will help to improve banking
capacity and enhance financial stability.
22. To address the deficiency of AML/CFT regime, the authorities have drafted
AML/CFT Law, and are in the process of several consultations and reviews by the
Ministry of Justice. The World Bank will subsequently help review the draft law to
ensure its compliance with international standards and, tentatively, the BOL will
propose draft AML/CFT Law to the National Assembly by 2014.
Structural Reforms
23. Lao PDR has become the 158th member of WTO in February 2013 and Lao PDR has
granted foreign access to domestic in several sectors. Significant progress was
achieved on structural reforms where more than 90 laws and regulations were enacted,
including those related to import licensing, custom valuation, investment, sanitary and
phytosanitary measure, technical barriers to trade, as well as intellectual property right
in order to better align with international norms. The authorities also continue their
efforts in simplifying business start-up procedures, notably with the establishment of a
one-stop shop to coordinate the application for foreign investment in the country
through various levels and spheres of approval. Electronic data interchange system
has been modernized to better facilitate cross-border trades. Additionally, Lao trade
portal (www.laotradeportal.gov.la) has been introduced to facilitate trade and enhance
transparency. The authorities believe that these initiatives will create a favorable
business climate conducive to more broad-based and inclusive growth.
24. The authorities realize the importance of high-quality and comprehensive set of
macroeconomic and financial sector statistics for conducting economic surveillance
and formulating appropriate and timely policy responses. In view of the need for

6
producing and disseminating these statistics in line with the international guidelines,
efforts are made toward improving official statistics and the reporting system. The
authorities welcome the Fund’s technical assistance to enhance statistical capacity.
Conclusion
25. The government envisages the Lao PDR to achieve LDC graduation by 2020. With
such ambitious undertaking, the authorities reaffirmed their commitment to carry out
the 7th national socio-economic plan in a manner that would sustain the investment and
growth momentum, while simultaneously preserving macroeconomic and financial
stability. They are aware of many challenges ahead and intend to gear the efforts
towards enhancing business environment, improving efficiency of public services,
reforming public financial management, building up necessary fiscal and monetary
policy space as well as strengthening banking regulation. Our authorities welcome
productive policy dialogue with the mission team and wish to express their
appreciation to the continued support of the Fund, especially in the area of technical
assistance.
