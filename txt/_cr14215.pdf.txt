STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION, FIRST
REVIEW UNDER THE THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT UNDER THE
EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY, AND REQUEST FOR WAIVER AND
MODIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Growth remains robust, despite slight downward revisions. Growth estimates for 2013
and projections for 2014 were revised to 6.6 and 6.8 percent, respectively, reflecting weather
and weaker terms of trade. Inflation is around zero, partly due to subsidized food prices. The
revised 2013 current account deficit rose to 7 percent of GDP, with a drawdown of imputed
reserves. The 2013 fiscal deficit increased to 3.5 percent of GDP, reflecting weaker revenues
and spending for subsidies, partly offset by higher grants.
In line with 2011 Article IV recommendations, the authorities maintained a prudent
fiscal stance, despite numerous shocks, and implemented structural reforms that have
improved the resilience of agriculture, especially cotton. Social transfers have been
bolstered to ensure the benefits of growth are better distributed. An updated external
stability analysis shows that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, and an
updated joint debt sustainability analysis maintains a “moderate” risk of debt distress.
Program performance has been satisfactory. The authorities are requesting a waiver for a
non-observance in the performance criterion for net domestic financing at end-December
2013, with most other quantitative targets met and all structural benchmarks for end-January
and end-March met. Program targets differ mainly due to higher budget support projections.
The 3 percent fiscal deficit target for the medium term macroeconomic framework remains
unchanged, although with a higher share of current spending.
Policy discussions focused on composition and quality of spending, transfers to public
enterprises, and natural resource revenues. The authorities recently submitted a
supplemental budget that increases the share of current spending for a higher wage bill and
more social and public enterprise transfers, but remains within program targets as a result of
spending offsets and higher budget support. The authorities are proposing an audit of large
public enterprises to estimate needs for the medium term, and inform reforms to reduce
transfer needs. The National Assembly did not approve a new mining taxation code by
end-2013 as expected, rather, the draft code was sent back to the authorities for further
consideration of investors’ concerns.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM
PERFORMANCE
A. Recent Developments
1.
Despite uncertainties associated with the transition of political power, the security
situation in Burkina Faso remains calm. After 25 years in office, President Compaoré is seeking to
amend the constitution to enable him to seek another term. Early in 2014, there were several high
profile resignations from his party, the Congress for Democracy and Progress (CDP). A new party
was formed, and joined forces with the opposition party to stage a series of peaceful protests
against the constitutional amendment. A public referendum on the constitutional amendment is
possible in the second half of this year.
2.
Growth remained robust in 2013, but was revised downward slightly from 6.8 to
6.6 percent (Figures 1 and 2). Erratic rains in 2013 affected grain production, although food stocks
appear adequate. Lower international gold prices constrained growth in mining production, with a
more pronounced impact on exports and fiscal revenues. Strong construction activity and cotton
production—the latter having become more resilient to rain patterns—partly compensated. Food
prices have been kept down due to price controls and government subsidized sales of basic food
products in special rural shops. Inflation has remained around zero for the past several months.
3.
The 2013 fiscal deficit was 0.2 percent of GDP higher than programmed, due to lower
revenues and higher spending, partly offset by higher grants. Revenue collection was affected
by, among other things, gold prices and foregone fuel excise taxes. Higher expenditures were
primarily due to capital transfers to public enterprises. Domestically-financed investment spending
was otherwise roughly on target, thanks to accelerated spending in the second half of the year.
Grants were larger than expected since the share of project grants to project loans was unusually
high—80 percent compared to 50 percent historically. The overall deficit reached 3.5 percent of GDP
(commitment basis). Deficit financing was skewed largely toward domestic financing: a bond
issuance late in the year was oversubscribed two fold, a large World Bank budget support
disbursement was delayed into the first few days of 2014, and external project financing was skewed
away from loans.
4.
In the first quarter of 2014, weaker than expected revenue performance continued
with large under-execution of spending. Revenue collection in the first quarter was about
88 percent and spending was 63 percent of programmed levels, leading to a temporary budget
surplus. Investment budget execution was 55 percent of program levels. In March 2014, the
government reversed its decision from a year ago to forego part of its take of fuel excise taxes,
which should compensate for one-half of the shortfall in revenue collection going forward
(MEFP ¶31).

5.
The current account balance deteriorated sharply due to lower gold prices (Figure 2,
Table 4). International gold prices caused reduced exports, and imports remained strong due to
demand for intermediate investment goods in conjunction with expansion of some mining projects
and growing public investment. Due to a retroactive change in official gold production statistics, the
current account deficits for 2012 and 2013 are 3.5 percentage points of GDP higher than in the
7th review.1 This change affects current account projections going forward, but balance of payments
projections are not yet finalized and there still may be offsetting revisions.
6.
Imputed central bank international
reserves dropped sharply, due to one-off
factors, while private sector credit remained
robust. As of end-December, imputed central
bank reserves dropped 40 percent against the
previous year. End-March monetary data indicate
that the sharp drop in imputed central bank
reserves continued, with net reserves going
negative (reflected only in the share of reserves

Discrepancies in official statistics for gold production have been resolved (end-March structural benchmark), with
the authorities finding that some production had been recorded in the wrong units (kilograms vs. tons). Thus, official
statistics for gold production in 2012 and 2013 were corrected from 42.4 to 35.6 tons and 42.8 to
38.9 tons, respectively. The revised production statistics have not yet been incorporated into the authorities’ real and
external sector statistics. However, since the correction implies an important change in the relationship between gold
production/exports and fiscal revenues, staff and the authorities agreed to incorporate the correction into the external
sector of the program framework. The change in production and exports in 2012 implies a very large upward revision
th
to the current account deficit, from 0.8 percent of GDP, at the time of the 7 review under the previous ECF
arrangement, to 4.5 percent currently. Once the national directorate of the BCEAO finalizes official BOP statistics,
there may be offsetting revisions to other aspects of the BOP. Meanwhile, staff and the authorities have agreed to
keep overall GDP growth estimates for 2012 and 2013 unchanged until the national accounts can be revised and
finalized, since the contribution of the mining sector to growth is modest and other possible revisions leave the net
effect on growth unclear. However, for the demand side, the higher current account deficit implies a reduction in
private sector savings relative to earlier projections.

7.
Private sector credit growth has remained robust, with an uptick in growth of banking
sector credit to the general government. However, reflecting the drop in imputed NFA for most of
2013, broad money growth (M2) slowed markedly, well below projected nominal GDP growth.
Although the trend is worth noting, in a monetary union and ample liquidity context, this does not
necessarily imply a constraint on growth.

B. Program Performance
8.
The majority of end-December and end-March quantitative targets were met (Table 5).
The adjusted ceiling on net domestic financing for end-December was not observed by about
0.3 percent of GDP. With a fixed bid system, a November bond issuance was oversubscribed more
than two-fold; the authorities used the financing to compensate for lower revenues and meet larger
than programmed capital spending needs. In contrast, the adjusted indicative target for the deficit at
end-December was met, due to the high share of grants supporting externally-financed investment
spending. An indicative floor for revenues was not observed by about 0.5 percent of GDP at both
end-December and end-March (MEFP ¶15) due to factors mentioned in ¶3. Due to large
across-the-board under execution of spending in the first quarter (pending decisions on
recomposition of spending), the end-March indicative target on poverty-reducing spending was
missed by a large margin.
9.
All end-January and end-March structural benchmarks were met (Table 6, MEFP ¶18).
Among these were measures to strengthen expenditure approval processes in order to accelerate
public investment spending; tax information sharing between Customs and Internal Revenue, which
has already provided preliminary information to flag large importers who do not pay much in income
taxes; updated financial projections for SOFITEX (state-owned cotton company) based on 2012
results; updated financial projections for SONABEL (state-owned electricity company) that helped
identify needs in 2014; and a harmonized database for official gold production in 2012 and 2013,
with strengthened ongoing cooperation between tax administration entities responsible for mining
revenues.

BACKGROUND FOR ARTICLE IV DISCUSSIONS
Burkina Faso is at a crossroads, its ability to
accelerate development hinging upon
crowding-in private sector activity and wise use
of natural resource revenues.

Burkina Faso has experienced sustained
higher and more stable growth over the past
two decades, with progress toward the
Millennium Development Goals. Burkina Faso has
experienced sustained and higher growth with
lower volatility, enabling it to catch up to regional
norms (Annex I). Five year average real growth
doubled between 1990 and 2012, with a decline in
the standard deviation from 3.8 to 2.5 percentage
points over the same period, despite numerous
shocks. On a purchasing power parity basis, Burkina
Faso’s GDP per capita in 2012 (US$1555) had almost
reached the WAEMU average (US$1663). Based on
the authorities’ official statistics for income poverty
(poverty rate of around 44 percent unchanged since
mid 1990s, using rising income levels in real US$
terms), there is a perception that poverty reduction
has been slow. This perception has been further
exacerbated by the recent boom in gold production.
However, broader indicators suggest that growth
has been relatively inclusive, with progress towards
the MDGs in many areas. The share of the
population living under the US$1.25 per
day threshold (2005 prices) has gone down
sharply since the early 90s (from 71 to
44 percent), and the income share held by
the wealthiest 10 percent of the population
has also decreased. MDG indicators with
notable improvements include health for
mothers and children under 5, primary
school enrollment and access to drinking
water. However, the country’s indicators for
education lag WAEMU, SSA and LICs
averages.

Burkina Faso has a long track record of strong macroeconomic policy management,
supported by consecutive IMF programs. The authorities’ policy decisions have tracked most
recommendations of the 2011 Article IV consultation, in the context of two consecutive ECF-support
programs (Box 1). Progress has been made in revenue collection, maintaining a prudent fiscal policy
stance and keeping debt levels low. Poverty-reducing and food security spending has been
increased, although direct transfers to protect the most vulnerable have only been introduced more
recently. Notable progress has been made in structural reforms to improve resilience and support
incomes in the vitally important cotton sector, which employs or supports a large share of the rural

population (Annex 2). In addition, Burkina Faso has been at the forefront of inclusive growth
innovations through its SCADD (Box 2), such as construction of a “growth pole” around the rural Bagré
reservoir, providing irrigation and other support services for diversified crops, ecotourism, fishing and
dairy industries, hydropower, among others, to create a synergetic center for local job creation and
investment.
Box 1. Burkina Faso: Status of Policy Recommendations from the
2011 Article IV Consultation
Policy Area

Staff Recommendations

Outcome

Fiscal

Maintain a prudent fiscal stance
and strengthen revenue
mobilization.

Consolidation of fiscal stance in 2012-2013, despite 2012 weather shock, with program
targets respected. Increased spending for investment and social transfers met by an
improvement in revenue collection effort, due to policy and administrative reforms.

Debt

Enhance debt management
capacity, and maintain a prudent
borrowing policy consistent with
debt sustainability.

Debt management capacity is ranked as moderate, with scope to improve internal
coordination and transparency of implicit support to public enterprises. Regional
efforts have shown deepening in regional market for domestic securities. Prudent
borrowing policies have lowered risk of debt distress from high to moderate. A nonzero ceiling on non-concessional borrowing was introduced in the program.

Structural

Promote economic diversification
and deepen structural reforms.

Authorities have invested in productivity-enhancements (irrigation, GMO seeds, crop
rotation, land management) to increase resilience of agriculture. They have also
invested in diversification and downstream activities, such as cotton and the Bagre
Growth Pole initiative. With development partners, government has invested in energy
expansion projects (new thermal plants, interconnections with neighboring countries
and solar energy), along with other growth-enhancing public investment spending as
laid out in the 5 year development plan.

Social

Improve social policies and
develop social protection systems
for the vulnerable.

Under the auspices of the SCADD, health, education, and food security spending has
led to improvements in social indicators. Authorities are scaling up spending to
achieve universal medical insurance coverage in 2016 and universal primary school
attendance by 2021. A National Social Protection Plan was established to do targeted
cash transfers, but has yet to take off, although spending on social transfers to the
most vulnerable increased by 1% of GDP in both 2013 and 2014.

12.
Despite this progress, private sector-led
growth faces numerous constraints, while
spending for development competes with less
efficient claims on public resources. Although
Burkina Faso’s business indicators are generally equal
to or better than those of regional peers, there are
well-identified binding constraints to sustaining high
and more inclusive growth. Private sector-led growth
and job creation are hampered by insufficient access
to, among others, reliable power, affordable financial
services, an effective judiciary, higher education and
vocational training, and transportation and
communications infrastructure. At the same time,
recent improvements in domestic revenue
mobilization have supported continued untargeted
energy subsidies and increases in the public wage bill.

These problems are not unique to Burkina Faso, nor are they more profound in Burkina Faso than
elsewhere. But this landlocked and resource poor (until recently) country has set high expectations
for itself, with a marked history of outperforming peer countries in the strength of its public policies
and public institutions.
13.
Burkina Faso’s recent gold boom provides an opportunity to accelerate its
development agenda, but the country lacks sufficient architecture to efficiently harness and
channel resources to meet multi-year development spending plans. (Annex 3). Although natural
resource revenues have not reached a “dependency threshold” of 20 percent of total revenues, they
are likely to in the coming years. Initial steps have been taken to improve the transparency of natural
resource revenue management, but architecture has not yet been put into place to optimize public
sector rent-sharing and to imbed disciplined rules for effective multi-year use of volatile resource
revenues for the purposes of development. To the contrary, natural resource revenues have
intensified the pressure to direct public resources for current consumption.
Box 2. Burkina Faso: Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Durable Development
The Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Sustained Development (SCADD) sets out economic and social
policies to support broad-based growth, sustained poverty reduction, and progress towards the MDGs
(MEFP ¶19–21). The strategy follows 4 main axes:


Development of accelerated growth pillars: in pursuit of a growth target of 10 percent, the SCADD
contains measures to improve the business environment, and develop “growth poles” to attract
private investment.



Consolidation of human capital and promotion of social protection: the SCADD focuses on
investment for expansion of health sector primary education, with coordinated expansion of
secondary and vocational education. The SCADD also aims to improve the equity of resource
allocation.



Strengthening of governance: internal and external controls to curb corruption and improve
accountability of public institutions. A main challenge is judicial reforms.



Crosscutting priorities in development policies: reduce gender inequalities, control population
growth, sustainable use of natural resources, capacity building.

Two-thirds of 2013 measures or indicators were implemented or met, notably feasibility studies for three
new growth poles, implementation of special export zones, and launching of a new household survey.
Establishment of a universal health insurance scheme aims to cover 50 percent of the population by 2025,
at a cost broadly estimated at 2 percent of GDP. Other health projects in the short run aim to hire health
care professionals, establish facilities, and assure free healthcare for children under 5 (20 percent of the
population). The 2010–20 education strategy plans to hire 3700 teachers per year, build or renovate
existing classrooms and buy textbooks, with a goal of 100 percent primary school enrollment by 2021, at
an additional cost of 2 percent of GDP per year.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Near Term Fiscal Policy
14.
The Cabinet approved a large package of new inclusive growth spending measures in
March, and a 0.6 percent of GDP public wage bill increase, but committed to find offsets to
maintain the program deficit (MEFP ¶27-29). The authorities stressed that revenue gains in recent
years and strong growth had led to mounting social pressure for more redistribution of public
resources, with two key outlets: the public wage bill and ad hoc social transfers. Negotiations for a
wage bill increase had been ongoing for 18 months as a quid pro quo for reducing the number of
categories of allowances. In early 2014, public sector labor unions joined together and began a series
of small scale strikes to force a conclusion of negotiations. By March, the government felt that
agreement was necessary to head off collective action and potential social turmoil. New social
transfers had been introduced in September 2013, and the authorities explained that continuation
and extension of these measures required new spending authority of 0.6 percent of GDP. The
Cabinet approved the spending increases in late March, along with another 0.3 percent of GDP
needed for voter registration and security spending and 0.8 percent of GDP in priority investment
spending. At the same time, the authorities identified preliminary categories of non-priority spending
to be “frozen” pending a mid-term budget review in July.
15.
At staff’s urging, the authorities agreed to formalize the new spending authority and
their financing by embedding them in a supplemental budget submitted to the National
Assembly on June 6. Staff also requested that the supplemental budget reflect additional spending
authority based on more realistic estimates of budgetary transfer needs of public enterprises, for
which the authorities added 0.3 percent of GDP. Total new spending authority of 2.6 percent of GDP
is to be financed by a combination of spending offsets and additional budget support grants.
Against the existing program framework, this implies a net increase in current spending by
1.3 percent of GDP, financed by reduced domestically-financed investment spending of 0.9 percent
of GDP and new resources of 0.4 percent of GDP. Additional budget support grants result from
agreement that a World Bank budget support operation delayed from 2013 into early 2014 could be
incorporated into the program framework as additional resources to be used in 2014 (maintaining an
original assumption for another disbursement later in 2014), thus reducing part of the need for
spending offsets.

The authorities explained that recomposition of spending would not jeopardize
program objectives for more inclusive growth, since higher social spending replaced lower
priority investment spending. They observed that the additional social spending addresses specific,
already-identified impediments to inclusive growth laid out in the National Social Protection Plan
and the SCADD, notably better support to the most vulnerable segments of the population and job
creation schemes (MEFP ¶24, 28-30). These include: targeted transfers for vulnerable groups
(orphans, street children, elderly, handicapped); creation of additional labor-intensive rural jobs;
increased use of “boutiques témoins” (small public grocery stores selling staple goods at subsidized
prices); credit lines/loan guarantees for small entrepreneurs; and expanding university funding to
facilitate more student participation and enrollment. At the same time, in finding offsetting
adjustments, the authorities were forced to carefully review investment spending in order to
safeguard the highest priority investment spending and delay lower priority spending (MEFP ¶29).
New identified priority spending is directed towards energy infrastructure. Thus, while spending may
be lower than originally planned, the quality and execution rate of spending should be higher, with
“readiness” of projects given more prominence in project selection. In considering WAEMU fiscal
rules, even with the recomposition, Burkina Faso meets the WAEMU floor for minimum domesticallyfinanced investment spending by a large margin.

The authorities acknowledged the mission’s
concerns about the size of the wage bill increase and
its sustainability, but explained that the
circumstances were unique. Staff noted that the
program already had incorporated a 10 percent increase
in the wage bill over 2013, to accommodate hiring of
new teachers and health workers. Thus, the wage bill
settlement implies a 25 percent increase over 2013, with
Burkina Faso’s wage bill increasing from 6.0 to
6.9 percent of GDP, and 35.8 to 39.9 percent of
revenues. The authorities noted that the wage bill

was unavoidable after almost a year and a half of
negotiations to streamline allowances. Staff expressed
concern about the sustainability of the large increase
in the wage bill over the medium term, noting the
change over time using various indicators. The
authorities expressed their commitment to revert the
wage bill back to the WAEMU ceiling (35 percent of
tax revenues) over the medium term, and discussed
with staff various options that might be incorporated
into program design at a later stage. Burkina Faso
does not have inflation-indexing, and the public sector
does not serve as a basis for wage negotiations in
other sectors. Thus, the most realistic option for
bringing the wage bill back in line with the WAEMU
ceiling is keeping a cap on multi-year wage
negotiations, since there are already significant further
increases in the number of teachers and health
workers planned for 2015–16.

The authorities also outlined measures to support program revenue projections to
address the mission’s concerns about weak first quarter results. They outlined numerous
measures to support the revenue projections in the program framework, including restoration of fuel
excise taxes, administrative measures to review past tax liabilities of mining companies, integration of
tax databases between Customs and Internal Revenues, and numerous other Customs measures,
including satellite tracking of import shipments and a new system of valuation for used vehicles.
(MEFP ¶13, 31) The authorities agreed with the mission that revenue projections in the budget,
having been increased by the National Assembly, could be overly ambitious and that the program
should retain more cautious projections.

B. Containing Fiscal Liabilities from Public Enterprises
19.
Staff explored in more depth budgetary transfers to the largest public enterprises
(Box 4). The enterprises’ imbalances are subject to fixed retail and volatile commodity pricing
structures which are unlikely to change significantly in the coming period. An automatic price
adjustment mechanism for fuel prices exists, but is not used in practice, and electricity tariffs—which
are already very high—have not been changed since 2006. Despite ad-hoc increases in retail fuel
prices—most recently for butane—explicit and implicit transfers to cover SONABEL and SONABHY
operational losses have grown substantially. Support took the form of explicit recurrent and
investment subsidies regularly appropriated in the budget, but also through tax and debt
forgiveness. In 2013, net transfers to SONABHY and SONABEL (implicit + explicit
subsidies—enterprises’ returns) reached a peak of CFAF 172 billion—9.5 percent of government’s
expenditure or 2.9 percent of GDP. It should be noted that this snapshot, however, covered both
losses in 2013 and some accrued losses from earlier years.
20.
Staff again stressed that untargeted retail fuel subsidies are inefficient, and
encouraged adjustment to avoid subsidizing cross-border fuel purchases at a minimum.
Following the 2011 protests and the reports of large revenue improvements in recent years, the
authorities remain concerned about the social consequences of larger adjustments in retail prices.
The more profound fiscal liabilities, however, are the operational losses of SONABEL. The scope for
maneuver on electricity tariffs is more limited still: sectoral experts stressed that it would be difficult
for the authorities to introduce tariff increases absent the provision of a more reliable supply of
power.
21.
The authorities have updated transfer needs for 2014 and proposed an external audit
to estimate a range of needs for 2015–17 (MEFP ¶34–35). The mission encouraged the authorities
to update 2014 transfer needs and include these in the supplemental budget, and to consider
whether there is any scope for retail price adjustments at this stage. The authorities proposed an
external audit (program benchmark for the 2nd review) to estimate a range of needs for 2015–17,
which would provide a basis for more concrete measures going forward. The audit will be carried out
by the Burkina external control agency (ASCE) and will assess: effective transfers to enterprises;
enterprises’ balance sheets; possible adjustments to costs and prices; and measures to contain costs
in the medium term.

Box 3. Burkina Faso: Implicit Subsidies to the Energy Sector, A Stock Taking of
Actual Costs in 2013
Electricity and fuel are provided by state-owned enterprises. Energy in Burkina Faso is provided by two
state-owned companies, the electricity company (SONABEL) and the fuel importer (SONABHY). SONABEL
has a distribution monopoly for electricity but not production, however, private operators have shown
limited interest so far. SONABHY has a legal import and storage monopoly for fuel products. Electricity tariffs
are set up according to a 2006 tariff grid for households, industry, tertiary business and residential threephases power lines. The grid slightly increased in 2008 and has been unchanged since. Retail prices for
butane, gasoline and diesel are supposed to be automatically adjusted with international prices, but in
practice there have only been ad-hoc hikes, most recently in March 2012 and May 2013.
Fixed retail prices and volatile input prices have caused operational losses. Both public companies face
fixed retail prices, whereas the price of imported fuel is volatile. With international price increases in recent
years, tariffs and prices have gone below actual costs , leading to financial losses for both companies since
2011 and causing larger fiscal risks and at some points threatening the loss of creditors and supplies. The
government has had to provide additional liquidity to the enterprises to sustain fuel and power supplies.
In 2013, explicit and implicit transfers to rescue SONABEL and SONABHY totaled almost one tenth of
the central government budget. Transfers to the companies from the government, were implemented in
the form of explicit recurrent and investment subsidies regularly appropriated in the budget. Besides these,
the government responded through tax and debt forgiveness operations. Tax exemptions were granted to
facilitate power imports from suppliers in neighboring countries; SONABHY was allowed to retain excise tax
on oil products for a 9-month period in 2013; and the government supported part of both companies’
liabilities through a mix of debt forgiveness and recapitalization to cover historical operational losses. Given
the companies’ poor profitability, they returned very limited amounts of taxes and dividends (VAT, taxes on
oil, revenue and property). In 2013, net transfers {implicit + explicit subsidies—enterprises return}, reached a
peak of CFAF billion 172—9.5 percent of government’s expenditure. This equates to 2.9 percent of GDP:
while an increase for Burkina Faso, it is consistent with averages for sub-Saharan African countries.

C. Harnessing Natural Resource Revenues to Finance Development
22.
A revised mining taxation code had been submitted to the National Assembly last fall,
but has been withdrawn for further revision. Mining companies have been lobbying to make
certain provisions of the draft code more generous, with the justification that lower international
gold prices have caused a slowdown in exploration activities. The authorities are currently consulting
with the companies concerning the requested revisions, and a revised draft is expected to be
submitted to the National Assembly in the fall. The authorities have committed to consult with staff
to help ensure that the draft submitted to National Assembly reflects key aspects of staff
recommendations, and is broadly comparable to the mining codes of peer countries in the
sub-region (MEFP ¶36). The mission met with members of the mining sector, the National Assembly,
the WAEMU commission, and the government to emphasize the importance of a mining taxation
regime which optimizes rent-sharing so that this non-renewable one-time windfall is effectively
channeled to investments to meet development needs of the country.
23.
The mission advocated, both at the national and regional level, consideration of a fiscal
rule to guide the use of natural resource revenues. Although natural resource revenues are still
below the “dependency” threshold of 20 percent of total revenues (16 percent in 2013), recent new
discoveries and/or a recovery of international gold prices could easily push revenues to a higher
level. The main channel by which gold production impacts the economy is through fiscal revenues, as
the contribution to real activity and external sector balances is limited. In terms of the type of fiscal
rule, key considerations are immediate development needs, execution capacity constraints, weak
institutional capacity to deal with volatile commodity prices, and the need for a relatively simple rule
that can garner broad ownership. Thus, rather than relying on longer term fiscal anchors based on
permanent income hypothesis or some derivation thereof, staff would recommend a shorter term
fiscal anchor as appropriate. An illustrative simulation of an expenditure growth rule is contained in
Annex 1. For their part, the authorities’ primary concern is that discussions about a fiscal rule should
be held within a regional context, and that revised WAEMU fiscal rules (currently under revision)
should be homogeneous for all countries. However, both in Burkina-specific and regional
consultations, staff have encouraged the authorities and other domestic stakeholders to consider
country-specific fiscal rules, as long as they are consistent with WAEMU rules.

D. Supporting Inclusive Growth
Investment for development:
24.
Financing the SCADD requires not only more spending on human and infrastructure
development, but also a redoubled focus on the quality of spending, through careful project
selection and results-monitoring. Under the auspices of the SCADD, the authorities are working to
identify critical infrastructure bottlenecks, and seeking to address them with large infrastructure
projects (MEFP ¶19–21, 24). However, the authorities are aware that if the expected growth payoff is
to be captured, the effectiveness of spending is critical. Average execution of investment spending
has been below targeted levels, and the Public Investment Management Index suggests there may

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

be weaknesses in the area of project selection. Last year, the authorities implemented some
immediate measures to improve the rate of execution of investment spending—although execution
of domestically-financed investment accelerated somewhat, donors do not report seeing much
difference in the rate of externally-financed investment project execution.
25.
The authorities have launched numerous initiatives to improve spending execution and
multi-year budget planning. Based on a diagnostic to identify expenditure approval bottlenecks,
they are in the process of rationalizing expenditure approval procedures and computerizing them
(MEFP ¶18, 32, 44, 46), as well as revising thresholds for public procurement. They are receiving
technical assistance to improve budget planning and program budgeting, and integrating the
multi-year planning processes with annual budgeting. Investment execution rates have started to
respond, but it will take time and monitoring to assess the quality and coherence of spending—on
the margin—against objectives of the development strategy.
Addressing energy constraints:
26.
Improving the supply of energy is critical to sustain inclusive growth, but also for
putting the sector on a more financially-sustainable basis. Business climate surveys consistently
indicate that, despite very high energy costs, consumers would be willing to pay more for reliable
and sufficient provision of electricity, as this would reduce interruptions of service and the need for
expensive backup systems. Thus, the question of financial sustainability is integrally linked to that of
supply. Numerous projects are in the pipeline to meet demand that is growing more than 10 percent
per year, while at the same time broadening access to energy for the rural population. There are
concerns that plans to expand domestic capacity may not be enough to meet energy needs, and
serve as an increasingly binding constraint on growth (Box 5). To meet these needs, the authorities
are accessing a combination of sources: expanding imported energy (less expensive, but limited
supply); expanding domestic thermal capacity (more expensive but more reliable); and developing
alternative sources as much as possible (e.g. solar energy) (MEFP ¶49).
Box 4. Burkina Faso: Electricity Supply: a Long Way to Close the Gap
Improvement of electricity supply is critical for eliminating a growth bottleneck and ensuring financial
sustainability of the sector. Key sector challenges include: (i) high supply costs, tariffs, and subsidies; (ii) fast
growing demand and limited supply; and (iii) a low electrification rate, especially in rural zones―only
14 percent of households are connected. Demand is estimated to grow at above 10 percent a year, faster than
the real GDP, while domestic capacity―still below 300 MW― grows at a much slower pace, with new electricity
projects taking longer than anticipated. Recent studies financed by donors suggest that over the period
2015–30, domestic capacity should increase to 750 MW and imported energy should increase by an additional
400 MW.
Increase of power supply: The increase of power generation is supported by donors, with a focus on renewable
resources. The lack of natural resources in Burkina Faso is a major impediment: solar electricity cannot exceed
25 percent of the total grid capacity due to technical constraints, and other natural assets either do not exist or
are already used to the maximum possible (hydro). Therefore, imports from neighboring countries constitute
an important element of the medium term strategy. The new interconnection with Ghana, planned for 2016,
should supply the domestic grid with a minimum supply of 100 MW by 2016. Most of the cost is supported by
the EU (US$31 million), AfDB (US$23 million), France (US$22 million) and the WB (US$16 million).

Identifying the export capacity of neighboring countries remains a challenge: Cote d’Ivoire aims to
double generation capacity by 2020. In Ghana, 110 MW additional capacity (IFC) came on line in 2013,
several other IPPs are in the pipeline, and the Ghana Power System Reinforcement Project (AfDB) aims to
reduce losses to the grid. The AfDB is also financing hydro-plants in Niger (Kandadji–130 MW) and Togo
(Adjarala–147 MW). However, accessing these sources may not be straightforward:
 fast growing domestic demand in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana;
 competition from other countries to import power from Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana: e.g. Côte d’Ivoire has
already committed to supplying 83MW to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea from 2015 onwards;
 export prices will likely increase to reflect increasing generation costs: while Burkina Faso has, until now,
been able to secure attractive prices from Côte d’Ivoire, implicit subsidies may not be sustainable due to
Côte d’Ivoire own budget constraints. The same will likely also be true for Ghana, meaning that imported
energy may cost more than historically.

Financial sector stability/access:
27.
Despite heightened risks for pan-African banks emphasized in WAEMU surveillance,
most commercial banks in Burkina Faso appear to be in a sound position. Burkinabè affiliates of
large regional banks remain profitable and stable. Capital adequacy ratios have dropped somewhat,
on the basis of robust new lending, with private credit growth at 26 percent as of December 2013.
The sustained high growth of lending has also affected the ratio of deposits to loans. On the other
hand, due to higher lending volume and a relatively low level of non-performing loans, there has
been a significant increase in return to capital. All but one bank are above the 8 percent minimum
capital threshold; the remaining bank is in the process of undergoing reform with a new
administrator and is not a systemic threat. As in the rest of the region, asset concentration is high,
with 5 banks (out of 12) holding more than 72 percent of assets. Loans are concentrated among
certain large borrowers, among them SOFITEX, SONABHY, a large construction firm, and food
importers. The central bank explained that concentration risks are controllable since banks engage in
mainly short-term lending (almost 2/3) and have a good mastery of the borrowing profiles. As with
other WAEMU countries, smaller financial institutions are supervised by national authorities. Pension
and insurance institutions are not supervised, but there are regional efforts to remedy this.

Access to financial services remains limited in Burkina Faso, with typical structural
impediments and a lack of incentives for innovation. As of 2012, about 16 percent of the
population had access to some form of financial services. Due to prohibitive costs, only 5 percent of
the population had access to commercial banking services. In the 2013 World Bank Doing Business
indicators, Burkina Faso ranked 130 (out of 181) for access to credit, down from 126 the previous
year. Commercial banks are introducing new products to broaden access for the informal sector, but
the regional regulatory and national legal environments represent serious obstacles, as do
undeveloped credit registries and use of collateral. For example, in West Africa, there has been very
little development of mobile banking since few institutions have received authorization to cooperate
with telecommunications entities to enable mobile banking. At the same time, telecommunications
service is quite poor, with limited infrastructure and competition, although the number of subscribers
has accelerated sharply. Also, commercial banks report that the judicial system does not support
enforcement of contracts, and sometimes may penalize the creditor.
29.
The authorities have an action plan to strengthen management and supervision of
microfinance institutions, and enhance the provision of basic financial services by the
state-owned postal company. Under the microfinance strategy, the objective is to rationalize

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19

BURKINA FASO

institutions and provide more reliable service by those that remain. Additional supervisors have been
added, with introduction of monthly reporting of prudential ratios and stress testing for some larger
institutions. Risk mapping has been added to leverage on-site inspections. For SONAPOST, the plan
is to use its geographical range to provide broader access to basic financial services for rural
populations. A first draft of a five year strategy has been finalized that envisages providing more
diverse and better quality products and services, including through computerizing SONAPOST’s
operations (MEFP ¶18).
Structural transformation:
30.
In spite of higher and more stable growth, there appears to be relatively limited
progress in structural transformation. Real GDP growth averaged 5.8 percent over the past
decade, and 7 percent over the past 5 years. At the same time, growth has become less volatile,
despite repeated droughts and floods. Better resilience against weather shocks is the result of
investment in irrigation, crop rotation and land management, and increased use of genetically
modified drought and pest resistant cotton seeds. However, concurrent structural transformation has
been limited—despite the emergence of industrial gold production, the secondary sector share of
GDP growth has remained around 20 percent since 1995, reflecting limited capacity to generate
higher value added activities. As discussed in the report for the approval of the current ECF
arrangement, there are efforts underway to establish value chains, notably in cotton.
31.
An updated base year for the national accounts is needed to identify evolving sources
of growth. The current base year is 1999. While the weight of various sectors has been adjusted in
the intervening years, the underlying survey techniques have not kept pace. In particular, the
statistical agency is concerned about estimates of informal sector activity. A first step in the process
is launching a new informal sector survey which could, among other things, correct estimations of
informal artisanal mining activity, which may be significantly understated. The statistical agency
noted that impediments to updating the base year are resources and TA. AFRITAC West has
reprogrammed TA planning to provide support, including to develop an action plan by year’s end
(structural benchmark).

OUTLOOK AND PROGRAM RISKS
A. Medium-Term Projections and Fiscal Policy
32.
The growth outlook for the next two years has been revised slightly downward, mainly
based on weaker terms of trade. The growth rate is forecast to be 6.7 and 6.8 percent in 2014 and
2015, respectively, reverting back to the past five year mean of 7 percent in 2016. Depending on
weather, commodity prices, and the pace and quality of investment spending, growth could be
higher, continuing its upward trend. Inflation is a function of imported prices and local food and fuel
prices—which are partly controlled or subsidized—and is expected to remain low at around
2 percent.

(MEFP ¶8, 13, 47). Baseline projections take these
improvements into account (as well as resumption of full collection of fuel excise taxes), but
cautiously do not take into account any production or tax policy changes for natural resource
revenues. Projections for residual financing needs in 2015 and 2016 are somewhat higher due to
more cautious assumptions for external financing partly compensated by higher projections for
domestic financing.

The framework projects less deterioration in the revised current account deficit in
2014, partly due to larger deterioration than expected in 2013. The deficit is expected to
improve only gradually through 2016, in light of projected terms of trade and continued high import
demand. Because the revision of 2012 gold production data caused a 3.7 percentage point of GDP
increase in the base for the current account deficit, with no offsetting adjustments in the rest of the
balance of payments, this implies a continued but modest use of international reserves over the
medium term due to conservative assumptions for gold exports based on WEO terms of trade
projections. However, it is important to note that these projections will most likely change once
balance of payments statistics for 2012 have been finalized, given likely other revisions in the
pipeline.
35.
Staff analysis does not suggest real effective exchange rate (REER) misalignment
(Annex IV). The nominal effective exchange rate appreciated by about 9 percent since the beginning
of 2013, following the appreciation of the euro against other major currencies. Low inflation pressure
in the WAEMU region meant that the REER, however, appreciated only moderately by about
4 percent and remained close to its historical average. Various model-based estimates suggest that
there is no significant misalignment of the REER at end-2013. Assessments of the current account
indicate that it also remains broadly in line with the country’s fundamentals and the capital account
is expected to remain stable over the medium term, composed of concessional financing and FDI.
Imputed reserves coverage has dropped due to one-off factors (as explained in ¶6).
36.
The 2014 DSA results are broadly unchanged from the 2013 exercise, reflecting a
moderate risk of debt distress (Annex V). More pessimistic external (and fiscal) balances as well as

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21

BURKINA FASO

more conservative assumptions on the terms of financing are offset by the higher discount rate,
lower starting nominal external debt levels than had been assumed in the 2013 exercise, and
assumptions about a higher share of domestic financing. In the baseline scenario, all debt ratios
continue to remain below the risk thresholds, with the risk threshold for the PV of debt to exports
breached only in the case of one of the standardized stress tests. On this basis, the risk rating is
maintained at “moderate,” albeit on the cusp towards “low.” The authorities and Bank and Fund staff
continue to discuss technical assistance that can help address debt management capacity constraints
that have been identified in various diagnostic reports.

B. An Alternative Low Growth Scenario
37.
To challenge the robustness of the macroeconomic framework projections and the DSA
results, staff constructed an alternative scenario. Since a gold price shock was explored in the
2012 and 2013 DSAs and is embodied in the standard stress tests, in this case staff explored a near
term growth shock due to drought, with no additional response from donors. The growth slowdown
starts in 2014, peaks in 2015, and has residual effects over the next five years. The main impact of the
shock would be on grain production, creating resulting food security needs. Due to higher food
prices, inflation increases to reach an average of 4 percent in 2015. The current account deteriorates
only marginally relative to the baseline, as exports are assumed unchanged (with mining unaffected
and cotton affected only marginally due to irrigation and GMO seeds) and lower growth and
investment is assumed to have a dampening effect on import demand.

38.
In this scenario, the fiscal deficit rises above 5 percent in 2015 and 2016, and
investment spending adjustment has an impact on growth in the medium term. The deficit
increases sharply due to lower revenues and spending needs associated with food security and other
transfers aimed at mitigating the impact of the shock. Investment spending adjustment is assumed
to avoid an even larger increase in the deficit, and this has the effect of dampening growth over the
next five years.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

39.
DSA results under this scenario show a higher risk of debt distress, albeit with the risk
rating remaining “moderate”. The impact of the shock is to increase long-term debt levels as the
increase in the fiscal deficit is assumed to be financed mostly by increased external borrowing on
non-concessional terms. On its own this scenario causes a near breach in the PV of debt-to-exports
and in combining it with standardized stress tests, both PV of debt-to-exports and debt-to-GDP
thresholds are breached. The results of this alternative scenario reinforce maintaining the risk of debt
distress as “moderate.” However, all DSA results should be interpreted with caution, particularly given
uncertain assumptions about the investment-growth nexus, outdated national account statistics, and
balance of payments data still under revision.

C. Program Risks
40.
Program risks have increased, mainly due to growing pressure on current spending and
risks of domestic social unrest (Table 8). Political uncertainty in the run-up to the presidential
elections in 2015, increasingly unreliable electricity and telecommunications access, and growing
social pressure on recurrent spending constitute new or enhanced risks to program implementation
in the near term. The constructed alternative scenario of a weather shock combined with a lack of
additional donor support should yield similar results as these types of shocks. Ongoing risks of
weather shocks, commodity price volatility, capacity constraints and low returns to investment
remain unchanged. Spillover from regional security issues constitutes a less serious risk than in the
past. Another emergent risk is that the National Assembly appears to be taking a less prudent role in
tax policy, both with regard to the mining taxation code and revenue projections underlying the
budget.

PROGRAM MODALITIES
41.
The authorities are requesting two minor modifications to program performance
criteria for end-June and end-December 2014. First, an increase of 0.2 percent of GDP in the
continuous performance criterion on non-concessional external debt to seek financing for two
additional highway projects, one of which provides better access to Benin (MEFP ¶43). The authorities
have already used about 60 percent of the existing program limit. Second, an unchanged indicative
deficit target and larger identified program external financing imply lower ceilings on net domestic
financing. Indicative targets for revenue and poverty spending are higher, and other program targets
and adjustors remain unchanged (Table 5, MEFP Table 1). Staff and the authorities have also agreed
on a new more specific and verifiable definition for the indicative target on non-accumulation of new
domestic arrears, consistent with that of other WAEMU countries (TMU, ¶23).
42.
The agreed program incorporates several aspects to avoid further nonobservance in
quantitative program targets. The end-December nonobservance of the performance criterion on
net domestic financing was partly a function of the use of fixed bid securities operations; the
establishment of a regional domestic debt issuance mechanism with variable bidding should help
keep planned debt issuance on track. The authorities have agreed to maintain more conservative
program projections for revenues—which take into account the decision to restore the government’s
full share of fuel excise taxes and new measures listed in ¶18— and maintain the program deficit
target to contain the spending envelope (MEFP ¶31). To meet poverty-reducing spending targets,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 23

BURKINA FASO

budget execution is expected to gather momentum in the second quarter as the implementation of
the planned social measures begins to accelerate and the recent reforms in investment planning and
in project selection and implementation take effect. The mission and the authorities also discussed
possible technical assistance that could help improve domestic debt planning, transparency of
exceptional debt operations, better internal coordination on debt issues, and broaden understanding
of the architecture of the ECF-supported program following an organizational restructuring by the
authorities in 2013.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
The growth outlook remains strong, but with heightened risks and growing policy
challenges. All else equal, growth should stay around its recent average of 7 percent and even
perhaps higher depending on weather patterns, but there are new risks to growth over the program
horizon. However, failure to address certain increasingly important policy issues outlined below
could undermine the country’s fiscal and debt positions, and ultimately affect growth and
development objectives.
44.
Despite facing a more challenging environment, the authorities have reaffirmed their
strong commitment to the program. Program performance through end-December remained
strong, even taking into account the non-observance of the end-December performance criterion on
net domestic financing. In the coming period, fiscal space is likely to be more limited than in the
past, notwithstanding that in the longer term there could be significant increases in natural resource
revenues. At this early stage, the authorities have wisely chosen not to borrow against future
resources, preferring to maintain a cautious and stable fiscal policy stance. However, in this context,
three critical policy challenges have emerged.
45.
One main challenge will be handling social and political pressure to increase spending
for consumption at the expense of development spending. This has already increased with the
emergence of growing natural resource revenues and could intensify in the coming electoral period.
In adjusting expenditure composition, the authorities should maintain a strong focus on promoting
inclusive growth, supporting vulnerable segments of the population, and fostering job creation, while
ensuring continued fiscal stability. Given planned increases in hiring in key sectors, the recent large
increase in the wage bill creates sustainability concerns: multi-year wage negotiations will need to be
contained and/or other measures implemented to bring the wage bill back in line with WAEMU
limits.
46.
Another challenge is boosting electricity supplies and containing fiscal liabilities posed
by public enterprises. Access to reliable power is the single most important constraint to growth
and job creation. The authorities are redoubling efforts to accelerate investment in increased power
supply, but the situation has deteriorated and more is still needed. In terms of fiscal sustainability, an
external audit can help provide more reliable forecasts of transfer needs going forward, but the
authorities need to consider options for near term adjustments in case resources become more
limited over the course of this year. In particular, adjustments to retail fuel prices would reduce
transfer needs and help finance the additional current spending in the supplemental budget.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

47.
A third main challenge is making sure that Burkina Faso does not squander its
one-time opportunity to harness natural resource wealth and channel it toward
growth-enhancing development spending. By becoming EITI compliant and keeping close track of
resource revenues, the authorities have taken good first steps. Next, it is critical that a mining
taxation code—one that seeks fair rent-sharing between international investors and the public
budget, comparable to regional peers—is drafted, and submitted and approved by National
Assembly. It is incumbent upon the government and the National Assembly to protect fiscal space
for development spending, and balance the interests of future generations against those of
international investors. In the medium term, it is important to consider rules that introduce an
element of counter-cyclicality to help safeguard development spending plans in the face of
execution capacity constraints and the inherently volatile nature of natural resource revenues. The
lack of more sophisticated architecture to harness, manage and use natural resource revenues leaves
the country vulnerable, at best to an important missed opportunity and at worst to governance
problems.
48.
Efforts to harness and direct resources toward development spending must be
complemented by reforms to improve the quality and pace of such spending. Weak institutions
and capacity constraints impede scaling up of public spending for education, health, and
infrastructure. Financing the national development strategy requires not only more investment
spending on human and infrastructure capital, but also a redoubled focus on the quality of spending,
through careful project selection and results-monitoring.
49.
Staff supports completion of the 1st review of the current ECF arrangement, with a
waiver for the end-December 2013 performance criterion on net domestic financing. Similarly,
it supports modification of the performance criterion for net domestic financing and the
nonconcessional external debt ceiling for end-June and end-December 2014, and the addition of a
structural benchmark by end-November for an external audit of large public enterprises. It is
recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place in the 24-month cycle in accordance
with the Decision on Article IV consultation cycles.

MINISTRY OF ECONOMY
AND FINANCE
---------------------------

Ouagadougou, June 17, 2014

GENERAL SECRETARIAT
-------------------------DIRECTORATE GENERAL
OF COOPERATION
N°2014/002524/MEF/SG/DGCOOP
Madame Christine Lagarde,
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street NW
Washington, DC 20431 (USA)
Subject: Letter of Intent and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies

Madame Managing Director,
The government of Burkina Faso has continued to implement the measures established in its
economic program supported by the three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility
(ECF) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the period 2013-2016. The seventh and final
review of our economic and financial program for 2010-2013, which ended on December 31, 2013,
was approved by the IMF Board of Directors on December 18 2013, allowing for a disbursement of
3,225 million SDRs or about CFAF 2,372 billion.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) examines program
performance at end-December 2013 and presents the policies that the government intends to
pursue in the year ahead. It also explains the country’s balance of payments needs and its reform
efforts to preserve macroeconomic stability, and strengthen the foundation for sustained and
inclusive growth in line with the objectives of the Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Sustained
Development (SCADD).
Program implementation in 2013 took place in an environment marked by less buoyant economic
activity than in 2012, mainly due to static production in agriculture. Domestic revenue mobilization
totaled CFAF 1,117.4 billion at end-December 2013, up 11.9 percent from 2012. The tax to GDP
ratio was 16.7 percent, within 0.3 percentage points of the WAEMU norm. The budget deficit,
including grants, amounted to 3.5 percent of GDP taking account of the expenditure effects of the
implementation of social safety net measures and actions to promote job creation. Over the course
of 2013, the government continued to implement the SCADD to strengthen the economy's
resilience to various shocks while promoting inclusive growth and poverty reduction.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

BURKINA FASO

In terms of program performance, the end-December performance criterion for net domestic
financing was not met and a waiver is requested. Net domestic financing amounted to 2.2 percent
of GDP against an adjusted target of 1.8 percent of GDP, due to the use of proceeds from the
issuance of government securities to balance the shortfall in domestic revenues, delayed budget
support, and to meet expenditure needs. The indicative target for revenue collection was not met,
mainly due to lower mining profits from falling international gold prices and the government’s
decision to forego part of its share of the tax on petroleum products. The indicative target on
poverty-reducing expenditures was missed by a minor amount at end-December 2013, but by a
wider margin as of end-March 2014. Execution of new social transfers spending should result in a
marked improvement in performance over the rest of 2014.
To ensure that targets are met in 2014, more cautious revenue forecasts have been maintained,
with specific reforms to further strengthen revenue administration. After disappointing first quarter
revenue collection, the government has decided to restore its full share of taxes on petroleum
products. Moreover, it will look carefully at the timing of budget support disbursements and
domestic debt issuance for the remainder of the year.
The eight structural benchmarks agreed to under the program for end-January and
end-March 2014 were all met on time.
In March 2014, the Cabinet approved an increase in spending of CFAF 110 billion, mainly for an
increase in the wage bill, additional social transfers, and new voter registration. To ensure this
additional spending does not jeopardize the sustainability of the public finances, additional
resources and offsetting spending adjustments have been identified to contain the nominal deficit
in line with agreed program targets. These changes in spending authority were reflected in a draft
supplemental budget law that was submitted by the government to the National Assembly on
June 7.
In aggregate, these measures aim on one hand to preserve spending in the social sectors (health,
education, and youth employment, in particular) and also to make savings on operating expenses,
certain current transfer items, and domestically-financed capital spending projects whose
implementation can be deferred based on their state of readiness, which should serve to strengthen
investment execution. Also, with the implementation of measures aimed at boosting job creation,
income generation, and access to financing, the government believes the package will have a
positive impact on inclusive growth, which will contribute to the consolidation of national solidarity
and the preservation of social stability.
In light of our commitment to preserving macroeconomic stability and based on the policies set out
in the attached MEFP, we request that the IMF conclude the first review under the ECF arrangement
enabling a disbursement in the amount of SDR 2.55 million, grant a waiver for the missed
performance criterion, modify the performance criterion on net domestic financing, and increase
the ceiling on the continuous performance criterion on nonconcessional external debt from
CFA 135.9 billion to CFA 150 billion (an increase of 0.2 percent of GDP).
The government believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to achieve
the objectives of its program, but it will take any further measures that may become appropriate for
this purpose. The government will consult with the IMF on the adoption of these measures, and in
advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with applicable IMF
policies on such consultation.

Furthermore, the government will provide the IMF with information on implementation of the
agreed measures and program execution, as provided in the attached revised Technical
Memorandum of Understanding or at the request of the IMF.
As in the past, the government agrees to publication of this letter, the attachments hereto, and the
related IMF staff report upon approval by the IMF Executive Board.

Very truly yours,

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies 2013–16
1.
This Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) provides an update on the
implementation of the arrangement supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under
the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) from 2013–2016. The purpose of the ECF-supported program
is to maintain macroeconomic stability and lay a firmer foundation for sustained and inclusive
growth in accordance with the objectives of the Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Durable
Development (SCADD). This memorandum describes recent economic trends and takes stock of
the quantitative criteria and structural benchmarks at end-December 2013, end-January 2014,
and end-March 2014. It also outlines the macroeconomic framework and the structural
benchmarks for the remainder of 2014.

RECENT ECONOMIC TRENDS
2.
Economic activity was less robust in 2013 with a growth rate of 6.6 percent, compared to
9.0 percent in 2012. This relative slowdown is due mainly to the primary sector, particularly the
drop in food crop production. GDP growth in 2013 was sustained primarily by the secondary and
tertiary sectors which grew at 7.9 and 6.6 percent respectively.
3.
Within the tertiary sector, there was an increase of 7.7 percent in the output of non-market
services, attributable to the effects of measures taken by the government in September 2013
regarding government employee allowances, job creation for youth and women, and the
improvement of social safety nets for vulnerable segments of the population. Another
contributing factor was the 5.8 percent rise in market services output, boosted by the hosting of
a number of international events―the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou
(FESPACO) and the International Tourism and Hotel Trade Fair of Ouagadougou (SITHO)―and
stepping up promotion of “destination Burkina Faso.”
4.
As regards the primary sector, its contribution amounted to a mere 0.9 percentage points
of GDP growth in 2013, compared to 4.6 points in 2012 (growth of 3.4 percent compared to
18.7 percent in 2012). The decline in cereal production (0.6 percent, due to less favorable rainfall
despite grants for inputs and equipment, and larger areas sown) was offset by a solid growth
performance in the cash crop agricultural subsector (14.9 percent), cotton production
(7.0 percent), and other cash crops (22.0 percent).
5.
Annual inflation stood at 0.1 percent at end-December 2013, compared to 1.6 percent at
the same time in 2012. The implementation of government measures, such as the sale of cereals
at subsidized prices in areas with shortages, price controls on consumer products, and the
opening of special outlets supporting food security policy by selling at lower-than-market prices
(boutiques témoins), combined with a good 2012/2013 crop year, helped keep average inflation
at 0.5 percent, well below the community standard, compared to 3.8 percent in 2012. At
end-January 2014, overall consumer prices dropped 0.8 percent compared to December 2013 as
a result of lower food and beverage prices, among other factors.
6.
Foreign trade was marked by a sharp rise in imports compared to exports. Imports of
goods and services were up 5.3 percent from CFAF 1978.2 billion in 2012 to CFAF 2083.9 billion
in 2013, due in large part to imports of capital goods and the oil bill. Exports fell by 1.8 percent

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

from CFAF 1491.1 billion in 2012 to CFAF 1463.6 billion in 2013, owing mainly to gold prices. The
current account deficit was 7.0 of GDP compared to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2012, a decrease of
2.5 percentage points.
7.
At end-December 2013, private sector credit rose by 26.3 percent on an annual basis. The
money supply was bolstered entirely by deposits, growing 11.3 percent. Net foreign assets fell
21.2 percent in 2013, mainly because of substantial import requirements from some large gold
mines and delay of a budget support disbursement from the World Bank. In addition, in spite of
stricter control of the repatriation of export revenues by the authorities, some large banks did
not comply with the requirements to transfer assets to the BCEAO. A BCEAO committee was
created to improve monitoring of compliance with this requirement
8.
Revenue mobilization grew by another 11.9 percent in 2013 from CFAF 999.0 billion at
end-December 2012 to CFAF 1117.4 billion at end-December 2013. This increase was brought
about by the government’s continued efforts to modernize tax administration, implement the
collection unit approach, broaden the tax base, raise awareness of tax compliance among
economic actors, and foster efforts to combat evasion, forgery, and corruption. This performance
is also attributable to the many actions taken by the authorities in 2013, the use of a special tax
on transactions related to mining stocks, the application of Value-Added Tax (VAT) on imports of
operational mining companies and companies that signed contracts with the government, and
the continued streamlining of customs clearance procedures. Tax mobilization was 16.7 percent
of GDP, close to the WAEMU criterion. At end-March 2014, CFAF 237.2 billion in revenues was
mobilized, compared to CFAF 259.7 billion over the same period in 2013, a contraction of
8.7 percent.
9.
Grants stood at CFAF 324.4 billion at end-December 2013 compared to CFAF 277.5 billion
in 2012, an increase of 16.9 percent despite a delay in the World Bank budget support
disbursement of CFAF 24.1 billion, which arrived in January 2014. These program grants were
complemented by project-related assistance that reached CFAF 205.2 billion, up 83.9 percent
compared to end-2012.
10.
Execution of total expenditure and net lending stood at CFAF 1652.7 billion at
end-December 2013 compared to CFAF 1460.8 billion in 2012. Total expenditure for 2013 was
27.8 percent of GDP, including the counterpart in capital transfers to SONABHY securities sold to
commercial banks and SONAPOST, for a total of CFAF 38.3 billion.
11.
Domestically financed capital expenditure (including capital transfers) reached
10.0 percent of GDP at end-2013 (CFAF 592.7 billion) in line with revised budget projections and
compared to the 7.8 percent forecast during the seventh review. Externally financed capital
expenditure, however, posted weak performance at 4.5 percent of GDP. At
end-March 2014, public spending amounted to CFAF 266.7 billion compared to
CFAF 316.7 billion at the same time in 2013.
12.
The budget deficit (grants included) at end-December 2013 was 3.5 percent of GDP
compared to 3.3 percent in 2012. Allowing for a cash adjustment of 0.9 percent of GDP, the
budget deficit was financed through net external financing and net domestic financing totaling
2.7 percent of GDP.
13.
Budget execution performance was not up to standard in the first quarter of 2014.This
outcome can be explained in part by weak execution of transfer payments. Revenues in the first

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

BURKINA FASO

quarter were also below target (CFAF 237.2 billion compared to a target of CFAF 268.7 billion). In
any case, the government anticipates an improvement in budget execution in the coming
quarters with the initial effects of the implementation of the social measures. It also expects an
improved revenue performance, due on one hand to the restoration of fuel excise taxes, and also
to the implementation of reforms relative to satellite tracking of merchandise imports and the
new system of valuation for used vehicles to improve customs revenue.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
14.
Most program quantitative targets for end-December 2013 and end-March 2014 were
met. However, the end-December 2013 domestic financing ceiling was missed by 0.3 percent of
GDP. This outcome led the government to request a waiver for the non-achievement of this
objective. The non-observance was due to issuance of government securities in the amount of
CFAF 121.6 billion, which was used to make up for a delayed World Bank disbursement, lower
than expected revenues and an acceleration in investment spending in the last quarter of 2013.
The indicative ceiling on the deficit was respected due to an upward adjustment in response to
the shortfall in the disbursement of CFAF 48 billion in program loans and grants. Under
execution of the budget meant that both the NDF and deficit targets were met by a large margin
at end-March 2014.
15.
Indicative targets for revenues were not achieved at end-December 2013 and end-March
2014, due to slower growth and the government’s decision to forego part of the tax on
petroleum products (TPP) to support SONABHY.
16.
The target on poverty-reducing spending at end-December 2013 was missed by a minor
amount. Preliminary data for end-March 2014 also show under-execution, which should be
corrected with the new social transfers underway.
17.
Limits on accrual of new external and domestic arrears and on nonconcessional external
debt were respected. The government entered into new agreements on new nonconcessional
loans at end-December 2013 to finance large investment projects, as follows: (i) construction of
Donsin airport with the ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development (EBID) (CFAF 5 billion)
and the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) (CFAF 50 billion); and (ii) paving of the
Dédougou-Tougan highway under a contract signed with the IDB in January 2014 for
CFAF 28,206 billion. Under these contracts, the total amount of the nominal limit used is
CFAF 83,206 billion.
18.

Structural benchmarks for end-January and end-March 2014 were completed:



Launch of the tax information cross-checking module in GERIF: To improve information
sharing between the tax and customs authorities, the tax information cross-checking
module in the Tax Information Cross-Checking Management (GERIF) software application
was completed and its functionality enhanced. Roll-out of the software began at two
pilot sites in January 2013 and continued at other sites thereafter. The country’s two
major tax centres, which collect at least 90 percent of DGI revenues, started using the
software fully in the fourth quarter of 2013.



Update of forecasts on the 2013–2016 financial situation of the SOFITEX business plan
based on FY 2012 results: This exercise has been carried out and the results have been
approved by the Board of Directors. The update helped the company increase its equity
from CFAF 11,2 billion in the initial plan to CFAF 16,2 billion.

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO



Adoption by the SONAPOST Board of Directors of a strategy to improve the quality of
financial service offered: A new five-year strategy was adopted by the SONAPOST Board
of Directors to expand access and improve the quality of postal financial services.
Implementation of this strategy will ultimately help prepare the creation of a postal bank.



Finalization of the SONABEL financial model and production of new forecasts on the
2014–16 financial situation, with various scenarios: The structure of this new financial
model was validated in December 2013 and the results confirm the software’s capability
to run financial simulations to determine the profit-and-loss accounts and the
management ratios over a given period, on the basis of realistic assumptions.



Begin using the interconnection between the DGI and DGD to facilitate information
sharing through an automatic update of the IFU (single tax identification number)
database in ASYCUDA++. The interconnection was achieved through CIR/RESINA. Tests
are being performed within DGI on suspended IFU numbers in the DGI database
following automatic deactivation in ASYCUDA.



Put in place a committee responsible for coordinating implementation of the
computerization initiative and make it operational. The committee was created and held
its first meeting on March 4, 2014, to adopt its annual agenda.



Revise the law establishing the budget and its implementing decrees to take into account
the findings of the workshop on procedural reform and the responsibilities of all
participants in the expenditure chain. The government submitted the draft law to the
National Assembly, which was passed on January 24, 2014.



Align the gold production databases and audit mining production statistics monthly. The
2012 and 2013 mining production data have been harmonized. Going forward, a
committee has been established to audit mining production statistics on a monthly basis.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRATEGY FOR ACCELERATED
GROWTH AND DURABLE DEVELOPMENT (SCADD)
19.
Government policies in 2013 were guided and implemented in keeping with the Strategy
for Accelerated Growth and Durable Development (SCADD) with a view to consolidating gains
and making further progress in achieving development objectives. At end-December 2013, the
annual performance assessment for the 2014 preview of the SCADD reported that indicator
targets were reached at a rate of 63.2 percent.
20.
Measures are being adopted to strengthen regional and sectoral capacity to improve
implementation over the period 2014–16 including developing the Bagré growth pole, more use
of public-private partnerships, improving the population’s access to energy, and increasing the
competitiveness of the private sector by improving the business climate and promoting more
capacity for structural transformation. Implementation of the “Bagré growth hub” pilot project
continued through a public-private partnership forged in order to send a strong signal to
potential investors as to the safeguards surrounding the project. To this end, a semi-state
company was created with a capital of CFAF 1 billion, 38 percent of which is held by the private
sector. Moreover, in terms of strengthening human capital, there are plans to bring staffing of
public health facilities up to required levels and to put in place a universal health insurance
system, to extend social protection to the population at large and broaden Burkinabè’s access to
a minimum of quality healthcare. It is also planned to broaden the implementation of reforms in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

BURKINA FASO

the education system, most visibly through building new classrooms, renovating schools, and
hiring about 5,000 new teachers per year.
21.
In the pursuit of pro-poor growth, actions were taken to improve social safety nets by
creating labor-intensive jobs (HIMO). For this and other social purposes, a supplemental budget
law authorizing additional spending of 1 percent of GDP (CFAF 64 billion) was enacted in
October 2013. Other areas covered by this measure included the provision of investment and
settling-in loans for financing self-employment of young graduates, strengthening the university
infrastructure and improving social safety nets for the most vulnerable.

MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
22.
The forecasts for 2014–15 are leaning toward continued economic growth of 6.7 to
6.8 percent, assuming rainfall is normal and gold and cotton prices remain relatively stable. This
growth would be driven in part by the implementation of quickly-impacting government
measures in the agricultural and livestock sectors, and the launch of the Bagré growth pole
operational phase. Gold production in 2014 is expected to increase by 4 percent compared to
2013, owing mainly to the entry into full production of certain mines and the expansion of one
gold mine. If rainfall is more favorable than expected, the growth rate is expected to rise above
7 percent.
23.
Moreover, to strengthen the resilience of the economy against various shocks while
promoting inclusive growth and poverty reduction, the government plans to continue to develop
growth hubs, implement arrangements under the National Rural Sector Program and the action
plan for food security, and approve a draft law on universal health insurance. Four new growth
poles will be established: two agricultural centers in Sourou and Samendeni, a mining center in
the Sahel, and a center for tourism in the east of the country. Establishing these centers of
commerce will help: (i) increase agro-pastoral and fisheries production; (ii) develop exports;
(iii) match development of infrastructure and critical services with industrial development needs;
and (iv) direct national and foreign investments toward establishing a better framework to
support small and medium-sized enterprises. These expected results should boost economic
growth in the selected centers, and help spread the effects across the whole of the local,
regional, and national economy.
24.
The government will continue to implement social measures, notably through controlled
consumer product prices, by keeping special outlets open. Other specific measures are intended
to help the most vulnerable groups in society, the young unemployed and women’s groups.
Subject to favorable rainfall and the continuation of these government measures, the rate of
inflation should be around 2 percent in 2014–2015, below the community standard of 3 percent.
25.
Terms of trade are expected to worsen in 2014, leading to a deterioration in the trade
deficit. In the medium term, the terms of trade and the trade deficit are expected to improve,
even if the current account deficit remains fairly high (owing to the statistical revision of gold
production data in 2012). Despite a drop in net foreign assets, the money supply is expected to
continue to grow faster than nominal GDP, reflecting stronger growth of private-sector credit
offset by lower banking system financing of the government.

BURKINA FASO

FISCAL POLICY FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2014
26.
The 2014 budget seeks to foster sustained, but more inclusive, growth. Growth should be
better distributed and address social concerns in a tangible manner, as a result of social
measures aimed at job creation and improving living conditions, especially for the most
vulnerable. Thus, the budget is built around the following strategic platforms: (i) strengthening
the pillars of growth; (ii) consolidating social gains; (iii) promoting local, economic, civic and
administrative governance; and (iv) stepping up national defense and internal security.
27.
To consolidate the social measures taken by the Cabinet in September 2013 to improve
living conditions, the government took further action on March 24, 2014. These actions stem
from the evaluation of the previously implemented measures conducted during an assessment
workshop on January 17, 2014. The workshop revealed genuine popular support for these
measures, based on their contribution to easing social tensions, particularly in rural areas. The
measures include raising public sector workers’ wages, improving the social safety net for
vulnerable segments of the population, creating jobs and income, and providing access to staple
goods.
28.
The total cost of the additional expenditure is 2.6 percent of GDP, and includes the
following:


Payroll, which increased by 0.6 percent of GDP after allowances were raised using a new
salary scale that had been discussed with the social partners (while streamlining the
number of allowance categories from 26 to 5). The housing allowances for all
government employees and public institutions were raised as of January 1, 2014.



The continuation of social measures initiated in September 2013 totaling 0.6 percent of
GDP. These measures include:





support for the most vulnerable segments of the population, which will make a
difference for more than 11,000 people (orphans, street children, the elderly,
people with disabilities);



creation of labor-intensive jobs, which will help roughly 20,000 people (waste
recycling workers, health care contract workers, research assistants, training for
housekeeping staff, labor market integration assistance for young professionals,
recruitment of staff for regional authorities);



increased access to financing (female entrepreneurship, informal sector
associations, small and medium enterprises) by establishing a special counter
providing a line of credit and a fund dedicated exclusively to loan guarantees for
female entrepreneurship;



easier access to staple goods through efforts to build up the special retail outlets;



academic measures by enhancing university infrastructure, boosting student
enrollment, and raising scholarship amounts;

Other small expenditures associated with updates to the electoral register for future
elections and with the security situation in Mali.

29.
To keep the deficit unchanged at 3.1 percent of GDP, the government identified
compensating measures in the form of cuts to non-priority spending, including operating

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

BURKINA FASO

expenses (acquisition of certain capital and material assets as well as overhead costs), current
transfer spending, and some investment spending that has become less of a priority in 2014
given the state of readiness of these investments. These measures were incorporated into a draft
supplementary budget that was submitted to the National Assembly on June 7.
30.
The reallocation of expenditures according to the new supplementary budget compared
to the initial budget will have a positive effect on inclusive growth because it will direct
additional resources to growth-enhancing social spending (particularly health, education, and
youth employment), while reprioritizing investment spending to maintain projects that are the
most growth-enhancing and ready to execute.
31.
Projections for program performance on the whole are in line with the targets set upon
program approval. The deficit target for the year remains unchanged. The revenue projection is
slightly lower, in keeping with more conservative estimates on performance, offset by the gains
that will be achieved through the collection of the TPP and the introduction of standardized
invoicing. The net domestic financing target is the same as at the time of program approval, less
additional financing expected from the World Bank and the African Development Bank.
32.
In order to improve budget execution, the government will pursue in 2014 the
operationalisation of verification units and their extension into other ministerial
departments, improvement of the procurement process, and reconcile the physical and financial
execution of the budget, more specifically as part of delegated project management. It will also
pursue the decentralization and delegation of spending, particularly through easing payroll
processing by extending processing units from the Payroll and General Pay Office Directorate to
other departments, and digitizing administrative documents to improve expenditure execution
times.

Government financing of publicly-owned enterprises
33.
In 2013, the government provided certain publicly-owned enterprises with assistance to
absorb past debts or ongoing operational losses. To this end, it provided SONABHY with
CFAF 26 billion in direct subsidies, and SONABEL with CFAF 12 billion in balancing subsidies, in
addition to CFAF 11 billion in oil subsidies. Given the current and accumulated operating losses
posted by these two publicly-owned enterprises, the overall financial support from the
government in 2013 accounted for close to 10 percent of budget expenditure, and about a third
of the total value of energy sales. Moreover, the government transferred CFAF 30.3 billion to
BAGREPOLE, a semi-public company, as a fixed financial contribution under the agreement
reached between the company and the government for 2013.
34.
For 2014, government transfers to publicly-owned enterprises were revised to
CFAF 48 billion. Additional expenditure in the amount of CFAF 15.7 billion was written into the
2014 draft supplementary budget. Of this amount, CFAF 12 billion is dedicated to SONABEL and
3.7 billion to SONABHY, in addition to the initial amount for capital loss, bringing the total to
CFAF 8 billion.
35.
The government plans to conduct an external audit of SONABEL and SONABHY to clearly
identify the subsidy needs of these companies in the medium term (new structural benchmark).
Depending on the results of the audit, different, more specific options could be explored to
control costs in the medium term.

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Mining sector
36.
With a view to refocusing the actions to optimize the contribution that mines make to
the national economy and to make them true drivers of development, the government
undertook to revise the mining code and mining investor guide. The draft law adopted by the
government was introduced in the National Assembly in September 2013 and then withdrawn
for further consultation with industry players regarding some of the points of contention. The
revision process is underway and the draft law should again be submitted to the National
Assembly during the fall parliamentary session. The government will ensure that this new draft
law, which draws on the recommendations made following several IMF technical assistance
missions, is consistent with applicable best practices and compares to mining codes already in
force in the subregion.
37.
This issue is one of critical importance for the future development of the economy as the
investment needed to boost infrastructure and fund development projects will be financed in
large part from the tax revenues generated from the ongoing expansion of the mining sector.
For the longer term, the government recognizes the need to improve the management and use
of natural resource revenues through exploring options for the application of an appropriate
fiscal rule, defined within the regional context.
38.
Burkina Faso joined the Initiative for Transparency in the Extractive Industries (EITI) in
2008 and was granted “compliant country” status on February 27, 2013. The country is expected
to undergo an evaluation in 2016 of the efforts it has made to maintain this status. To meet the
requirements for this exercise, it prepared its third report on the reconciliation of payments from
mining companies to the government and the revenues collected by the government from these
companies for 2011. The fourth report is currently being prepared and will cover the 2012
financial year. To help make future preparation of EITI reports more successful, the EITI-BF
Steering Committee organized a national training workshop on the EITI Standard from March
24-28, 2014, for all individuals involved in gathering information for the production of Burkina
Faso’s EITI reports. Moreover, the government is continuing consultations with mining sector
stakeholders to improve and accelerate transparency in mining in order to clean up industrial
operations, including small-scale or artisanal mining, and to ensure an adequate level of mining
revenues to fund the development projects needed to translate the natural resource boom into
significant improvements in living conditions. A company called “Société de participation minière
du Burkina Faso” was created to value the assets held by the government in mining companies,
as was a national board for securing mining sites to keep mining facilities and investments safe.

Debt policy
39.
The government will continue to update and implement the medium-term debt
management strategy (2014–16), which sets out the guidelines and criteria for external and
domestic debt and which provides a framework for debt policy over the next three years. The
main objectives of this strategy are as follows: (i) meet the government’s financing and payment
obligation needs at the lowest possible cost in the long term; (ii) maintain risks at an adequate
level, and (iii) achieve the other objectives of the authorities, such as financial market
development.
40.
The main policy thrusts are as follows: (i) minimize the cost of debt while maintaining risk
at its current level; (ii) maintain its participation in the regional financial market; and (iii) continue
to use nonconcessional resources to finance high-return or structuring projects.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

BURKINA FASO

41.
To this end, the government of Burkina Faso will continue its current strategy of using
highly concessional resources to finance the needs of its economy. External financing
denominated in euros will be given preference due to the low exchange rate risk it poses.
42.
Through its participation in the regional financial market, the government plans to
diversify its financing sources, reduce its dependence on external financing, and contribute to
the development of the financial market.
43.
As part of the current program, the government is requesting that the ceiling for
nonconcessional financing be increased from CFAF 135.9 billion to CFAF 150.0 billion.
Structuring projects for road, hydroagricultural, and business infrastructure have already been
identified which justify this increase.

STRUCTURAL REFORMS FOR THE REMAINDER OF
2014
Shorter public expenditure execution timeframes
44.
With respect to the budget, a number of major reforms will be implemented to further
reduce the time required for executing public spending. With the coming into force of amending
law no. 06/AN of January 24, 2003, which now entrusts the payment authorizing officer
(ordonnateur) with validating the expenditure according to normal procedures, the time needed
for executing public spending should become shorter. Moreover, this reform led to the
reorganization of the IT system, particularly the Integrated Expenditure Chain (Circuit Intégré de
la Dépense – CID), by making it possible for computer-based expenditure validation by the
payment authorizing officer to automatically lead to the issuance of the payment order.
45.
Another major reform is digitizing content. This reform will be monitored particularly
closely with the formal establishment of a committee responsible for overseeing the
implementation of the process through the issuance of a joint order signed by the Minister of
Finance and the Minister responsible for the Development of the Digital Economy.
46.
As regards investment spending, the committee responsible for monitoring expenditure
associated with development projects and programs, established by order
no. 2013-0070/MEF/SG/DGB of June 27, 2013, will continue its activities in 2014 with a view to
contributing to better execution of investment spending.

Improved information sharing
47.
The government will continue to roll out the tax information cross-checking module in
GERIF at other DGI sites to ensure its optimal use in improving information sharing with the
DGD. Furthermore, to ensure harmonized mining production data, a committee created for this
purpose will meet regularly.

Product diversification
48.
As part of product diversification, the government plans to develop niche products in
specific markets. Products likely to make up these niches include shea, nutsedge, and soybean.

Energy
49.
To encourage the production and use of solar energy, import exemptions for solar
equipment will be maintained. In addition, to improve its management, its governance, and
supply to its customers, SONABEL intends to develop a new strategic plan for 2014–18 based on
recommendations and action plans arising from technical assistance financed by the World Bank.
A new contract will also be drawn up between SONABEL and the government before the end of
2014.

PROGRAM ARRANGEMENTS
50.
The government intends to take all necessary steps to achieve the targets and meet the
criteria agreed upon with IMF staff, as presented in tables 1 and 2 of this memorandum. The
program will be reviewed in accordance with the Technical Memorandum of Understanding
(TMU), which sets out the quantitative performance criteria and requirements for reporting data
to IMF staff. The second and third program reviews are expected to take place in September
2014 and March 2015, or shortly thereafter.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) defines the quantitative performance
criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks that will serve to assess performance under
the program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) from 2014 to 2016. It also sets the
framework and deadlines for the submission of data to IMF staff for assessment of program
implementation.

CONDITIONALITY
1.
The quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for end-March 2014,
end-September 2014, and end-December 2014 are provided in Table 1 of the MEFP. The
structural benchmarks set forth in the program are presented in Table 2 of the MEFP.

DEFINITIONS
2.
Government. Unless otherwise indicated, the term “government” means the central
administration of Burkina Faso and does not include local administrations, the central bank, or
any other public or government-owned entity with autonomous legal status not included in the
table detailing the financial operations of the state (TOFE).
3.
Definition of debt. For the purposes of the relevant performance criteria, the definition
of debt is set out in IMF Executive Board Decision No.6230-(79/140), Point 9, as amended by
Executive Board Decision No. 14416-(09/91), published on the IMF website.
4.
Debt guarantees. For the purposes of the relevant performance criteria, a government
debt guarantee means an explicit legal obligation to service a debt in the event of nonpayment
by the borrower (through payment in cash or in kind).
5.
Debt concessionality. For the purposes of the relevant performance criteria, a debt is
considered concessional if it includes a grant element of at least 35 percent.1 The present value
(PV) of debt at the time it is contracted is calculated by discounting the borrower’s future debt
service payments on the debt.2 The discount rate used is 5.0 percent.
6.
External debt. For the purposes of the relevant performance criteria, external debt is
defined as debt contracted or serviced in a currency other than the CFA franc. This definition also
applies to debt among WAEMU countries. The relevant performance criteria apply to the
external debt of the government, public enterprises that receive government transfers, and other
public entities in which the government holds more than 50 percent of the capital, and any
private debt for which the government has extended guarantees that constitute a contingent
liability for the government.

1

The following page of the IMF website provides a tool to calculate the grant element of a wide range of
financing packages: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/conc/calculator.
2

The calculation of concessionality takes account of all aspects of the loan agreement, including maturity, grace
period, payment schedule, upfront commissions, and management fees.

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
7.
The revised quantitative performance criteria proposed for 2014 are as follows: (i) a
ceiling on net domestic financing as defined below in paragraph 10; (ii) a ceiling on the
contracting or guarantee of nonconcessional external debt by the government, as defined in
paragraphs 4 to 7, and (iii) a ceiling on the non-accumulation of payment arrears on external
debt service.

A. Net Domestic Financing
8.
For the purposes of the relevant performance criteria, net domestic financing is defined
as the sum of (i) net bank credit to the government, including net bank credit to the Treasury as
defined below and other government claims and debts vis-à-vis the domestic banking
institutions (claims associated with IMF disbursements are included); (ii) the stock of
unredeemed government bills and bonds held outside domestic commercial banks;
(iii) privatization receipts and other government claims and debts vis-à-vis national nonbank
institutions. Net bank credit to the Treasury is the balance of the Treasury’s claims and debts
vis-à-vis domestic banking institutions. Treasury claims include the cash holdings of the
Burkinabè Treasury, deposits with the central bank, deposits with commercial banks, secured
obligations, and government deposits in postal checking accounts (CCP). Treasury debt to the
banking system includes funding from the central bank (including statutory advances,
consolidated advances, IMF financing, and refinancing of secured obligations), government
securities held by the central bank, funding from commercial banks (including government
securities held by commercial banks), and securitized deposits of the national postal savings
fund (CNE/CCP). Net bank credit to the government is calculated based on information provided
by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) whose figures are deemed valid for program
purposes. The foregoing items are calculated based on the government budget execution report
presented each month in the table detailing the financial operations of the state, prepared by
the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
Adjustment
9.
The cumulative ceiling on net domestic financing will be adjusted upward in the amount
by which external program support, excluding project grants and project loans, falls short of the
projected amount, up to a maximum of CFAF 65 billion. The shortfall will be calculated by
reference to the projections in Table 1 below. The ceiling will not be adjusted downward if the
external program assistance is higher than programmed.

55

BURKINA FASO

10.
If the value of government bonds issued for the benefit of public enterprises, and sold to
commercial banks by them, falls short of projections, the cumulative ceiling on net domestic
financing will be adjusted downward in the amount equivalent to the difference between
projected and actual figures. The difference will be calculated by reference to the projections in
Table 2 below. The ceiling will not be adjusted upward if the value of the bond sales is higher
than programmed.

11.
The Ministry of the Economy and Finance will submit data on net domestic financing to
the IMF within six weeks of the end of each quarter.

B. Nonconcessional External Debt Contracted or Guaranteed by the
Government
Performance criterion
12.
The government commits not to contract or guarantee any nonconcessional external
debt beyond the ceiling indicated in MEFP Table 1. This performance criterion applies to external
debt as defined in paragraph 7 of this memorandum. It uses the concept of concessionality as
defined in paragraph 6 of this memorandum. This performance criterion also applies to any
private debt guaranteed by the government that constitutes a contingent government liability as
defined in paragraphs 4 to 7 of this memorandum. In addition, this criterion applies to public
enterprises that receive government transfers, local governments, and other public sector
entities (including public administrative, professional, scientific and technical agencies) unless
excluded in MEFP Table 1. However, this performance criterion will not apply to Treasury bills
and bonds issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU regional market, to ordinary short-term credit
from suppliers, or to IMF loans. This commitment is a performance criterion to be observed
continuously. It is measured on a cumulative basis from the IMF Executive Board’s date of
approval of the ECF, and no adjustment factor will apply.
Reporting deadlines
13.
Details on any loan (terms and creditors) contracted by the government must be
reported within four weeks of the end of each month. The same requirement applies to
guarantees extended by the government.

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

C. Non-accumulation of New External Payment Arrears
Performance criterion
14.
External payment arrears are external payments due but unpaid. Under the program the
government agrees not to accumulate external payment arrears on its debt, except arrears
arising from obligations being renegotiated with external creditors, including bilateral non-Paris
Club creditors. Nonaccumulation of new external arrears by the government is a performance
criterion, to be observed continuously.
Reporting deadlines
15.
Data on outstanding balances, accumulation, and repayment of external arrears will be
submitted within six weeks of the end of each month.

OTHER QUANTITATIVE INDICATIVE TARGETS
16.
The program also includes indicative targets for the overall deficit (commitment basis,
grants included) as defined in paragraph 19 below; total government revenue; poverty-reducing
social expenditures, and nonaccumulation of domestic payment arrears.

A. Overall Deficit Including Grants
Definition
17.
For the program, the overall deficit including grants is valued on a commitment basis. It
is defined as the sum of the government’s net foreign and domestic financing, measured from
the financing side, plus a cash basis adjustment. Net foreign financing is the sum of new external
borrowing less amortization. Government net domestic financing is defined in paragraphs 10–11
above. The cash basis adjustment is defined as the sum of: (i) the total change in unauthorized
expenditure commitments, (ii) the change in pending bills, and (iii) the change in Treasury
deposits.
Adjustment
18.
The ceiling on the overall fiscal deficit, including grants, will be adjusted upward in the
amount by which external program grants falls short of the projected amount, up to a maximum
of CFAF 65 billion. The shortfall will be calculated by reference to the projections in Table 3
below. The ceiling will not be adjusted downward in the event that actual external program
assistance is higher than programmed.
19.
The ceiling on the overall fiscal deficit, including grants, will be adjusted downward in the
amount equivalent to the difference between projected and actual project loans if the actual
figures are lower than projected. The overall fiscal deficit, including grants, will be adjusted
upward in the amount equivalent to the difference between projected and actual project loans if
the actual figures are higher than projected. The difference in the amount will be calculated by
reference to the projections in Table 3 below.

financing will be adjusted downward of the amount equivalent to the difference between
projected and actual figures. The difference will be calculated by reference to the projections in
Table 2 above. The ceiling will not be adjusted upward if the value of the bond sales is higher
than programmed.

B. Total Government Revenue
Definition
21.
Total government revenue is valued on a cash basis. It includes all tax and nontax
revenue collected by the Directorate General of Taxation, the Directorate General of Customs,
the Burkinabè Treasury, and revenue collection units at ministries and institutions. It also
includes revenue from treasury checks.

C. Poverty-Reducing Social Expenditures Definition
22.
Poverty-reducing social expenditures are defined as the expenditures supporting the
priority programs identified in the Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy
(SCADD) to accelerate the achievement of poverty reduction objectives. Such expenditures cover
all spending categories for the following ministries: Promotion of Women and Gender Issues;
Health; Social Action and National Solidarity; National Education and Literacy; Agriculture and
Food Security; Animal Resources; Environment and Sustainable Development; Youth,
Professional Training and Employment including the labor and social security components of
Civil Service, Labor, and Social Security; Water, Hydraulic Improvements, and Sanitation. They
also cover spending on rural roads and Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative
(Category 5) for Infrastructure, Integration, and Transport; and HIPC expenditures only for
Communication; Justice and Human Rights; Economy and Finance; and Mines, Quarries, and
Energy ministries. Added to this is the allocation under section 98 “transfers to subnational
governments” from Health, Agriculture and Food Security as well as National Education and
Literacy. These expenditures are monitored directly through the budget, and the indicative
threshold for the program will be 90 percent of the amount established by the budget authority.

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

D. Non-accumulation of Domestic Payment Arrears
Definition
23.
The government will not accumulate payment arrears on domestic obligations during
the program period. This is an indicative target. Under the program, domestic payment arrears
arise when actual payment is made more than 90 days after liability is incurred for an undisputed
debt to a third party, except in cases where the terms and conditions of the transaction stipulate
a longer period. In the case of debt service, arrears arise 30 days after the due date. Payments
are deemed to be in arrears according to the following definition:


Debt unpaid for more than 30 days after the due date stipulated in the agreement between the
parties (creditor/debtor).



Unpaid wages or pensions 90 days after their due date.



Payments for services rendered received by the supplier more than 90 days after processing of the
supporting documents submitted by the supplier.

D. Additional Information for Program Monitoring
24.
To enable IMF staff to assess program performance, the government agrees to submit
the following data, in paper format and/or MSC Excel electronic files, consistent with the
frequency and deadlines specified below.

Annex I. External Stability Assessment
The current account deficit has increased to about 10 percent of GDP in 2013, but it is expected to
improve progressively over the medium term as investment and gold exports stabilize. Non-debt
creating flows—official transfers and FDI—constitutes the main source of external financing.
Various analyses indicate that the current account and real effective exchange rate remain broadly
in line with the country’s fundamentals. There is also no indication of current account disequilibria
and real effective exchange rate misalignment at the regional level. Official WAEMU reserves
remain adequate. Structural competitiveness has been improving in some respects, but much
remains to be done, in particular to develop infrastructure and increase energy supply.

Balance of payments
1. The current account deficit (excluding grants) has increased recently reflecting
important investment and falling gold exports.1 The deficit has increased from 5.7 percent of
GDP in 2011 (its lower historical level) to about 8 percent in 2012 and 10 percent of GDP 2013
reflecting raising investment and falling gold exports. Investment, in particular public ones,
increased from about 16 percent of GDP in 2011 to about 21 percent of GDP in 2013. The trade
balance mirrored these developments deteriorating from a zero balance in 2011 to -1.4 percent
in 2012 and -3.3 percent in 2013. The current account deficit is expected to decrease gradually
from 9.8 percent of GDP in 2014 to about 8.5 percent of GDP in 2019 as investment
(progressively financed by national saving) and export growth would stabilize.
2. Grants and foreign direct investment (FDI) constitute the main source of external
financing. Official—current and capital—transfers have remained at about 6-6.5 percent of GDP
over the last 3 years and are expected to decrease only slightly in the medium term. After
increasing to above 2 percent of GDP, FDI is expected to stay at about 1 percent of GDP over the
medium term. Portfolio investment has been low accounting for about 0.1 percent of GDP over
the last decade. Overall, non-debt creating flows are projected to remain a predominate source
of current account deficit financing.

Price competitiveness
3. The real effective exchange rate (REER) assessment does not indicate significant
misalignments and price-competitiveness issues at the country level. The nominal effective
exchange rate appreciated by about 9 percent since the beginning of 2013, mirroring to the
large extent the euro appreciation. The real effective exchange rates, however, appreciated only
moderately by about 4 percent owing to moderating inflation pressure in the region and
remained close to its historical average. A model-based assessment (Box 1) does not point to
significant misalignments of the real effective exchange rate.

Regional price competitiveness and reserves adequacy
4. The regional external stability assessment indicates the real effective exchange rate is
broadly in line with regional fundamentals and official reserves coverage remains
adequate.2
1

The assessment here is based on the current account excluding grants on the basis this wider measure of
external balance allows for measurement of vulnerability to all external flows, including program assistance.

2

WAEMU Staff Report on Common Policies for Member States (IMF Country Report 14/84).

62

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

5. The real effective exchange rate appreciated by about 4 percent since the beginning
of 2013 reflecting nominal effective appreciation and favourable inflationary
developments. The CGER methodology applied to the WAEMU points to small—positive and
negative—deviations confirming that there is no significant price-competitiveness issue at the
regional level. Although official regional reserves are estimated to decline in from
CFAF 7051 billion at end-2012 to CFAF 6886 billion at end-2013, reserves coverage remains
adequate at about 4.7 months of the following year’s extra-regional imports.

Structural competitiveness
6. There is a need for further improving structural competitiveness. Various
competitiveness indicators rank Burkina Faso among the best performers in the region. Further
efforts, however, are necessary to improve business and investment climate.


The World Bank “Doing Business” indicators show that in certain respects the country’s
situation has significantly improved over the last decade (Figure 2). Burkina Faso scores
relatively well in dealing with construction permits, starting a business and protecting
investor rights. The standard of transport infrastructure remains insufficient. Therefore,
trading across borders and ensuring access to a reliable supply of electricity remain
relatively more challenging constraints relative to other WAEMU countries. Access to
finance and registration of property continue to be cumbersome. Progress overall has been
maintained in the last 2 years and Burkina Faso is now the highest ranking country in the
region on the basis of these indicators (Table 2). These results broadly confirm those
presented in the Selected Issues paper on Inclusive Growth.



The World Bank Governance Indicators (WGI) also rank Burkina Faso among the best
performers in the region, especially regarding regulatory quality and rule of law. The
indicators show, however, a moderate deterioration over the last 5 years.

First, the macroeconomic balance approach estimates the equilibrium current account balance
compatible with the country’s medium-term fundamentals. This approach indicates that the exchange
rate should depreciate by about 7 percent to close the gap between the equilibrium and underlying
current account balances. The second method estimates the equilibrium real exchange rate as a
function of medium-term fundamentals which points to an overvaluation of about 4 percent of the
actual real effective exchange rate. Finally, the external sustainability approach derives the current
account norm that stabilizes net foreign assets at its 2012 level (24 percent of GDP). This method
indicates that about 9-percent depreciation is needed to close the gap between the underlying and
equilibrium current account.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
FIRST REVIEW UNDER THE THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT
UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY, AND REQUEST
FOR WAIVER AND MODIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE
CRITERIA—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Michael Atingi Ego
and Peter Allum (IMF)
and Jeffrey D. Lewis
and Marcelo Giugale
(IDA)

Prepared jointly by the staffs of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the International Development Association
(IDA)

This joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) has been prepared in the
context of the First Review under the program supported by the IMF’s Three-Year
Extended Credit Arrangement (ECF). It is based on new end-2013 debt data. Based on
lower WEO projections for gold prices and projected higher spending, the current account
and fiscal balances are notably worse, with an impact on growth through the medium
term. A downward adjustment to actual gold production statistics in 2012 and 2013
significantly worsened the current account balance, thus worsening the projection profile.
A cautious assumption is made that gold mining reserves will begin facing depletion
around 2022, not fully compensated by other mineral exports. Under these assumptions,
none of the external debt ratios under the baseline scenario breach their respective
indicative debt distress thresholds, but one of the standardized stress tests shows a
breach, indicating that Burkina Faso’s risk rating for debt distress remains moderate.1 To
supplement the standardized DSA treatment, staff has constructed an alternate scenario
with a significant near term “growth shock.” Under this scenario, the same standardized
stress test shows an earlier breach in addition to a new breach under a different stress
test.

Burkina Faso’s latest CPIA score is 3.8, which places the country’s policy and institutional framework in the
group of ‘strong’ performers.

BACKGROUND AND UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
1.
Burkina Faso’s nominal stock of debt as of end-2013 was 29.1 percent of GDP, equivalent to
approximately US$3.6 billion (Table 1). Although up slightly from end-2012, this amount is lower
than what had been assumed in the 2013 DSA (US$3.9 billion). The composition of debt shifted
slightly more toward domestic debt, reflecting large issuances of government bonds in 2013, delayed
donor disbursements, as well as exchange rate appreciation. About 75 percent of the total stock of
debt at end-2013 was external debt, down from 81 percent at end-2012.

2.
Table 2 and Box 1 summarize the main differences in macroeconomic assumptions
between the previous DSA (July 2013) and this one. The most significant changes are gold price
projections and their attendant impacts; retroactive revisions to gold production data by the
authorities (Annex III, Box 1); and WEO projections for nominal exchange rate appreciation through
the medium term. In the near term, somewhat lower growth is assumed, although this is harmonized
with growth over the medium term. Maintaining spending roughly constant at current levels, these
assumptions lead to higher fiscal and external deficits over the medium term. Moreover, the current
account balance is expected to deteriorate further starting in 2022 when gold production slows,
although there is modest improvement in fiscal and external balances in the longer run, as spending
levels and imports adjust.

This DSA assumes continued modest use of nonconcessional financing over the
forecast horizon. The authorities have already signed contracts using about 60 percent of the
program continuous PC on nonconcessional external debt, mainly for the Donsin airport project and
a road connecting Dedougou to Tougan northwest of the capital. The authorities have requested an
upward modifications of the program continuous PC on nonconcessional external debtby
approximately 0.2 percent of GDP in order to finance two additional highway projects (Table a. and
Box 2).
4.
The DSA includes both already-contracted and anticipated borrowing on a
disbursement basis. The authorities have reiterated their ongoing commitment to rely as much as
possible on available concessional financing, but in light of limited concessional resources, this DSA
includes an assumption that nonconcessional borrowing will be continued, at modest levels, through
the DSA horizon. Consistent with this and the conservative assumption of less concessional financing
going forward, the grant element of new borrowing is assumed to decrease gradually over the
forecast horizon, especially toward the outer years.

Gold prices have dropped significantly since the last
DSA. WEO projections have dropped as well, by an
average of 20 percent over the forecast horizon.

The overall fiscal deficit (including grants) is based on relatively stable, but higher spending levels, and
revenues that fluctuate in line with gold exports. The deficit increases after gold production slows beyond
2022 and expenditures remain unchanged. In the long run, the deficit begins to improve as spending
adjusts.
Debt composition: Domestic debt is assumed to increase modestly through the forecast horizon, reflecting
the authorities’ efforts to deepen domestic and regional financial markets. The remainder of the deficit is
financed via external debt, but on less generous terms to reflect some nonconcessional financing and a
more cautious assumption about ability to borrow at concessional terms going forward (the impact on the
net present value is partly offset by use of a higher discount rate, as explained in paragraph 4).
The current account deficit is significantly larger throughout the forecast horizon than in the 2013 DSA,
due to the authorities’ revisions to gold production data for 2012 and 2013. This, plus gold price
projections, render export projections significantly lower in the current DSA compared to the 2013 DSA. The
current account deficit forecast mimics that of the fiscal balance, with a deterioration following an
assumption of gradual depletion of gold reserves, with a delay in the adjustment of import levels.

Box 2. Burkina Faso: Nonconcessional Borrowing
The nonconcessional borrowing for which approximately 83.2 bln CFAF has already been signed relates
mainly to the Donsin Airport project and the highway project between Dedougou and Tougan. The
remaining 64.5 bln CFAF that has not been signed is envisioned for two additional highway projects. Of this
64.5 bln CFAF, 12 billion is upward adjustment requested to the continuous PC on nonconcessional external
debt.
The new airport project involves the revamping of the existing one from the city proper to 35 kilometers
northwest of Ouagadougou. A World Bank feasibility study determined that the envisioned benefits would
outweigh the costs, and supported its construction. Currently, two loans have been signed relating to the
project. The first one is by the amount of 50 bln CFAF, financed by the Islamic Development Bank (BID) at an
interest rate of 2.5 percent (grant element of 22 percent); this has been ratified by the National Assembly in
March of this year. The second loan, in the amount of 5 bln CFAF, financed by ECOWAS, at an interest rate of
3 percent (grant element of 23 percent), is expected to be official soon.
The remaining loans relate to three highway projects that involve the bituminous surface treatment (BST) of
existing roads or construction of new roads with BST treatment to improve road access. BST is usually used
on low-traffic roads, but also as a type of sealing to rejuvenate an existing asphalt pavement. The first
project for which 28.2 bln CFAF has been signed with BID at an interest rate of 2.5 percent (grant element of
20 percent) is a highway connecting Dedougou to Tougan northwest of the capital, approximately 92 km of
distance. The loans for the remaining projects are estimated to be 25.7 and 38.8 CFAF bln respectively, but
the financing has not yet been secured. The first project is a construction of a new road between Guiba and
Garango, south-east of the country. The second is the construction of two connected highways that
eventually connect Kantchari, located to the east of Ouagadougou near the Niger Border, to Tansarga, near
the Benin border, involving approximately 70 km of paved road.

DSA RESULTS
A.

External Debt

5.
The 2014 DSA results are broadly unchanged from the 2013 exercise, reflecting a
moderate risk of debt distress (Figure 2 and Table 1). The more pessimistic external and fiscal
balances are offset by the higher discount rate, lower starting nominal external debt levels than had
been assumed in the 2013 exercise, and revised assumptions about the mix of domestic and external
financing. In the baseline scenario, all debt ratios continue to remain below the risk thresholds. Even
with the less optimistic fiscal and external outlooks and the assumption for continued
nonconcessional borrowing, the PV of external debt to exports peaked at 174.4 percent in 2034, still
below the 200 percent debt risk threshold.2

2

Residual figures in the external debt baseline are higher than in the 2013 DSA on account of the much larger current
account deficit in 2012 and 2013 caused by the revision in official gold production data while actual fiscal results and
debt accumulation remained unchanged. This discrepancy between the accrual of debt from the fiscal and estimated
debt creating flows from the external balance likely reflects the underestimation of artisanal gold production/exports
in the official data, as discussed in Box 1 of Annex III.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

6.
As in the past, the risk threshold for the PV of debt to exports is breached only in the
case of one of the standardized stress tests. The breach is similar to that of the 2013 DSA. The
stress test reflects a shock to exports, assuming that the growth of exports is reduced by one
standard deviation in 2015–16. Indeed, volatility of gold prices remains an important vulnerability to
exports. Under this shock scenario, exports are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level,
but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock,
implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in imports.

B. Total Public Debt DSA Results
7.
The current DSA assumes a continued modest increase in domestic financing, bringing
debt levels higher relative to the 2013 DSA, although the debt to GDP ratio remains below the
relevant WAEMU convergence criterion. This assumption stems from progress already underway
in expanding the domestic bond market, and plans to expand the regional market and develop more
secondary markets. Under a fairly conservative assumption, this DSA assumes close to current terms
for new domestic financing, which have fixed bid schemes and may be overly generous given the
large oversubscription of recent bond issuances. However, the authorities are already considering
variable bid schemes and other means to bring down the costs of domestic financing, and allow
more precision for the amounts and timing thereof.

C. An Alternate Lower Growth Scenario
8.
To challenge the robustness of the macroeconomic framework projections and the DSA
results, staff constructed an alternative scenario. Since a gold price shock was explored in the
2012 and 2013 DSAs and is embodied in the standard stress tests, staff constructed an alternative
scenario to test the sensitivity of the analysis to a near term shock to growth, stemming from a
drought, but without recourse to additional budget support. In effect, this shock simply exaggerates
the existing weather/growth patterns seen in the past. The shock is assumed to hit in the second half
of 2014, reducing projected growth from 6.7 to 6.0 percent. The larger impact of the shock is felt in
2015, with projected growth slashed to 4.5 percent (from 6.8 percent). Public spending in 2015 would
increase sharply to address food security needs and farm gate price subsidies to cotton farmers in
addition to other spending aimed at muting the impact of the shock. At the same time, fiscal
revenues would be affected by lower growth, causing a sharp increase in the deficit to 5.2 percent of
GDP in 2015 (compared to 3.1 percent in the baseline), taking into account offsetting spending
adjustment of 0.5 percent of GDP affecting domestically-financed investment.
9.
Without additional budget support, the remaining fiscal deficit would be met by
higher domestic financing and more expensive external financing. Of the 2.1 percentage points
of GDP increase in the deficit, approximately 10 percent would be financed by additional domestic
financing, and the rest would be met by additional nonconcessional external financing. Under this
scenario, lower investment spending would be assumed to have an impact on growth and the fiscal
deficit over the next 3 years, leading to higher accrual of debt. The current account deteriorates less
relative to the baseline, as exports are assumed unchanged (with mining unaffected and cotton

6

BURKINA FASO

affected only marginally due to irrigation and GMO seeds) and lower growth and investment is
assumed to have a dampening effect on import demand. The use of more nonconcessional external
financing was proxied in the DSA framework by reducing the overall grant element of new financing
for the medium term down to an approximate average of 10 percent.
10.
DSA results under this scenario show a higher risk of debt distress, albeit with the risk
rating remaining “moderate.” On its own this scenario causes a near breach in the PV of
debt-to-exports and in combining it with standardized stress tests, both PV of debt-to-exports and
debt-to-GDP thresholds are breached. These results, even maintaining gold unchanged, indicate a
clearer “moderate” risk of debt distress than the baseline, which is on the cusp of “moderate” and
“low.” However, all DSA results should be interpreted with caution, particularly given uncertain
assumptions about the investment-growth nexus, outdated national account statistics, and balance
of payments data still under revision.

CONCLUSION
11.
The DSA results indicate that Burkina Faso’s risk of debt distress remains “moderate.”
The baseline scenario shows no breach of debt distress thresholds for any of the indicators. However,
the debt-distress threshold for the PV of debt-to-exports is breached under the standardized stress
test of a shock to exports. An alternative low growth scenario combined with the standardized stress
tests, shows an earlier breach of this indicator and a breach of the PV of debt-to-GDP.

Authorities’ Views
12.
The assumptions and conclusions of the DSA were discussed with the authorities who
broadly concurred with the assessment and with maintaining a “moderate” debt risk rating. They
thought that the alternative scenario of an impact on growth due to a weather shock was useful for
considering realistic risks. On domestic debt issuance, they indicated that the new regional debt
issuance entity, “Agence UMOA Titres” has been established, and that domestic debt will be issued
on variable-bid schemes going forward. The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to seek
concessional financing to the greatest extent possible, but they continue to be concerned about the
limited availability of such financing for large investment projects.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts cannot be added.
3

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.
4

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the assistance. Grant
assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt owed to the
Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

Safeguards Assessments
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is a common central bank of the countries
of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAMU). The latest assessment of the
BCEAO was completed on December 13, 2013. The assessment found that the bank continued to
have a strong control environment and has, with the implementation of the 2010 Institutional
Reform of the WAMU, enhanced its governance framework. Specifically, an audit committee was
established to oversee the audit and financial reporting processes, transparency has increased with
more timely publication of the audited financial statements, and the BCEAO is committed to IFRS
implementation by end-2014. The assessment also identified some limitations in the external audit
process and recommended that steps be taken to ensure the adequacy of the mechanism through
selection of a second experienced audit firm to conduct joint audits.
Exchange System
Burkina Faso is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The
exchange system, common to all members of the union, is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The union's common currency, the
CFA franc, had been pegged to the French franc at the rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Effective
January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was devalued and the new parity set at CFAF 1 = F 0.01. Effective
December 31, 1998, the parity was switched to the euro at a rate of CFAF 655.96 = €1.
The authorities confirmed that Burkina Faso had not imposed measures that could give rise to
exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. They will inform the Fund, if any such measure
is introduced.
Aspects of the exchange system were also discussed in the report “WAEMU: Common Policies
of Member Countries" (Country Report No. 13/92 of March 8, 2013).
Article IV Consultations
The periodicity of Burkina Faso’s Article IV consultation is set in accordance with the
July 15, 2002 Executive Board Decision on consultation cycles. Discussions took place in
Ouagadougou during September 29–October 14, 2011 for the 2011 Article IV Consultation and the
third review under the Extended Credit Facility. The latest Article IV consultation was completed by
the Executive Board on December 21, 2011 (Country Report No.12/158). In concluding the 2011
Article IV consultation, Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ sustained implementation of
sound policies and structural reforms, which has contributed to robust economic growth, low
inflation, and a broadly favorable external position. They underscored that continued fiscal
consolidation, improved social policies, and decisive implementation of structural reforms will be
critical to achieve sustained, broad-based economic growth and poverty reduction. Directors agreed
with the authorities’ focus on scaling up investment to close the infrastructure gap and boost
economic growth and stressed the need to improve investment efficiency, within financing
strategies that are consistent with long-term debt sustainability.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The most
affected areas are: national accounts and price statistics. Burkina Faso has received technical assistance
(TA) from the IMF; the TA has been partially financed by Japan.

BURKINA FASO

National accounts: Annual GDP estimates are compiled by economic activity, by institutional sector
accounts and by expenditure categories at current and constant prices (1999=100). Data quality is
affected by the scarcity of suitable sources and deficiencies in statistical practices. Weaknesses include:
coverage of the informal sector (due to limited, out of date surveys, and a failure of small enterprises to
submit accounting statements or tax declarations); private household consumption, which is not
adequately validated with supply-use tables and updated household budget-consumption surveys.
Price statistics: The CPI (2008=100) only covers African households in the capital; it excludes various
types of purchased goods and services, and services of owner-occupied dwellings and prices of
unavailable products are presumed unchanged for up to three months rather than imputed from
recorded prices changes of closely related products. The producer price index and the wholesale price
index are neither compiled nor envisaged due to budgetary constraints.
Government finance statistics: A committee was put in place to oversee the compilation of government
finance statistics and strengthen coordination among fiscal agencies. The provision of expenditure data
has also improved with the adoption of functional presentation of expenditure. The remaining areas for
improvement include mainly the extension of the TOFE coverage to the general government and basing
its compilation on the Treasury ledger.
Monetary finance statistics: Most of the problems in monetary statistics are not specific to Burkina Faso
but affect all member countries of the WAEMU. The BCEAO has encountered difficulties in estimating
currency in circulation in each WAEMU member country due to large backlogs of unsorted banknotes
held by the central bank in its various national agencies.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Burkina Faso participates in the General Data Dissemination Standard since December 28, 2001. A data
ROSC visited Burkina Faso during May 8-21, 2003.
III. Reporting to STA
Balance of payments (BOP): The coverage of informal trade is incomplete and that of services and
transfers (especially workers’ remittances) depends on contacts with reporting bodies. Annual surveys,
reporting FDI transactions, are conducted yearly. BCEAO authorities have indicated that quarterly data
derived from banking settlement reports are used to assess BOP reports; payment statements provide
early information and support data quality controls. The BCEAO has started publishing IIP data in line
with the BPM 6 format and has revised its surveys design and software accordingly. The BCEAO does not
provide any metadata (describing its methodology). It participates in ECID surveys corresponding to
direct investment presented on a bilateral basis (with partner countries).
Government Finance: Since October 2010, annual data and quarterly data covering budgetary central
government are reported to STA for publication in International Financial Statistics and the Government
Finance Statistics yearbook. The latest reported data cover 2012. The BCEAO reports monetary data to
STA with a lag of at most three months.

Press Release No. 14/330
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 3, 2014

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes First Review Under Extended Credit Facility
Arrangement, Approves US$3.9 Million Disbursement, and Concludes 2014 Article IV
Consultation with Burkina Faso
On July 3, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund completed the first
review of Burkina Faso’s economic performance under a three-year program supported by
the IMF’s Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement, and also concluded the 2014 Article
IV Consultation1 with Burkina Faso. The completion of the first review enables the
immediate release of an amount equivalent to SDR 2.55 million (about US$3.9 million),
bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to an amount equivalent to SDR 5.1
million (about US$7.9 million).
In completing the first review, the Executive Board also approved the authorities’ requests
for a waiver for nonobservance of the end-December 2013 performance criterion on net
domestic financing, and for modification of the continuous performance criterion on nonconcessional external debt and modification of the performance criterion on net domestic
financing for the end-June and end-December 2014 periods. The 36-month ECF arrangement
in the amount equivalent to SDR 27.09 million (about US$41.9 million, or 45 percent of
Burkina Faso’s quota at the IMF) was approved by the Executive Board on December 27,
2013 (see Press Release 13/542).
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Burkina Faso, Mr. David Lipton, First
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair issued the following statement:
“Burkina Faso has a long track record of strong macroeconomic policy management,
supported by IMF programs. Structural reforms to improve productivity and resilience in
agriculture and increased spending for poverty reduction and food security have resulted in
robust growth rates and progress toward the Millennium Development Goals.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

“Burkina Faso’s performance under the new ECF-supported program has been satisfactory,
with all structural reforms implemented and most quantitative targets reached. Growth has
remained robust and the fiscal deficit has been contained. While the outlook for growth
remains strong, there are challenges arising from unfavorable terms of trade in the near term.
However, fiscal deficits should remain contained around 3 percent of GDP, due to spending
adjustment and increased grants. As gold prices recover over the medium term, external
balances should improve. The risk of debt distress remains classified as “moderate”.
“The authorities have reaffirmed their strong commitment to the program against the
backdrop of a more challenging policy environment. Three macroeconomic challenges have
been identified to set the foundation for progress over the longer term. First, ensuring that the
quality and composition of spending allows scaling up critical investment, both in
infrastructure and people, needed to support private sector-led growth. Second, accelerating
investments for increased and more reliable electricity supplies to meet growing demand,
while putting the energy sector on a more financially-sustainable footing and scaling down
untargeted subsidies. Finally, updating the mining code to harness natural resource revenues,
and creating mechanisms, such as a fiscal rule, to direct them toward growth-enhancing
spending over a multi-year horizon.”
The Executive Board also completed the 2014 Article IV consultation with Burkina
Faso.
Over the past two decades, Burkina Faso has experienced sustained stable and higher growth,
with progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The country has a long
track record of strong macroeconomic policy management, supported by consecutive IMFsupported economic programs. The authorities have taken a number of measures to improve
productivity and resilience in agriculture, boost revenue collection, and increase spending for
poverty reduction and food security.
Growth remained robust in 2013 at 6.6 percent, although slightly lower than average due to
the impact of erratic rain on agricultural yield and weaker terms of trade. Inflation hovered
around zero, reflecting low food prices. The fiscal deficit was 3.5 percent, slightly higher
than expected, mainly due to revenue shortfalls. The current account deficit worsened, due to
lower gold prices and sustained imports.
For this year, the authorities have submitted a supplemental budget reflecting an increase in
the wage bill (0.6 percent of GDP) and increased social transfers (0.6 percent of GDP).
However, to maintain an unchanged fiscal deficit, the new spending will be financed by
additional grants and reduced non-priority spending, mainly in investment, also reflecting a
reprioritization in favor of energy projects and more “shovel-ready” projects.

3

Going forward, growth is expected to remain around 7 percent, inflation around 2 percent,
and the fiscal deficit (including grants) at around 3 percent of GDP. The current account
deficit is expected to stabilize at 7 per cent of GDP as terms of trade improve over the
medium term. Risks to the outlook are weather, further terms of trade deterioration, pressure
to spend more on untargeted subsidies and public wage increases, and political transition.
Executive Board Assessment2:
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their long track record of sound
macroeconomic management and structural reforms that have led to robust growth. Good
progress has been made towards achieving the development goals, supported by increased
investment and poverty-reducing spending. Performance under the Fund-supported program
has been satisfactory. While the medium-term outlook is favorable, significant challenges are
posed by public spending pressures, energy constraints, and liabilities associated with public
enterprises. Directors emphasized that continued strong ownership and commitment to
prudent policies and structural reforms will safeguard the macroeconomic gains and foster
long-term sustainable and inclusive growth.
Directors underscored the need to contain fiscal expenditure, including by bringing the wage
bill back in line with WAEMU rules, while maintaining priority spending in the areas of
infrastructure, health, and education. Directors supported plans to continue improving
revenue collection through new administrative measures. While welcoming the planned audit
of key public enterprises, Directors encouraged the authorities to give consideration to
gradual adjustments of retail fuel prices. At the same time, and recognizing the complexity of
this issue, they also called for addressing energy supply constraints through planned
acceleration of projects to increase power generation and operational efficiency which are
critical to alleviating growth constraints. Noting that energy supply shortages are an issue
throughout the region, Directors encouraged more focus on regional approaches to help
address the problem.
Directors stressed the importance of harnessing natural resource revenues to finance
development. They welcomed Burkina Faso’s EITI compliance, and looked forward to an
updated mining tax code that is aligned with best international practice, since these revenues
will be critical for financing the country’s development needs. To help manage the use of
natural resource revenues in the face of volatile commodity prices and investment capacity
constraints, they encouraged consideration of a fiscal rule, consistent with WAEMU rules.
To ensure debt sustainability, Directors recommended that the authorities limit
non-concessional borrowing to high-return projects, and continue to improve debt
management capacity.
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

4

Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to enhance spending in key priority areas,
as outlined in their development program. In scaling up investment spending for human and
infrastructure capital, Directors encouraged a strong focus on the quality of spending,
through careful project selection and results-monitoring. In particular, they called for more
attention to higher education and job training programs. Directors supported the authorities’
efforts to expand access to financial services.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue efforts to update the base year for national
accounts statistics, in order to better assess evolving sources of economic growth and
structural transformation.

Statement by Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director for Burkina Faso
and Ngueto Tiraina Yambaye, Alternate Executive Director
July 3, 2014
On behalf of our Burkinabe authorities, we would like to thank the Management and the
Board for the Fund’s continuous support to Burkina Faso. The authorities are also thankful
for staff’s timely and constructive policy advice and for the technical assistance. The close
dialogue and mutual understanding which characterized the first ECF program review and
article IV consultations discussions are well reflected in the staff papers.
Background
Burkina Faso is at a crossroads. While much progress has been realized in poverty reduction
with the support of the international community, the countries’ development needs remain
significant. Notably the economy remains vulnerable to commodities price volatility and
agricultural activities remain exposed to weather and rain variations. Besides addressing
immediate social needs, there is a pressing demand for increased employment opportunities
particularly for women and the youth. After several years of superior growth performance,
the authorities are faced with increasing social demands to translate high growth rates into
inclusive and shared prosperity.
Against this background, the authorities have intensified their efforts to maintain
macroeconomic stability while strengthening the foundations for a sustained and inclusive
growth, in line with their homegrown Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Sustained
Development (SCADD).
A mid-period review of SCADD implementation found that 63.2 of actions planned were
already implemented. An evaluation of social spending was also conducted which led the
authorities to adjust their spending priorities and unveil a new package of targeted
expenditures, including transfers to vulnerable groups and the creation of additional laborintensive shovel ready jobs programs.
Burkina Faso has met all the program’s structural benchmarks for end-January and endMarch 2014, as well as all quantitative performance criteria except for the performance
criterion for net domestic financing for which corrective action was taken. To help
complement their reforms efforts, and catalyze external support, the authorities are
requesting continued Fund assistance and the completion of the first ECF program review.
Recent Economic Developments
The economy registered a 6.6 percent growth rate in 2013 driven by services and the growth
in mining sector activities. At 0.1 percent in December 2013, inflation was comfortably
below regional standards. The current account deteriorated to 7 percent of GDP as imports of
capital goods and oil products increased, while exports fell, driven by lower gold prices. The

-2-

net foreign assets position declined sharply in 2013 due to one-off factors including the
failure by some financial institutions to comply with the region-wide foreign exchange
surrender requirements.
Fiscal policy focused on creating the fiscal space for inclusive growth measures and
preserving medium term fiscal sustainability. Years of modernization efforts, a broadened tax
base, and improvements in tax compliance enforcement continued to pay off as revenue
mobilization grew by 12 percent in 2013. A key milestone was reached in the launch of the
Tax Information Cross-Checking Management software, GERIF.
Although poverty reducing spending increased and domestically financed capital spending
turned out as planned, spending under-execution continued. The authorities took steps to
address these including by providing for increased social spending in the second quarter of
2014. Moreover, the findings of the workshop on procedural reforms and the definition of
responsibilities for all expenditure chain participants was incorporated in the Budget law with
the view to improving spending quality and execution rate.
Spending was reallocated towards priority sectors. As mentioned above, a package of social
spending initiatives was unveiled by the authorities to foster a shared prosperity in Burkina.
These measures aimed at providing labor intensive employment opportunities, job training
programs and support to small and medium-sized enterprises with a focus on opportunities
for woman and the youth. In order to preserve fiscal sustainability, the authorities off set the
additional spending with cuts in budget appropriations to non-priority sectors and
investments allocation that was not yet ready to be executed. As a result the projected budget
deficit target was maintained.
With respect to the financial sector, the authorities continued implementing their financial
development strategy with the adoption by SONAPOST of options to expand access to
financial services leveraging its geographical range. Regulatory and supervisory efforts were
also stepped up to ensure that the financial system remained sound.
On structural reforms, the authorities pursued the implementation of SCADD. Notably a
public-private corporation was set up to facilitate investments in the Bagré growth hub.
Efforts were also made to improve the financial soundness of state owed companies as well
as public sector efficiency. In this vein, the state-owned electricity company, SONABEL’s
financial model was revised, and the committee responsible for coordinating the
implementation of the computerization initiative and make it operational was installed.
To remove energy supply constraints and diversify the sources of electricity, the authorities
undertook a number of projects, including the construction of solar and thermal plants.
With respect to the mining sector, the authorities pursued efforts to increase transparency in
the management of this sector. Hence, Burkina Faso reached a key EITI milestone by
achieving compliance status.
Policies for the Remainder of 2014 and the Medium-Term Framework

-3-

The authorities’ policies going forward will continue to be anchored by SCADD. A major
accomplishment of SCADD includes the successful launch of the Bagré growth hub. Plans
are underway to strengthen further implementation capacity at the regional and sector level
and to leverage public-private partnerships in achieving SCADD’s objectives.
The authorities plan, going forward, to scale up their efforts to promote an inclusive growth
agenda and shared prosperity, while preserving macroeconomic stability.
Fiscal Policy
Fiscal policy will continue to remain prudent, seeking to achieve the Government’s growth
and social advancement initiatives while preserving fiscal sustainability. Efforts will continue
to be made to further improve revenue mobilization including with the expansion of the
deployment of the Tax Information Cross-Checking Management software, GERIF.
Spending aimed at promoting a higher and shared prosperity will be scaled up. Amongst
major programs planned is the launch of four new growth hubs, major infrastructure
spending, and labor intensive projects. The authorities also plan to take measures to increase
access to financing for female entrepreneurship, informal sector associations and small and
medium term enterprises. To strengthen the social safety net, the authorities plan to
implement a universal health insurance; and further education spending including the hiring
of teachers, and enhancing university infrastructure.
To achieve these goals while preserving fiscal sustainability they plan to improve spending
efficiency, cut non-priority outlays and implement additional reforms aimed at improving
public financial management. Progress will continue to be made towards the adoption of
program budgeting. To address recurring delays in spending execution, the authorities plan to
implement the streamlined budget process, and to further improve the procurement
processes.
Debt policy
The authorities remain committed to preserving debt sustainability. Steps will be taken to
improve debt management capabilities. They are also committed to have to recourse to
concessional financing in priority and to rely on non-concessional financing only for vetted
high economic impact projects within the program’s limits.
