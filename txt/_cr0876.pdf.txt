•
Discussions were held in Kabul from October 30─November 15, 2007. The mission met
with Senior Minister Arsala; Minister of Finance Ahady; former Governor of Da Afghanistan Bank
(DAB) Delawari;1 Minister of Commerce and Industry Farhang; other government officials; and
representatives of Parliament, the diplomatic and donor communities, and the private sector.
•
The staff team comprised Mr. Elhage (head), Ms. Farahbaksh, Mr. Wieczorek (all MCD),
Mr. Tyson (FAD), Mr. Saxegaard (PDR), Mr. Hayward (MCM expert), and Mr. Charap, Fund
resident representative in Kabul.
•
At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation on March 6, 2006, Executive Directors
noted that Afghanistan continued to face formidable medium-term challenges, compounded by
lingering insecurity. Directors stressed the need to consolidate macroeconomic stability while
pursuing vigorously the reform agenda in support of sustained growth and poverty alleviation. Since
then, the authorities have succeeded in maintaining macroeconomic discipline, but progress on the
structural agenda has been uneven and slow. Moreover, rapid growth in commercial banking has
given rise to new challenges and risks.
•
Afghanistan’s three-year PRGF arrangement amounting to SDR 81.0 million (50 percent of
quota) was approved by the Executive Board in June 2006. The arrangement supports the authorities’
economic program through March 2009. On July 9, 2007, the Board completed the second review
of the program and agreed that Afghanistan had reached the decision point under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative. Completion of the third review would allow the fourth disbursement (SDR 11.3 million).

•
Afghanistan maintains a managed float regime, with no preannounced path for the exchange
rate. Afghanistan continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, but
based on available information, no exchange restrictions and/or multiple currency practices are
currently in place.

On November 17, 2007, Mr. Abdul Qadeer Fitrat was confirmed by Parliament as the new Governor of DAB.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic Developments
•
Economic performance since the fall of the Taliban regime has been strong, and substantial
progress has been made toward achieving macroeconomic stability. During 2002/03–2006/07, real
GDP growth averaged 15 percent a year and inflation declined markedly. For 2007/08, growth is
expected to exceed 13 percent and inflation to return to double digits, mainly as a result of sharp
increases in prices of imported fuel and foodstuffs. The nominal exchange rate has remained stable.
•
Economic growth over the medium term will depend critically on confronting governance
issues, overcoming infrastructure bottlenecks (particularly in the electricity sector), and implementing
structural reforms in support of private sector activities. The security situation continues to impact
economic activity and the widespread drug economy is undermining the authorities’ efforts to
broaden economic development.
Policy Issues
During the consultation discussions, the authorities were in broad agreement with the staff on the
following key issues:
•
Greater government ownership of the policy framework and an acceleration of structural
reform is needed. Better coordination between government ministries and donors would be
instrumental in developing a coherent strategy for reform. At the same time, the government should
reaffirm its support for the development of a market economy. An acceleration of the reforms under
the PRGF-supported program would provide a strong positive signal.
•
Revenue mobilization requires further efforts aimed at capacity building and introduction
of a broad-based consumption tax, while maintaining a transparent and equitable trade regime.
•
The role of capital notes should be expanded to better manage liquidity and improve the
effectiveness of monetary policy.
•
Bank supervision and the regulatory framework for the financial sector need to be
strengthened.
•
There are no immediate risks to external stability and the exchange rate level appears broadly
in line with fundamentals.
Program for the remainder of 2007/08 and for 2008/09
•
The PRGF-supported arrangement remains on track. Nevertheless, the implementation
of structural conditionality was mixed. The authorities have implemented the following prior actions:
(i) completion of a special audit of DAB’s reserve assets; (ii) appointment of a reputable audit firm
to perform an audit of DAB’s financial statements for the financial year 2007/08—both reflecting
safeguards assessment concerns; and (iii) elimination of the discretionary application of a 1 percent
import duty on selected industrial inputs.
•
The program has been strengthened to address the risks emerging from: (i) government
involvement in the domestic petroleum market; (ii) potential fiscal drains stemming from the
government’s relations with public enterprises; and (iii) a weak supervisory and regulatory
framework for the banking system, particularly in light of its recent rapid growth.

I. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS: FROM POSTWAR RECOVERY TO MACRO-STABILITY
A. Overview
1.
Economic developments since the fall of the Taliban regime, at end-2001, have
resulted in high real GDP growth and progress toward macroeconomic stability
(Table 1). Real GDP growth during 2002/03–06/07 averaged around 15 percent a year. It
dropped in 2006/07 owing to drought, but is expected to exceed 13 percent in 2007/08,
reflecting a post-drought rebound in agricultural output (Figure 1a). Inflation declined to
single-digit levels in 2006/07, but it returned to double-digits in 2007/08 because of sharp
increases in the prices of imported fuel and foodstuffs owing to worldwide commodity price
pressures and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar (Figure 1b).

Postwar reconstruction, funded by donors, and the return of many skilled and
entrepreneurial individuals have stimulated economic activity. Additional impetus came
from several large foreign direct investment projects. Nevertheless, the cost of doing
business remains high and economic activity is subdued in several areas of critical
importance for growth and external sustainability. In particular, no new exports outside the
traditional base (carpets, minerals, and horticulture products) have been developed, owing to
low capacity, the high cost of capital, and lack of electricity.

3.
The volatile security situation and the persistence of the drug economy are
weakening attempts at broadening economic development. These two phenomena are
intertwined as the resurgence of the Taliban and other anti-government elements is deemed
to be fuelled by opium exports. The drug economy (Box 1), while being a source
of livelihood for many households, continues to be a major obstacle for Afghanistan to regain
its comparative advantage in traditional exports.
Box 1. Afghanistan’s Opium Economy
Opium remains, by far, the largest cash crop in Afghanistan. Opium production has increased steadily from
185 metric tons in 2001 to 8,200 metric tons in 2007. As a result, Afghanistan has become the world’s largest opium
producer, with its share of the total world supply increasing from 52 percent in 1995 to 93 percent in 2007. The
increase in production has resulted in a decline in the farm-gate price of fresh opium at harvest time. Although opium
prices declined in 2004–07, they were still three times higher than in 1994–2000. In 2007, about 81 percent of the
opium production was located in the south and south-west regions of Afghanistan, where anti-government elements
are most active.
The impact of opium cultivation on the economy has been substantial. About 12 percent of the population (or
3.3 million people) were involved in opium poppy cultivation during the 2007 season, with the farm-gate value of the
opium harvest amounting to $1 billion (11 percent of projected licit GDP). The United Nations Office on Drugs and
Crime estimates that the total value of the opium harvest (accruing to farmers, laboratory owners, and traffickers) was
about $4 billion in 2007, compared with $2.7 billion in 2005.

The recommendations of the previous Article IV consultation focused on the
need to broaden the revenue base, prepare more realistic development budgets,
strengthen the banking system, and establish an enabling environment for private
sector activities. The authorities made good progress in key policy areas. They stepped up
revenue efforts through tax reforms and capacity building, and strengthened the MediumTerm Fiscal Framework (MTFF), and the implementation of the development budget. They
also continued to develop the monetary policy framework and improve banking supervision.
With regard to the broader reform agenda, however, policies have been subject to conflicting
influences. Proposals favoring interventionist and protectionist measures are currently
dominating the domestic economic debate, while the laws critical for private sector
development continue to linger in the administrative pipeline and the privatization of stateowned enterprises (SOEs) proceeds at a disappointing pace. At the same time, there have
been allegations of corruption and growing frustration with the slow progress on structural
reforms.
B. Macroeconomic Policies and Debt Issues
5.
Despite continued reliance on donor financing for public spending, revenue
efforts have played a central role in improving the underlying fiscal position. Domestic
revenues increased markedly from an extremely low base of 4.7 percent of GDP in 2003/04
to 8.2 percent in 2006/07 (Tables 2a and 2b, and Box 2). This increase, combined with a
prudent policy toward operating expenditure under the core budget, has led to a gradual
reduction in the core operating budget deficit (excluding grants) since 2004/05 (Figure 2).2
During the same period, core budget development expenditures grew significantly, still
mostly with donor support. However, the bulk of public expenditures, notably outlays on
security and development, continue to be undertaken in the context of the external budget
(i.e., outside the core budget), which is executed and financed directly by donors (Figure 3).

The core budget covers operating and development expenditures of the central government.

Box 2. Rebuilding Domestic Revenue
Key implemented revenue measures include:
• rationalizing the customs schedule;
• simplifying the corporate and personal income tax;
• repealing nuisance taxes; and
• withholding tax on imports, which is creditable against final income tax liabilities.
Steps taken on tax and customs administration include:
• establishing a large taxpayer office (LTO) in the revenue department;
• piloting a medium taxpayer office (MTO) in Kabul; and
• enacting a customs code.

The fiscal sector has undergone important reforms over the last few years, but
the public finances remain fragile. Reforms have concentrated on: (i) creating a legal
framework; (ii) establishing fiscal authority; and (iii) strengthening revenue administration
and public financial management (PFM). In 2007/08, the government initiated program
budget pilots with a view to consolidating the budget preparation process and facilitating the
alignment of expenditures with its priorities under the Afghanistan National Development
Strategy (ANDS). Also, the MOF has begun to articulate Afghanistan’s medium-term fiscal
policy objectives and challenges by using the MTFF. Nevertheless, continued postwar
reconstruction needs and escalating security demands are putting pressures on the public
finances and perpetuating donor dependence.
7.
Monetary policy management has proved challenging, owing to the high degree
of dollarization and large inflows of foreign exchange. DAB has continued to rely on
currency in circulation (CiC) targets and foreign exchange auctions to conduct monetary
policy. Following the introduction of a new currency in October 2002, it was assumed that
stabilizing the nominal exchange rate would bring about price stability, strengthen the

11
demand for Afghanis, and thus reduce dollarization. Inflation, however, turned out to be
more persistent than originally expected, due mainly to large inflows of foreign aid and
opium export receipts. With ample foreign exchange at its disposal, DAB tightened the CiC
targets and stepped up foreign exchange interventions. In the event, inflation declined (albeit
temporarily) to single-digit levels in 2006/07, but “afghanization” has stalled since 2004/05

(Figures 4a and 4b). Dollarization, which was originally driven by the increased demand for
foreign currencies as a hedge against exchange rate risk, continues to be supported by the
abundance of foreign exchange, which strengthened currency substitution, with foreign
currencies and Afghanis used interchangeably for domestic transactions.3
8.
The rapid development of the banking sector has created an enabling
environment for new monetary policy instruments. In mid-2004/05, DAB launched
auctions of capital notes (CNs) with a view to developing them as the primary instrument for
monetary policy. Thus far, however, the role of CNs has been limited with the stock
outstanding at end-November 2007 not exceeding Af 2 billion (US$40 million). Interest rates
on CNs are negative in real terms, and DAB remains reluctant to expand the volume of the
CN auctions and assume the associated interest cost.

Afghanistan’s exchange regime continues to fit the definition of a managed float.
While the monetary policy conduct resulted in the stability of the Afghani vis-à-vis the
U.S. dollar, the authorities have made no commitment to maintaining any particular level
of the exchange rate. DAB has conducted the foreign exchange auctions in a manner
consistent with the CiC targets and sought to smooth short-term fluctuations in the nominal
rate only when this has been consistent with the CiC ceilings under the program. The foreign
exchange market is highly decentralized and the spread between the market rate and the
auction rate is negligible (Figure 5).

10.
Afghanistan’s external position continues to depend on large aid inflows
(Table 3). Official transfers increased to 66 percent of GDP in 2006/07 from 53 percent in
2003/04, reflecting mainly higher security spending by donors, with a predominant import
content. Large official transfers, foreign direct investment, and debt relief helped improve the
import coverage of gross international reserves (excluding imports financed by donors) from
2.8 months of imports in 2002/03 to 9.3 months in 2006/07.
11.
Afghanistan’s debt sustainability has improved significantly as a result of debt
relief from its bilateral creditors and interim debt relief under the HIPC initiative. In
July 2006, Paris Club creditors agreed to cancel more than US$10 billion of debt, thereby
reducing Afghanistan’s external debt by nearly 90 percent, and capitalized all debt service

13
payments falling due until March 31, 2009.4 At the HIPC decision point, in July 2007, they
committed to cancelling all remaining claims once Afghanistan reaches its completion point
under the HIPC initiative. Additional interim debt relief under the HIPC initiative is being
provided by the World Bank. The authorities are actively pursuing debt relief agreements
with the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) and non-Paris Club bilateral and
commercial creditors (MEFP ¶15), and continue to make progress towards meeting the HIPC
completion point triggers (MEFP ¶47).
12.
Afghanistan still has a high risk of debt distress, notwithstanding significant
traditional debt relief from bilateral creditors. The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
conducted in the context of the HIPC decision point in July 2007 highlights that
Afghanistan’s external position is particularly vulnerable to a deterioration in the
concessionality of new borrowing and to slower export growth. Nevertheless, full delivery
of debt relief under the HIPC initiative and assistance under the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) would be sufficient to reduce Afghanistan's debt burden indicators to
sustainable levels.
C. Financial Sector Developments and Risks5
13.
Banking sector activities have expanded considerably over the last few years
(Box 3). According to information provided by DAB, as of September 2007, the banking
system was well-capitalized (32 percent, compared with the minimum capital adequacy
requirement of 12 percent), and the ratio of classified and watch assets to total assets was
about 4.6 percent. There are, however, considerable differences among individual banks. In
particular, two large private banks that recently experienced significant growth in their loan
portfolios have occasionally fallen below the minimum capital adequacy requirement. Also,
the low ratio of classified assets to total assets reflects, to some extent, the widespread
practice of rolling over loans. In addition, a recent report by DAB on its first full-scale onsite examination of banks indicates that five banks with more than 60 percent of total
banking system assets were given a CAMEL rating of 4, on a 1–5 scale.6 The report reveals
serious deficiencies, including a lack of fit and proper management, violations of regulations
on connected lending, and significant currency mismatch in some bank.

The bilateral agreement with Russia was signed in August 2007.

For a detailed discussion of this topic refer to the accompanying selected issues paper on “Banking Sector
developments in Afghanistan.”

6

CAMEL stands for Capital, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings, and Liquidity. The system uses a five
points scale for grading each category. An overall composite rating is also assigned based on the same scale,
with 1 being the highest rating and 5 the lowest.

14
Box 3. Banking System
Afghanistan’s banking system has been growing rapidly since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. As of end2007, there were 16 licensed banks (compared with 6 banks in 2001), including three state-owned banks and five
branches of foreign banks. After a long period of slow growth, the total assets of the banking system more than
tripled over the last couple of years, from $388 million (7 percent of GDP) in March 2005 to $1.3 billion (about
15 percent of GDP) in September 2007. This increase has been mainly due to the expansion of private banking,
whose share of total assets increased from 21 percent to 60 percent. In fact, the assets of two domestic private banks
constitute about 50 percent of total banking sector assets. On the liability side, banking sector deposits have grown
almost fivefold since March 2005, constituting about 78 percent of the total balance sheet (deposits plus capital) of
the banking system as of end-September 2007.
The bulk of activities of the banking sector remains in foreign currencies. As of September 2007, about
77 percent of the total deposits and loans were denominated in U.S. dollars; a proportion slightly higher than in
March 2005. Also, all interbank deposits were in non-Afghani currencies, with about 80 percent being denominated
in U.S. dollars. About 35 percent of the deposit base of state-owned banks and 55 percent of their loans at endSeptember 2007 were denominated in U.S. dollars, implying a considerable currency mismatch for these banks.

14.
The rapid growth in commercial bank activity has prompted DAB to strengthen
bank supervision. DAB has recently completed a self-assessment against the Basle Core
Principles for Effective Bank Supervision. The assessment yielded a roadmap for addressing
weaknesses in DAB’s supervisory framework, including noncompliance with the Basle
Principles on the management of credit, and on operational and market risks.
15.
Some progress has been made regarding the restructuring of state-owned banks.
Following the completion of its external audit, Bank Millie has taken a number of steps to
restructure and improve its financial status. Moreover, the Cabinet approved the restructuring
plan for Bank Pashtany in August 2007, but the audit of its financial statements has not yet
been completed. The client accounts of the Export Promotion Bank have been transferred

15
to Bank Pashtany, but the merger of the two banks is yet to be finalized. To preserve the
value of state-owned banks, the MOF continues to prohibit lending from these banks to
enterprises that do not have audited balance sheets and cabinet approved restructuring plans.
D. Structural Reforms, ANDS (PRSP), and AML/CFT
16.
Structural reforms and the preparation of the legal framework for the business
environment have advanced slowly, and the government still plays a major role in key
sectors. Little progress has been made in preparing for the restructuring/privatization of
government enterprises that are not covered by the law on SOEs and the government has not
yet submitted to parliament laws on partnership and corporations, secure transactions, and
negotiable instruments. In the petroleum sector, the government continues to be involved in
importation, storing, and wholesale trade of petroleum products. While reportedly refraining
from employing price controls, the government influences retail petroleum prices through
market interventions and the imposition of fees on private importers.7
17.
A tariff reform implemented in 2006 sought to balance trade policy
liberalization and revenue considerations, but discretionary protectionist measures
have subsequently crept in (Box 4). The 2006 reform intended to address instances
of negative protection, but higher tariff bands on certain products were also introduced to
safeguard fiscal revenue in light of political resistance to the introduction of excise taxes.8
Subsequently, in the first half of 2007, several ad hoc protectionist measures were introduced
because of concerns about unfair competition from neighboring countries and the high cost
of doing business in Afghanistan. One of these changes, the discretionary application of the 1
percent tariff rate, was removed in January 2008.

7

Staff obtained conflicting information on the extent of government involvement in the petroleum sector. While
there is no evidence of subsidies, the operations of the government-owned petroleum enterprise and their fiscal
aspects remain nontransparent (MEFP ¶43).

8

After these changes, the simple average tariff increased from 4 percent to 5.7 percent.

18.
The authorities are implementing the interim ANDS (I-ANDS) and have made
substantial progress in preparing the full ANDS (Afghanistan’s PRSP).9 The ANDS
preparation status report appropriately highlights the efforts made by the authorities to
broaden the consultation on the ANDS and clearly articulates the steps toward its
completion. The authorities intend to submit the full ANDS document to the Boards of the
Fund and the World Bank by March 2008, as envisaged at the HIPC decision point in July
2007. This timetable may prove challenging, however, given the need for political decisions
on key issues, including intersectoral prioritization. To avoid delays in completing the
ANDS, the authorities have decided to limit the costing exercise to three sectors (health,
education, and roads) whose expenditure envelopes will be aligned with the MTFF and the
2008/09 budget. The full costing of all sector strategies will be reflected in the first annual
report on ANDS implementation.
19.
The authorities continue to develop controls against money laundering and
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). Currently, all 16 banks in Afghanistan submit monthly
reports on large cash and suspicious transactions to a specialized unit which was established
in early 2006.10 The full-scale on-site examination of banks has revealed that most banks fell
short of their obligations regarding the implementation of AML/CFT laws and regulations.
These included staff's lack of access to internal regulations, insufficient training, and lack
of communication of AML/CFT policies to branches. The authorities have directed banks to
strengthen controls against money laundering and correct the observed deficiencies. Also,
Hawala dealers (money changers) are now expected to report their operations using forms
that have been developed for AML/CFT purposes.
II. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK: CREATING CONDITIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
A. Overview
20.
The consultation discussions with the authorities focused on Afghanistan’s
medium-term policies and prospects in light of the expected decline in foreign
assistance. The medium-term scenario assumes that the key obstacles to growth (including
lack of electricity in Kabul and the precarious security environment) will be removed
gradually. Main sources of growth would include: (i) licit agriculture benefiting from rural
development programs and the implementation of the donor-supported strategy to eliminate
poppy cultivation in favor of alternative crops; (ii) mining, supported by foreign direct
investment; and (iii) concomitant broad-based growth in trade and services. Real GDP

growth is projected to moderate from 9 percent in 2008/09 to 7 percent in 2012/13, reflecting
a gradual decline in the investment-to-GDP ratio to about 30 percent in 2011/12.11 Donorfunded public investment is expected to remain critical for economic growth (Box 5), but its
relative importance will diminish over time as private investment and foreign direct
investment play increasing roles.
Box 5. Macroeconomic Effects of Donor Assistance
Nonsecurity grants for the external budget are expected to drop, as a percentage of GDP, from an estimated 30 percent
this fiscal year to 9 percent in 2012/13, as immediate reconstruction needs recede and the government takes increasing
responsibility for expenditures. At the same time, grants to the core budget would decline from 13.6 percent of GDP to
10.6 percent of GDP over the same period.
The significant level of security expenditures in the external budget reflects the cost of training, equipping, and
supporting the increase in the national army and the police. This support is expected to decline as force levels stabilize
and security improves.
Automatic sterilization due to the large import `content of donor expenditures will help mitigate the potential “Dutch
disease” effect of donor inflows on competitiveness. Also, it is expected that aid-financed investments in infrastructure
and security will enhance productivity and competitiveness, thus offsetting potential pressure on the exchange rate from
the sustained foreign aid to the core budget.

B. Fiscal Policy

21.
The authorities indicated that fiscal policy would seek to balance a “needsbased” approach to expenditure with a focus on fiscal sustainability.12 The operating
budget deficit, excluding grants, is projected to decline from 4.0 percent of GDP in 2007/08
to 3.6 percent in 2008/09. This improvement is dependent on containing expenditure and
strengthening revenue, and is consistent with the government’s stated objective of covering
operating expenses from domestic revenue—a target that is expected to be achieved in
2012/13. Core budget development expenditures are projected to average about 11½ percent
of GDP over the same period, and will be mostly covered by donor grants and highly
concessional lending.
The government is committed to structural reforms aimed at creating fiscal
22.
space for ANDS priorities, achieving the fiscal sustainability objective, and reducing
risks to the fiscal outlook. The authorities intend to regularize relations between the budget
and key public enterprises, reform the pension system, implement the pay and grade reform
within the civil service, and strengthen public financial management (MEFP ¶26). The
MTFF already reflects the cost of pay and rank reform in the army and the police, as well as
in the civil service. The medium-term expenditure profile also includes some large
expenditure items that are either one-off (such as election costs in 2009/10, which are
estimated at 0.6 percent of GDP) or projected to fall (such as the energy subsidy, which is
expected to decline as a result of structural reforms in the electricity sector).
The authorities agreed on the need to strengthen domestic revenue mobilization
23.
in order to generate resources for ANDS priorities and cope with fiscal uncertainties.
Over the next year, the revenue efforts will focus primarily on: (i) intensifying administrative
reforms; (ii) building capacity, especially in the provinces; (iii) consolidating the legislative
base; and (iv) targeting high-income taxpayers. The authorities are also preparing legislation
to transform the current Business Receipts Tax (BRT), a cascading turnover tax, into a
broad-based consumption tax (MEFP ¶25). They also plan to draft a new tax code to set a
clear legislative base for the income tax and the BRT. These efforts are expected to yield a
modest immediate increase in revenue, but would make a significant contribution toward
fiscal sustainability in the coming years. Revenue from trade taxes is expected to increase in
response to a higher level of taxable imports and the strengthening of customs and border
controls.
Addressing security demands will depend on continued donor support over the
24.
medium term. The core budget outlook will need to accommodate the impact of recent
12

For a detailed discussion of this topic refer to the accompanying selected issues paper on “Fiscal
Sustainability in Afghanistan: A Framework to Cope with Security Pressures and External Aid.”

20
decisions to increase the size of both the army and the police (accompanied by the pay and
rank reform in these sectors) on the government’s wage bill. Donor support in this area will
be critical for many years to come. The MOF, together with the World Bank and donors, has
started a review of the budgetary implications of security expenditures.
C. Monetary Policy

25.
In the near term, monetary policy will continue to rely on foreign exchange
auctions and CiC targeting. Given the recent rebound in inflation, DAB has decided to
adhere to its original CiC target for 2007/08 (which is below the program ceiling), in order
to contain inflationary pressures. The ceiling for CiC growth in 2008/09 has been tentatively
set at about 20 percent (Table 4), in line with projected nominal GDP growth. Developments
in financial intermediation and improvements in the liquidity forecasting framework
(MEFP ¶35) may warrant shifting the focus toward more comprehensive monetary
aggregates in the future.
Deepening the market for CNs would further strengthen the effectiveness of
26.
monetary policy and help reduce currency substitution. A decisive move by DAB to
accept higher interest rates on CNs would encourage banks to increase interest differentials
between Afghani and foreign-currency denominated deposits, and thus provide incentives for
increasing the use of the Afghani. In addition, the development of a secondary market in
CNs would allow DAB to increase reliance on these instruments.13
D. The Financial Sector

27.
The recent rapid growth of the banking sector underscores the need to
strengthen institutional capacity and the legal framework for the financial system.
The lack of a core set of basic commercial laws, including laws on mortgages, secured
transactions, and commercial arbitration, continue to prevent banks from providing credit to
small and medium-sized businesses, thereby leaving it to the informal sector to fill in the
gap. Moreover, financial institutions still lack the capacity to manage credit risk, and the
enforcement capacity of DAB needs to be strengthened.
To address emerging risks in the banking sector, DAB will continue its targeted
28.
supervisory actions and strengthen enforcement. The authorities have also agreed to place
limits on the expansion of weak banks by restricting their credit growth to 5 percent per
quarter and suspending the issuance of licenses for new branches. These measures will be
in effect until the relevant banks’ CAMEL ratings are reassessed to be less than 4.

13

The Fund is providing technical assistance to strengthen the legal framework for a secondary market in CNs.

21
The authorities also plan to take measures aimed at improving the regulatory
29.
framework for the banking sector. In particular, DAB’s Supreme Council will repeal the
decisions instituting the requirement to invest 80 percent of bank deposits in the domestic
economy and raising the minimum capital requirement for banks from US$5 million to
US$20 million. DAB will issue circulars to inform banks about these decisions (MEFP ¶38).
The minimum capital requirement, applicable immediately for new banks seeking licenses,
will be set at US$10 million, while incumbent banks will be given five years to comply.
E. External Sector Issues

30.
Several factors indicate that there are no immediate risks to external stability
and that the exchange rate is not misaligned. The robust growth of official exports and
their increasing share of world exports (Figure 6) suggest that the real exchange rate is not a
constraint on external competitiveness. There appears to be scope, however, for improving
competitiveness by reducing institutional bottlenecks and lowering the cost of doing business
(Box 6). While the lack of data precludes a formal analysis of the appropriateness of the
exchange rate level, the stability of the CPI-based REER and (to a lesser extent) the ratio
of nontradable to tradable prices suggests that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals (Figure 7). The current account balance (before grants) is expected to
strengthen gradually over the medium term in step with an improving trade balance and full
delivery of debt relief under the HIPC Initiative.
Safeguarding medium-term external sustainability requires further
31.
improvements in the competitiveness of the economy and a renewed commitment to
a liberal trade regime. The authorities are of the view that the projected decline in donor
inflows will be partly offset by sizeable foreign direct investments. Other countries’
experience suggest, however, that while large-scale foreign investment has a positive effect
on the economy, its impact on the balance of payments and fiscal revenue tends to be less
pronounced. There will be a need, therefore, for a broad-based increase in exports. This
would require maintaining a liberal trade regime and addressing the major impediments to
export growth, notably the shortage of electricity and other infrastructure bottlenecks.

22

Box 6. External Competitiveness
Afghanistan’s official exports have increased from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2002/03 to
7.8 percent in 2006/07, growing at an average annual rate of 37 percent. As a share of world
exports, the country’s official exports rose from 0.02 to 0.05 percent during the same period.
Growth in carpet exports has been particularly impressive, with an average annual rate of
almost 280 percent in value terms and 120 percent in volume terms between 2002/03 and
2006/07.
Afghanistan’s robust export performance in recent years appears to be related to
increased capacity utilization. After the appreciation of the REER in May 2004 (due largely
to pressure on the housing market from the influx of donors), the REER has remained broadly
stable, suggesting that “Dutch Disease” effects from donor assistance and opium exports have
been contained.
Structural bottlenecks suggest that there is significant scope for improving
competitiveness.1 According to the World Bank, Afghanistan currently ranks 159 out of
178 economies in terms of overall ease of doing business. Difficulties faced by Afghan
companies include the high cost of credit, high input costs, and the cost of trading across
borders (exporting a container costs more than twice the average in the rest of the region
and requires more than twice as many days). Input costs include the high cost of electricity
in Kabul and unreliable supply with the result that most businesses rely on their own electricity
at a very high cost.
The high cost of doing business is compounded by a difficult institutional environment.
Based on the governance indicators from the World Bank for 2006, Afghanistan’s institutional
environment has weakened in the areas of political stability, government effectiveness, and the
rule of law.

III. THE PRGF-SUPPORTED PROGRAM

32.
All the end-September 2007 quantitative performance criteria under the PRGFsupported program were observed (MEFP Table 1). Despite a weak revenue performance
in the first quarter of 2007/08, the authorities were able to meet the mid-year domestic
revenue target with a comfortable margin. They remain confident that the end-year target
will also be observed, but stand ready to take appropriate actions, in consultation with Fund
staff, should any revenue shortfalls occur in the second half of 2007/08.
The implementation of the structural conditionality for the third program
33.
review was mixed, leading to revisions in the structural agenda (MEFP Table 2). The
structural performance criterion on submitting to parliament the core budget’s audited
financial statement for 2006/07 by September 21, 2007, was missed by one day, with the
submission taking place on September 22, 2007. The structural benchmark calling for the
adoption by the Cabinet of a comprehensive restructuring plan for the public entities and
government agencies engaged in commercial activities but not covered by the SOEs law was
also missed. The timeline for the preparation of this plan has been revised with a view to
obtaining Cabinet approval by March 31, 2008. DAB has also incurred delays regarding two
structural benchmarks for end-November 2007, one calling for the issuance of regulations on
credit-granting standards and the credit-monitoring process and, the other setting limits on
sector loan concentration. It is expected that both regulations will be issued in early February
2008. The structural benchmark on submitting for Cabinet approval a restructuring plan for
Bank Pashtany has been only partially implemented as the plan was not based on the bank’s
audited financial statement. The other three structural benchmarks were met without
qualifications.
Two prior actions that were proposed in the context of the safeguards
34.
assessment have been incorporated in the program: (i) completion of a special audit
of DAB’s reserve assets; and (ii) appointment of a reputable audit firm to perform an audit
of DAB’s financial statements for financial year 2007/08. A third prior action consisted
of the elimination of the discretionary application of a 1 percent tariff rate on imports of
selected industrial inputs. All three actions have been implemented. The authorities also
agreed to implement a full set of updated safeguards recommendations (MEFP ¶36).
The quantitative program for the remainder of 2007/08 has been revised to take
35.
into account the midyear budget review, in line with the understandings reached at the
time of the second PRGF review (MEFP ¶22). The revisions affecting fiscal targets
(indicative targets for December 2007 and performance criteria for March 2008) reflect
mainly the inclusion in the budget of additional security expenditures previously left outside
its scope, pending confirmation of donor financing. Since the authorities observed the
September revenue target, the midyear review also allows for a limited amount (equivalent
of 0.3 percent of GDP) in additional nonsecurity expenditure, consistent with earlier
understandings. The targets for net international reserves have been revised upward to

25
realign the monetary program for the remainder of 2007/08 with developments through
September 2007, notably, significantly larger-than-expected inflows of off-budget foreign
assistance. The PRGF arrangement is fully financed through end–2008/09.
The authorities recognized the need to refocus the program and address risks
36.
emerging in several areas. In addition to revenue efforts, public expenditure management
and central bank reforms, the program now also aims to deal with: (i) issues pertaining to
the government’s role in the economy, including its involvement in the domestic petroleum
market and the trade policy stance; and (ii) the management of potential fiscal drains
mainly stemming from the government’s relations with public enterprises (e.g., DABM—the
electricity provider, and Ariana—the national airline).14
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL

37.
Afghanistan has made substantial progress toward macroeconomic stability,
but structural reforms need to be accelerated. Fiscal revenues have increased steadily and
monetary policy has been strengthened, but progress in other structural areas, including much
needed measures to create the infrastructure and legislation necessary for private sector
development, has been slow. A vigorous implementation of the reform agenda under the
PRGF-supported program is crucial for maintaining macroeconomic stability and improving
Afghanistan’s growth and poverty alleviation prospects.
Looking ahead, revenue efforts will play a central role in moving Afghanistan
38.
gradually toward fiscal sustainability. Fiscal policy will continue to focus on tax reforms
and other revenue enhancing measures, which will require support at the top levels of
government. Key steps will include parliamentary approval for moving the BRT toward
a much-needed broad-based consumption tax and restarting the preparations for introducing
an excise tax.
The uncertainty affecting the fiscal outlook also warrants a prudent expenditure
39.
policy. Discipline will be required to observe expenditure ceilings and prioritize the use of
scarce resources, and to make the adjustments necessary for achieving fiscal sustainability.
Given the high dependence on external aid, it would be prudent for the authorities to
maintain a buffer of deposits at DAB and prepare for developing a domestic debt market over
the medium term.
The recent strengthening of the MTFF is a positive development that has
40.
contributed to improving the strategic aspects of fiscal policy, but further efforts are
necessary in this area. The high dependence on external support highlights the need to deal
14

A list of structural benchmarks is included in Table 2 of the MEFP and their detailed description is in the
Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU).

26
with fiscal sustainability and aid volatility within a robust and systematic planning
framework. The availability of data on donor activity outside the core budget would
significantly strengthen fiscal analysis underlying the MTFF.
Monetary policy has been instrumental in reducing inflation and safeguarding
41.
external stability but it needs to be strengthened. The rebound of inflation in 2007/08,
albeit largely due to exogenous causes, calls for increased reliance on CNs and the
development of a secondary market for these instruments. This would also help reduce the
degree of dollarization.
The financial sector needs to be thoroughly supervised and properly regulated.
42.
Staff welcome the actions undertaken by DAB to strengthen banking supervision, limit the
expansion of weak banks, and refine the regulatory provisions pertaining to banks’ domestic
investment and the minimum capital requirements. Also, DAB’s recent self-assessment
against the Basle Core Principles provides a useful tool for addressing weaknesses in
banking supervision. Looking ahead, it is important that DAB continues its targeted
supervisory actions and strengthen enforcement. Also, there is a need to bring the
restructuring of the state-owned banks to a successful conclusion based on sound market
principles, and to adopt promptly several pieces of legislation that are critical for private
sector growth and financial sector stability, including the laws on mortgages, secured
transactions, and commercial arbitration.
The government should resist pressures for expanding its role in the economy
43.
and focus on fostering competition and improving economic governance. In this context,
staff welcome the authorities’ commitment to reducing gradually the FLGE’s involvement in
the petroleum sector, limiting its role to providing services to the private sector, and making
its operations fully transparent. The government’s relations with SOEs need to be clarified
with a view to improving transparency and stemming potential fiscal drains.
The current exchange rate regime is serving Afghanistan well and the exchange
44.
rate level appears broadly in line with fundamentals. Nevertheless, safeguarding mediumterm external stability requires further improvements in the competitiveness of the economy
and a renewed commitment to a liberal trade regime.
Every effort should be made to maintain a trade regime that minimizes
45.
distortions and does not discriminate across traders. In this regard, the agreed upon
unwinding of tariff increases on soft drinks and the elimination of the discretionary 1 percent
tariff rate on raw materials provide an important signal of renewed commitment by the
authorities to an open trade regime. In the period ahead, it would be important to avoid
introducing further ad hoc changes to the tariff schedule and other protectionist measures.
The ANDS should aim at improving the alignment of public spending with the
46.
government’s priorities. It should integrate sectoral strategies with the government’s

27
growth and poverty reduction objectives, and ensure maximum effectiveness of public
investment while taking into account the absorptive capacity of the economy.
The authorities need to increase their efforts to improve Afghanistan’s statistical
47.
database. In this process, priority should be given to strengthening the Central Statistics
Office and improving coordination among data providers and the compilation of national
income data. While data provision is adequate for overall surveillance purposes, donor
assistance is needed to overcome shortcomings in some areas, such as the balance of
payments and the national accounts.
Staff support the waiver of nonobservance for the structural performance
48.
criterion on the submission to parliament of the core budget’s audited financial
statement for 2006/07 by September 21, 2007 and, based on the performance to date,
recommends the completion of the third review under the PRGF supported
arrangement. The nonobservance of the structural performance criterion was due to a minor
delay, and the authorities complied with the Public Finance and Expenditure Management
Law. Moreover, Afghanistan is expected to encounter no difficulties in meeting its
obligations to the Fund.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Afghanistan take place in
49.
accordance with the decision on consultation cycles of July 15, 2002.

and 55.4 percent of GDP, respectively, in 2006/07.
4/ After HIPC and MDRI relief as well as debt relief beyond HIPC relief from Paris Club creditors. Debt also includes obligations to the IMF. The debt stock includes the
capitalization of interest to Paris Club creditors until completion point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. The large increase in the debt in 2005/06 reflects principally
the recognition of Russia's claims (that were subsequently restructured), and the reconciliation of all March 2006 debt stocks for the HIPC Initiative.
5/ The 2007/08 number is for January 1, 2008.

Sources: Afghan authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ Numbers have been revised as a result of more reliable data on public grants.
2/ Excludes opium exports and, due to limited data availability, flows associated with U.S. Army and most ISAF activities.
3/ Debt service projections are based on the total stock of external debt (including estimates of unverified arrears). Given lack of data on the rate of
penalty interest and ongoing bilateral negotiations, interest on overdue obligations was estimated by Fund staff.
4/ Assumes that Afghanistan will reach the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative and receive MDRI relief from IDA in 2009/10. Paris Club
creditors are assumed to go beyond HIPC and provide 100 percent stock reduction on eligible debts and capitalized interest at completion point.
5/ Includes foreign transactions recently reported by licensed money changers.
6/ Arrears shown represent Fund staff estimates of debt service due, but not paid, on estimated overdue obligations. The 2006/07 and 2007/08 reduction
in arrears corresponds principally to the July 2006 rescheduling of Paris Club debt on Naples terms, including the upfront cancellation of the majority of
Russian claims consistent with Paris Club practice.
7/ Debt rescheduling includes the capitalization of interest falling due to Paris Club creditors until the completion point of the enhanced HIPC Initiative,
interim assistance from multilateral creditors, and HIPC debt relief from multilateral creditors after the completion point.
8/ In months of imports of goods and services, excluding imports for reexports and duty free imports by donors. The definition of imports used for the
calculation of reserve coverage has been changed to exclude duty free imports by donors that are fully financed.
9/ After HIPC and MDRI relief as well as debt relief beyond HIPC from Paris Club creditors. Debt includes obligations to the IMF. The debt stock includes
the capitalization of interest to Paris Club creditors until completion point of the enhanced HIPC initiative.
10/ Exports exclude reexports.

2008/09

1/ 2004/05–2006/07 figures are estimated using market exchange rates. 2007/08 estimates and program projections are made on the basis of the program exchange rate.
2/ The gold does not include the gold held in the palace vaults.
3/ Until March 2006, capital notes and foreign currency deposits of commercial banks with DAB were included in Reserve money (as banks could use capital notes to meet their reserve requirements;
this possibility was removed in March 2006, at which time banks were also instructed to meet the reserve requirements in Afghanis only against both Afghani and foreign currency deposits).
4/ Weighted average of bid rates; 30-day notes until March 2006.
5/ The second PRGF review projection is re-based due to revised estimates of foreign reserves and currency in circulation data (no consequence for the assessment of program performance in 2006/07).

ATTACHMENT I. LETTER OF INTENT

Kabul, January 28, 2008
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn,
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) supplements and
updates the understandings reached with IMF staff on our economic program supported by
the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) Arrangement. The new MEFP reports
on quantitative performance through September 2007 and on progress in implementing
Afghanistan’s structural reform agenda. It sets quantitative targets through September 2008,
including quantitative performance criteria for March 2008, and describes the government’s
policies for the remainder of fiscal year 2007/08 (ending on March 20, 2008) and, on a
preliminary basis, for 2008/09.
We are pleased to inform you that we met all the September 2007 quantitative performance
criteria, including the floor on fiscal revenue, which required redoubled efforts to strengthen
revenue administration, and broaden the collection base. We also observed the continuous
zero ceilings on contracting or guaranteeing of new medium- and long-term nonconcessional
external debt, on short-term external debt, and on new lending from state-owned banks to,
or government-guaranteed borrowing by, enterprises in need of restructuring; and the
continuous performance criterion prohibiting accumulation of new external payments arrears.
The program, centered on fiscal discipline and maintaining confidence in the Afghani,
contributed to limiting inflationary pressures and strengthening our external position.
Regarding the structural conditionality for the third review, we have experienced some
delays in implementing several measures. Some of the delays are not critical for the
achievement of program objectives and call for corrective actions we are ready to implement.
We request a waiver of nonobservance for the structural performance criterion on submitting
to parliament the core budget’s audited financial statement for 2006/07 by September 21,
2007. By making the submission one day later, on September 22, 2007 we have observed the
Public Finance and Expenditure Management Law. We missed the structural benchmark
requiring Cabinet’s adoption of a comprehensive restructuring plan for the public entities and
government agencies engaged in commercial activities, but not covered by the State Owned
Enterprises law. We will make our best efforts to obtain Cabinet approval of this plan
(currently under preparation) before end-March 2008. We also missed two structural
benchmarks for end-November 2007 calling for the issuance of regulations on credit-granting
standards and the credit-monitoring process, and setting limits on sector loan concentration.
As required by law, draft regulations have been issued to the public for comments. We intend
to obtain DAB’s Supreme Council final approval of both regulations and issue them in early

40
February 2008. We have implemented partially the structural benchmark on submitting for
Cabinet approval, by August 31, 2007, a restructuring plan for Bank Pashtany, based on the
bank’s audited financial statement. We made the submission before the required test date but,
as the audit of the financial statements of the bank had not yet been finalized at that time, the
restructuring plan did not fully benefit from its findings. Once the audit is finalized, the
restructuring plan for Bank Pashtany will be amended to take the audit into account. All
other structural benchmarks were met. We remain in consultation with IMF staff to ensure
satisfactory implementation of the program.
The government and Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) believe that the economic and financial
policies set forth in the attached memorandum provide a sound basis for achieving the
objectives and targets of the program. During the period of the arrangement, we will
consult with the Fund on the adoption of any further measures that may be appropriate, at
the initiative of the government or DAB, or whenever the Managing Director of the IMF
requests such a consultation. In addition, we will provide the Fund in a timely manner with
all information necessary to monitor implementation of the program. The government and
DAB will conduct with the Fund the fourth review before end-July 2008.
On the basis of this performance, and on the strength of the policies set forth in the attached
memorandum, we request that the IMF complete the third review under the PRGF
arrangement and approve the fourth disbursement (in the amount of SDR 11.3 million). After
the period of this arrangement and while Afghanistan has outstanding financial obligations to
the IMF, we will periodically consult with the IMF, at the initiative of the government or
DAB, or whenever the Managing Director of the IMF requests consultation on Afghanistan’s
economic and financial policies.
We remain committed to transparent policy-making and are keen on rendering the contents
of this letter and those of the attached MEFP and technical memorandum of understanding,
as well as the staff report for the 2007Article IV consultation and third review under the
PRGF arrangement, available to the public and hereby authorize their posting on the Fund's
website subsequent to Executive Board consideration of this request.
Sincerely yours,
Anwar Ul-Haq Ahady

ATTACHMENT II. MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2007/08 AND 2008/09
January 28, 2008

I. INTRODUCTION
The Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and Da Afghanistan
Bank (DAB) remain committed to the program of economic reforms aimed at reducing
poverty and moving Afghanistan to a sustainable growth path. This memorandum
reviews quantitative performance through September 2007 and compliance with structural
conditionality for the third review under the program supported by the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, sets out the revised economic and financial
policies for the remainder of 2007/08, outlines the government’s policy commitments for
2008/09, and updates Afghanistan’s medium-term objectives and policy framework. Based
on these policies, we request completion of the third review and approval of the fourth
disbursement under the PRGF arrangement.
1.

A. Performance Under the Program

2.
Economic developments in 2007/08 have been marked by high economic growth
and a return of inflation to double-digit levels. A rebound in agricultural production from
the drought-triggered decline in 2006/07 and strong growth in other sectors, particularly
services, are expected to raise GDP by 13½ percent in 2007/08. Higher prices for imported
fuel and foodstuffs caused the Kabul CPI to increase by 8 percent in the first seven months
of 2007/08, with 12-month (end-of-period) inflation peaking above 12 percent in
September 2007 before subsiding to 9½ percent in October 2007. Despite the increase in
inflation, the exchange rate of the Afghani has remained stable against the U.S. dollar.
Performance under the financial program through September 2007 was strong.
3.
Despite a slow start in the early months of 2007/08, fiscal revenue exceeded the program
floor for the first half of the year by 3.4 percent (about 0.1 percent of GDP). All other
quantitative performance criteria and the indicative ceiling on the operating budget deficit
(excluding grants) were observed with ample margins (Table 1). The observance of the fiscal
policy targets reflected mainly the consolidation of administrative efforts to increase fiscal
revenue and a prudent implementation of operating expenditure. The maintenance of an
appropriate monetary policy stance was instrumental to meeting the performance criteria
on net international reserves and currency in circulation.

4.
We have also followed through on the structural conditionality for the third
review but experienced delays in implementing several measures (Table 2). We
submitted to parliament the core budget’s audited financial statement for 2006/07 on
September 22, 2007—the last day of the sixth month of the Afghan solar year 1386—and
thus observed the

42
Public Finance and Expenditure Management Law; however, we missed the September 21,
2007 test date for the related structural performance criterion. We missed the structural
benchmark for end-September 2007 calling for the adoption by the Cabinet
of a comprehensive restructuring plan for the public enterprises not covered by the law on
state-owned enterprises (SOEs)—Tassady Law. The implementation of this measure has
been delayed several times for technical reasons (lack of capacity) and the absence of broad
support for the privatization of these enterprises, including among the members of the
Cabinet. Nevertheless, the plan remains under preparation and we will make our best efforts
to obtain Cabinet approval by March 31, 2008. We also missed two structural benchmarks
for end-November 2007 calling for the issuance of regulations on credit-granting standards
and the credit-monitoring process and setting limits on sector loan concentration. As required
by law, draft regulations have been submitted to public for comments and we intend to obtain
DAB’s Supreme Council final approval of both regulations and issue them in early February
2008. We have implemented partially the structural benchmark on submitting, by August 31,
2007, for Cabinet approval a restructuring plan for Bank Pashtany, based on the bank’s
audited financial statement. We made the submission before the required test date, although
the audit of the bank’s financial statement has not yet been completed. We have met all other
structural benchmarks. We have also made significant progress toward implementing, the
understandings reached with Fund staff in July 2007 with regard to the elimination of the
discretionary application of a 1 percent import tariff rate on raw materials and other
intermediate inputs.
B. Fiscal Sector

5.
Fiscal performance during the first half of 2007/08 was stronger than
programmed. The revenue target for the first half of 2007/08 (equivalent to 3.4 percent
of revised annual GDP) was comfortably met, and operating expenditure was below the
programmed level by 1.1 percent of GDP, in part due to the delayed approval of the budget.
As a result, the operating budget deficit (excluding grants) for the first half of 2007/08 is
estimated at 1.0 percent of GDP, compared to an indicative program target of 2.0 percent.
Lower than expected external grants for the operating budget were largely offset by higher
grants for the development budget. Core development budget expenditure, at 3.4 percent
of GDP, was in line with the program
Improvements in revenue collection allowed us to exceed the midyear revenue
6.
target. In particular, collections of the business receipts tax (BRT) improved significantly
relative to last year as a result of vigorous compliance and enforcement campaigns on
telecommunication services providers, hotels, and banks by the Large Taxpayers
Office (LTO), and on restaurants and wedding halls by the interim Medium Taxpayers
Office (MTO). Advance remittance of overflight revenues in the second quarter led to better
than expected collection of administrative fees, although this revenue will not be available
for collection in the fourth quarter. Customs duty receipts were lower than expected,
probably reflecting ongoing changes to the tariff regime, but higher nonduty customs
collections, including a 2 percent advance payment of income tax, compensated for the
revenue shortfall.

43
7.
New information on the external budget, particularly on security outlays,
indicates that direct donor-financed expenditures have been significantly higher than
previously estimated. Our international security partners have shared new information with
us on the magnitude of external security spending. Based on this information, our projection
for external budget spending in 2007/08 has increased by Af 124 billion (about 29 percent
of GDP). Much of the new data are presented on commitment basis, and we will seek to
improve our estimate of the cash impact of this spending on the Afghan economy over the
coming months.
Progress has continued on structural reforms in the public finances. We met the
8.
end-July 2007 structural benchmark on clarifying the tax policy framework and published the
document to this effect. Nevertheless, we continue to hear about confusion among some tax
payers and there have been some cases of misclassification of “traders” by our own officials.
The Afghanistan Investment Support Agency (AISA) and the Revenue Department of the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) intend to conduct a public information campaign to rectify this.
We have also taken steps to address staff shortages in the revenue department, published a
document that clarifies the roles and responsibilities of the various agencies operating at the
border, and transferred accountability for all large- and medium-sized taxpayers in Kabul,
on a pilot basis, to the revenue department. In addition, we have submitted to parliament
legislation amending the income tax law and will soon submit a proposal to apply the BRT
to imports—a key step in the gradual transition toward a broad-based consumption tax.
We continue to strengthen our Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) in line
9.
with the commitments made at the time of the second program review. The MTFF is
increasingly being used as a tool for engaging donors to discuss external support for the
recurrent budget. We are also setting out the levels of public investment needed to create
enabling conditions for the implementation of the Afghan National Development Strategy
(ANDS). The latest version of the MTFF is consistent with the PRGF and is part of our
baseline macro-framework for the ANDS.
C. Monetary and Financial Sector

10.
Monetary policy has remained broadly consistent with the program, despite
difficulties with liquidity management experienced during and after Ramadan. Growth
of currency in circulation surged from 8.5 percent during the first half of 2007/08 to
18 percent in October (or nearly 24 percent year-on-year). Continued exchange rate stability
throughout this episode suggests that the surge in the money supply—related to an
acceleration of government expenditure—was met with increased demand, reflecting a
combination of Ramadan-related seasonality and steep increases in the prices of imported
fuel and essential foodstuffs. In mid-October, DAB stepped up its foreign exchange
interventions with a view to reducing the growth of currency in circulation to about
15 percent by December 2007, consistent with the program ceiling for the third quarter
of 2007/08.

44
11.
We met the structural benchmarks in the areas of central bank accounting and
reporting. We have developed a monthly monetary survey in line with international
standards (structural benchmark for end-July 2007) and are submitting it on a monthly basis
to the IMF. We also have introduced the new accounting system at DAB and six regional
hubs (structural benchmark for end-September 2007). The system still remains in a trial
phase and the operations of the regional hubs are not yet automatically monitorable from
headquarters.
Rapid growth in commercial bank activity prompted us to take action to
12.
strengthen bank supervision and the regulatory framework for the banking sector. We
have completed a summary report on banks’ compliance with prudential regulations based
on a full round of on-site inspections, which revealed several weaknesses. We are now in the
process of implementing targeted supervisory actions. Among other measures, we have
instructed all banks to publish their audited financial statements. We have also enforced all
licensing requirements for Bank Pashtany and Bank Millie, with the exception of the
appointment of qualified managers, which would require lifting the ceilings on salary levels
for state sector employees.
D. External Sector and Debt Issues

13.
Developments in the first quarter, notably strong growth of recorded exports,
and early indicators of donor activity, suggest that the external position of Afghanistan
will strengthen further in 2007/08. First quarter data show that recorded exports grew by
14 percent (in U.S. dollar terms) relative to the same quarter of 2006/07. We expect this
trend to continue throughout the remainder of 2007/08 and contribute to a drop in the trade
deficit (by 2½ percent of GDP). The latter is expected despite a significant pick up in dutyfree imports related to the increased external budget outlays, which are mainly securityrelated and are fully-funded by donors. As a result, we expect the current account deficit
(including grants) to drop from 6.3 percent of GDP in 2006/07 to 1.4 percent of GDP in
2007/08. Foreign direct investment, debt relief from bilateral creditors, and interim assistance
under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative will contribute to the
strengthening of our external position.
We have improved the collection of balance of payments data, although
14.
important shortcomings still need to be addressed. We have made significant progress in
identifying data sources and strengthening data reporting by enhancing cooperation between
the relevant government agencies and DAB. Although we have strengthened our expertise in
the compilation of the balance of payments, further efforts are needed, including with
technical assistance from the IMF.
We have continued our efforts to regularize relations with our creditors, after
15.
having reached the decision point under the HIPC Initiative in July 2007. In August 2007,
we signed a bilateral agreement with Russia, and thus finalized the process of regularizing
our debts with Paris Club creditors under the July 2006 Paris Club agreement. The agreement
with Russia provides for a reduction of Russia’s claims on Afghanistan by more than
90 percent, amounting to a reduction of our external debt by nearly 90 percent. During the

45
IMF and World Bank annual meetings in October 2007, we also approached representatives
from Bulgaria and the Kuwait Fund for International Development in an attempt to regularize
our debts to these creditors.
E. Other Structural Reforms

16.
We have made some progress in divesting SOEs and restructuring the
state-owned banks. Of the 24 SOEs that were scheduled to be auctioned, 11 have already
been sold. We have also lowered the price of six SOEs in order to auction them successfully.
In addition, the Cabinet has approved the privatization of 15 other SOEs. In the absence of a
comprehensive restructuring/divestment plan for SOEs and other commercial activities of the
state that are not covered by the Tassady Law, we have resisted pressures to provide
budgetary support to these entities, particularly the national airline Ariana. In the financial
sector, Bank Millie, following the completion of its external audit, has taken a number of
steps to restructure and improve its financial status. Completion of the audit of Bank
Pashtany has been delayed, but its restructuring plan was approved by the Cabinet in August
2007. The client accounts of the Export Promotion Bank have been transferred to Bank
Pashtany and the merger of the two banks is expected to be completed by March 31, 2008.
To preserve the value of state-owned banks, we continue to prohibit lending from these
banks to enterprises in need of restructuring (continuous structural performance criterion).
Progress in reforming the legislative framework for the business environment
17.
has been slow, in part due to the lengthy review process at the Ministry of Justice. The
submission to parliament of laws on partnership and corporations, secure transactions, and
negotiable instruments is still pending. We are concerned that further delays in the
introduction of these laws are likely to impact adversely on private sector investment and
the orderly development of the financial sector.
F. Preparations for the ANDS

18.
We have made substantial progress towards the preparation of the ANDS—our
PRSP—with a view to submitting it to the Boards of the IMF and World Bank by
end-March 2008. Consultations in all 34 provinces have been completed and have resulted
in provincial development plans (PDPs) for each province. We have also completed a first
draft of all the sectoral strategy papers, which have been circulated to civil society and our
development partners for comments. The PDPs and the sectoral strategies will be used to
ensure that the ANDS includes targeted policy measures that reflect the development needs
of each province and each sector, and measures to not only increase investment and growth,
but also to reduce poverty. With the completion of the update of the 2005 National Risk and
Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) earlier this year, and the ongoing work on the 2007
NRVA, we have also improved our capacity to track the impact of government expenditure
on poverty reduction. We have consulted with donors on their likely contributions to the core
and external budget over the next five years. We are in the process of preparing proposals on
broad sectoral priorities, and will engage government entities and the international
community to reach agreement on the ANDS sectoral expenditure envelopes.

46
II. THE PROGRAM FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2007/08 AND FOR 2008/09
A. Macroeconomic Objectives

19.
The near-term macroeconomic outlook remains positive, but inflationary
pressures are expected to subside only gradually. A record harvest and strong growth
in construction and government and business services suggest that the expectation
of double-digit GDP growth in 2007/08 will be fulfilled. In 2008/09, growth in agriculture
is expected to return to the predrought trend, but overall GDP growth is projected at about
9½ percent owing to the strengthened fiscal impulse from donor contributions in support
of the ANDS. Given the anticipated trends in international commodity prices, inflation is
expected to drop below 10 percent in 2008/09, assuming that prudent fiscal and monetary
policies will be successful in containing the second-order effects of the exogenous price
increases.
Economic growth over the medium term will depend critically on curbing
20.
corruption, overcoming infrastructure bottlenecks, and deepening structural reforms in
support of private entrepreneurship. The projected combined donor-financed investment
and domestic investment will decrease from above 40 percent of GDP in 2007/08 to about
30 percent of GDP in 2011/12, assuming that private investment would replace a portion
of the declining public investment component to the tune of 1–2 percent of GDP per year.
Under conservative assumptions with regard to investment efficiency reflecting
Afghanistan’s difficult natural conditions, absorption capacity limits, and inevitably high
security costs, these levels of investment would be consistent with annual GDP growth rates
ranging from 9 percent in 2008/09 to 7 percent in 2012/13. Higher growth rates could be
expected if structural reforms accelerate, the quality of public expenditure improves, and
public investment enhances key infrastructure, notably transport and electricity.
B. Fiscal Policy

21.
We have undertaken measures to ensure that the good revenue performance
will continue throughout the remainder of 2007/08. Revenue is projected to reach
Af 35.7 billion (8.2 percent of GDP) in 2007/08. This is in line with the original program and
goes beyond our objective of collecting revenue equivalent to 8 percent of GDP by 2010/11,
as set out in the Afghanistan Compact agreed between the government and donors in London
in 2006. (The downward revision of the GDP estimates implies that we achieved that
objective last year). During the remainder of this fiscal year, we will endeavor to foster
greater responsibility for revenue collection at the top levels of government and strive to
safeguard the tax collection system against political interference. We will reach an agreement
within the government on the taxation of airlines, including Ariana. We will also work with
parliament to obtain timely approval of the government’s proposed amendments to the tax
legislation. A steering committee for tax and customs modernization was created to address
these challenges—we will use this committee as a forum for advancing sustainable revenue
reforms.
In October 2007, we conducted a limited midyear review of the budget for
22.
2007/08, in line with the understandings reached at the time of the second program

47
review. Both operating expenditure and grants to the operating budget (on a cash basis) have
been reduced by Af 1.5 billion relative to the original program to account for the receipt
of fuel-in-kind from our international partners (published documents show expenditure
of Af 54.8 billion). As a result, operating expenditure through end-2007/08 is now projected
at Af 53.3 billion (12.2 percent of GDP). Within this amount, we have increased security
expenditure by 0.9 percent of GDP by identifying additional donor contributions, as
provided for under the program adjustor, and by reallocating funds from other items, such as
the wage bill increment related to the Pay and Grade reform (postponed until the next fiscal
year). As an increased envelope for security spending has now been built into the revised
program baseline, the program adjustor for additional security expenditure is no longer
necessary. We deem the new agreed envelope for security spending sufficient, but will
consult with IMF staff should unexpected security-related pressures arise. To reflect the
carryover of approved projects from last year, we have revised the core development
budget upward by about Af 10 billion, to Af 87 billion (19.9 percent of GDP). Nevertheless,
in light of systematic underspending in previous years, for program purposes we are targeting
an amount of Af 45.5 billion (10.4 percent of GDP), only Af 1.4 billion higher than in the
original program for 2007/08. We also used the midyear budget review to settle payment
arrears (to private contractors) that had accrued owing to weak financial management in
several line ministries.

23.
Expenditure management efforts during the remainder of 2007/08 will focus on
regularizing the relations between the budget and public enterprises. To that end, we
will initiate a review of the fiscal relations between the government and key SOEs
(e.g., Afghan Telecom, Ariana, DABM—the electricity provider, FLGE—the petroleum
trading SOE, and mining SOEs), in advance of the 2008/09 budget. The review will cover
the period from 2005/06 onward and will focus on: (i) payment of bills and service charges
by the line ministries; (ii) payment of taxes by SOEs; (iii) transfers of SOEs’ profits to the
Treasury account; and (iv) closure of unauthorized bank accounts. These measures should
reduce the pressure to subsidize SOEs. Nevertheless, to obtain settlement of unpaid
government bills, SOEs will need to present audited financial statements for the period
of claims. We will also conclude, with assistance from the World Bank, an analysis of fiscal
sustainability in the security sector.
We will seek to reduce our operating budget deficit excluding grants from
24.
4.0 percent of GDP in 2007/08 to 3.6 percent in 2008/09. This is consistent with our
medium-term fiscal objective of covering operating expenses with domestic revenue—a
target that we expect to achieve by 2012/13. We are targeting domestic revenues of
Af 44.5 billion (8.5 percent of GDP) for 2008/09. At the same time, operating expenditure
in 2008/09 will be capped at Af 63.4 billion (12.1 percent of GDP)—this will allow us to
accommodate recent decisions to increase the size of both the army and the police,
accompanied by a Pay and Rank Reform in these sectors, and will provide for Af 2.8 billion
in fuel subsidies for Da Afghanistan Breshna Moassesa (DABM). The ceiling on operating
expenditures reflects a prudent approach to the wage bill, which seeks to encourage faster
progress in the civilian Pay and Grade Reform. To that end, pay increases outside the reform
process will be contained below inflation. Consistent with the PRGF program and the
baseline scenario in the ANDS, core budget development expenditure is projected at
Af 56.9 billion (10.9 percent of GDP) in 2008/09, representing a 25 percent increase in
nominal terms over the expected outturn this year.

25.
Revenue policy in 2008/09 will focus on implementing measures to secure the
success of major tax reforms slated for 2009/10. In this two-step process, we target a
revenue increase of only 0.3 percent of GDP in 2008/09, to be followed by a further increase
of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2009/10, which would bring the revenue-to-GDP ratio to
9.1 percent. In 2008/09, while maintaining the necessary collection efforts to achieve the
annual revenue target, we will place greater emphasis on (i) consolidating the pertinent
legislation; (ii) capacity building; and (iii) expanding administrative reforms. The legislative
agenda, part of which has already been submitted to parliament, includes: (i) the elimination
of nuisance taxes; (ii) reforms to income taxation; and (iii) measures toward transforming the
BRT into a broad-based consumption tax, such as the imposition of a BRT on imports (to
become effective in 2009/10—structural benchmark for March 2009) and exempting
financial services from the BRT. Once approved by parliament, we will promptly announce
these measures to the public. We will also conduct an information campaign within the trader
community prior to withdrawing the concessions on filing and paying taxes (structural
benchmark for March 2009) that had been granted to traders. In the meantime, we will focus
on key administrative reforms to maximize the benefits of the planned tax policy measures.
First and foremost, we will ensure adequate resourcing of the Revenue and Customs

49
Departments, focusing on the retention of qualified staff and the needs of the major
provincial tax offices. Based on this, we will roll out the operations of the LTO and
MTO to five key provinces. We will also refine the crediting mechanism currently used for
the income tax with a view to applying a similar mechanism to the BRT that will be collected
on imports, thus alleviating partially the cascading of this tax. We will also continue to
expand the collection net to capture high value tax payers, including airlines, security
companies, and landlords.
On the expenditure side, we will focus on fiscal discipline, improving the quality
26.
of public expenditure, and aligning it with the ANDS’ priorities. Several reforms are
critical in this regard:
•

On budget formulation, we will expand the program budget pilots to seven
ministries and ensure that the program structure is aligned with the ANDS sector
strategies. This reform will not only help integrate budget formulation in line
ministries, but will also contribute to aggregate discipline as decision makers are
presented with information that will facilitate prioritization (March 2008).

•

We will work with our development partners to strengthen financial management
in the line ministries. In particular, we will ensure that the government priorities,
as defined in the budget, are implemented and will seek to eliminate the build up
of arrears in line ministries (throughout 2008/09).

•

The Treasury Department will restructure operations in three provincial
Mustofiats by using the Afghanistan Financial Management Information System
(AFMIS) to process transactions of these Mustofiats and by hiring the staff needed
to execute treasury functions on a PRR (priority restructuring and reform) basis
(March 2008).

•

The MOF will implement a new procedure to integrate and restructure allotment
management arrangements based on a commitment management system and
financial plans from all budgetary units (March 2008).

•

To improve payroll management, we will adopt, in consultation with line ministries
and donors, an action plan for implementing a computerized payroll system that will
allow the MOF to track payroll payments for all government employees
(January 2008).

•

We will take decisive actions to contain potential fiscal drains resulting from lack
of financial discipline in the public enterprises, particularly, DABM. To this effect,
we will follow through on our commitment to establish a comprehensive agreement
with the DABM on a medium-term plan to reduce subsidies. For 2008/09—as we do
not envisage any additional sources of electricity coming on line—we will reach an
interim agreement with DABM (structural benchmark for March 2008) on quarterly
reform benchmarks to be met in exchange for subsidy disbursements (see Technical
Memorandum of Understanding (TMU ¶2). Key conditions will include submitting

50
financial statements for 2006/07–2007/08 (by June 2008), achieving measurable
improvements in collection performance, and cutting physical theft of electricity. By
September 2008, in collaboration with DABM, we will prepare a draft medium-term
plan to gradually reduce and eventually eliminate the energy subsidy. The viability
of the plan will be predicated on: (i) DABM’s restructuring; (ii) optimal use of
existing and new electricity sources; (iii) tariff increases for premium power users;
and (iv) scheduled load shedding for residential customers (as opposed to cutting
supply to control costs, as is presently the case). Moreover, we will ensure that at
no stage the increase in electricity supply leads to an increase in subsidies. We will
finalize this plan and agree with DABM on the timetable for its implementation by
December 2008 (structural benchmark).
•

We will continue to monitor fiscal risks related to aid volatility and work with
donors on refining our projections in this area.

•

Implementation of the Pay and Grade reform will start before September 2008.

We will continue to strengthen the MTFF as a policy tool for the government.
27.
The MTFF will be the primary instrument for setting fiscal parameters for the annual budget
process and the ANDS envelope, and for analyzing fiscal sustainability. To that end, we will
determine, and subsequently update on an annual basis, the fiscal parameters for the ANDS
macroframework. For the 2008/09 budget, the MTFF will: (i) set out our medium-term plan
to eliminate the operating budget deficit before grants; establish indicative sectoral
allocations for both the core and external budgets; and (ii) provide envelopes for key crosscutting areas, such as Pay and Grade Reform and maintenance costs associated with
investment spending. The latter will build on our recent work with the World Bank and
security partners to assess fiscal sustainability in the security sector. It will include concise
descriptions of the policy actions necessary to meet fiscal objectives, on both the revenue and
expenditure fronts. The improvements to the MTFF will be in line with the understandings
underpinning the HIPC completion point triggers.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies

28.
Monetary policy will seek to contain inflationary pressures. In this context, we
consider the original currency in circulation ceiling for 2007/08 (consistent with a 19 percent
growth in the demand for the Afghanis) appropriate, even though nominal GDP growth in
2007/08 is likely to exceed this figure by about five percentage points. The major
contribution to growth in 2007/08 comes from agriculture, which adds comparatively less
than other sectors to the demand for domestic currency. The envisaged monetary tightening
will limit the increase in the prices of nontradables, and will help contain inflation. In
2008/09, we expect economic growth to be more broad-based and the demand for money to
increase by about 20 percent, in line with the nominal GDP growth.
Foreign exchange auctions will remain a primary instrument of monetary
29.
policy. DAB will make no commitment to purchase Afghanis at a pre-determined rate and
thus uphold the managed float character of the exchange regime. Seasonally-adjusted
quarterly currency-in-circulation targets (consistent with the program currency-in-circulation

51
ceiling) will provide guidance for DAB’s foreign exchange interventions, while the degree of
flexibility will enable the DAB to smooth out short-term exchange rate fluctuations. DAB
will ensure the observance of the “T + 2” rule for the settlement of the bids in foreign
exchange auctions and impose adequate penalties on violators, including escalating fines
and, ultimately, suspension of money changers licenses for multiple offenders.
30.
DAB will improve the standing arrangements for the provision of cash (in
Afghanis and in U.S. dollars). To this effect, DAB will satisfy the constitutional requirement
of consulting with parliament on cash printing once a year when presenting its annual report,
and will make advance arrangements for ensuring an adequate supply of Afghani notes
during the year. The guidelines on importing and exporting U.S. currency will also be
articulated clearly and incorporated in DAB’s operating procedures. DAB will also improve
liquidity forecasting—in cooperation with the MOF—in order to ensure a smooth
implementation of monetary policy. In particular, DAB management will strengthen the
internal consultation mechanism over liquidity forecasts and intervention policy by endowing
the Monetary Policy Department with greater ownership and accountability for its policy
advice.
DAB will be expanding the volume of capital notes auctions with a focus on
31.
managing bank liquidity and developing a yield curve. Preparations for launching the
secondary market in capital notes (CNs) will be finalized in February 2008. Subsequently,
DAB will articulate the steps leading to the opening of the secondary market for CNs and
promulgate the rules guiding secondary market transactions among the commercial
banks. Meanwhile, DAB will increase the volume of auctions and strengthen the procedure
for determining ex ante the amounts to be auctioned.
We continue to develop controls against money laundering and financing of
32.
terrorism (AML/CFT) in the banking and other sectors. We intend to have all the
appropriate controls in place prior to the first AML/CFT evaluation of Afghanistan by the
Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering, which is expected to take place in the third
quarter of 2008.
D. Strengthening of DAB’s Accounting and Reporting Framework

33.
The introduction of the new accounting system at DAB forms the basis for
strengthening internal control and improving the quality of data available to inform
policy decisions. Nevertheless, further steps are needed to make the new system fully
operational. With assistance from the Middle East Technical Assistance Center (METAC),
we will work toward finalizing this task and ensure that the new accounting system at the six
regional hubs is fully integrated with that at DAB’s headquarters and satisfies the standards
required for central bank operations (structural benchmark for end-March 2008).
We will also take steps to strengthen the quality of the monthly reporting
34.
of DAB’s operations. To this effect: (i) by December 20, 2007, we will take stock
of discrepancies between the monthly reports based on the accounting records and the reports
produced by the Monetary Policy Department for program monitoring and reporting;
(ii) subsequently, we will eliminate these discrepancies by correcting the errors in the source

52
data; (iii) by the beginning of fiscal year 2008/09, and only if satisfactory reconciliation is
achieved, we will use the data based on the accounting records for program monitoring and
reporting monetary operations to the IMF.
35.
Since July 2007 DAB has been producing monetary surveys of a better quality.
In the period ahead, DAB will reconcile central bank and commercial banks reporting (based
on a consistent Gregorian or Solar Calendar time-frame) and publish integrated monetary
surveys using a consistent time-frame.
E. Safeguards Assessment Issues

36.
We have renewed our commitment to improving DAB's operations and control
framework by implementing the IMF's updated safeguards recommendations. To
provide assurances regarding the level of DAB’s reserve assets, we have requested our
external auditors to conduct an independent verification of these assets and their availability
as of September 22, 2007 (prior action). In addition, we will take steps to complete the
annual audit of financial year 1385 (2006/07) by end-December 2007, and appoint an
external auditor for financial year 1386 (2007/08) by end-December 2007 (prior action).
We will also continue with the process of implementing the new accounting system and
addressing audit observations for the financial year 1385 concerning weaknesses in controls,
with priority given to the accounting and foreign reserves management areas.
F. Bank Supervision and Financial Sector Policies

37.
To safeguard the soundness of the banking sector, we will continue to
strengthen bank supervision and address banks’ noncompliance with prudential
regulations. Effective immediately, we will stop awarding licenses for opening new
branches to banks exhibiting “well-defined weakness” (i.e., banks with Capital adequacy,
Asset quality, Management, Earnings, and Liquidity (CAMEL) ratings of 4 and 5). Also,
given the absence of appropriate risk management skills and the limited effective collateral,
we will limit the credit growth of such banks to 5 percent per quarter beginning
end-December 2007. This limitation will remain in effect for those banks whose CAMEL
ratings continue to be assessed as 4 or 5 by DAB’s banking supervision department. We will
notify the banks by end-November 2007 of our decision. We will also revise the enforcement
regulations to ensure that corrective actions are taken promptly, and will follow up on the
banks’ failure to comply with these actions. To that end, we will put in place automatic
measures, including fines for each day of failing to comply with DAB's orders. We are in the
process of developing an off-site supervision form detailing sectoral loan classification. As
of December 2007, banks will be required to report their loans to DAB based on these new
forms. To increase the transparency of the legal framework for commercial bank operations,
we intend to consolidate all pertinent regulations in a handbook.

53
38.
We will seek to enhance coherence in the regulatory framework for the banking
sector in close consultation with IMF staff. DAB’s Supreme Council will repeal the
decisions instituting the requirement to invest 80 percent of bank deposits in the domestic
economy and raising the minimum capital requirement from US$5 million to US$20 million.
DAB will issue circulars informing banks that these decisions have been repealed (structural
benchmarks for end-March 2008). After consultation with IMF staff, we believe that the
minimum capital requirement for commercial banks should be raised to US$10 million.
The new requirement will be applicable immediately for new banks seeking licenses, while
incumbent banks will be given 5 years to comply. In relaxing our position on minimum
capital requirements, we are recognizing the need to ensure that small but well-run banks
continue to operate.
We will also modify two tax policy provisions applicable to the banking sector.
39.
Taxation of income from bank deposits will be applied uniformly to all commercial banks,
including state-owned and private banks, and the provisions calling for the withholding
of taxes on interbank lending will be withdrawn. Both actions will be taken by end-2007/08.
G. External Sector Policies

40.
We are committed to a trade regime that minimizes distortions and does not
discriminate across importers. Consistent with this objective, the decree (No. 5016)
allowing selected producers to import raw materials at a 1 percent tariff rate will be repealed
by December 31, 2007 (prior action). The goods eligible for the 1 percent rate will be
incorporated in the tariff schedule at rate(s) to be decided, with due consideration for
government revenue. Moreover, we intend to repeal, by end-March 2009, the decree (No. 96)
that raised the tariff rate on soft drinks from 20 to 40 percent, and reduce the applicable tariff
rate to 20 percent. Fund staff and the authorities have reached an understanding that this
measure will be a structural performance criterion for a later review. Furthermore, we will
refrain from introducing any discriminatory trade policy measures and reclassifying goods
into higher tariff bands, and will unwind previous tariff increases once the revenue situation
permits. We also intend to limit changes to the tariff schedule by (i) acting in accordance
with paragraph 23.2 of the customs law, which states that “the customs tariff shall be
approved by the Minister of Finance upon the recommendation of the General Director
of Customs;” and (ii) avoiding changes to the tariff schedule outside the annual budget
process. Finally, we are committed to an even-handed application of the tariff schedule and
will promptly redress any irregularities in this regard, including in the case of gasoline.
We are also committed to maintaining a foreign exchange system free of
41.
restrictions. In this regard, we look forward to receiving technical assistance from the Fund
to assist us in assessing the adequacy of our legal framework and in formalizing a
restrictions-free exchange system consistent with our aim of accepting the obligations under
the Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, 4 of the Fund’s Article’s of Agreement.
We will continue to make efforts to regularize relations with all our creditors
42.
while pursuing a prudent debt management strategy consistent with achieving external
debt sustainability. In this regard, we will work toward reaching agreements with our

54
non-Paris Club bilateral and commercial creditors on terms at least comparable with those
received from Paris Club creditors, and will redouble our efforts to complete a debt relief
agreement with the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID). Moreover, we will
continue to rely primarily on grants and highly concessional loans to meet our financing
needs. The government and DAB will not contract or guarantee any nonconcessional
external debt (continuous performance criterion).
H. Petroleum Sector

43.
We remain committed to a transparent and competitive petroleum sector, with
the private sector playing the dominant role. The recent decision of the Fuel and Liquid
Gas Enterprise (FLGE) to import fuel for state-owned retail pump stations was necessary
because of temporary shortages, which led to sharp increases in retail prices. Nonetheless,
the government’s intention, as highlighted in the Afghanistan Compact, is to withdraw from
the oil sector and privatize the FLGE by March 2009. To this end, we intend to reduce
gradually the FLGE’s imports of petroleum products and, ultimately, limit its role to
providing services to the private sector. We will ensure that fees collected for the FLGE’s
services will not be used to subsidize the fuel sold by FLGE, including at state-owned retail
pump stations. To improve transparency in the sector, we also plan to publish a schedule of
fees for FLGE's services (end-February 2008 structural benchmark). We remain mindful of
the need to protect the consumer by maintaining competitive market conditions, and are in
the process of formulating an anti-trust law for that purpose. To improve transparency and
prepare for the privatization of the FLGE, we have commissioned an external audit of its
accounts for 2007/08, which would be completed by November 2008. Upon completion of
the audit, we will promptly publish the audit report (structural benchmark).
I.

Other Structural Reforms

44.
We will redouble our efforts to finalize the strategic plan for the non-Tassady
public enterprises and government entities engaged in commercial activities. We will
prepare a strategic plan for non-Tassady enterprises for Cabinet adoption by March 31, 2008
(structural benchmark). Regarding Ariana, we will not: (i) assume payment obligations for
liabilities contracted without government guarantee; (ii) provide government guarantees for
new obligations; or (iii) approve lending to Ariana by state-owned banks.
We will follow through on our plans to restructure the state-owned banks
45.
(Pashtany and Millie) and will establish a timetable for finalizing the liquidation
of delicensed state-owned banks. We are also committed to resolving the outstanding issues
raised in the context of the external audit of Bank Pashtany, with a view to enabling the
completion of the audit report by December 20, 2007.
J. ANDS and HIPC-Related Issues

46.
Prioritization and realistic costing of sectoral strategies will be key to the quality
of the ANDS. In order to complete the ANDS on schedule, we are initially costing three
sectoral strategies (education, health and roads), which will be included in the 2008/09
budget. The remaining sectoral strategies will be costed in time for the first ANDS annual

55
progress report, which we intend to submit to the Boards of the IMF and the World Bank in
early- to mid-2009. As the financing needs implied by the sectoral strategies and PDPs are
expected to exceed available resources, we will use the MTFF to balance the needs of
different sectors and provinces with fiscal prudence, and to spread the implementation of the
ANDS over a realistic timeline.
47.
Progress continues towards meeting our HIPC completion point triggers.
Regarding the HIPC completion point triggers within the IMF’s areas of responsibility, we
aim to strengthen our debt management capacity by publishing quarterly external debt
reports, starting with the report for the first quarter of 2008/09 within three months of the end
of the quarter, and by implementing a database system on external debt by
end-September 2008. The 2008/09 budget formulation process will seek to satisfy the trigger
on alignment of public spending priorities, and the MTFF published alongside the budget
will be in line with the criteria set out in the HIPC trigger. We are modifying the Treasury’s
Chart of Accounts to enable the tracking of poverty reducing expenditures during 2008/09.
Annual audits of the core budget’s financial statements will proceed in line with the
requirements of the HIPC trigger.
K. Statistical Issues

48.
Several initiatives are under way to improve Afghanistan’s statistics in the key
sectors for economic policy and the ANDS. In August 2007, we began the 2007 NRVA,
which extends the consumption module of the 2005 NRVA to a larger number of nonfood
items. We have also made preparations for launching the Integrated Business Enterprise
Survey in February 2008. The findings of these surveys will help upgrade the social database
and serve as a basis for strengthening the national accounts.
49.
We plan to intensify our efforts to build the capacity of the Central Statistics
Office (CSO), including by appointing the head of CSO, increasing training, providing
adequate resources through securing funding from donors, and restructuring its operations.
In coordination with the donor community, CSO intends to develop a detailed blueprint to
address the weaknesses in the national income accounts database. Finally, we plan to launch
the national household census in August 2008.
We will continue to work toward compiling a balance of payments for 2007/08.
50.
To that end, DAB and AISA, in consultation with the STA expert from the IMF will jointly
launch by year’s end a FDI survey for 2007/08 to a sample of companies, with a view to
completing it before the end of the first quarter of 2008/09. Moreover, CSO will improve the
quality of merchandise trade data, including duty-free imports, and the timeliness of their
reporting. It will also coordinate with the MOF to improve the consistency between the CSO
trade data and those reported by the Customs Department.
III. PROGRAM MONITORING

51.
The program will be monitored through quantitative performance criteria for March
2008 and indicative targets for December 2007, June 2008, and September 2008. The fourth
review under the arrangement is scheduled to be completed by June 2008 and will be

56
conditional upon compliance with the quantitative performance criteria and structural
conditionality through March 2008. The updated TMU (attached) specifies the details
of program monitoring, including definitions of performance criteria and adjusters, and
data provision requirements.
52.
During the program period, Afghanistan will not impose or intensify restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, or introduce or
modify multiple currency practices, or conclude bilateral payments agreements inconsistent
with Article VIII, or impose or intensify import restrictions for balance of payments
purposes.

4.
Program exchange rates will be used for purposes of monitoring the quantitative
targets under the program. All foreign assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars will
be converted into Afghanis using a program exchange rate of 50.08 Afghanis per U.S. dollar,
which corresponds to the average of the Af/US$ buy and sell cash rates, as reported by DAB
as of March 19, 2007. For assets and liabilities denominated in SDRs and in foreign
currencies other than the U.S. dollar, they will be converted into U.S. dollars at their
respective exchange rates prevailing as of March 19, 2007, as reported in the following table.
Gold holdings will be valued at US$653.47 per ounce, the price as of March 19, 2007.

B. Currency in Circulation

5.
Currency in circulation is defined as total currency issued by DAB. It excludes
currency held in the presidential palace vault, in DAB main vault, and in the vaults of all
DAB’s provincial and district branches.
C. Net Central Bank Financing of the Government

6.
NCBF of the government is defined as the difference between the central bank’s
claims on the government and the deposits of the government with DAB. These deposits
include the deposits held at DAB headquarters, but exclude the deposits held at DAB’s
branches.1
D. Net International Reserves

7.
Net international reserves (NIR) are defined as reserve assets minus reserve
liabilities of DAB.
Reserve assets of DAB, as defined in the fifth edition of the balance of payments
8.
manual (BPM5), are claims on nonresidents denominated in foreign convertible currencies,
that are controlled by DAB, and are readily and unconditionally available for DAB to meet
balance of payments financing needs, intervention in exchange markets, and other purposes.
They include DAB holdings of monetary gold, SDRs, Afghanistan’s reserve position in the
IMF, foreign currency cash (including foreign exchange banknotes in the vaults of DAB, but
excluding cash held in DAB’s branches), and deposits abroad (including balances on
accounts maintained with overseas correspondent banks). Excluded from reserve assets are
any assets that are pledged, collateralized, or otherwise encumbered;2 claims on residents;
precious metals other than monetary gold; assets in nonconvertible currencies; illiquid assets;
and claims on foreign exchange arising from derivatives in foreign currencies vis-à-vis
domestic currency (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options).
Reserve liabilities are defined as short-term (original maturity) foreign exchange
9.
liabilities of DAB to nonresidents (held at DAB headquarters); all credit outstanding from
the IMF; foreign currency reserves of commercial banks held at DAB headquarters;
commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from derivatives (such as futures, forwards,

1

This definition differs slightly from international standards owing to the unavailability of reliable and timely
government deposit data from DAB’s branches.

2

In particular, assets that are counterpart of the government's foreign currency deposits that back letters of credit
are excluded from the reserve assets. However, assets that are counterpart of other government deposits are
included in the reserve assets.

65
swaps, and options); and all arrears on principal or interest payments to commercial banks,
suppliers, or official export credit agencies.
10.

Reserve assets and reserve liabilities will both be expressed in U.S. dollars.
E. Revenues of the Central Government

11.
Revenues of the central government are defined in line with the Government
Financial Statistics Manual (GFSM 2001) on a cash accounting basis, excluding foreign
grants. Revenue is an increase in net worth of the central government (including its units in
the provinces and agencies) resulting from a transaction. Revenues of the central government
include taxes and other compulsory transfers imposed by central government units, property
income derived from the ownership of assets, sales of goods and services, social
contributions, interest, fines, penalties and forfeits and voluntary transfers received from
nongovernment other than grants. The definition for program monitoring excludes grants and
other noncompulsory contributions received from foreign governments and international
organizations; such transfers between central government units would be eliminated in the
consolidation of the fiscal reports and not recorded as revenue. Receipts collected by central
government on behalf of noncentral government units should not be counted as revenue
(e.g., Red Crescent fees). Receipts from the sale of nonfinancial assets, such as privatization,
and transactions in financial assets and liabilities, such as borrowing but excepting interest
payments, are also excluded from the definition of revenue.
Revenues should be recognized on a cash basis and flows should be recorded when
12.
cash is received. Exceptional advanced payments will be treated as if received on the normal
due date. All revenue must be supported by the relevant documentation and revenue
receivables, where a cash sum has been recorded but the revenue item has not yet been
accounted for, and revenues payable, where the revenue has been reported but the cash has
yet to be recorded should be separately reported on a gross basis.
F. External Debt and Arrears

13.
As set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect
to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-00/85; August 24, 2000), the term “debt” will be
understood to mean a current (i.e., not contingent) liability, created under a contractual
arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or
services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will
discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract.
•

Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being: (a) loans, (i.e., advances
of money to obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the
obligor will repay the funds in the future—including deposits, bonds, debentures,

66
commercial loans and buyers’ credits—and temporary exchanges of assets that are
equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay
the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in
the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);
(b) suppliers’ credits (i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered or services
are provided); and (c) leases (i.e., arrangements under which property is provided that
the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are
usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor
retains the title to the property). Excluded from this limit are leases of real property
by Afghan embassies or other foreign representations of the government.
•

For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the
lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement
excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the
property. Arrears, penalties, and judicially-awarded damages arising from the failure
to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure
to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition
(e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.

The ceiling on medium- and long-term external debt applies on a continuous
14.
basis to the contracting or guaranteeing by the government or DAB of new
nonconcessional external debt with an original maturity of more than one year. For
program purposes, “government” includes the central government (including government
departments), as well as official agencies that do not seek profit and whose budgets are
issued independent of the annual operational or development budgets. Consistent with the
PFEM law, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) should have sole responsibility for the
contracting and guaranteeing of external debt on behalf of the government.
•

It applies to both debt as defined in paragraph 13 of this memorandum, and also to
commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. For the
purposes of the program:

-

external debt will be considered to have been contracted at the point the loan
agreement or guarantee is signed by the MOF (on behalf of the government) or
DAB Governor; and

-

the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal obligation of the government
or DAB, or any other agency acting on behalf of the government, to service such
a debt in the event of nonpayment by the recipient (involving payments in cash or
in kind), or indirectly through any other obligation of the government or DAB to
cover a shortfall incurred by the loan recipient.

67
•

Excluded from the limits are refinancing credits and rescheduling operations, credits
extended by the IMF, and credits on concessional terms defined as those with a grant
element of at least 60 percent. The grant element is to be calculated using currencyspecific discount rates based on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development’s Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs): for maturities of less
than 15 years, the grant element will be calculated based on six-month averages of
CIRRs; and for maturities longer than 15 years, the grant element will be calculated
based on 10 year averages.

•

Debt falling within the limit shall be valued in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate
prevailing at the time the contract or guarantee becomes effective.

The zero ceiling on short-term external debt applies on a continuous basis to the
15.
stock of short-term external debt owed or guaranteed by the government (as defined in
paragraph 14 of this memorandum) or DAB, with an original maturity of up to and including
one year.
•

It applies to debt as defined in paragraph 13 of this memorandum.

•

Excluded from the limit are rescheduling operations (including the deferral of
interest on commercial debt) and normal import-related credits.

•

Debt falling within the limit shall be valued in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate
prevailing at the time the contract or guarantee becomes effective.

A continuous performance criterion applies to the nonaccumulation of new external
16.
payments arrears on external debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government or
DAB. External payment arrears consist of external debt service obligations (principal and
interest) falling due after March 20, 2006 and that have not been paid at the time they are
due, as specified in the contractual agreements. Excluded from the prohibition on the
accumulation of new arrears are: (a) arrears arising from interest on the stock of arrears
outstanding as of March 20, 2006; and (b) external arrears that are subject to debt
rescheduling agreements or negotiations.
G. Lending to, or Guaranteeing Borrowing by, State-Owned Enterprises

17.
The zero ceiling on new lending from state-owned banks to, or government
guaranteed borrowing by, enterprises in need of restructuring applies on a continuous
basis.
•

For the purposes of this performance criterion:

68

•

-

“state-owned banks” refers to those banks that are wholly or majority owned by
the government (as defined in paragraph 14 of this memorandum); including
Bank Millie, Bank Pashtany, and Export Promotion Bank;

-

“enterprises in need of restructuring” refers to enterprises that meet any one of the
following: (a) enterprises (public or private) that have not had an audited balance
sheet in fiscal years 1384 and 1385; (b) public enterprises that have been
identified by the MOF for liquidation; (c) public enterprises that do not have
Cabinet-approved restructuring plans;

-

“public enterprises” refers to enterprises wholly or majority owned by the
government, including those covered by the State-Owned Enterprise (Tassady)
Law, and 13 state-owned corporations3 and any other public entities and
government agencies engaged in commercial activities but not covered by
Tassady Law.

It applies to any new loans (or financial contributions) extended directly from
state-owned banks to enterprises in need of restructuring, and also to any new
government guarantees (as defined in paragraph 14 of this memorandum) of
borrowing undertaken by these enterprises. It applies to loan agreements and
guarantees for which value has not been received.
H. Adjustors

18.
The floor on NIR and the ceiling on the NCBF of the government are defined
consistent with the assumption that core budget development spending in 2007/08 will
amount, on a cumulative basis from March 20, 2007, to:
December 21, 2007
March 19, 2008

Af 27,063 million
Af 45,483 million

and in 2008/09 will amount on a cumulative basis from March 19, 2008, to:
June 20, 2008
September 21, 2008

3

Af 7,107 million
Af 21,320 million

Afsotar, Afghan Teor, Aftento, Af-Turk, Afghan Cart, Afghan Naichi, Astrass, Afghan Telecom, Afghan
Wireless, Afghan National Insurance Company, Afghan Textile, Ariana Afghan Airlines, and Hotel
Intercontinental (Baghi Bala/Kabul).

69
Should core budget development spending exceed these projections, the NIR floor will be
adjusted downward and the NCBF ceiling will be adjusted upward by the difference between
the actual level (up to the appropriated amount) and the projected level of development
spending.
The NIR floor and NCBF ceiling are defined consistent with the assumption that the
19.
external financing of the core budget and the receipts from the sale or transfer of
nonfinancial assets will amount, on a cumulative basis from March 20, 2007, to:
December 21, 2007
March 19, 2008

Af 38,980 million
Af 56,889 million

and in 2008/09 will amount on a cumulative basis from March 19, 2008, to:
June 20, 2007
September 21, 2008

Af 10,742 million
Af 28,161 million

Should external financing of the core budget (including that associated with off20.
budgetary spending coming on budget) and the receipts from the sale or transfer of
nonfinancial assets collectively exceed (fall short of) these projections, the NIR floor will be
adjusted upward (downward) and the NCBF ceiling will be adjusted downward (upward) by
the difference between their actual level and the projected level.
Should some expenditure currently financed directly by donors outside the budget be
21.
moved on to the operating budget, the NIR floor will be adjusted downward, and the NCBF
ceiling and the indicative targets (ceilings) for the operating budget deficits of the central
government, excluding grants, will be adjusted upward, by the actual amount of these
expenditures on the conditions that (a) the moving on budget of these expenditures is
justified by a statement from donors indicating their decision to stop financing them outside
the budget and (b) they are subject to a supplementary appropriation approved by parliament.
The overall downward adjustment to the NIR floors will be capped at US$300 million.
III. PROVISION OF INFORMATION TO FUND STAFF

22.
To facilitate the monitoring of program implementation, the government of
Afghanistan and DAB will provide to Division A of the Middle East and Central Asia
Department (MCD), through the office of the Resident Representative of the IMF in
Afghanistan, the information specified below and summarized in the list of reporting tables
provided by Fund staff to the Technical Committee.

70
In order to facilitate regular monitoring of the PRGF-supported program, actual
23.
outcomes should be provided with the frequencies and lags indicated below.
•
DAB net international reserves should be reported weekly, no later than two weeks
after the end of the week.
•
Monetary statistics, including exchange rates, government accounts with DAB,
currency in circulation, and a monetary survey should be reported monthly and no later
than three weeks after the end of the month. The monetary survey will include the balance
sheet of DAB and a consolidated balance sheet of the commercial banking sector.
Core budget operations and their financing should be reported monthly and no
later than four weeks after the end of the month. The official reports for the purpose of
program monitoring will be the monthly financial statements from the Afghanistan Financial
Management Information System. The structure of financing (grants and loans should be
separately identified) and expenditure data should be on a consistent cash basis. Core
operating expenditures should be reported on a monthly basis using the budget appropriation
economic (object) and administrative classification in addition to the program and functional
classification as reported in the budget documents. Core development expenditures should
also be reported separately on a monthly basis using the budget program classification in
addition to the economic (object), administrative and functional classification consistent with
the operating budget. All the data should also compare outturns against the approved budget
(or figures reported in the budget documents). Core operating and development revenues and
expenditures should also be reported by province, separately on the same monthly basis.

•

External budget operations and their financing (i.e., donor funded spending
outside the core budget treasury systems) should be reported at least semi-annually (more
frequently if possible) and no later than eight weeks after the end of the period. External
development expenditures should be reported on a disbursement basis (as currently defined
in budget documents) using the budget program classification (and an administrative,
functional and provincial classification where possible).

•

•
External debt data should be reported quarterly and no later than six weeks after the
end of the quarter. They will include: (a) details of new loans contracted or guaranteed
during the quarter, including the terms of each new loan; (b) the stock of debt at the end the
quarter, including short-term debt, and medium- and long-term debt; (c) loan disbursements
and debt service payments (interest and amortization) during the quarter; (d) debt relief
received during the quarter; (e) information on all overdue payments on short-term debt, and
on medium- and long-term debt, including new external arrears (if any); and (f) total
outstanding amount of arrears.

71
•
National accounts data, with the exception of merchandise trade data, should be
reported annually and no later than eight weeks after the end of the year. Merchandise trade
data should be reported quarterly and no later than eight weeks after the end of the quarter.
•
Consumer price indexes (CPIs) for the city of Kabul and for Kabul and five other
major cities (“national” CPI) should be reported monthly and no later than four weeks after
the end of the month.

The government of Afghanistan and DAB will prepare and send to the IMF reports
24.
explaining progress made in implementing structural reforms, in particular regarding those
included as structural performance criteria and benchmarks in the program. These reports
will include appropriate documentation to substantiate progress achieved, and will explain
any deviations relative to the initial reform plans or timetable, specifying expected revised
completion date.
Other details on major economic and social measures taken by the government that
25.
are expected to have an impact on program sequencing (such as changes in legislation,
regulations, or any other pertinent document) will be sent in a timely manner to IMF staff,
for consultation or information.
The Technical Committee of Coordination (TCC) will provide Division A of MCD
26.
with any other information that may be required by the staff of the IMF for the effective
monitoring of the program. For program monitoring purposes, working meetings are
planned, at least biweekly, with the participation of representatives of the designated
members of the TCC, including any party that could facilitate monitoring implementation of
the program.

Exchange Arrangement

Afghanistan is an Article XIV member country. The authorities are implementing a liberal
exchange system. Based on information currently available to the staff, no exchange
restrictions and multiple currency practices are currently in place. The authorities have
provided documents to IMF staff related to laws and regulations on the exchange regime
and have requested technical assistance from the Fund to formalize the current liberal
regime. They have been implementing a managed float system with no predetermined path
for the exchange rate. On January 16, 2008, the average of the buying and selling exchange
rates in cash transactions on the Kabul money exchange market was Af 49.47 per $1.
To conduct monetary policy, the authorities rely on foreign exchange auctions since
May 2002, and on short-term capital note auctions since September 2004. The foreign
exchange auctions were initially open only to licensed money changers, but since June 2005
they are also open to commercial banks. The capital note auctions are open to commercial
banks. Auctions are linked to the overall monetary program and are held on a regular basis
(biweekly for foreign exchange auctions, daily for capital note auctions).
X.

Article IV Consultation

The last Article IV consultation with Afghanistan was discussed by the Executive Board
on March 6, 2006. Consultations with Afghanistan are on the standard 12-month cycle.
XI.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) is subject to
a safeguards assessment with respect to PRGF arrangement approved on June 26, 2006.
A safeguards assessment of DAB completed on June 12, 2006 revealed serious
vulnerabilities in DAB's external and internal audit mechanisms, as well as in its financial
1

Net Present Value (NPV) at the decision point under the enhanced framework.

4
reporting framework and system of internal controls. Capacity constraints, however,
hampered the effective implementation of measures recommended by the assessment,
and a follow-up staff visit conducted in November 2007 found that while external audit
arrangements have been strengthened, financial reporting and internal controls were
insufficient to ensure the accuracy of monetary data, and the accounting system remained
unreliable. To provide some assurances ahead of the next review of the PRGF arrangement,
the mission recommended that a special audit of reserve assets be conducted as a prior action
for the completion of the review.

Afghanistan is a participant in the Middle East Technical Assistance Center.
With financial support from the Sweden Technical Assistance Subaccount, the Fund
sponsored a number of training activities aimed at DAB officials. A long-term resident
training advisor, Mr. Khan, was posted at DAB from September 2004-April 2006 and is

6
now conducting peripatetic technical assistance missions. Finally, Sweden has financed a
monetary policy peripatetic advisor (a position currently shared by Mr. Coats and Mr. Gray)
to assist DAB in developing the strategy and instruments for improving the implementation
of monetary policy.
XIII. Resident Representatives
During the first half of 2002, the Fund’s resident representative in Pakistan, Mr. Ghesquière,
assisted in maintaining relations with the Afghan authorities. A resident representative,
Mr. de Schaetzen, took up his post in Kabul on August 24, 2002. Mr. Charap succeeded him
on June 13, 2005.

7
ANNEX II. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of January 9, 2008)
1.
The Interim Strategy Note (ISN) discussed by the IDA Board of Executive Directors
on May 25, 2006 follows the two Transitional Support Strategies (TSS) that covered the
2002-06 periods. It is guiding IDA’s engagement in Afghanistan over the period of 2006–08
and is expected to be followed by a full Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) once the
Government has finalized its full PRSP–Afghanistan National Development Strategy which
is expected to be completed in March 2008. The government promulgated its Interim
Afghanistan National Development Strategy (I-ANDS) in January 2006. As the government
had submitted the I-ANDS to the IMF and the World Bank as its Interim Poverty Reduction
Strategy (I-PRSP), Bank and Fund staff prepared a Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) which
was also discussed by the Bank Board on May 25, 2006. The ISN focus shifts slightly from
the previous TSS, notably to provide greater emphasis on the development of the rural
economy. Its pillars are: (i) build the capacity of the state and its accountability to its citizens
to ensure the provision of services that are accountable, accessible, and of adequate quality;
(ii) promote growth of the rural economy and improve rural livelihoods; and (iii) support
growth of a formal, modern, and competitive private sector.
2.
As of January 9, 2008 the World Bank had committed an aggregate of US$1.6 billion
in IDA assistance to Afghanistan, financing more than 30 projects covering public
administration, infrastructure, education, health, customs, transport, and rural development.
Three IDA projects closed in FY 2007 (i.e. July 2006–June 2007) and two have closed thus
far in FY08. Most recently, the Board approved, in January 2008, a US$30 million IDA
investment in microfinance. Together with the HIV/AIDS project and the National Rural
Access Program this takes FY08’s commitments to date to US$152 million with three more
planned for board approval, including projects for skills development, educational
improvement and Kabul urban waste.
3.
As of December 31, 2007, the IDA’s active portfolio comprised 21 investment
projects with combined net commitments of US$1,016 million of which 48 percent had been
disbursed. In terms of sectoral composition of the overall portfolio, rural and transport
sectors continue to represent the two largest shares, with respect to both commitments and
disbursements. This is largely due to the successful implementation of the two nation-wide
programs: National Solidarity Program (NSP) that supports development of community
demand-driven rural infrastructure and community level governance, and the National
Emergency Employment Program (NEEP) that provides short-term employment
opportunities to the vulnerable segments of rural population through rural roads
rehabilitation and reconstruction.
4.
The World Bank also administers the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund
(ARTF), on behalf of 27 donors, which became effective in May 2002. The ARTF is the
main mechanism for providing coordinated funding support to Afghanistan’s recurrent

8
budget, as well as investments through the Core Development Budget in line with agreed
budget priorities of the Government. In the previous Solar Year 1386 (2005/06), the ARTF
mobilized over US$450 million, while cumulative disbursements reached US$468 million.
This Solar Year through November 2007, contributions have reached US$455 million and
disbursements US$297 million.
5.
As of 21 November, 2007, paid-in donor contributions to the ARTF reached
US$ 2.4 billion. As of 21 November, 2007 the ARTF investment window financing
comprised 11 active projects with combined commitments of US$394 million, of
which US$263 million had been disbursed. The National Solidarity Program II and the
Microfinance are the two fast-disbursing programs in the ARTF current investment portfolio.
The new Management Capacity Program was added to the ARTF active portfolio in
FY 2007. The Bank also administers a special window for Afghanistan for the Japanese
Social Development Fund of US$50 million. ARTF is increasing its financing of investments
and has the potential to support better donor coordination, simplified processes, and fast
results.
6.
The World Bank is also actively engaged in providing analytical and advisory
services to the government. Current and recent analytical work has focused on civil service
reform, urban development and land management, education policy reform, labor market and
pensions, oil/gas infrastructure development, and the drug economy, as well as broader
regional trade work encompassing issues with Afghanistan’s neighbors. A Gender
Assessment was released in January 2006. The World Bank completed a major Public
Finance Management (PFM) review in 2006, which incorporates an assessment of civilian
public expenditures and fiduciary aspects, including procurement and financial management,
as well as revenue and security sector expenditures. Fund staff contributed to the PFM
review, including by providing an analysis of domestic revenue prospects. Technical
assistance on pensions and three major analytical tasks, on Public Administration Reform,
on Fighting Corruption, and on Sub-National Administration are underway in response to
government requests. Looking ahead, the pipeline for FY09 includes work on financial sector
reform and rural enterprise development.

9
ANNEX III. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
General
1.
Data are broadly adequate for surveillance and program monitoring, although statistical
weaknesses remain. The statistical system has improved since 2002; nonetheless, organizational
weaknesses, poor staffing, and lack of equipment continue to hamper the compilation process.
Due to security reasons and limited central government influence outside Kabul, setting up a
nationwide statistical system has been a difficult undertaking. While the Central Statistics
Office (CSO) has regional offices, staffing and communication are poor. Staffing in most
agencies is inadequate both in number and expertise, and salaries remain low. Strengthening
statistical capacity is an ongoing process and greater efforts and significant institutional support
will be required if further substantial improvements are to be made. STA continues to provide
technical assistance through peripatetic statistical advisors as well as short-term topical
missions.
2.
The authorities have restructured the CSO, but many key donors involved in preparing
the statistical master plan (SMP) have expressed concern over the independence of the CSO,
which now reports to the Ministry of National Economy, and the integrity of the statistical
system. Progress on the implementation of the SMP has been delayed, as the authorities have
been slow in undertaking the required institutional changes and strengthening the management
structure of the CSO.
3.
The authorities have been participating in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) since June 2006.
Real Sector
4.
The national accounts compilation process is hampered by the general lack of source
data. The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) provided funding for two major surveys that could
supply critical source data for the national accounts; however, the survey fieldwork has been
delayed. The AsDB has suspended funding of TA projects in Afghanistan and the future of
these surveys is uncertain.
5.
The CSO now compiles a nationwide CPI covering Kabul and the five major cities.
Nonetheless, the inexperience of price collectors has posed some early challenges to the
compilation process. There is also the need to update the expenditure weights as the current CPI
basket was derived from a 1987 household income and expenditure survey. In 2003, the CSO
conducted a limited exercise to update the weights based on household expenditure in Kabul;
however, a comprehensive exercise to obtain representative weights is required, and is
predicated on the completion of an integrated living standard survey.
6.
Customs coverage of overland foreign trade—which is most of foreign trade—is limited
at best. The CSO currently records trade at only seven of the 14 customs posts. Monthly trade
data are updated manually, thereby causing delays in dissemination. Accordingly, there is an
urgent need for improved computer hardware.

10
Government Finance Statistics
7.
An STA expert has been assisting the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in compiling
government finance statistics, achieving considerable progress. The tables reported for
publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook 2006 incorporate for the first time
data on extra-budgetary agencies, donor expenditure made on behalf of the government, and
the operations of municipalities. Nevertheless a number of weaknesses remain, including a
very limited technical capacity of the MOF’s staff, inadequate classification systems in use
by municipalities, deficiencies in the functional classification of government expenditure,
and a lack of consistency and comprehensiveness in the data compiled.
Money and Banking Statistics
8.
The banking sector has developed steadily over the last several years. In addition to
three state-owned banks in the process of restructuring, twelve commercial banks are now in
operation. While there was some improvement in the scope and quality of data reporting by
the central bank, there are still weaknesses in many areas. Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) has
installed a new accounting software, which allows DAB to produce its balance sheet at least
on a monthly basis. The very limited accounting capacity of DAB, especially outside Kabul
has hindered efforts to produce a complete and reliable balance sheet. Regarding the
commercial banks, DAB has developed new reporting formats to provide data for bank
supervision and monetary statistics compilation, and the banks are now reporting data to
DAB regularly according to these formats. STA has assisted DAB (four expert visits took
place between March 2006 and November 2007) in bringing the data reporting of DAB and
the commercial banks in compliance with the methodology in the IMF’s Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual.
9.
The authorities have expressed interest in reintroducing a country page for Afghanistan
in International Financial Statistics (IFS). A STA expert has assisted DAB in drafting a
country note and initiating data reporting for publication in IFS. Provided that DAB is able to
compile and report data (Standardized Report Forms 1SR, 2SR, and 5SR) to STA on a regular
monthly basis, an IFS page for Afghanistan could be introduced in early 2008.
Balance of Payments
10.
Like the national accounts, compilation of balance of payments statistics suffers from
a paucity of source data. There are no estimates of unrecorded border trade, which constitutes
a significant proportion of foreign trade. No reliable source data exist to estimate services,
income, transfers, and foreign direct investment. A balance of payments statistics mission
(May 19–25, 2007) found that source data are extremely weak and that survey initiatives have
not materialized in any significant data output due to poor responses, sampling problems, and a
lack of human, financial, and technological resources. The mission found that limited progress
had been made on the work program initiated in August 2006. Outstanding issues include:

11
•

Adopt legal measures that give DAB the authority to collect data from other sectors,
other than banks, and ensure the confidentiality of reported data.

•

Estimate exports and imports based on CSO data with adjustment for illegal trade
and duty free imports. The CSO should start including duty free imports according to
international classifications.

•

Adjust freight and insurance at 12 and 3 percent, respectively, of c.i.f. imports from
overseas to calculate imports f.o.b.

•

Introduce questionnaire to hotels and guesthouses to collect data on expenses of
nonresidents to estimate travel receipts.

•

Conduct sample surveys of residents returning from travel abroad and use immigration
data to estimate travel expenses.

•

Introduce a questionnaire for collecting data from foreign embassies and other foreign
organizations to estimate government receipts and compensation of employees.

•

Improve the questionnaire on foreign direct investment (FDI) to collect relevant data
from major FDI enterprises.

•

Introduce reporting forms for foreign exchange transactions between residents and
nonresidents to commercial banks, following discussions with the Banking Supervision
Department of the DAB.

•

Introduce a questionnaire for money changers and money transfer service providers.

•

Enhance the collection of quarterly data from the Ministry of Economy on NGOs’
receipts of donations and grants.

•

Compile preliminary balance of payments statistics on the basis of various estimation
procedures discussed with and documented by the Balance of Payments Section.

A follow-up STA mission in October/November 2007 noted some improvements in the area
of source data and in the cooperation between agencies. The mission’s main recommendations
were to: (1) review the reporting forms in the area of services as provided by the mission and
implement these as needed; (2) compile the financial account related transactions for the
commercial banks based on the forms as agreed with the Banking Supervision Department;
(3) compile DAB related transactions using the reporting form provided by the mission;
(4) continue compiling international reserves data consistent with the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) as compiled during the mission and provide these to the
IMF for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS); and (5) agree with Afghan
Investment Support Agency to conduct an FDI survey. An action plan was agreed upon with
the authorities, with targeted dates for implementation. Furthermore, DAB will report on a
monthly basis to STA the progress regarding processing and compiling balance of payments
statistics. The mission will continue to provide remote TA. Future TA missions will depend on
DAB completing specified benchmarks three months after the end of the mission.

12

External Debt
Many records were destroyed during the war and the authorities are slowly rebuilding their
database. Nevertheless, significant progress in terms of reconciliation has been made in the
context of the July 2006 Paris Club rescheduling. Progress is also being made in reconciling
debts to non-Paris Club creditors.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Islamic Republic of Afghanistan
February 13, 2008
1.
This statement summarizes information that became available since the issuance
of the staff report on January 29, 2008. Staff visited Kabul during January 26–February 5,
2008 to assess Afghanistan’s performance with respect to the indicative quantitative
targets under the PRGF-supported program through December 2007, and to reach
understandings on corrective measures to address a revenue shortfall. The new
information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The three prior actions for the completion of the third review under the PRGF
arrangement have been implemented. President Karzai issued a decree approving the
appointment of KPMG as Da Afghanistan Bank’s (DAB) external auditor until 2010/11,
and a special audit confirmed DAB’s foreign exchange reserves, as reported to the Fund
at the September 2007 test date. The authorities have also made the legislative changes
necessary to eliminate the discriminatory application of the 1 percent tariff rate on
imports of raw materials.
3.
Performance under the program during the third quarter of 2007/08 shows some
slippages (see Table). Specifically, the indicative floor on fiscal revenue and the ceiling
on currency in circulation (CiC) were each missed by approximately Af 1 billion
(0.2 percent of GDP). Prudent execution of the core operating budget permitted
observance of the indicative targets on the operating budget deficit and net central bank
financing of the government, but the revenue shortfall underscores the need to implement
promptly measures to bolster revenue collection, as agreed with staff during the
November 2007 mission.
4.
Higher prices of imported fuel and foodstuffs led to a significant increase in
consumer prices, with 12-month (end-of-period) inflation reaching 17 percent in
December 2007. Following increased reliance on auctions of foreign exchange and
capital notes (CNs) to absorb excess liquidity, the Afghani has appreciated by 1 percent
against the U.S. dollar since end-December 2007.
5.
In early February 2008, the authorities implemented the measures covered by
the structural benchmarks for end-November 2007 that had been delayed, including the
issuance of regulations on credit-granting standards and the credit-monitoring process,
and on setting limits on sectoral loan concentration. DAB also proceeded expeditiously
with the issuance of two circulars informing banks of changes to the minimum capital
requirement and repealing the requirement to invest 80 percent of bank deposits
domestically.
6.
Regarding the draft 2008/09 operating budget, expenditure exceeds the level
agreed with Fund staff in November 2007 by Af 2 billion (0.4 percent of GDP), on
account of the contingency for accelerating recruitment by the Afghan National Army.
The authorities also reallocated the cash fuel allowance of Af 1.5 billion for the Ministry

2
of Interior to other expenditure items following commitments of offsetting in-kind
donations. In addition, there has been a reallocation of expenditure from operation and
maintenance to salaries. The operating budget envelope will be reevaluated at the time
of the fourth review.
7.
DAB recognizes the need to improve liquidity management to ensure that the
March 2008 ceiling on CiC is observed. To that end, DAB is engaging the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) in efforts to improve the projection of the government’s cash-flow needs.
As noted above, consistent with program understandings, DAB has already increased the
issuance of CNs. It is also preparing the legal framework for the secondary market in
these instruments, with Fund technical assistance.
8.
The authorities and the World Food Program (WFP) have launched a joint appeal
to distribute wheat to areas affected by shortages. Additional efforts to mitigate the effect
of rising prices may, however, be necessary. Staff stressed the advantages of targeted
cash transfers to vulnerable households.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 20, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
Islamic Republic of Afghanistan
On February 13, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.1
Background
Since its approval by the Executive Board in June 2006 the three-year Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement (amounting to SDR 81 million) has helped maintain
macroeconomic stability and has contributed to the implementation of the government’s reform
agenda. The arrangement supports the authorities’ economic program through March 2009 and
Afghanistan’s participation in the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
The authorities have made good progress in the key policy areas covered by program
conditionality. They have strengthened the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework, enhanced
revenue efforts through tax reforms and capacity building, and improved implementation of
the development budget. They also continue to strengthen the monetary policy framework
and banking supervision. With regard to the broader reform agenda, however, performance
has been mixed. There have been pressures for protectionist measures, while laws critical for
private sector development have not yet been approved and the privatization of state-owned
enterprises has proceeded at a slow pace. Moreover, the volatile security situation and the

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
increasing importance of the drug economy are weakening attempts at broadening economic
development.
While the PRGF-supported program remains on track, it has been strengthened to address the
risks emerging from: (i) government involvement in the domestic petroleum market; (ii) potential
fiscal drains stemming mainly from the government’s relations with public enterprises; and
(iii) a weak supervisory and regulatory framework for the banking system.
Real GDP growth (excluding the drug economy) dropped to 6.1 percent in fiscal year 2006/07
owing to drought, but is expected to exceed 13 percent in 2007/08, reflecting a post-drought
rebound in agricultural output and strong growth in other sectors, particularly construction.
Inflation averaged 5.1 percent in 2006/07 but returned to double-digit levels in 2007/08 owing to
sharp increases in the prices of imported fuel and foodstuffs. The Afghani has remained broadly
stable against the U.S. dollar.
Revenue efforts have played a central role in improving the underlying fiscal position. Domestic
revenues have increased markedly from an extremely low base of 4.7 percent of GDP in the
fiscal year 2003/04, and are projected at 8.2 percent in 2007/08. This increase, combined with a
prudent expenditure policy under the core budget (covering operating and development
expenditures of the central government) have led to a gradual reduction in the core operating
budget deficit (excluding grants) since 2004/05. The bulk of public expenditures, however,
continue to be undertaken in the context of the external budget, which is executed and fully
financed by donors.
Monetary policy has remained broadly consistent with the program and continues to be guided
by indicative targets for currency in circulation, within the context of a managed float exchange
system. With ample foreign exchange at its disposal, the Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) relies
primarily on foreign exchange auctions for managing liquidity. Limited use has been made of
DAB’s capital notes, which were introduced in mid-2004/05, as a liquidity absorption instrument.
Foreign currencies and Afghanis continue to be used interchangeably in domestic transactions.
The external position remains dependant on large aid inflows. Official transfers were estimated
at 66 percent of GDP in 2006/07, reflecting mainly higher security spending by donors.
Afghanistan’s debt sustainability has improved significantly as a result of debt relief from its
bilateral creditors and interim debt relief under the HIPC Initiative. International reserves have
increased steadily.
Banking sector activities have grown considerably over the last few years, mainly due to the
expansion of private banking. This rapid growth has prompted DAB to strengthen its bank
supervision capabilities. The bulk of activities of the banking sector are in foreign currencies.
The preparation of the Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) has reached an
advanced stage. The authorities intend to submit the full ANDS document to the Boards of the
IMF and the World Bank by March 2008.

3
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for Afghanistan’s continued satisfactory
performance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)-supported program,
despite a difficult security environment. They emphasized that, to improve Afghanistan’s
sustainable growth and poverty alleviation prospects, the authorities need to accelerate
structural reforms to enhance governance, overcome infrastructure bottlenecks, and promote
private sector activities while reducing the government’s involvement in the economy.
Directors noted the revenue shortfall that emerged in the third quarter of the current fiscal year,
and stressed the need for revenue enhancing measures to move Afghanistan toward fiscal
sustainability. They encouraged the authorities to muster political support to implement
measures aimed at bolstering revenue collection, in particular by expanding the revenue base
of medium and large tax payers.
Directors welcomed the progress made in strengthening expenditure control, and considered
that continued efforts were needed to meet the government’s medium-term objective of
covering operating expenses from domestic revenue. Directors underscored the need to
prioritize the use of scarce resources in line with Afghanistan’s development objectives. They
also highlighted the importance of clarifying the government’s relations with state-owned
enterprises with a view to stemming potential fiscal drains.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy by
broadening the central bank’s policy instruments, especially in light of the recent rebound in
inflation. In that context, they supported the increased reliance on capital notes and the
development of a secondary market for these instruments. They recommended managing the
volume of capital notes prudently in order to prevent unnecessary fluctuations in liquidity.
Directors commended the Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) for the successful outcome of the special
audit on the availability of foreign reserves. Looking forward, they encouraged the authorities to
improve the DAB’s accounting system.
Directors welcomed the measures recently taken by DAB to strengthen bank supervision and
the regulatory framework for banks, as well as DAB’s decision to proceed expeditiously on
implementing changes to the minimum capital requirement and investment regulations for
banks.
Directors noted that the current exchange rate regime had served Afghanistan well, and that the
exchange rate level appeared to be broadly in line with fundamentals. They stressed the need
to maintain a transparent and liberal trade regime to improve external competitiveness. In this
regard, they welcomed the elimination of the discretionary preferential import tariff for selected
businesses.
Directors welcomed the progress made toward completing Afghanistan’s National Development
Strategy. They noted that, to achieve maximum effectiveness of public investment, the

4
authorities needed to align their sectoral strategies with the government’s growth objectives,
while taking proper account of the absorptive capacity of the economy. They also stressed the
importance of securing debt relief agreements on comparable Paris Club-terms with all
remaining creditors.
Directors noted the authorities’ intention to link explicitly the disbursement of subsidies to the
state-owned electricity company to progress in its restructuring. They indicated that addressing
the shortage and high cost of electricity in Afghanistan will have a major positive impact on the
business environment and the well-being of the population.
Directors stressed the need for improvements in Afghanistan’s statistical database, in particular
in the areas of the national accounts and the balance of payments. They encouraged the
authorities to strengthen the Central Statistics Office in order to improve coordination among
data providers.

IMF Executive Board Completes Third Review Under PRGF Arrangement with
The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and Approves US$17.9 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the third
review of The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's performance under the economic program
supported by the three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement.
The completion of the review allows for an immediate disbursement of SDR 11.3 million
(about US$17.9 million), which would bring total disbursements under the arrangement to
SDR 47.1 million (about US$74.5 million).
In completing the review, the Board also granted a waiver of non-observance of a structural
performance criterion on submitting to parliament the core budget’s audited financial
statement for 2006/07. The audited financial statement was submitted with a minor delay
and no corrective action is required.
The PRGF arrangement for the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was approved in June 2006
for a total of SDR 81.0 million (about US$128 million) (see Press Release No. 06/144).
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in a Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs
are consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social
policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5
percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5½-year grace period on principal payments.
Following the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, said:
“Despite a difficult security environment, Afghanistan continues to have a satisfactory
performance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility-supported program.
Nevertheless, structural reforms need to be accelerated to support high growth and reduce
poverty.

2

“Real GDP growth is estimated to have moderated to 6 percent in 2006/07, but is projected to
increase sharply in 2007/08, owing primarily to a rebound in agriculture. Year-on-year
inflation was 17 percent in December 2007 on account of higher prices of imported fuel and
foodstuffs. The revenue performance during the first half of 2007/08 was satisfactory, but
revenue collection in the third quarter fell somewhat short of the indicative target for
December 2007. However, prudent execution of the core operating budget permitted meeting
the December 2007 indicative target on the operating budget deficit. The Afghani has
appreciated by 1 percent against the U.S. dollar since end-December 2007, on account of
increased sales of foreign exchange by Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB).
“Looking forward, the continued success of the program hinges on mustering political
support for the revenue enhancing measures that are necessary to move Afghanistan toward
fiscal sustainability. There is also a need to allocate adequate resources for infrastructure
maintenance, and to clarify the government’s relations with state-owned enterprises with a
view to stem potential fiscal drains.
“As regards monetary policy, increased reliance on capital notes should enhance
effectiveness. Managing the volume of capital notes prudently would be important in order to
prevent unnecessary fluctuations in liquidity. It is also important to follow-up on Fund staff’s
recommendations to improve the accounting system of DAB. With regard to the banking
sector, measures taken recently by DAB to strengthen bank supervision and the regulatory
framework should help stem risks in this sector.
“The managed float regime in place has served Afghanistan well and the level of the
exchange rate appears appropriate. In the future, improving competitiveness will require
acceleration of structural reforms and further efforts at promoting a transparent and liberal
trade regime. The authorities should also avoid further ad hoc changes to the tariff schedule.
The authorities have made satisfactory progress toward completing their PRSP—the
Afghanistan National Development Strategy. In the period ahead, they should align sector
strategies with the growth objectives, while taking into account the economy’s absorptive
capacity.
“The intention to link explicitly the disbursement of subsidies to the state-owned electricity
company to progress in its restructuring should provide momentum for much-needed reforms
in this area. Redressing the shortage and high cost of electricity in Afghanistan would have a
major, positive impact on the business environment and the well-being of the population.
The authorities have launched a joint appeal with the World Food Program to distribute
wheat to areas affected by shortages. Cash-transfers should be targeted to vulnerable
households—sourced from the existing budget envelope—to mitigate the effect on the poor
of rising wheat prices,” Mr. Portugal said.

Statement by Mr. Mohammed Daïri, Alternate Director for Islamic Republic of Afghanistan
February 13, 2008
The authorities are grateful to the staff of the IMF and World Bank for their support of the
ongoing comprehensive restructuring and stabilization efforts in Afghanistan. They wish, in
particular, to thank Mr. Elhage and his team for the very useful dialogue and the excellent set
of papers. The decision to go forward with debt relief under the HIPC-Initiative reflects the
international community’s strengthened commitment to supporting Afghanistan and has also
boosted domestic support for meeting the challenges that lie ahead. My authorities are fully
committed to achieving the MDGs and laying the foundations of sustainable high growth,
and express their deep appreciation to the international community for its generous financial
and technical support.
Despite the exceptionally difficult circumstances, the authorities have made significant
progress under the economic program supported by the PRGF arrangement. Economic
performance has been strong despite the heightened security concerns. Average real GDP
growth has been around 15 percent per year in the last five years, with various sectors
exhibiting good performance, notwithstanding the adverse effects of the 2006/07 drought on
agricultural production. Inflation has been moderate, with the recent increase in 2007/08
largely attributable to the sharp increases in imported fuel and foodstuff. While growth in
opium production continues to have a deleterious impact by constraining the expansion of the
licit economy and access to formal tax bases, the impact on competitiveness of traditional
exports may have been contained, as suggested by the performance of traditional exports.
With sustained donor support, the official reserve position has strengthened to a level
equivalent to more than 9 months of imports. The fiscal position has improved with strong
revenue efforts and prudent expenditure policy, contributing to a reduction in the core
operating budget deficit (excluding grants) since 2004/05. The budgetary process and
revenue efforts have been strengthened significantly through increasingly incorporating a
medium-term outlook to budget preparation, administrative capacity building, and tax
reforms. All quantitative performance criteria for the Third Review have been met, prior
actions have been carried out, and structural conditionality has been by and large fulfilled.
The small deviations from the indicative floor for revenue and the ceiling for currency in
circulation for the third quarter were due in part to exogenous or temporary factors, and
remedial measures are being implemented as indicated in the staff’s supplement.
The monetary policy framework has been strengthened and the market-determined exchange
rate is in line with fundamentals. As noted in the Special Issues paper, some deficiencies in
the main instrument of market intervention (open-market operations) have been addressed
through improvement in the auction procedures. The volume of capital notes and their
maturity structure has been increased, including the introduction of 182-day notes in 2007.
The authorities recognize the need to deepen further the market for capital notes by
increasing systematically the volume of primary auctions and further developing the
secondary market for these instruments. Coordination between the Central Bank and the

2
Ministry of Finance is also in need of improvement to allow for more informed and accurate
liquidity forecasts.
Notwithstanding the capacity constraints, banking supervision and regulation, including on
AML/CFT, is improving at an impressive rate, which is important given the size of the
informal markets. Significant progress has been made in putting the supervisory mechanisms
in place, including compliance with many Basel Core Principles. As noted in the Special
Issues paper, the welcome rapid expansion in the private banking sector has resulted in some
supervisory and regulatory challenges, including ensuring capital adequacy and sound risk
management practices in some cases. In order to address these challenges, the authorities
have stopped licensing new branches for those banks with an unfavorable (CAMEL) rating
and have restricted credit growth by such banks to 5 percent per quarter. Efforts are being
made to improve risk-based supervision and banking supervision enforcement. The
authorities have already strengthened the legal framework by issuing regulations on credit
standards and credit monitoring process, as well as by setting limits on loan concentration.
Progress has been made in the restructuring of the two state-owned banks (Bank Pashtany
and Bank Millie), and the authorities have prohibited lending by those banks to state-owned
enterprises that do not have audited balance sheets and Cabinet-approved restructuring plans.
As reiterated in their LOI and MEFP, the authorities are committed to important reforms in
many areas, including increasing transparency and reducing government involvement in the
petroleum sector. Implementation of some of the more complex and multifaceted structural
reforms has run into delays due to the need to engender the necessary political consensus and
ensure adequate coordination with the Afghan National Development Strategy (ANDS),
which is under preparation. The authorities have implemented, although with some delay, the
measures covered by the structural benchmarks for end-November 2007 and, as indicated in
the staff’s statement, are diligently working to implement the remaining reforms. In
particular, they have made the legislative changes to eliminate the discretionary application
of the 1 percent import tariff rate on raw materials and other intermediate inputs, and are
working to complete the preparation of the comprehensive restructuring and privatization of
government enterprises that are not covered by the SOE law. In this latter regard, they are
actively examining options on how to deal with the national airline Ariana in a way that
would safeguard public finances as well as state-owned banks against drains or contingent
liabilities that could result from Ariana’s dire financial condition. The authorities aim at
obtaining Cabinet approval of this package by end-March 2008, as indicated in the MEFP.
With continued donor support and debt relief and, in the absence of further deterioration in
the security situation, the medium-term prospects appear favorable. The authorities are fully
aware that the ultimate success of the ongoing program and the restructuring and poverty
reduction efforts depend on their continued commitment to timely implementation of their
reforms. As detailed in the MEFP and delineated in the structural benchmarks under the
Fourth and subsequent PRGF reviews, the authorities remain committed to continued fiscal
discipline toward supporting the ANDS priorities and gradually reducing reliance on donor
support. Toward these ends, the reform effort will focus on better defining the role of
government in the economy, fighting corruption, improving the legal infrastructure to foster
private sector development, strengthening administrative capacity, and liberalizing trade. The

3
authorities recognize that there will be considerable challenges in meeting upcoming revenue
targets, and are committed to taking extra steps to continue to improve revenue collection.
As the PRSP emphasizes, development of human capital remains a challenge, even though
the return of many skilled expatriates has already boosted entrepreneurship. While the
authorities are firmly determined to deliver on their commitments to achieve their objectives,
further technical assistance by the IMF and other donors will continue to be critically
important in the period ahead, in particular in view of the limited administrative capacity and
security challenges. The authorities are striving to meet the completion point triggers for the
HIPC-Initiative, which, along with MDRI and continued donor support, is critical to reducing
the debt burden to sustainable levels. In this regard, as underlined in the PRSP, the ANDS
document preparation is at an advanced stage, targeted for submission to the Board of the
IMF and the World Bank by end-March 2008.
Against this background, the authorities believe that there is considerable reform momentum
and that the program is on track. They thank the Executive Board, management, and staff for
their invaluable support and look forward to the completion of the Third Review under the
PRGF-supported program.
