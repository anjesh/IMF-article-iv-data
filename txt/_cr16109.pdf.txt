IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Zimbabwe
and Third Review Under the Staff Monitored Program
On May 2, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Zimbabwe.
Zimbabwe’s economic difficulties have deepened. Drought, erratic rains, and increasing
temperatures, have reduced agricultural output and disrupted hydropower production and water
supplies. Economic activity is severely constrained by tight liquidity conditions resulting from
limited external inflows and lower commodity prices. Inflation remains in negative territory,
because of the appreciating U.S. dollar—the country’s main currency—and lower commodity
prices. Zimbabwe remains in debt distress and the level of international reserves is low. Despite
the adverse environment, the authorities have reduced the fiscal deficit in both 2014 and 2015.
They have started to rationalize public expenditures by implementing recommendations from the
2015 civil service audit. They are also amending the Public Financial Management and
Procurement Acts. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has taken measures to restore confidence in
the financial sector. All banks in operations now have capital buffers above the minimum
requirements.
Unless the country takes bold reforms, the economic difficulties will continue in medium-term.
Given the outlook for the global economy, growth is projected to remain below levels needed to
ensure sustainable development and poverty reduction. The current account deficit is expected to
narrow, but remain high over the medium term, financed mainly by loans to the private sector.
The authorities have met their commitments under the Staff Monitored Program (SMP) that
ended at end-December 2015, despite economic and financial difficulties. The program focused
on implementing a limited number of key reforms to show that the country has the capacity to

implement the kind of reforms that would be required for a Fund-supported program. The SMP
has been a useful anchor in a difficult macroeconomic and political environment.2
The authorities are pursuing a gradual, step-by-step approach to reengaging with the
international community. Clearing arrears to the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) is seen
as a first step in this process. The authorities presented a strategy to clear their external arrears to
the IFIs and reforms plans going forward to creditors and development partners in October 2015.
The strategy and reform plans received broad support and, once implemented, should provide
positive signals to investors and creditors, and help unlock external flows to finance the
authorities’ development plans and private sector-led growth.
Going forward, the authorities intend to: (a) reduce the size of the wage bill to re-orient spending
towards priority capital and social outlays; (b) improve debt management, develop a
comprehensive public financial management strategy, and strengthen VAT policy and key
processes in revenue administration; and (c) improve the business environment, including by a
transparent and consistent application of their indigenization policy and a new comprehensive
land reform program. The latter would include a framework for land compensation.
Risks to the already difficult outlook stem mainly from prolonged adverse weather conditions,
and weak commodity prices and policy implementation in a difficult political environment.
Timely implementation of measures to curb the wage bill and continued progress in State-Owned
Enterprise (SOE) reforms would be needed to lower employments costs.

Executive Board Assessment3
Directors commended the Zimbabwean authorities for the successful implementation of the
economic policies under the staff-monitored program despite difficult domestic and external
circumstances. Directors noted that adverse weather conditions and lower commodity prices
have taken a heavy toll on economic activity and social well-being. They underscored the
importance of maintaining fiscal prudence and pressing ahead with ambitious structural reforms
to address impediments to investment, foster private sector-led growth, and reduce poverty,
making the best use of the Fund’s targeted technical assistance. Further progress on these fronts,
as well as on clearance of external arrears, will pave the way for full re-engagement with the

international community, allowing Zimbabwe to regain access to external financing, particularly
from the Fund, in support of its development agenda.
Directors agreed that a step-up to a comprehensive and deep economic policy adjustment agenda
will be critical to address Zimbabwe’s daunting economic challenges. In this context, they
concurred that achieving a sustainable fiscal position requires a significant reduction in the wage
bill, while rebalancing the budget toward much-needed infrastructure investment and social
outlays to stimulate growth. Noting the relatively high tax-to-GDP ratio, Directors considered it
appropriate to focus efforts on base-broadening, increasing non-tax revenue from mineral
resources, improving the efficiency of VAT collections, and enhancing tax administration.
Further steps are needed to accelerate the reform of state-owned enterprises, strengthen public
financial management, and enhance transparency in the mining sector.
Directors welcomed progress in enhancing the resilience of the financial system and reducing
nonperforming loans. They encouraged the authorities to continue to strengthen bank supervision
and risk management, facilitate financial deepening, and promote financial inclusion.
Directors stressed the importance of stepping up structural reforms to raise potential growth and
living standards, and to secure support from Zimbabwe’s development partners. They
highlighted the need to implement the indigenization policy in a business-friendly and
transparent manner, and to resolve outstanding land issues swiftly. Other priorities include
improving the investment climate, tackling corruption, and promoting economic diversification.
Directors acknowledged the difficult and unique debt situation of Zimbabwe. Noting that
Zimbabwe continues to be in debt distress, they called on the authorities to pursue a strong debt
management strategy, including by limiting non-concessional borrowing to critical
growth-enhancing and poverty-reducing projects that would ultimately improve the country’s
repayment capacity.
Directors welcomed the comprehensive strategy for normalization of relations with international
financial institutions (IFIs). In this context, they urged the authorities to clear all arrears to the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) and other IFIs. Once arrears to the PRGT are
cleared, Directors looked forward to the next stage whereby remedial measures against
Zimbabwe can be removed, including the reinstatement of Zimbabwe to the list of
PRGT-eligible countries.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND THE THIRD REVIEW OF THE STAFF-MONITORED
PROGRAM
KEY ISSUES
Context. The authorities met all their commitments under the Staff–Monitored Program
(SMP), despite economic and financial difficulties. Inadequate external inflows, lower
commodity prices, the dollar appreciation, and the El-Niño-induced drought hurt
economic activity. The authorities have started to rationalize civil service by exploiting
opportunities for cost savings, amended the Public Financial Management and
Procurement Acts for Parliament and Cabinet approval, respectively, and rid the financial
sector of problem banks and reduced non-performing loans. They garnered broad
support for their reengagement strategy from creditors and development partners, in
particular their plans to clear arrears to the International Financial Institutions.
Outlook and Risks. Growth will stay below levels needed to ensure sustainable
development and poverty reduction unless the authorities take bold policy reforms.
Risks to this difficult outlook stem mainly from adverse weather conditions, weak
commodity prices, fiscal challenges, and weak policy implementation in a challenging
domestic political environment. Conversely, progress in curbing the wage bill, reforming
state owned enterprises, pushing forward market-oriented reforms, and advancing the
arrears clearance strategy could establish a virtuous circle of foreign investments and
financing, normalization of relations with the international community, and sustained
growth.
Key Challenges. Discussions focused on how to reprioritize spending toward capital and
social outlays, move towards fiscal sustainability, and remove structural impediments for
a thriving private sector. Reforms need to progress in parallel with the normalization of
relations with the international community. Difficult reforms would not be sustainable
without fresh financial support.
Key Policies. The authorities intend to: (a) reduce the size of the wage bill to re-orient
spending towards priority capital and social outlays; (b) improve debt management,
develop a comprehensive public financial management strategy, and strengthen
VAT policy and key processes in revenue administration; (c) improve the business
environment, including by ensuring transparency and consistency of application of their
indigenization policy and implementing a new comprehensive land reform program; and
d) pursue normalization of their relations with the international community.

BACKGROUND
1.
The Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) ended at end-December 2015. The authorities have
met their commitments under the program, despite economic and financial difficulties. The program
focused on implementing a limited number, but key reforms. The SMP has been a useful anchor in a
difficult macroeconomic and political environment. The authorities demonstrated strong
commitment to the program, and made significant progress in advancing their macroeconomic and
structural reforms. Zimbabwe’s performance under the SMP has laid the basis for the country to
undertake more ambitious reforms, and it set the stage for advancing the reengagement process
and to justify an eventual request for a Fund-financial arrangement. The authorities have garnered
broad support for their reengagement strategy from creditors and development partners, in
particular their strategy to clear arrears to the international financial institutions (IFIs).1
2.
The authorities have indicated their interest in seeking financial support from the IFIs
in the context of their ambitious medium-term transformation agenda. Restoring fiscal and
external sustainability, bolstering financial stability, and addressing the debt overhang remain critical
for achieving the country’s development objectives. Going forward, bold, comprehensive
medium-term reforms and policies are needed to tackle the structural impediments and accelerate
growth, transform the economy, and reduce poverty. The authorities have started to develop a
medium-term economic transformation program, in line with their broader reform agenda
presented at the Lima meetings on arrears clearance in October 2015. The financing needs to
support the reforms are substantial and the authorities recognize that normalizing relationship with
the international community is paramount to unlock Zimbabwe’s access to much-needed financing.
Based on their step-by-step, pragmatic approach, the authorities see clearing the arrears to the IFIs
and advancing their reform agenda as precursors for seeking financial support from the IFIs, and
eventually traditional debt treatment under the umbrella of the Paris Club.
3.
Zimbabwe’s political situation appears broadly stable, but with rising rivalries within
the ruling ZANU-PF party. Infighting has intensified, with suspensions and expulsions from the
party and the cabinet along factional lines since December 2014. A new opposition party led by
former vice president Joice Mujuru, with support from some of those expelled from the ZANU-PF
party was launched in early-March 2016. Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for
2018. Despite these developments, there is broad political support for reforms and the
reengagement process, the importance of which the president stressed in outlining a 10-point plan
for economic growth and job creation in August 2015.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
4.
Zimbabwe’s economic difficulties have deepened. GDP growth slowed significantly to
1.1 percent in 2015, mainly because of the impact of adverse weather conditions on agricultural
output, and power generation (Table 1). The mining sector, which has been hit by low commodity
prices, erratic power supply, and policy uncertainties, recovered somewhat because of increased
gold production. Meanwhile, significant investment is needed to transition from extracting alluvial
diamonds to kimberlitic deposits.2 Growth is projected to remain subdued in 2016, despite strong
performance in mining—which is expected to benefit from increases in gold, platinum, and diamond
output—construction, and financial services. Tight liquidity conditions stemming from inadequate
external inflows, and lower commodity prices continued to hurt economic activity. Unemployment is
rising (Annex II), and employment has been shifting to the informal sector. Inflation remained in
negative territory, because of the appreciating U.S. dollar—the country’s currency—and lower
commodity prices, but this price adjustment has had only limited impact on competitiveness.

5.
The current account balance improved in 2015, because of lower prices for oil imports,
subdued economic activity, and fiscal consolidation efforts (Table 2). The current account
deficit will likely worsen in 2016, despite improving terms of trade, because the drought has raised
the need for substantial maize imports. The levels of international reserves remain low, and
Zimbabwe remains in debt distress.
6.
Fiscal performance in 2015 was better than programmed, despite the adverse
macroeconomic environment. Tax revenue benefitted from strong collection efforts on overdue
payments and court decisions at year end in favor of the revenue authority (ZIMRA) that offset the
impact of slower-than-anticipated growth, increased unemployment, reduced profitability, and
lower commodity prices. On the expenditure side, the authorities kept employment costs well below
budgetary projections—for the second year in a row—and saved on capital outlays, while protecting
social spending. As a result, the primary cash deficit was lower than programmed (Table 3).

Alluvial deposits are found on shallow soft ground while kimberlitic diamonds are found deep in the soil. The latter
are more expensive to extract and require specialized machinery to break through hard strata.

7.
Despite spending pressures to mitigate the impact of the drought, the authorities
remain committed to fiscal discipline, and target a primary cash deficit of 0.2 percent of GDP
for 2016. Additional spending to provide maize to the poor and the vulnerable groups of the
population (0.5 percent of GDP) is to be offset by lower allocation for non-priority current outlays.
To generate additional resources, and restore the financial viability of the public service pension
system, the authorities have re-established withholding of social security contributions3—resulting in
an increase in non-tax revenue, and adopted measures to broaden the tax base.4
8.
The authorities have started to implement measures to rationalize public expenditure
and reduce public employment costs. In line with the recently completed civil service audit, they
have started to eliminate duplications and redundancies, rationalize posts, revise leave policy in the
education sector, reduce employment costs to grant-aided institutions, and cuts to government
top-ups to teachers in private schools.5
9.
Deposit growth in the banking sector continued to slow in 2015, constrained by the
weak economy (Table 5). Domestic credit recorded a marked increase in 2015, driven by higher
lending to the central government—the majority being debt issued to recapitalize the Reserve Bank
of Zimbabwe (RBZ) and other public institutions, financing the asset management company
(ZAMCO) and addressing legacy debt obligations. In addition to direct purchases, financial
institutions have increased their holdings of government securities through purchases on the
secondary market, particularly from corporates and individuals who acquired them as part of the
government’s clean-up of legacy debt obligations. Credit to the private sector declined by 2 percent,
reflecting the combined effects of the weak economy, tight liquidity conditions, and banks’ cautious
approach to lending to the private sector. Deposit and credit growth is expected to benefit from the
financial sectors reforms and implementation of the financial inclusion strategy (¶30–31).
10.
The authorities remain committed to the multi-currency regime. While they
acknowledge the costly constraints this regime imposes on macroeconomic policy, they do not see
any feasible alternative in the short-to-medium term. To provide credibility to the multicurrency
system, and promote consumer and business confidence, the RBZ undertook a three-month
demonetization process (June-September 2015), effectively removing the legal status of the
Zimbabwe dollar. The process addressed cash held by the public, and non-loan bank accounts as at
end-2008. Some US$9 million was converted during the period. There was increased demand for the

Following hyperinflation, the authorities had stopped withholding public employees’ social security contributions.
The 2016 budget includes 0.7 percent of GDP in additional revenue as a result of this measure.

These include: reducing: (a) the list of persons and organizations entitled to tax exemptions; (b) the list of
VAT-exempt items; and (c) travelers’ rebate on good imported at customs. To reduce undervaluation and evasion of
revenue at customs, pre-shipment inspections became operational on March 1, 2016.
5

Implementation of some of these measures started in November 2015: e.g., rationalizing posts in several
government units, cutting government support to teachers in private schools, and reviewing vacation leave in the
education sector. In the absence of these measures, the wage bill would be around 1 percentage point of GDP higher
in 2016.

Zimbabwe’s social indicators have improved in recent years, but other major
development challenges remain (Annex II). The authorities, with support from the World Bank
and other development partners, are undertaking a number of initiatives to address these
challenges. Preparation of an interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and a Poverty, Income,

Zimbabwe, like the rest of the region, is grappling with the El Niño-induced
conditions. Drought, erratic rains, and increasing temperatures have reduced agriculture output and
livestock, and disrupted hydropower production and water supplies. Due to the severe drought and
poor harvest, particularly for the staple food maize, an estimated 3 million people (about 30 percent
of rural population) are at risk of food insecurity.7 The authorities are working with development
partners and the private sector to help mitigate the impact, and secure sufficient maize imports
(Box 1).

Since December 2014, the RBZ introduced 1, 5, 25 and 50 cent bond coins, indexed at par to the U.S. dollar and
backed by a US$50 million bond facility. Prior to the introduction, the rand coins were widely used since the
adoption of the multi-currency regime system.

The economic outlook remains challenging, as El Niño-induced drought is already
severely affecting another agricultural harvest season and the energy sector. Given the outlook
for the global economy, projections under the baseline scenario are for growth to average 4 percent
over the medium term (Figure 2), well below the level that would be needed to ensure sustainable
development and reduce poverty.8 Inflation is projected to remain in negative territory in 2016, but
pick up over the medium term. The current account deficit is expected to narrow, but remain high
over the medium term, financed mainly by offshore loans to the private sector. The persistent large
current account deficits, exacerbated by a sharp appreciation of the U.S. dollar, have worsened
Zimbabwe’s external position and competitiveness. Zimbabwe will need to improve its
competitiveness by facilitating further relative wage and price adjustments while creating fiscal
space. In the medium term reforms aimed at removing structural impediments and strengthening
institutions to create a supportive business environment will be needed to restore external stability
and increase resilience to external shocks (Annex III).
14.
Risks to the already difficult outlook stem mainly from continued adverse weather
conditions, fiscal challenges, weak commodity prices, and policy implementation in a difficult
political environment. (Annex I, Risk Assessment Matrix). The projections are subject to
macroeconomic and policy risks. Should external shocks intensify, macroeconomic conditions would
deteriorate further and jeopardize the revenue targets. Timely implementation of the measures to
curb the wage bill and continued progress in State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) reforms and wage
restraint would be needed to lower employments costs. Failure by the authorities to effectively
implement their reform agenda or delays in advancing their arrears clearance strategy could
undermine their efforts to attract much-needed foreign investment to transform the economy, and
to normalize relations with the international community.
15.
The authorities shared the staffs’ views on the medium-term outlook and risk
assessment. They emphasized that the major economic challenges facing Zimbabwe emanate from
exogenous shocks—El Niño-induced drought, low commodity prices, and the appreciating U.S.
dollar—exacerbated by inadequate external flows and tight liquidity, erratic power supply, and the
economic slowdown. In the near-term, they will have to accommodate additional spending to help
mitigate the impact of the devastating drought on the vulnerable population. The staff underscored
the urgent need to move forward with comprehensive reforms to transform the economy.
The authorities concurred with the staff’s macroeconomic outlook and assessment of risks.
They noted, however, that the absence of external financial support magnifies risks and their impact,
and generates resistance to reforms. They believe that a successful re-engagement with the
international financial community would be a necessary condition to reduce the impact of domestic
and exogenous risks.

Box 1. Zimbabwe: The Impact of El Niño on Zimbabwe
Zimbabwe is experiencing its worst drought since 1991–92. El Niño has led to far below-average rainfall across
Southern Africa, and projections are for a continuation of below-average rainfall, and above-average temperatures. The
situation in Zimbabwe is exacerbated as the country already experienced a poor 2014/15 agricultural season with dry
spells in most regions.
The agricultural and electricity sectors have been hit hard, with broader spillovers on the economy. The 2015/16
season is expected to see agricultural output shrink by 9.9 percent, following an already poor 2014/15 season. The
contribution to growth is projected to decline to -1.3 percent in 2016, relative to -0.7 percent in 2015. The Kariba dam,
which provides about 60 percent of peak electricity demand, is operating at around 50 percent of its capacity and risks a
complete shutdown, if water levels decrease further. Faced with declining agricultural output and inadequate maize
reserves, Zimbabwe will have to import an estimated 1.4 million tons of grain until the 2016/17 harvest season.
The humanitarian cost of the drought is rising, with an estimated 3 million people facing food insecurity. Rain
dependent farmers have been hit hardest. Cattle and other livestock have been decimated, in a context of declining
prices (as farmers are destocking). The Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee (ZIMVAC) Rapid Assessment
Report of February 2016 estimates food insecurity to double relative to 2014/15, with 30 percent of the rural population
now at risk. The household food security status is threatened further by other shocks to households’ disposable
incomes, including diminished opportunities for casual labour, particularly in agriculture, declining remittances due to
depreciation of regional currencies, and reduced formal employment. Weaknesses in procurement and distribution
chains increase the risk of large food price increases—which have not yet materialized—which would disproportionately
affect the poor and contribute to increased vulnerability.
The authorities have declared a state of national disaster, with estimated total needs assessed at US$1.5 billion.
This would cover: (a) grain importation of 1.4 million metric

an additional 0.5 percent of GDP has been budgeted for this.
Enhancing resilience will require reversing the reduced preparedness and response capacity. The ability of the
irrigation system to mitigate the impact of droughts has been eroded over time due to underinvestment and limited
maintenance. Additionally, financing constraints exacerbated by a lack of collateral continue to hinder agriculture
financing. With an increase in rural–urban migration, increasing unemployment and evidence of increasing urban
poverty, there is need for policy interventions in urban areas. These could be improved access to affordable cereals and
feeding programmes. Concerns have also been raised over the efficiency in procurement and distribution of food.
Opening borders for food imports, ensuring that all critical facets of food, water and drugs, are adequately covered to
prevent further deterioration of livestock condition and deaths would curb food insecurity.
Going forward, diversification of the economy, while making the agricultural sector more resilient, remains key
to reduce the country’s vulnerabilities. The agricultural sector has become increasingly vulnerable to water
shortages—and this is likely to persist without investment in irrigation and investments that increase agricultural
productivity, including by focusing on crops more resilient to water shortages. Additionally, diversifying the economy
towards manufacturing not related to agriculture and services will aid to improve resilience to droughts. This requires
continued emphasis on tackling some of the factors hindering the emergence of businesses that could drive noncommodity exports.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
16.
All of the quantitative targets for end-December 2015 were met (Table 8). The floor on
the primary cash balance and the net international reserves target were met with comfortable
margins. The floor on protected social spending, the target for Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust
(PRGT) payments, and the ceiling on nonconcessional debt were also met.
17.
The remaining three structural benchmarks for the third review were also met
(Table 9).9 The cabinet approved: (a) the amendments to the Public Financial Management (PFM)
Act and the PFM Bill was submitted to the parliament in November; and (b) the amendments to the
Procurement Act to tighten the public procurement framework and improve efficiency and
transparency. In early-January 2016, the authorities published the new framework, procedures and
guidelines for implementing the indigenization policy on the Zimbabwe Investment Authority (ZIA)
website. While this helped by continuing the dialogue on the policy, more needs to be done to tie
up loose ends and implement the policy in a transparent and non-discretionary manner (Annex IV).
18.
In addition, meaningful progress has been made in implementing the broader
structural reform agenda. However, the authorities need to follow through with further
implementation of key measures, particularly the new indigenization framework, reducing the wage
bill, and reducing the cost of doing business.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Zimbabwe’s deteriorating economic conditions reinforce the urgency to move forward and implement
comprehensive ambitious reforms to transform the economy, and to advance the reengagement
process. Key priorities jointly identified by the authorities and staff include: (a) fiscal discipline and
rebalancing expenditure away from employment costs toward development and social spending to
restore fiscal sustainability, supported by strengthened public financial management (PFM) and
revenue administration, and acceleration of SOE reforms; (b) further enhancing financial stability and
depth to ensure the financial sector plays its role in savings mobilization and investment and
contribute to economic development; (c) tackling the external arrears and advancing the
reengagement process to allow the country to eventually access external financing; and (d) addressing
structural weaknesses to boost Zimbabwe’s growth potential.
The policy discussions underscored a broad convergence of views between the staff and the authorities
on policies and reform priorities. The attached Letter of Intent outlines the authorities’ policy intentions
in the short-to-medium term. It includes their short-term policy commitments and a matrix of reform
priorities that will form the nucleus of their next phase of reforms. The authorities emphasize that,
without external financial support, reform efforts would have limited impact and fizzle in the face of

mounting domestic resistance. The staff stressed the importance of tackling impediments to growth as
soon as possible and redirect the economy toward private sector-led growth, but also agreed that
financial support is needed for reform efforts to succeed.

A. Advancing Fiscal Reforms for Fiscal Sustainability
19.
The staff emphasized that fiscal policy in the medium term should be guided by the
objective to rebalance expenditures from wages to capital and social spending. Zimbabwe’s
public sector wage bill is among the highest in the region (Annex V), and accounts for a
disproportionately large share of the budget. The growth in employment costs reflects large wage
increases and expansion of the civil service.10 Zimbabwe’s tax collection as a share of GDP is high by
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) standard. Thus, efforts should focus on improving the efficiency of tax
administration, rather than increasing tax pressure.11 Non-wage expenditures have suffered from
years of compression and could lead to widening gaps in infrastructure and social development, if
not addressed. Staff’s baseline medium-term projections are predicated on a slight increase of
spending in proportion of GDP, accompanied by a marked redistribution of spending from wages to
capital and high-priority current outlays (Figure 2).
20.
The authorities agreed that reducing the large public sector wage bill should be a key
objective for achieving fiscal and debt sustainability over the medium term. In the adjustment
scenario, the authorities plan to reduce wage costs from around 66 percent of expenditure in 2016
to 50 percent in 2019 (see section E). To achieve these reductions, the authorities aim to maintain
total wage costs unchanged in nominal terms until 2019. In addition, they plan to implement the
payroll audits of all service commissions and review allowances with the goal of identifying
efficiency gains and cost savings.12 The authorities concurred that the fiscal space thus created could
be used to increase development and social spending.
21.
The authorities concurred that increasing transparency and accountability in the
diamond sector, as well as its contribution to fiscal resources, is key. The sector was managed
poorly and the lack of transparency and accountability led to a situation where it did not generate
any dividends for the budget.13 In a bid to address this issue, the government put forward a
proposal for the setting up of the Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company (ZCDC), following the
Botswana model, and consolidated all diamond operations in a new entity. The negotiations

transfers to other levels of government.
11

A tax policy mission is expected in the first half of 2016.

12

In addition to the audit finalized by the Public Service Commission, covering about 50 percent of public
employment, Cabinet has requested the other commissions (Judicial; Uniformed Services; and Health Service Board)
to perform audits and propose recommendations to rationalize employment.
13

The seven companies previously operating in the sector are Marange Resources, Mbada Diamonds, Anjin
Resources, Diamond Mining Company, Gyne Nyame, Kusena, and Jinan.

between the authorities and the diamond firms were, however, not successful. Therefore the
authorities went ahead, not renewing mining licenses, and have since commenced mining
operations. Private companies can participate subject to the indigenization policy. The government
intends to fully account for production, sales, turnover, exports, and profits, thus ensuring
transparency and accountability in the sector and that proceeds from diamond mining are accrued
to the budget.14 To underscore their commitment to transparency, they will regularly publish the
audited accounts of ZCDC.
22.
The authorities are making progress in strengthening PFM, supported by development
partners. Work is underway, with World Bank’s assistance, on a PFM enhancement project to, inter
alia, support: (a) strengthening expenditure controls and internal audit; and (b) pilot rollout of the
IFMIS to the local authorities. To help improve expenditure prioritization, the authorities have rolled
out pilot program-based budgeting (PBB) on a phased-basis in the ministries of Public
Administration, Health, Education, and Social Welfare. PBB is to be rolled out to all ministries over
the next two years. The Public Procurement Bill15 is undergoing extensive consultations with local
authorities and accountability organizations with the objective of fast-tracking its submission to
parliament.
23.
The authorities agree that there is limited scope to raise the tax-to-GDP ratio. However,
they see considerable scope to increase efficiency of tax policy and revenue administration. In tax
policy, they intend to review the design of their tax system, in particular their VAT. Tax
administration efforts will focus on improving the efficiency of crucial operations. ZIMRA’s reform
priorities focus on strengthening risk management, taxpayer filing and compliance, and monitoring
of transit traffic. Staff agreed that these are priority areas to increase efficiencies in administrative
processes and mitigate evasion, and have the potential to generate substantial revenue, at little
additional cost and minimal administrative disruption.
24.
Staff emphasized the importance to accelerate the reform of SOEs to reduce their
budgetary impact, improve service delivery and accountability, and enhance their
contribution to economic growth. Forensic and performance audits are being conducted on most
of the ten largest SOEs targeted for priority action to determine the appropriate restructuring
policies, and employments costs have already been reduced in a number of them. For some of the
10 enterprises targeted for priority action, the authorities plan to seek strategic and technical
partners, pursue joint ventures, or unbundle them. The concluded forensic and performance audits
(Grain Marketing Board and Cold Storage Company), and the four turnaround strategies under
consideration by Cabinet (Industrial Development Corporation, Zimbabwe National Water Authority,

Agriculture and Rural Development Authority, and TelOne) will provide the baseline for appropriate
restructuring policies.16
25.
The authorities reiterated their firm commitment to accelerate SOE reforms.
While acknowledging that progress in SOE reforms has not been as fast as they initially hoped, the
authorities noted that performing due diligence and designing and implementing reform strategies
for each company takes time. They also noted that they succeeded in reducing employment in
several SOEs, including at the Grain Marketing Board, TelOne, and National Railways.
26.
Strengthening debt management capacity is a priority for the authorities. In line with
the Debt Management Act, a unified, up-to-date debt registry will be established in the Debt
Management Unit, which would provide complete data about both foreign and local debts from a
single record.17 Such registry will be integrated with other functions in the ministry—e.g., budget
preparation and execution. The authorities plan to produce debt management strategy that is fully
integrated in the medium term budgeting process. Fund technical assistance is already being
provided to the authorities to operationalize their plans.

B. Enhancing Stability and Deepening the Financial Sector
27.
The RBZ has made significant progress in restoring confidence and strengthening the
financial sector. Banking sector conditions have improved (Figure 1, Table 6): all troubled banks
have been removed from the sector and all operational banks maintain capital buffers above the
minimum requirements—with two banks having exceeded the 2020 requirements.18 Asset quality
has improved as the level of nonperforming loans (NPLs) continued to decline,19 reflecting bank
closures, acquisition of collateralized NPLs by the Zimbabwe Asset Management Company
(ZAMCO), and initiatives by the banks, and banks’ profitability is improving.20 ZAMCO is fully
operational and self-sufficient (Box 2). The Afreximbank-supported $200 million interbank facility
(AFTRADES) is helping to address liquidity challenges (Box 3). The RBZ has been recapitalized and
the cleanup of its balance sheet is well advanced.21
16

Outside the 10 priority SOE, a forensic audit has been completed for ZimPost, and two forensic audits are ongoing
for NetOne and Allied Timbers.
17

The Act provides a comprehensive framework for debt management, comprising the purpose and objectives of
borrowing, the mandate to issue debt and guarantees, and clear requirements for developing a debt management
strategy and transparent reporting.
18

In 2014, the RBZ issued directives for Tier 1 banks (undertaking core banking activities plus additional services) to
have minimum core capital requirements of US$100 million by 2020. The People’s Own Savings Bank does not have a
minimum capital requirement.
19

At end-December 2015, the level of NPLs, excluding the one bank under provisional judicial management, stood at
10 percent.
20

These include loan restructuring, refining of underwriting standards, and establishment of loan recovery units.

21

By end-January 2016, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development had taken over $656 million (4.6 percent
of GDP) of RBZ’s noncore liabilities.

ZIMBABWE

Box 2. ZAMCO: Helping to Address the High Levels of Nonperforming Loans
As part of its multi-pronged approach to tackle the high level of nonperforming loans (NPLs), in
early-2014, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), with Fund assistance, established the Zimbabwe Asset
Management Corporation (Private) Limited (ZAMCO). The high levels of NPLs mainly reflected past
unsound lending practices—including cases of insider and related party loan exposures, weak corporate
governance, poor risk management, asset-liabilities mismatch and an underperforming economy.
The level of NPLs increased steadily, particularly since early-2012, and peaked at 21 percent in September
2014. ZAMCO was tasked with acquiring, restructuring, and disposing of NPLs.
ZAMCO commenced the first phase of NPLs acquisition in October 2014, focusing on the top 100 NPLs,
in terms of absolute size, across the financial sector (out of a total NPL portfolio of $816 million—
21 percent at end-September 2014), and on those NPLs where the underlying companies have prospects
of viability if the loans are restructured. The restructuring involved extending the loan repayment period,
reducing interest rates, capital repayment holiday and in some instances, conversion of the debt into
equity. As at end-December 2015, ZAMCO has purchased eligible mortgaged-backed NPLs amounting to
$360 million, financed by long-term government debt securities. Debt servicing obligations are met
through a stream of income placed in a sinking fund.
ZAMCO is fully functional, guided by an operational framework, (including an asset valuation and
transfer pricing strategy), and a governance structure that is in line with international best practices.
ZAMCO’s operating costs were initially met by the RBZ. However, since October 2015, ZAMCO has been
self-sufficient, generating its own funding through arrangement fees, interest from restructured loans,
and dividends from preference shares. As at end-December 2015, ZAMCO had sufficient resources to
cover its operating expenses for the next two years, at current levels of operation.
The work of ZAMCO has helped to restore financial sector viability by strengthening banks’ balance
sheets and providing them with much-needed liquidity. The level of NPLs, while still high, has been
reduced significantly from the peak of 21 percent in September 2014 to 10 percent (excluding the one
bank under provisional judicial management) at end-December 2015. In addition, the restructuring
efforts have brought relief to a number of corporates who faced very high financing costs.

28.
The regulatory framework is being strengthened. The approved amendments to the
Reserve Bank and Banking Acts are awaiting presidential assent. The amendments seek to align
banking laws with recent developments, including a more comprehensive framework on risk
management and corporate governance, introduce greater transparency in shareholdings and
operations of banking institutions and controlling companies, and provide for the setup of the credit
reference bureau. The new legislation will go a long way to further strengthen the regulatory
framework, and safeguard the sector. Pension and insurance legislation is being amended to
strengthen the industry’s regulatory framework, and bring the legislation in line with international
standards.
29.
However, challenges remain and staff emphasized the need for continued strong,
proactive supervision. Liquidity conditions remain tight against the background of inadequate
capital flows, low commodity prices, the economic slowdown, and negative inflation. Credit risks will
remain high in this challenging economic environment. Moreover, deflation risks can further strain
corporate sector’s capacity to repay. Further reduction in NPLs and increased access to credit remain
important to cement financial stability and reinforce confidence. Early passage of the Banking

14

ZIMBABWE

Amendment Bill, which will effect the amendments to the Reserve Bank and the Banking Acts, would
enhance financial stability.
Box 3. Zimbabwe: The Afreximbank Trade Debt-Backed Security Facility
To help address short-term liquidity challenges, in the context of market segmentation, the
Afreximbank-supported interbank liquidity facility was launched in March 2015. The $200 million facility,
which is underwritten by Afreximbank under the Afreximbank Trade Debt Backed Securities (AFTRADES),
has helped to redistribute funds from some banks with high levels of liquidity (surplus banks) to those
facing liquidity shortages (deficit banks). The interbank facility is managed by the RBZ, acting as agent
for the Afreximbank.
The facility enables deficit banks to access the funds provided by the surplus banks, through the RBZ, at
interest rate of 8 percent, for which they provide acceptable collateral for borrowing, including loans and
advances. Surplus banks earn 5 percent interest rates on their funds which are secured by the AFTRADES.
At end-January 2016, the pool of AFTRADES secured funds was $176 million, reflecting participation of
six surplus banks, and $154 million disbursed to deficit banks.

30.
The levels of financial inclusion in Zimbabwe improved markedly from 60 percent in
2011 to 77 percent in 2014, mainly due to increased mobile banking services (Text figure and
text table 1).22 Among the rural adult population, the level of inclusion rose to 62 percent in 2014,
from 27 percent in 2011. According to the FinScope Survey, some 81 percent of banked adult
Zimbabweans was using financial products and services through both the formal and informal
sectors in 2014. This placed Zimbabwe among the highest levels of financial inclusion in SSA.
Access to finance is mainly through the banking institutions.23 Microfinance institutions (MFIs) play
an important role in channeling credits to the SMEs and low-income rural population.

The RBZ, in collaboration with key stakeholders, has developed a national financial
inclusion strategy.24 The overarching goals for 2020 are to (a) broaden access to financial products
and services (from 69 to 90 percent); and (b) increase the proportion of banked adults (from 30 to
60 percent). Despite the increase in the portion of the population accessing formal financial services,
there are still gaps particularly in the level of access to, usage, and quality of financial products and
services.25 The gaps are more pronounced among the rural population,26 women and youths, smalland medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and the small-scale agricultural sector. The main barriers to
financial inclusion have been high levels of poverty, low disposable income, unavailability of
affordable and appropriate products and services, cost of services, low levels of financial literacy, 27
information asymmetry, and lack of confidence. Banks have developed three-year strategies
anchored on increasing branch network, adopting technology innovations to make greater use of
agent and mobile banking, provision of no-fees/low cost and microfinance products. The RBZ, with
support from the World Bank and key stakeholders, is developing consumer protection standard
and guidelines, and a financial education strategy. In addition, as a complement to the credit
reference system, a collateral registry is being established to enhance the range of acceptable and
qualifying collateral security by enabling SMEs, low income groups to register their moveable assets
to obtain credit. Financial deepening and inclusion is expected to encourage savings mobilization
and stimulate investments, thereby contributing to sustainable economic development and poverty
reduction.

The authorities concurred that supervision should be strengthened and risks carefully
monitored. They are cognizant that the international and domestic economic environments pose

risks for banks. The RBZ has requested technical assistance and training is various aspects of
banking supervision and stress testing. The authorities noted that while increased financial inclusion
create opportunities for broader economic growth, it also poses supervisory and regulatory
challenges which the RBZ is planning to address in its operations and financial regulations. In this
regard, the authorities plan to, inter alia: a) facilitate capacity building programs in financial
institutions; b) develop a comprehensive and harmonized legal and regulatory framework for
financial consumer protection; c) issue guidance to banking institutions and payment system
providers on acceptable conduct and practices; and d) develop legal and regulatory framework for
the savings and credit cooperative societies. In addition, they plan to strengthen the framework for
cooperation and collaboration among the various supervisory and regulatory institutions, to
enhance risk management.

C. Tackling External Arrears, Steps toward Normalizing Relations

Zimbabwe’s economy. Eliminating such
arrears would allow increased external
inflows to finance the authorities’ development plans and private sector-led growth. To this end, the
authorities have developed a strategy, which staff welcomes, to clear its external arrears to the IFIs
through: a) bridge financing from Afrieximbank to repay arrears to the AfDB, the African
Development Fund, and IDA; b) a long-term loan from a bilateral creditor to repay the IBRD; and c)
use of SDR holdings to clear the arrears to the Fund.28 This strategy and the authorities’ reform plans
going forward received support from creditors and development partners during the Lima meetings
and, if implemented, should provide positive signals to investors and creditors, and help unlock
external flows. The World Bank’s management recently agreed for their private sector arm—the
International Finance Corporation (IFC)—to prepare proposals for possible investments in Zimbabwe

that could be reviewed by its management over the coming months. The authorities have indicated
that they are planning to work toward requesting a debt treatment under the Paris Club
(representing 44 percent of their public and publicly-guaranteed debt), following the repayment of
arrears to the IFIs. The authorities plan to eventually seek Fund-financial support for an ambitious
medium-term program, a necessary step to seek debt treatment under the Paris Club. The timing of
these steps will be decided by the authorities on the basis of their capacity to build support for full
reengagement.
34.
Zimbabwe continues to make efforts to cooperate with the Fund on policies and
payments, and to make good use of technical assistance (TA). They continue to make the
agreed $150,000 monthly payment to the PRGT, the increased pari passu payments to the World
Bank and AfDB, and token payments to the European Investment Bank. The authorities have
committed to increase payments to the IFIs as their payment capacity increases. Zimbabwe
continues to benefit from targeted Fund TA to address policy challenges, strengthen institutional
capacity, and support its ongoing reform efforts.

D. Addressing Structural Impediments to Boost Output
35.
The Zimbabwean economy is operating well below capacity and there is urgent need
for ambitious reforms to transform the economy and unleash the country’s growth potential.
The country’s output is increasingly constrained by infrastructural bottlenecks—electricity, water,
transport; unavailability and high cost of long-term capital; high cost of doing business; low
productivity; and an uncompetitive manufacturing sector. Staff emphasized that catching-up with its
regional peers will require addressing the debt overhang, normalizing relationship with the
international community, and much faster implementation of bold policies and reforms to tackle the
country’s structural impediments and facilitate sustainable long-term growth.
36.
The implementation of the framework, procedures and guidelines for implementing
the indigenization policy has been controversial. While the proposal to set a levy on nocompliance with indigenization rules has been rejected, significant uncertainty remains on how
compliance with the law can be achieved in an economically sensible and transparent manner. Staff
urged the authorities to address this issue including by setting clear criteria on how existing
business are going to be treated and how a transfer of shares will be financed (Annex IV).
37.
The authorities concurred with staff recommendations. They noted that they have
already broadly outlined an ambitious reform program to support their reengagement process.
Planned reforms include: (a) infrastructure development, particularly in such key areas as energy,
water, roads, and schools; (b) enhancing the investment climate and reducing the cost of doing
business; (c) further strengthening the financial sector; (d) accelerating public enterprises reforms
and improving public financial management, (e) revitalizing agriculture and agro-processing;
(f) aligning the laws with the 2013 constitution; and (g) strengthening the rule of law and improving
governance.

38.
Good progress has been made in improving the business climate, led by the Office of
the President and Cabinet, with support from development partners. Zimbabwe is now ranked
155, out of 189 countries, on the World Bank’s 2016 Doing Business Rankings. Various legislations
are being amended to improve the ease of doing business.29 In collaboration with development
partners, a number of areas have been identified for scaled-up implementation to address
remaining bottlenecks to doing business. These include: starting a business, construction permits
and registering property, getting credit and resolving insolvency, protecting minority investors and
enforcing contracts, and paying taxes and trading across borders. As part of the same effort, the
authorities are setting up a one-stop shop for private investment.
39.
Critical action has been taken on land issues (Letter of Intent, ¶vi). In collaboration with key
stakeholders, in early-March 2016, the authorities have prepared and submitted to the cabinet
documents to establish the 99-year land leases. Once finalized, this is expected to pave the way for
the leases to be used as collateral, improving security of tenure, which should provide positive
signals to investors, and boosting agricultural production. Parliament is currently considering a bill
for the establishment of the Land Commission (as provided by the Constitution) aimed at supporting
land administration including through regular land audits. The authorities have also announced a
framework for land compensation, which includes the following main elements: a) a recentlyestablished Land Compensation Fund; b) an ongoing mapping of land boundaries; and c) an
ongoing systematic evaluation of mapped land and improvements therein. The European Union and
the United Nations Development Program are assisting the authorities in the mapping and
evaluation exercise and mapping devising modalities for compensation.
40.
The authorities acknowledged that tackling Zimbabwe’s infrastructure deficit will be
crucial for boosting productivity and competitiveness. The 2016 budget has allocated
$315 million (2.1 percent of GDP) for infrastructure development, including in energy, transport and
communication, water and sanitation (dam construction, rehabilitation and upgrading), roads,
information technology. Zimbabwe currently produces less than half of its peak hour electricity
demand. There are a number of projects, including hydro, coal-fired, diesel and solar power, at
various stages of development aimed at addressing the country’s energy deficit.

E. Alternative Scenario
41.
Achieving strong sustained growth and reducing poverty requires that Zimbabwe
undertake significant reforms and investment. To illustrate the benefits of the reforms, staff
discussed with the authorities an alternative scenario that envisages an acceleration of an ambitious
medium-term reform strategy that would see the economy catching up for the lost decades. Under
this scenario, and assuming clearance of the arrears to the IFIs, Zimbabwe could see medium-term
growth averaging 8 percent, consistent with experiences of some Sub-Saharan African countries that
29

These include the Commercial Court Law, Private Business Corporation Act, Shop License Act, Companies Act,
Deed Registry Act, Insolvency Act, Land Survey Act, and a new Collateral Registry Act.

received debt relief. In addition, the combination of restraint in the wage bill and higher growth
would generate substantial increase in fiscal space that could lead to capital spending more than
doubling with respect to 2016 (Text Table 2). While the current account would remain large, driven
by higher investments, the level of international reserves would increase, as government generates
surpluses and builds accounts at the RBZ (Figure 3).

42.
Agriculture would continue to play a key role in the alternative scenario. In the short
term, a rebound in production is expected, provided normal precipitations return—as has been the
pattern following El Niño years. More fundamentally, the authorities have laid the basis for
improved agricultural production in the medium term. The establishment of bankable leases,
together with a solution to the ownership issues, would enhance access to credit and security of
investment. The authorities are also targeting investment and maintenance of irrigation systems in
their investment plan.
43.
The authorities agree with the objectives and policies underpinning the adjustment
scenario. In particular, they committed to lower the wage bill of the central government and grant
aided-institutions to 50 percent of total expenditures by 2019 and to rebalance spending towards
priority social and capital outlays.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

STAFF APPRAISAL
44.
Achievements: The authorities have implemented the policies agreed under the SMP,
despite quite difficult economic and financial conditions. They have built a track record of prudent
fiscal policies by improving the primary balance, accumulating less domestic and external arrears,
and keeping wage outlays below budgetary projections both in 2014 and 2015. Higher payments to
the IFIs and slight improvements in their capacity to repay have helped the authorities to develop a
credible strategy for repaying their arrears to the IFIs, a key step toward reengaging with multilateral
and bilateral creditors. The implementation of the SMP has also shown that Zimbabwe possesses the
technical and institutional capacity to move economic reforms forward. These experience and
capacity level would serve them well should they request an eventual financial arrangement with the
Fund. The authorities have also made headways in garnering support from creditors, as shown by
the creditors’ meeting held in Lima in October 2015.
45.
Challenges: Economic difficulties have deepened. The El Niño-related droughts, low
international prices for commodity exports, and the appreciation of the dollar have hit the economy
hard. Real growth has dropped below the level needed to raise per-capita income, formal
employment has shrunk, signs are that poverty is in on the rise, and 3 million people are now
estimated to be at risk of lack of access to food. Under these conditions, Zimbabwe cannot wait.
A profound economic transformation program is needed to reverse this adverse trend and unleash
the country’s potential. Policies need to address the underlying impediments to growth as soon as
possible, and redirect the economy toward private sector-led growth. The lack of external financial
support cannot be a reason for inaction. To the contrary, an ambitious, comprehensive, and
frontloaded economic reform program is essential for Zimbabwe to regain access to financing from
both multilateral and bilateral creditors. Without such financing, reform efforts will not be successful.
46.
Fiscal Policy: Zimbabwe cannot use fiscal policy to deal with adverse shocks or its social and
development needs, because it lacks the necessary resources and it spends too much for wage
outlays. For the time-being, the budget needs to target a broadly balance fiscal position while
reprioritizing spending toward social and development outlays. This stance will help restore fiscal
sustainability and increase the capacity to repay the country’s external debt. The objective is to
unlock foreign financing that could allow the government to run small-to-moderate deficits in
response to adverse shocks and raise the spending levels for social and infrastructure needs. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ intention to continue seeking financing through grants and loans that are
as concessional as possible, and to limit contracting of non-concessional loans, while prioritizing
investment that would eventually raise Zimbabwe’s capacity to repay.
47.
The Wage Bill: There are no doubts that the top priority is lowering the size of the wage bill.
The issue is how to do it in a credible and sustainable way. The measures taken in the context of the
2016 budget are a good start, and the authorities’ target for reducing the wage-related central
government outlays appears appropriate and sufficiently ambitious. To achieve their medium-term
target, the government should focus on both the size and remuneration of the public service, and
keep the level of wage-related outlays constant in nominal terms at least until 2019. Staff welcomes

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

ZIMBABWE

the recent audit conducted by the Civil Service Commission and suggests that all the other service
commissions proceed with similar audits.
48.
Government Revenues: Zimbabwe’s tax collections are among the highest in SSA and there
is not much scope for a significant rise on tax collections without an adverse impact on economic
activity. The authorities’ planned review of the design of the tax system should focus on broadening
the tax base, particularly of the VAT, with a view to shifting the burden of taxation from income
toward indirect taxes. Improvements in tax administration should aim at simplifying procedures and
addressing areas where collection efficiency can be improved. Non-tax revenues have remained
below potential. Staff is encouraged by steps to increase transparency and accountability in the
diamond industry, which should ensure a meaningful and monitorable contribution of the sector to
government finances.
49.
Financial Sector: The RBZ has made progress in restoring banking sector confidence that
had been shattered by hyperinflation and the credit boom that followed. The system is now much
sounder. Nevertheless, risks need to be monitored carefully and supervision strengthened. ZAMCO
appears to be off to a very good start in restructuring mortgage-backed loans, and we welcome that
its operations are now self-funded. Looking forward, it will be important for ZAMCO to adhere to
international best practices. Financial inclusion is important to deepen the financial system.
Moreover, by providing opportunities for saving and investing it can help economic activity and also
limit the impact of adverse shocks on the vulnerable portion of the population. It will be however
important that, as financial inclusion progresses, supervision adapts to the changing financial
landscape.
50.
Investment Climate: Zimbabwe’s economic revival cannot take place without a vibrant
private sector. There are still too many obstacles to private entrepreneurship. The imminent
establishment of a one-stop shop window for private investors could simplify procedures
significantly. The consistent and transparent implementation of the indigenization policy will be
critical to attract both foreign and domestic investment by limiting the scope for discretion and
reducing uncertainty about the regulatory framework.
51.
Land Issues: The authorities’ decision to put an end to the fast-track land reform program
and to work toward devising modalities and a framework for land compensation could help solve
long-lasting conflicts that have hurt agricultural productivity. Moreover, the introduction of
bankable long-term land leases could greatly benefit investment in the sector by clarifying
ownership rights and providing access to much-needed financing. To be successful, these measures
will need to be followed by careful and consistent implementation that reassures investors of the
stability of the new land ownership environment.
52.
The Reengagement Process: Staff welcomes the authorities’ plan to repay their arrears to
the IFIs, but stresses that a sufficiently ambitious reform program and broad support from creditors
are also prerequisite for a financial arrangement with the Fund, as this support from creditors is
essential to the success of the reengagement strategy. Staff urges the authorities to redouble their
efforts to mobilize this support by reaching out to creditors to explain their medium-term reform

ZIMBABWE

agenda and keep them abreast of the progress in its implementation. In particular, the transparent
and business-friendly implementation of the indigenization policy will be key to secure support from
development partners. The matrix of reform items attached to the Letter of Intent is a good
foundation on which the authorities can build the next phase of economic reforms. It offers
considerably more detail on the authorities’ policy intentions on land reform, fiscal policy, public
financial management, tax policy, and revenue administration. Progress in these areas is important
to promote much-needed private sector-led growth and development partners’ support could
coalesce around these reforms. Staff notes that prioritization among the list of reform items is
critical and looks forward to support the authorities in the technical work needed to operationalize
them. Finally, a clear communication strategy that aligns policy actions to commitments, and
stresses policy consistency is of paramount importance. The ongoing work toward aligning the laws
with the Constitution, and progress toward strengthening the rule of law and governance would also
go a long way in securing donor support.
53.
Balance of Risks: Major risks have already materialized, and unfavorable weather conditions
could persist into the second half on 2016 and into 2017. Lack of progress in the reengagement
process together with setbacks in the implementation of the authorities’ reform agenda could
adversely impact private sector activity, while the government’s liquidity crunch could exacerbate,
further reduce public investment, and lead to larger accumulation of arrears, with major impact on
the country’s social indicators. On the upside, strong implementation and deepening of economic
reforms and progress in reengaging with creditors could reopen access to financial support, reverse
the adverse economic trend and improve the economic outlook.
54.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Zimbabwe be held on the
standard 12-month consultation cycle.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline
(“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a
probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the
time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium
term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Annex II. Social Developments in Zimbabwe
Overall poverty remains high, but extreme poverty significantly declined over the 2001-2011 period.
Income inequality also declined. Unemployment is rising. Further poverty, income inequality, and
unemployment reduction will primarily require sustained and strong inclusive economic growth.
Implementing employment and social safety net programs, improving the business environment, foster
private sector development, broadening access to finance, and building human capital would also be
essential elements to reduce poverty and inequality.

Poverty Remains Pervasive


The 2011/2012 Poverty, Income, Consumption, and Expenditure Survey (PICES) indicated that
72.3 percent of people in Zimbabwe are poor—their per-capita expenditure being below the
Total Consumption Poverty Line (TCPL)—up by 2 percentage points from 2001, mainly as a result
of the economic meltdown which accompanied the hyperinflation years. In fact, robust economic
growth helped reduce poverty by 4.7 percentage points during the 1996-2001 period. Poverty is
particularly pronounced in rural areas (84.3 percent) and is lower in urban ones (46.5 percent).
Extreme poverty—for people living at or below the Food Poverty Line (FPL)—however, halved to
16.2 percent of the population between 2001 and 2011/2012.

above were considered economically active (91 percent of
the total population in the group).

Annex III. Improving External Competitiveness
Large current account imbalances and low international reserves keep Zimbabwe in debt distress.
The country’s external position remains precarious with large and increasing external arrears—
although at lower rates than before the SMP. The current account deficit is projected to remain
above 10 percent of GDP (see figure 2) and is largely financed by capital inflows in the form of shortand long-term loans. The economy is exposed to declines in commodity prices and strengthening of
the U.S. dollar, which has worsened the country’s competitiveness relative to its main trading
partners (particularly South Africa) and regional neighbors.1

Weak institutions and an unfavorable business
environment undermine Zimbabwe’s
competitiveness. Zimbabwe’s international surveybased competitiveness ranking remains low. The
business climate, as measured by the 2015 World
Bank Doing Business survey, is ranked 155 among
189 countries—in the lowest quartile of all surveyed
countries—as in previous years. Domestic inflation
has been in negative territory, partly as a result of
weak demand and tight fiscal policy mitigating the
impact of the U.S. dollar appreciation. However,
Zimbabwe will still need to improve its competitiveness by facilitating further relative wage and price
adjustments while creating fiscal space.
A 2014 study found that between 2009 and 2013, minimum wage levels increased on average by
28.6 percent in Zimbabwe (an indication of direction of change in labor costs).2 Its main trading
partners in the region over the same time period registered lower increases: 19 percent in Zambia,
6.3 percent in South Africa, 5.9 percent in Mozambique and two percent in Botswana. As a result,

monthly minimum wage in 2013 stood at almost twice as high as the levels prevailing in Zambia,
Mozambique and Botswana. The study also found that these increases could not be justified by
increases in productivity. With the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar and large depreciation
of the trading partners’ currencies, Zimbabwe’s wage competitiveness has eroded further.
The key to restoring competitiveness is enhancing productivity. To restore external stability and
increase resilience to external shocks, Zimbabwe needs to: (i) continue fiscal consolidation; and
(ii) develop the country’s infrastructure; this requires stepped-up efforts by the authorities to secure
debt relief to reduce the unsustainably high external debt burden and unlock concessional foreign
financing; and (iii) continue the structural reforms aimed at removing impediments to create a
supportive business environment.
Zimbabwe’s level of human capital is high, compared to SSA. According to the Global

Annex IV. Zimbabwe’s Indigenization and Economic
Empowerment Framework
In 2008, the authorities enacted the Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act which requires
that 51 percent of all companies or new investment must be owned by locals. The law also sets up a
national indigenization fund to be financed through a levy to be imposed on companies that do not
comply with the law.
Zimbabwe decided a long time ago to promote local empowerment. The legal basis in
Zimbabwe is the Constitution, international conventions, and the African Charter on Human and
People’s Rights.1 The Zimbabwean authorities refer to countries in the region as having similar
policies. South Africa’s Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment is part of a growth strategy
targeting inequality. Botswana’s Citizen Economic Empowerment Policy acknowledges that economic
growth and diversification without empowerment could ultimately lead to a more fragile and
vulnerable economy, subject to the volatility of international markets.
In the case of Zimbabwe, the key challenge centers around balancing the desire for economic
empowerment with the desire to foster economic growth through domestic and foreign
investment. In January 2016, the authorities sought to clarify the Indigenization and Economic
Empowerment (IEE) Law and gazetted the Frameworks, Procedures and Guidelines for Implementing
the IEE Act. The latter did not change the policy but restated the commitment of preserving the
51 percent ownership threshold in the resources sector and offer ownership flexibility in other, nonresource, non-reserved sectors. While the desire to clarify the indigenization framework is a welcome
step, there are still important issues that need to be addressed. The framework proposed a levy to be
charged on noncompliant firms (the levy is foreseen in Article 17 of the IEEA). However, the levy
triggered extensive debate, with businesses expressing strong reservations and Cabinet, in March
2016, decided that there would be no levy. A levy would have required Parliamentary approval. What
is left is: clarifying the rebate system with a view to avoid discretion; clearly stating how existing
companies, particularly in the resources and reserved sectors will be treated; and how financing of
the indigenous shares could be secured in the face of scarce indigenous capital. Without these
clarifications, it would be difficult to implement the framework in a transparent manner.
The major question is how the authorities can foster indigenization without inhibiting
investment. With the abandoning of the levy, the authorities announced in March that businesses
should fully comply with the law, failure of which would lead to revoking the business license.
This also comes on the backdrop of major challenges in the past with perception, selective
application, and inconsistence in the implementation of the law. The feasibility of local share
ownership has to be addressed. Concerns continue to be raised on the issue of resourcing
indigenization given the demographics of the country, leading to a perception that “elitization” or
1

Article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights states that all citizens within a
country must benefit from the state using its natural resources to guarantee socio-economic rights. Article 21(1) and
Article 22(1) of The African Charter on Human and People’s Rights reads that “freely all peoples shall dispose of their
wealth and natural resources.”

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZIMBABWE

“individualization” could be the final outcome instead of indigenization. To this end, the authorities
should consider the adverse impact of the implementation of this policy on the economy.
Furthermore, separation of stakeholder interests and clear prioritization thereof and consistent
government pronouncements are keys in limiting negative perceptions and confusion about policies.
The indigenization policy and investment are intrinsically linked and it would be desirable that
authorities come up with one single harmonized law on investment. Recent work on creating an
omnibus investment act should explore the harmonization of the two laws. Given that the
indigenization law provides for different line ministries to oversee compliance in their own sectors,
inconsistencies and contradictions have emerged. There are some sectors of the economy which
appear to have been untouched while other sectors appear to be in substantial compliance. One way
of mitigating this unsatisfactory position is to have a regulatory framework within the law. That
framework or the regulator should also oversee the consistent implementation of the rebates and
incentives. In this context, making the Zimbabwe Investment Authority (ZIA) the sole entity in charge
of implementing the policy would de-politicize the process and likely lead to better results.
Improving the business environment more broadly remains critical. With respect to its regional
peers, investment in Zimbabwe falls short of potential. An enhanced and inclusive dialogue between
the private sector and government could go a long way in instilling a more conducive investment
climate. In addition, swift action to operationalize the one-stop-shop (OSS) for investment and
ensuring that officials at the OSS are empowered to make final decisions will be instrumental.
Furthermore, the recently launched annual National Competitiveness Report has the potential to
tackle the major obstacles to competitiveness and doing business. The recently gazetted Joint
Venture Bill will also assist the authorities to implement infrastructure investments. The recently
established National Competitiveness Commission should feed into this process.

Annex V. Wage Policy Strategy for Zimbabwe1
Background
At 77 percent of government spending (2016), employment costs in Zimbabwe undermine fiscal
sustainability, place a significant financing burden on the economy, and crowd out other productive
expenditures. The growth in employment costs from 51 percent of spending in 2010 has been the
result of both higher wages and employment growth. Wage growth has mainly been driven by the
need to increase public service real wages that were eroded by hyperinflation during the 2000’s.
At the same time, the increase in employment numbers was the result of an expansion in service
delivery (for example introduction of an early childhood development program), and a generalized
expansion of the role of the state in the economy. Between 2010 and 2013, the expansion in
employment costs was underpinned by expectations of continued economic growth, and the
unanticipated slowdown in growth and inflation has served to exacerbate the problem.
Within challenging financial and economic circumstances, the Zimbabwean government was able to
reverse a pattern of overspending on employment costs in 2015. Estimated wage spending were
below the budgeted amount by USD277 million, mainly due to the deferment of the 2015 13th check
and a large part of the December salary bill to 2016.

Current Policy Commitment
The Zimbabwe government has long recognized the challenge that its employment costs pose to
fiscal sustainability, service delivery and economic growth. Successive budget statements have
provided a transparent assessment of the problem and have outlined a number of commitments to
address the challenge. The three most significant interventions are:


The freeze on personnel numbers introduced in 2011. The numbers freeze has not been successful
in containing growth in the civil service. By the Minister of Finances own admission (Budget
Statement 2015), numbers of employees have continued to grow as service delivery priorities
have often overridden the wage freeze commitment.



No wage increase since 2014. While not an explicit and stated policy of government, salaries have
not been adjusted since 2014. Further, performance related salary increments have not been
implemented, leading to no nominal salary progression for civil servants. This has been facilitated
by negative CPI inflation in 2014 and 2015



Direct salary interventions based on salary audits. The Civil Service Human Resource and Payroll
Systems Audit undertaken by the Public Service Commission2has resulted in potential wage bill
savings of USD170 million a year. These interventions were announced in the 2016 Budget
Statement and are in the process of being implemented. The service commissions/boards for the

from discussion with development partners.

The Public Service Commission covers all civil servants except for health workers. The Judiciary and uniformed
services have their own commissions. The health sector has a Health Services Board.

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZIMBABWE

Judiciary, health sector and uniformed services are undertaking similar audits and will be
announcing specific savings interventions later this year.

A Medium-term Strategy for Addressing the Wage Bill
Managing the wage bill challenge requires the government to develop a medium-term wage bill
policy strategy that goes beyond the direct measures already announced and being planned.

Short-term Measures
Establish a clear wage bill target. Wage policy must be directly anchored in the fiscal objectives of
the government. For this purpose, the government should target the consolidated wage bill of
central government (wages and salaries for central government plus wage related transfers to grant
aided). Setting a target for the consolidated wage bill depends on economic growth expectations,
fiscal objectives, and employment and remuneration policy.
For example, based on the staff’s alternative economic and fiscal scenario (including zero growth in
the nominal wage bill), a reduction in the consolidated wage bill from 66 percent of spending in
2016 to 50 percent by 2019 is consistent with an affordable fiscal framework and a rebalancing of
expenditure towards social and economic priorities. This scenario illustrates how pursuing wage
restraint and economic growth leads to significant resources for investment in service delivery
priorities, which in turn support further economic growth and development. If the authorities growth
outlook is lower than that contained in the staff’s alternative scenario, a higher target or more
restrictive employment and remuneration assumptions would be necessary.
Once the target is set, recruitment and remuneration policies must be managed in a manner
that is consistent with its achievement. This commitment should be primary to the other needs of
government. If service delivery norms or expanded service delivery require new hiring, this should be
done within the existing and funded establishment of government. Should the economic and
spending trajectory worsen, government will have to manage their recruitment and salary objectives
to ensure that the wage bill and fiscal targets are met.
Implement the findings of the payroll audits conducted by all service commissions and boards.
The Public Service Commission has completed a payroll audit that informed the wage savings
interventions announced in the 2016 Budget Statement. Cabinet has requested similar proposals
from the Judicial and uniformed service commissions and the Health Services Board. The
implementation of the findings of all the commissions/boards should be a short-term priority as they
will directly reduce the level of the consolidated wage bill, thereby bringing the government closer to
its target.
Allowances should be reviewed with the goal of identifying efficiency gains and savings.
In 2015, allowance payments made up 43 percent of the civil service wage bill. While these
allowances should be reviewed as part of a longer-term pay reform strategy, a short term review
should look to identify immediate and implementable reforms that would cut wastage and save
government money. For example, the government should reconsider the inclusion of an
accommodation and transport allowance in the 13th check. The government could also consider
moving to a 13th check paid only if economic growth exceeds a particular level.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

ZIMBABWE

Develop a strategy and framework for the equitable retrenchment of staff that cannot be
redeployed. It may not be possible to train and place all staff identified for redeployment in the
payroll audits. For staff that cannot be redeployed, an equitable separation scheme should be
designed. It is not intended for separations to be numerous as the aim is to address the inevitable
friction in a redeployment process through an equitable but affordable separation package.
Developing capacity of MoFED staff to analyze, advise and play a regulatory role in wage bill
budgeting. To support the Minister of Finance in his/her responsibilities, a dedicated Public Sector
Personnel Analysis unit should be introduced to the budget department. This unit should analyze
wage related data to understand and report on trends in pay policy, interface with the service
commissions/boards, and advise the Minister of Finance on pay policy options and scenarios.
Medium-term Measures
Budget preparation reform. The budget call circular is currently issued late in the financial year
which severely limits the ability of ministries to prioritize scarce resources to where they will have the
greatest impact. This is exacerbated by separate ceilings for wages, other running costs, and capital
expenditure in the call circular. This results in budgeting in silos, hoarding of positions, and
discourages ministries from shifting allocations in support of more effective service delivery. To give
ministries a greater incentive to re-prioritize, the MoFED should adjust the formulation of ceilings,
and provide appropriate guidance to ministries for the preparation of the FY17 budget. At the same
time, the budget call circular should be issued much earlier to allow more time for rebalancing
discussions within ministries.
Review and strengthen Medium Term Expenditure Framework. A well-functioning MTEF, based
on a credible Medium Term Fiscal Framework, is an important reform in shifting the budget culture
from needs based petitioning to one based on allocating existing resources in most effective
manner. Current approaches to expenditure forecasting should be reviewed and strengthened.
Continue development of Program Based Budgeting. The adoption of a program approach to
budget would contribute to better management of the budget by encouraging MDAs to explore a
better balance inputs (staff, running costs and capital) needed to achieve program outputs.
Review and strengthen government wide planning processes. Planning is highly desirable, but
needs to be based on realistic resourcing prospects to be worthwhile. The current planning process
appears to be driven by needs rather than availabilities. As a result, trade-offs between the
alternative use of resources is not confronted and priorities in service delivery are avoided. Needs
based planning undermines effective wage bill management by encouraging additional staffing
requests rather than better allocation of existing staff. This suggests that existing approaches to
planning should be reviewed, ensuring that plans are costed and related to availabilities based fiscal
framework.
Long-term Measures
Updated pay policy. There are a number of features of the Zimbabwe pay policy that need to be
revisited, updated, and modernized. Comprehensive pay policy reform is a complex and sometimes
costly undertaking, but if done properly can significantly improve the effectiveness of the public
service. The government should therefore begin to review existing pay policy, aiming to have a

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZIMBABWE

comprehensive set of reforms to implement when fiscal conditions allow. The reforms should achieve
a pay policy regime that relate pay to jobs that are being performed (building on job descriptions,
job evaluation and well-designed pay and grading systems), are non-discriminatory (with regard to
age, gender, marital status, religion, diversity etc), and attract, retain and motivate skills needed for
efficient and effective service delivery. This process should also look to reform the existing allowance
regime, restricting allowances to targeted interventions to compensate for a specific problem that
undermines service delivery.
Decentralization of HR Management without loss of control. The government currently operates
a highly centralized system of HRM, with all decisions and processes of personnel administration
carried out by the Public Service Commission and other Commissions/Boards. There are historical
reasons for these arrangements, and in the short run there is a justification for retaining central
control over the wage bill. In the longer run the highly centralized nature of HR management is likely
to inhibit efficient service delivery by undermining incentives for senior managers to manage their
labor resources to achieve better outcomes. At the same time, decentralization of HRM should be
matched by improvements in reporting and “line of sight” into wage budgets to allow the MoFED
and commissions/boards to play an effective regulatory role.
Launch a process of Functional Reviews in critical ministries. Functional reviews entail looking
afresh at Ministry mandates and the organizational structures and staffing put in place to discharge
those mandates. A cycle of functional reviews takes time to develop and execute, and are best
thought of as longer term measures.
Undertake Pension System Reform. Pensions remain a significant component of total employment
costs. While they are largely driven by past public service hiring decisions, there is scope for broader
system reform. The suitability of moving towards a fully funded defined benefit scheme (the present
policy commitment) should be evaluated very carefully. The starting point for pension reform could
be a review of the effectiveness of current pension roll controls.
Wage policy objectives beyond 2019. Assuming the successful achievement of the government’s
wage bill target, future objectives and ambitions for the wage bill should be developed. These should
include a headline target and time period, accompanied with a program of reform that supports
service delivery and economic growth within the fiscal constraint.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
April 14, 2016
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, DC 20431
United States
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
We thank the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for its continued support of our economic reform
programme and valuable technical assistance. This support has played a pivotal role in our efforts to
transform our economy, normalize relations with the international community, and eventually access
Fund financial resources.
Our continued engagement under the Staff-Monitored Programme (SMP) was critical in stabilising
the macroeconomic environment. We are committed to our economic transformation program in
preparation for clearing arrears with international financial institutions (IFIs) and full re-engagement.
Economic difficulties have deepened, so time is of the essence. The El Niño-induced drought has hit
our economy and the situation is expected to worsen with adverse impact on agricultural output,
food security, and power generation. Moreover, lower commodity prices, the appreciation of the U.S.
dollar, and insufficient external inflows still weigh on the economy.
Our commitment, with support from the private sector, civil society, and the general public ensured
that the SMP remained on track. Despite substantial economic and financial difficulties, we have met
all end-December 2015 quantitative targets. The floor on the primary cash balance was met with a
wide margin. The floor on protected social spending, the targets for Poverty Reduction Growth Trust
(PRGT) payments, net international reserves, and the ceiling on non-concessional borrowing were all
met.
We have also met the remaining structural benchmarks:
a. We submitted to Cabinet amendments to the Public Finance Management Act. The bill has
since been gazetted and submitted to Parliament. The amendments are geared towards
strengthening Treasury’s financial oversight of state owned enterprises (SOEs) and local
authorities.
b. We submitted to Cabinet amendments to the Procurement Act to tighten the public
procurement framework and make it more efficient and transparent.
c.

48

In January 2016, we published the frameworks, procedures and guidelines of the
Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act. We have addressed challenges related to the
policy to provide certainty and clarity.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZIMBABWE

In addition, we have pushed forward our reform agenda, particularly in the following areas:
i.

We have started to implement measures to rationalize public expenditure and reduce public
sector employment costs. We envisage the measures under implementation to generate
savings of about 1 percent of GDP. These measures, as detailed in the 2016 Budget Statement,
include reviewing the vacation leave policy in the education sector, withdrawing from noncore responsibilities and the rationalisation of employment structures across ministries. We
have already reduced employment cost obligations for grant-aided institutions. Further, to
the audit by the Civil Service Commission, the Police and the Judicial Service Commissions
and the Health Services Board will complete salary and employment audits for their own
sectors in 2016. These audits will inform our decision on the reduction of employment costs
across government and related institutions

ii.

We have finalised 2 forensic audits out of the 10 largest and most critical SOEs. Furthermore,
forensic audits were conducted for ZBC and Allied Timbers. We also reduced employment
costs in a number of SOEs (for Tel -One by 15 percent, and National Social Security Authority
by 25 percent.). In addition, the Radiation Protection Authority of Zimbabwe reduced its
overall costs by 30 percent.

iii.

With the aim of improving transparency and accountability for natural resources, we have
moved ahead with the consolidation of the diamond sector. We are accounting for diamond
mining from extraction to sales and transfers of proceeds. We will timely publish audited
financial statements of state owned mining entities.

iv.

On the ease of doing business, we constituted various committees in 2015 to address the
remaining bottlenecks. We started a pilot project on harmonising the City of Harare processes
for business set up, including building permits through the assistance of the United States of
America International Development (USAID) and the World Bank. We are in the final stages of
operationalising the One-Stop-Shop for investment.

v.

We have made substantial progress to place the financial sector on a stable and sound
footing. The sector is rid of troubled banks, the banks are adequately capitalised, and nonperforming loans are now down to 10 percent. As of end February 2016, mortgage-backed
loans amounting to $357 million had been acquired by the Zimbabwe Asset Management
Company (ZAMCO) of which US$210 million loans were restructured into long term loans,
US$40 million into preference shares and US$35 million into ordinary shares. This has assisted
in restructuring firms in strategic sectors of the economy such as agriculture and mining.
ZAMCO is now self-sufficient in terms of funding its operating expenditures. We have
launched a National Financial Inclusion Strategy aimed at broadening access to and use of
financial resources with a view to improve social and economic development.

vi.

We conducted a midterm review of our economic blueprint, ZIM ASSET. The outcome of the
review suggests that we need to mobilize more financing and prioritize projects. To finance
some of our projects, we have resorted to nonconcessional loans, especially in the area of
infrastructure investment, development partner support as well as statutory funds. In 2015, a
total of $431.9 million, 3 percent of GDP, was channelled toward priority infrastructure in the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

ZIMBABWE

water, energy, transport, ICT, irrigation, housing, social services, and the agriculture sector,
which falls short of our substantial needs.
vii.

We are moving ahead with land audits to expose any irregularities with the implementation
of past land reform. We have submitted to Parliament a bill to establish the Land
Commission in line with the Constitution. In collaboration with the European Union and the
United Nations Development Programme, we started mapping and evaluating farms and
devising modalities for compensation. The draft bankable 99-year lease is being finalised and
is awaiting submission to Cabinet. This will go a long way in providing security of tenure to
the beneficiaries of the land reform programme and consequently boost agriculture by
facilitating access to financing and investment.

On the basis of our strong performance against programme targets and our continued commitment
to sound macroeconomic policy management, we request that the third and final review under our
15-month SMP be completed.
The Government believes that the economic and financial policies set forth in our Letter of Intent
(LOI) and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) of November 3, 2014,
supplemented with the LOI of April 17, 2015 and that of September 30, 2015 were adequate to meet
the objectives of the SMP. The measures outlined in this updated LOI are geared towards
maintaining the momentum of economic transformation that began with the SMP and set the stage
for an eventual full re-engagement, including arrears clearance to the IFIs, a Fund-financial
arrangement, and debt treatment under the Paris Club.
Continuing with our commitment to transparency in government operations, which we believe is
essential for good governance and keeping our citizens abreast of our policy intentions, we consent
to the publication on the IMF website of: the IMF staff report, all SMP-related documents, and the
debt sustainability analysis performed by IMF and World Bank staff. In addition, we have published
our arrears clearance strategy presented in Lima last year and we will publish our forthcoming
economic transformation programme on both our websites.

POLICIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR AND BEYOND
The end of the SMP in December 2015 concludes the monitored part of our economic and social
transformation programme. We remain committed to the spirit of the agenda we began with the two
successive SMPs and the objectives contained therein. Most importantly, we are implementing the
broader reforms outlined in our arrears clearance strategy presented at the Lima meetings. In this
context, resolving Zimbabwe’s external arrears remains our highest priority. Our debt overhang and
overdue obligations impede Zimbabwe's access to external financing, and hamper our economic and
social transformation agenda. We expect the successful resolution of Zimbabwe’s external payment
arrears to send strong signals to the international community, reduce the perceived country risk
premium, and unlock affordable financing for government and the private sector. Our objectives are
to achieve sustained economic development through economic transformation, to improve living
conditions for the people of Zimbabwe, and reduce poverty.

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZIMBABWE

These objectives cannot be achieved without the bold measures outlined in Table 1. We believe that
these measures, together with arrears clearance, will pave the way for full re-engagement with the
international community and set the stage for strong private sector-led growth. Our economic
transformation agenda is based on our ZIMASSET, the 10 point plan announced by the President on
August 25, 2015 and the Sustainable Development Goals.
We will continue with the productive and fruitful dialogue we have had with the IMF. Should any
need for substantial non-concessional external borrowing arise, we will hold timely consultations
with IMF staff on the possible terms to ensure that such borrowing strengthens confidence in
macroeconomic management and does not jeopardize our arrears clearance strategy and debt
sustainability.
Fiscal discipline remains a priority. In the short term, even in the presence of additional spending
needs to mitigate the impact of the drought, we will strive to achieve a primary cash balance of close
to zero, because of lack of financing. This heightens the urgency of re-engagement that, by
eventually unlocking financing, will allow us to deal with adverse shocks and plan for much needed
social and capital outlays. We will finalise the Public Finance Management (PFM) Reform Plan and
promulgate PFM regulations. Meanwhile, we will accelerate the on-going SOE reform.
A crucial element of our fiscal policy is a strategy that lowers the combined wage bill of the central
government and grant-aided institutions to 50 percent of total expenditure by 2019. To achieve this
reduction, we will work on the size and remuneration of the public service. Based on current
economic growth and expenditure forecasts, this will mean that the employment and salary freeze
will have to remain in place for at least the next three years.
The service commissions of government will implement the recommendations of their employment
audits. We will conduct a review of allowances to identify savings and efficiency gains. We will
enhance service delivery by redeploying underutilized employees and we intend to retrench staff
that cannot be redeployed.
We will continue to improve the business environment, including in areas where resources are
needed to strengthen governance and to address administrative bottlenecks. The Office of the
President and Cabinet is now driving the process under the Rapid Results Approach and we envisage
a significant improvement in our doing business rankings.
We are ready to clear the outstanding arrears with IFIs, as outlined in the Lima meetings. With the
reform agenda outlined in Table 1, we believe that after clearing these arrears, we will be in a
position to present a comprehensive and ambitious reform programme that could be supported by a
Fund financial arrangement in close collaboration with other IFIs. As part of this process, we will seek
a debt treatment by the Paris Club. We aim at maintaining a sustainable debt burden after arrears
clearance which will be instrumental in maintaining macroeconomic stability.
We will continue to monitor progress in implementing our strategy at both the technical and political
levels. At the political level, the monitoring is coordinated by the Office of the President and Cabinet.
The technical monitoring committee comprising officials from the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Development, Ministry of Economic Planning and Investment Promotion, the Reserve Bank of

Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency, and the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority will
continue to meet regularly. The quadripartite committee (comprising the African Development Bank,
IMF and the World Bank, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and the Reserve Bank
of Zimbabwe), will also continue to provide input into the process.
As we set out for normal cooperation with our partners, it remains crucial that institutional
deficiencies are attended to. During this phase, we will continue to request technical assistance from
the Fund particularly in tax policy and administration, PFM, financial sector issues, and statistics.

Application of Remedial Measures under the Arrears Strategy:
Zimbabwe has been in continuous arrears to the Fund since February 2001. On September 24, 2001,
the Executive Board declared Zimbabwe ineligible to use the general resources of the Fund and
removed it from the list of PRGT-eligible countries. On June 13, 2002, the Board issued a declaration
of non-cooperation with respect to Zimbabwe and suspended all technical assistance (TA) to the
country. On June 6, 2003, the Board suspended Zimbabwe’s voting and related rights at the Fund.
The Managing Director issued a complaint regarding compulsory withdrawal on February 6, 2004.
The Executive Board considered the complaint on July 7, 2004, on February 15, 2005, and again on
September 9, 2005, and decided to postpone the recommendation on Zimbabwe’s compulsory
withdrawal from the Fund to the Board of Governors so as to give more time for Zimbabwe to
improve cooperation with the Fund. On February 15, 2006, Zimbabwe fully settled its arrears to the
General Resources Account. As a consequence, the complaint for compulsory withdrawal was
withdrawn. However, the Executive Board decided not to restore Zimbabwe’s voting and related
rights, nor did it terminate Zimbabwe’s ineligibility to use the general resources of the Fund.
The Executive Board also kept in place the decisions taken to address Zimbabwe’s arrears to the
PRGT Trust—the declaration of noncooperation, the suspension of TA, and the removal of
Zimbabwe from the list of PRGT-eligible countries.
On May 4, 2009, the Executive Board lifted the suspension of TA to Zimbabwe in the following areas:
(i) tax policy and administration; (ii) payments system; (iii) lender-of-last-resort and banking
supervision; and (iv) central banking governance and accounting (EBS/09/55). On February 19, 2010,
the Executive Board restored Zimbabwe’s voting rights and its eligibility for general resources.
On May 17, 2010, the Executive Board added macroeconomic statistics to the targeted areas for
Fund TA. On January 4, 2011, it added public financial management and anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism. On October 23, 2012, the Executive Board further relaxed the
restrictions on Fund TA to Zimbabwe to include any other area that would support the formulation
and implementation of a comprehensive adjustment and structural reform program that can be
monitored by the staff. Zimbabwe’s arrears to the PRGT Trust amounted to SDR 78.97 million
(US$109.1 million) as of end-February 2016.

unsettled balances under an inoperative bilateral payments agreement with Malaysia, payments and
transfers for current international transactions can now be effected without restriction.
Since 2009, Zimbabwe has adopted a multi-currency regime, including the U.S. dollar, the South
African rand, the British pound, the euro and the Botswana pula—with the U.S. dollar as principal
currency. The Australian dollar, the Chinese yuan, the Indian rupee and the Japanese yen were
added to the list in February 2014. The use of the Zimbabwean dollar as domestic currency has been
discontinued. The de facto exchange regime is classified as exchange arrangement with no separate
legal tender.

The teams were encouraged by the policy dialogue with the Government, and agreed
that country-specific policies and reforms are needed to unlock Zimbabwe‘s growth potential
and place the country on a sustainable, inclusive growth path. Over the immediate to medium
term, reforms need to be focused on strengthening public financial management, improving payroll
and human resource management, raising the effectiveness, efficiency and equity of government
expenditure, reducing financial sector vulnerabilities, tackling infrastructure bottlenecks, and
improving the business environment. In addition, addressing Zimbabwe’s debt overhang and
enhancing governance will be essential if the country is to attract much-needed investment and
access affordable long-term capital.
3.
Based on this assessment, the teams agreed to support the authorities’ efforts with the
following division of labor:


4

PFM reform: The Fund will continue its engagement with the Zimbabwean authorities in their
effort to advance the fiscal reform agenda and restore fiscal sustainability. The Fund will offer TA
in: (i) macro-fiscal forecasting and budgeting to develop and implement a strategy for an
improved medium-term expenditure framework; (ii) cash management, accounting, and fiscal
reporting; (iii) improving fiscal oversight at the central government,; and (iv) budget formulation
and execution. The Bank will continue supporting financial management and reporting,
enhancing internal controls and internal auditing, the external audit oversight and oversight of
Parliament to ensure increased transparency and accountability, the gradual expansion of the
IFMIS system to public authorities (especially local governments) currently not covered and is
working towards stronger enforcement of government rules in SOEs. As part of a joint World

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZIMBABWE

Bank – Ministry of Finance and Economic Development effort to review public expenditures,
oversight and transparency of extra-budgetary funds is gradually being expanded.


Tax reform: The authorities have made some progress on tax reform. The Fund will continue to
offer TA in tax policy (VAT) and tax administration reform, including in the areas of risk
management, taxpayer filing, management of transit traffic, and post control audit. A joint
IMF-World Bank-OECD project is advising on transfer pricing issues in mining taxation.



Diamond sector reform: Activities in the Marange area have slowed significantly over the last
two years due in part to (i) depletion of the easier to access alluvial resource leaving only the
harder, deeper and less profitable conglomerate resource for mining, but also due to (ii) the
ongoing restructuring and consolidation of mining licenses in the Marange area. From
discussions with government, Zimbabwe is nearing completion of the restructuring process
which will consolidate all Marange mining licenses under the fully state owned and controlled
Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company (Pty). The Bank believes that following the
restructuring an opportunity for further technical assistance will emerge as the government will
need to attract capital and technical expertise to optimally explore and deplete the remaining
Marange resource.



Mining fiscal policy, modeling and tax administration support. The Bank is providing
technical support for improved management of the mineral sector. In March 2014 the Bank
launched a project on fiscal modeling and capacity building for mining with the Ministry of
Mines and Mining Development (MMMD) and the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Development (MoFED). A fiscal model was completed and MOFED have been working to
populate the model with data from mining companies. In order to advance the thinking on
mining fiscal policy, the World Bank also provided a options note on mining fiscal policy to the
MoFED and MMMD. The Bank will continue to provide TA aimed at improving the fiscal regime
in Zimbabwe and improving capacity for revenue forecasting – in diamonds and other mineral
commodities. As previously mentioned the OECD and World Bank are also providing capacity
building support to ZIMRA on issues of international tax administration.



Delivery of basic services and social safety nets: The Bank has delivered TA to prepare the
2016 budget of the Ministries of Health and Child Care, Primary and Secondary Education and
Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare in program-based format. The presentation of the
budget in this format is gradually expanded to other ministries and scheduled to cover the full
budget in 2018. In parallel projects are delivered TA to improve service delivery in the heath and
child care as well as primary and secondary education.



Business environment reform: The Bank delivered TA on Doing Business Reforms under the
auspice of the Office of the President and Cabinet. The TA has seen various legislative drafts
drawn out that would result in improving the ease of doing business. At least eight Acts have
been amended and seven regulatory reforms. Specific legislation includes Commercial Court
Law, High Court Act, Private Business Corporation Act, Shop License Act, Companies Act, Deeds

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZIMBABWE

Registry Act, Insolvency Act, Land Survey Act, Legal Practitioners Act and a new Collateral
Registry Act.


Financial sector reform: The WBG provides TA to the RBZ covering Banking Supervision and
Crisis Resolution, Credit Infrastructure, Financial Inclusion to Collateral Registry and Anti-Money
Laundering and Combating of Financing of Terrorism. The IMF will provide assistance on
developing a macro-prudential policy; stress testing; and banking supervision, including
consolidated supervision of banking groups.



Central bank reform: The IMF takes the lead on Central Bank Reform issues, including the
establishment of the Zimbabwe Asset Management Company (ZAMCO) to purchase toxic assets
from banks to enable them to lend again.



Reform of the statistical system: The World Bank has provided TA to ZIMSTAT to help them
produce a poverty atlas that presents poverty levels at the provincial, district and ward level.
The Bank is also assisting ZIMSTAT with questionnaire design and a sampling strategy for their
upcoming Poverty Income and Consumption Expenditure Survey (PICES) 2016/17. The Fund will
continue to offer TA in national accounts, monetary statistics, and government finance statistics.



Debt and arrears strategy: In the context of the 2016 Article IV Consultation, Bank and Fund
staffs produced a joint DSA.



Poverty Analysis and Poverty Reduction Strategy: The Bank is providing TA to support the
preparation of a poverty reduction strategy as part of the implementation of Zimbabwe’s
development agenda (ZIM ASSET).

4.

The teams agreed to the following sharing of information:



The Fund team requests to be kept informed about the timing of Bank missions and about
progress in the above macro-critical structural reform areas. The Fund team also requests from
the Bank team to share outputs, as requested.

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
GROUP
(As of April 1, 2016)

A.

Overall Engagement and Strategy

The African Development Bank (AfDB) Group’s engagement in Zimbabwe, as entailed in the Country
Brief Update (2014–2016), seeks to assist the country to arrest fragility, build resilience, and
accelerate re-engagement with the international community for the socio-economic transformation
of the country. The Bank’s engagement is anchored on the government’s main economic policy
blueprint—the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (ZimAsset,
2013–2018). The Bank supports the country through basic infrastructure rehabilitation in the water
and energy sectors for inclusive service delivery; capacity building and technical assistance for
strengthening institutional governance; and private sector participation for job creation.
The engagement in these areas is strengthened through emphasis on gender and youth
empowerment, climate resilience, green growth, and provision of knowledge solutions and advisory
services to hasten the recovery process.
Despite the debt arrears situation, the Bank Group has remained engaged in Zimbabwe. As of
March 1, 2016, the Bank portfolio in Zimbabwe had 14 active operations (covering 4 investment
operations and 9 technical assistance/capacity building interventions) amounting to 124.3 million
Units of Account (UA). Of these, UA 75.9 million (61.1%) is funded by ADF grant resources,
UA 40.3 million (32.4%) by the Zimbabwe Multi Donor Trust Fund, UA5.7 million (4.7%) by an ADB
loan, UA 1.3 million (1.3%) by the African Water Facility, and Fund for African Private Sector
Assistance (FAPA) grants UA 0.7 (0.6%). In terms of sectoral distribution of the portfolio, water
supply and sanitation sector constitute 41.5%, followed by power 30.3%, multi-sector (institutional
support) 19.6%, agriculture 5.8%, social sector 2.2%, and transport sector at 0.7%.

B.

Key Interventions by the AFDB Group in Zimbabwe

Infrastructure rehabilitation and development – In 2010, the AfDB was requested by a group of
donors to establish and administer a Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Zimbabwe (MTDF or ZimFund).
The purpose of ZimFund is to contribute to early recovery and development efforts in Zimbabwe by
mobilizing donor resources, promoting donor coordination, and channel financial assistance to such
efforts. Since its inception, ZimFund has played a key role in rehabilitating targeted social
infrastructure in water and sanitation and energy sectors to ensure the country delivers basic
services, builds the necessary resilience against shocks, and overcomes fragility in the face of serious
socio-economic challenges.
Donors’ current commitments to the ZimFund amount to about US$145 million, of which
USD140.80 million has already been paid up by the contributing donors. Under the ZimFund
Phase 1 water project (US$43.61 million), physical works as well as consultancy works were

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

ZIMBABWE

completed in all the beneficiary municipalities of Harare, Chitungwiza, Chegutu, Mutare, Masvingo,
and Kwekwe. Under the Phase 1 power project (US$39.61 million), there have been three work
contracts focusing on distribution and and sub-transmission system reinforcements and the
Hwange Power Station Ash Plant Rehabilitation. ZimFund is now focusing on implementation of
Phase 2 water supply and sanitation project (US$35.99 million) targeted at Harare, Chitungwiza,
Redcliff and Ruwa as well as the energy project (partly funded to the tune of US$15.42 million).
Over and above ZimFund-financed projects in emergency infrastructure rehabilitation, the Bank
Group has been able to leverage resources, including through partnerships, to support the
rehabilitation of Kariba Dam, Bulawayo water and sanitation, and Alaska-Karoi energy security
interventions. In addition, the Bank Group, through the Africa Water Facility (AWF) Trust Fund, is
implementing a project to support the preparation of planning and technical studies for an
Integrated Urban Water Management to rehabilitate the water supply and sanitation system in
Marondera Municipality. The Bank also continues to assist the country in operationalization the
infrastructure study it prepared in 2011, supporting the preparation of the Energy and Transport
Sector Master Plans and helping develop a pool of investment specialists to prepare feasibility
studies for the bankable projects. The Bank Group’s intervention in basic infrastructure rehabilitation
is aimed at arresting fragility and building resilience through sustainable provision of service
delivery.
Support to economic and financial governance. The AfDB Group supports Zimbabwe’s economic
governance and private sector development initiatives aimed at promoting inclusive growth.
Its support consists of technical assistance, capacity building, and other types of assistance not
affected by the arrears situation. Support has been targeted at improving economic governance and
enhancing the effectiveness of public service delivery in public financial management, statistics, and
external debt management, revenue management, procurement reforms, mining sector governance,
and enhancing the Reserve Bank’s supervisory role, among others. The Bank Group’s engagement in
private sector development in Zimbabwe has been both direct and indirect. Beyond its direct
investment in Lake Harvest (Aquaculture expansion project on Lake Kariba), the AfDB Group has
supported Zimbabwe’s private sector through regional financial institutions that operate and invest
in Zimbabwe. Also, the presence of the AfDB Group in Zimbabwe, together with the Southern Africa
Resource Center, has facilitated the close follow-up of project implementation and support to
enhance the overall development impact of the Bank Group’s support.
Support to the re-engagement process – The Bank Group is also playing a key role in garnering
support for the country’s debt arrears clearance and reengagement process, collaborating with
other development partners. Following the first high-level debt forum on Zimbabwe in Tunis in 2012
hosted by the Bank Group, there has been consensus on deepened engagement by all partners
through an IMF Staff Monitored Program. As part of the re-engagement process, the Bank Group
further co-hosted a series of forums with the IMF and World Bank aimed at re-engagement, in Lima,
Washington and Tokyo. There has been strong support from the development partners for
Zimbabwe’s arrears clearance and debt relief process.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Zimbabwe—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of April 4, 2016
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has shortcomings but data are broadly adequate for surveillance. Despite recent
improvements in timeliness and coverage, there are shortcomings stemming from weak data sources,
insufficient coverage, and capacity constraints, especially in national accounts and external sector statistics.
The Zimbabwe National Statistical Agency (ZIMSTAT) has a culture of complying with international standards,
but suffers from a shortage of funding and human resources across the board following funding cuts and a
staff freeze across government departments.
National Accounts: Zimbabwe’s national accounts (NA) broadly follow the concepts and definitions of the
1993 System of National Accounts (SNA) and some recommendations of the 2008 SNA. The scope of NA
statistics is being expanded, including the compilation of quarterly national accounts. However, staff resources
are inadequate to achieve these objectives. A February 2016 STA TA mission assisted in developing a detailed
strategy for the compilation of quarterly national accounts (QNA), focusing on deriving timely QNA from
annual accounts using administrative and preliminary and partial data. With a view of expanding the coverage
and improving the accuracy of quarterly GDP, in March 2016, a mission from STA provided technical assistance
to enhance data sharing among the authorities of Zimbabwe, and in particular, between the Zimbabwe
Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) and ZIMSTAT. The mission recommended updating the memorandum of
understanding between ZIMSTAT and ZIMRA to facilitate the data exchange.
The authorities are currently working on the Poverty, Income, Consumption and Expenditure Survey (PICES)
2016/17. The survey, one of the largest carried out by ZIMSTAT, will provide data on income distribution,
consumption level, private consumption, and living conditions of the population, Consumer Price Index (CPI)
weights, production account of agriculture and poverty mapping.
Price Statistics: ZIMSTAT compiles and disseminates a monthly consumer price index (CPI), with weights
based on data from the 2011/12 Household Budget Survey (HBS) with a December 2012 base. In the new CPI,
compiled since January 2013, ZIMSTAT has also expanded the geographical coverage to include price
developments in both urban and rural areas, and increased the number of items in the basket. ZIMSTAT also
compiles and disseminates a quarterly producer price index (PPI), based on December 2009 with December
2008 weights. A 2013 STA TA mission recommended further improvements to the CPI basket by replacing
outdated products, increasing the frequency of data collection for perishable items from monthly to weekly,
and expanding PPI coverage to include exports.
Government Finance Statistics: Reporting of GFS for the central government has improved since 2009. The
Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED) collects data on revenue and expenditure, which are
published on its website on a monthly basis, along with the annual budget statements. Data on government
financing are limited but improving. The MoFED does not yet compile GFS in line with the Government Finance
Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001, but is in the process of moving to GFSM 2001, with IMF TA. Budget data are

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

ZIMBABWE

compiled only for the budgetary central government.
Monetary Statistics: The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) resumed reporting MFS to the Fund in late–2015.
The MFS data are timely and based on the new Standardized Reporting Forms (SRFs). STA has provided
feedback to the RBZ, requesting some further clarifications.
External Sector Statistics: The RBZ compiles ESS data, following BPM4 methodology. Balance of payments
and external debt statistics are subject to a number of data issues. The RBZ does not yet report any ESS data to
STA—reporting is expected to start by December this year. There is a structural break in trade data in 2010. For
years prior to 2010, the source is the Exchange Control Department of the RBZ, and for 2010 and onwards, the
source is customs data. Subsequent to IMF technical assistance in external sector assessment, the historical
current account deficit has been revised significantly downwards to reflect amongst others estimates of cash
and in-kind transfers from Zimbabweans working abroad, export of gold to neighboring countries by small
scale artisanal miners, estimated to account for 50 percent of gold exports, and adjustment to the long- and
short-term private sector external payments. Interests payments for 2014 and 2015 are reconciled with
creditors’ records are reflected as accrued interest on overdue financial obligations. The 2013 STA TA mission
identified a number of data gaps, including in international trade in services, direct investment and portfolio
investment income, idirect investment, portfolio investment, trade credit and advances. Gaps in services arose
because the BPM4 methodology does not cover all BPM6 items. A follow-up mission in 2014 provided further
training in BPM6 methodology and assisted in mapping tables from BPM4 to BPM6. Zimbabwe is part of the
IMF-UK Department for International Development (DFID) funded Enhanced Data Dissemination Initiative II
(EDDI-II) Project for Balance of Payments Module 1. With the help of DFID-EDDI2, the compilation of quarterly
balance of payments statistics on BPM6 basis is envisaged by December 2016.
International Investment Position (IIP): The compilation of the IIP is currently not possible due to the lack of
reliable information on private sector stocks of foreign assets and liabilities and due to the lack of appropriate
categorization of the available stock data into the required instruments. However, the RBZ has already started
building the basis for the IIP compilation by adjusting the survey forms to allow for collecting the integrated
data for the financial account components. Also, with the planned launch of the Foreign Private Capital (FPC)
survey valuable position data needed for the IIP compilation will be collected,
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the Enhanced General Data Dissemination System (e-GDDS) since November 1, 2002.The e-GDDS
metadata on the IMF DSBB site were last updated in April 2013.
No data ROSC is available.
III. Reporting to STA
Zimbabwe does not report NA, price, or external sector statistics to STA for dissemination in the International
Financial Statistics and the BOP Statistics Yearbook. Reporting of GFS to STA needs to be improved – the latest
annual data available for budgetary central government (tables 1-3) are for 2012, and no sub-annual data are
reported.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND THE THIRD REVIEW OF THE STAFF-MONITORED
PROGRAM—DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS

April 15, 2016

Approved By
Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf
and Catherine Pattillo (IMF)
and John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF)and the International Development
Association (IDA)

This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) confirms that Zimbabwe continues to be in debt
distress, consistent with the results of past DSAs.1 Both public and external debt ratios
remained high, and most of the external debt is in arrears. All external debt indicators
breach their indicative thresholds under the baseline scenario, and many of them stay
above the thresholds until end of the the time horizon of the analysis. Even with clearing
of arrears to the IFIs, which is expected to unlock concessional financing, Zimbabwe’s debt
burden would only marginally improve, underscoring the need for the country to follow
sound economic policies, including a prudent borrowing strategy, and to continue
garnering support for debt treatment under the Paris club.

1

This DSA was prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank staff under the joint Fund-Bank Low-Income Country
(LIC) Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF). Zimbabwe’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)
Rating averaged 2.38 for 2012-14 and falls under the weak performer category. Zimbabwe’s fiscal year runs
from January 1 to December 31.

ZIMBABWE

BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
A heavy debt burden, international sanctions, and uncertain domestic political
environments continue to weigh on economic performance. Although economic stabilization
efforts helped improve the situation, macroeconomic imbalances persist because of lack of
financing, insufficient fiscal consolidation exacerbated by looming drought and appreciating U.S.
dollar.2
2.
Zimbabwe’s external public debt burden indicators remain elevated and external debt
overhang is large. External debt is estimated at 76 percent of GDP. Both public and external debt ratios
remain at high levels with most of the external debt is in arrears. Following a debt reconciliation exercise by
the authorities for end-2014 and 2015, Zimbabwe’s total public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external
debt has been estimated at about 49 percent of GDP (US$6.96 billion), 79 percent of which is in arrears
(Table 1). Moreover, the country continues to accumulate arrears. The recent fall in mineral prices has
exacerbated Zimbabwe’s external position. In 2015, in line with the SMP, the authorities borrowed abroad
for development projects on non-concessional terms with an average grant element of 26 percent and
external (public and publicly guaranteed) debt increased by US$239 million.

3.
The Zimbabwean authorities have taken steps to exit debt distress by pressing ahead with
their reengagement efforts with the international community, with the immediate objective of resolving
arrears with the IMF, the WBG, and the AfDB. The plan involves clearing the country’s external arrears to the
three IFIs through a combination of the country’s own resources, bridge financing from a regional financial
institution, and a long-term loan from a bilateral creditor. The strategy received support from creditors and
development partners during a meeting in Lima, Peru in October 2015. As part of their arrear clearance
strategy, the authorities have started formulating an ambitious medium-term economic transformation
program to turn around the economy.
4.
The stock of public domestic debt is not high, at an estimated 13.8 percent of GDP at end2015. However, it is evolving. While the domestic debt of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has been
gradually shrinking, the stock of the outstanding government securities has expanded, following the end of
hyperinflation. While short-term domestic public debt has declined, the government has managed to place
securities with maturities of one year or more in the market. Arrears on domestic debt are declining but
remain substantial, representing an additional concern for overall risk of public debt distress.

5.
The macroeconomic framework underpinning the medium-term to long-term debt
sustainability takes into account recent economic developments and progress in structural reforms
identified in the Staff Monitored Program. The framework takes into account impact of recent
slowdown in South Africa, main trading partner, and appreciation of the U.S. dollar. The baseline assumes
no debt relief and limited external borrowing from non-traditional creditors, particularly China (See Box 1).
Any financing gap in the balance of payment is assumed to be closed through short-term private sector
external borrowing.

Box 1. Zimbabwe: Key Macroeconomic Assumptions 2016–36 (Baseline)1
The baseline scenario assumptions are informed by discussion with the authorities’ reform plans.
Real Sector: The real GDP growth rate is expected to gradually increase to 4 percent until 2021
lower growth at the beginning of the period (1.4 percent in 2016) and then to average 4 percent
over 2022–36. Medium term real GDP growth mainly reflects strengthening of the agriculture,
financial services and mining sectors. Inflation, as measured by GDP deflator, is projected to be
close to zero in the near term, but will rise moderately over the medium term; it averages 2 percent
in 2018–35.
Fiscal sector: The fiscal deficit is projected to improve over the medium term, reflecting a
combination of improvements in tax revenue collection, and containment of current spending,
including a gradual reduction in wage bill. Over the long run, the fiscal accounts are expected to be
broadly balanced. Beyond 2025, increases in capital spending will generate a return to small primary
deficits.
External sector: The current account deficit is expected to improve slightly over the medium term,
reaching 9.7 percent of GDP by end of projection period, reflecting moderate growth in mineral and
exports and improvement in commodity prices. The current account deficit will be financed by
external loans to the private sector, foreign direct investment, limited non-concessional borrowing
from non-traditional creditors, and continued accumulation of external debt arrears, in line with
recent trend. External grants are assumed to remain confined to humanitarian assistance, estimated
around 1 percent of GDP per year.
External debt: Reflecting continued limited access to international finance and a deteriorating debt
service capacity, disbursements of new loans from non-traditional creditors are expected to be
limited, at about 1 percent of GDP during 2017–36, in exchange they will continue making regular
payments to the same creditors. It is also assumed that they will continue to make token payments
to the WBG, IMF, AfDB and EIB. Under the baseline scenario there is no debt relief. External arrears
are assumed to continue to be rolled over and that Zimbabwe will continue not to service
obligations arising from the stock of arrears.

B. Debt Burden Thresholds under the Debt Sustainability Framework
6.
Zimbabwe’s external debt stock remains unsustainable under the baseline scenario (Figure 1
and Table 1). The public external debt outlook is expected to improve slightly but remains very high. All
PPG external debt level ratios continue to breach their respective indicative thresholds and many of those

ZIMBABWE

remain above the thresholds for most of the 20-year projection period.3 The present value (PV) of PPG
external debt is at 59 percent of GDP at end-2015—twice the 30 percent threshold for weak policy
performers—and is projected to stay above 30 percent of GDP for the large part of the projection period.
Similarly, both the PV of debt-to-exports and the PV of debt-to-revenue ratios are above 200 and
300 percent respectively in 2015, well above their respective thresholds. Although these ratios are projected
to improve based on the assumptions of robust growth and limited external borrowing over the medium
to long run, such improvements are insufficient to bring debt to sustainable levels in the medium-term. The
authorities report that the private sector is by and large current on its external obligations.
7.
In addition, Zimbabwe’s debt outlook can get worse in the face of a range of shocks
(Figure 1 and Table 2). Stress tests highlight the possibility of an even worse debt outlook. The results
indicate that all debt burden indicators worsen across all simulations, with debt path increasing steeply,
leading to an even larger debt and debt-service burden.
8.
The consideration of domestic debt does not alter fundamentally the assessment of
Zimbabwe’s debt sustainability. Public DSA results mirrors those of the external DSA (Figure 2 and
Table 3). Given the moderate size of Zimbabwe’s domestic debt, the public debt indicators are driven
mainly by the external debt component. As a result PV of public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to stay well
above the indicative benchmark until 2035.

C. Alternative Scenario (Clearance of arrears with the IFIs)
9.
The alternative scenario presents the current authorities plan to clear the country’s external
arrears as a first step towards normalizing relations with creditors. The strategy entails simultaneously
clearing arrears to the IMF, WNG and AfDB through a combination of the country’s own resources, bridge
financing from a regional financial institution, and a long-term loan from a bilateral creditor. The strategy
also envisages accelerating an ambitious structural reform that would see the economy catching up for the
lost decades. The macroeconomic framework underpinning the medium-term to long-term debt
sustainability in the alternative scenario is presented in Box 2.
10.
The results from the alternative scenario do not alter fundamentally the assessment of
Zimbabwe’s debt sustainability. Even with clearing of arrears to the IFIs, which is expected to unlock
concessional financing, Zimbabwe’s debt burden would only marginally improve (Figures 3 and 4). This
underscores the need for Zimbabwe to follow sound economic policies, continue garnering support for
treatment under the Paris Club, avoid selective debt servicing, and minimize non-concessional borrowing.

3

For the purpose of defining debt burden thresholds under the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF), Zimbabwe is
classified a weak policy performer. Zimbabwe’s rating on the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) is 2.38.

ZIMBABWE

Box 2. Zimbabwe: Key Macroeconomic Assumptions 2016–36 (Alternative) 1
The Alternative scenario assumes clearing of arrears to the three IFI’s at end-2016 as
envisaged in the authorities’ stated reengagement strategy.
Real Sector: The real GDP growth rate is expected to initially increase to 9.5 in 2017 and
8.9 in 2018 and converges to 6 percent over 2022–36. Medium-term real GDP growth
mainly reflects strengthening of the construction, financial and mining sectors as a result
of capital inflows from foreign and domestic investments and further boosting of
activities in manufacturing. These would expect to raise potential growth from 4 percent
in the baseline to 6 percent. Inflation, as measured by GDP deflator, is projected to be
the same as in the baseline.
Fiscal sector: It is assumed that the wage bill in the medium term is assumed to be kept
at the 2016 level and rationalization of public employment cost would significantly
increase fiscal space for a larger capital expenditure. Higher economic growth and
revenue mobilization efforts are projected to more than compensate for the decline in
income tax, improving revenue collection over the long run.
External sector: The current account deficit is expected to widen over the medium term
financed by increased foreign direct investment as well as domestic investment. The
deficit is projected to average 9.2 percent of GDP over the 2022–36 projection periods.
In 2016, it is assumed disbursement of $219 million and 536 million from IDA and AfDB
respectively in 2016 as part of clearing arrears operation and further disbursement of
one percent of GDP concessional financing from IFIs’ would replace the
non-concessional borrowing assumed in the baseline. New non-concessional borrowing
from a bilateral creditor in 2016 for clearing part of the arrears to the WB in the amount
of US$ 831 million with 5 percent interest rate and 10 years to maturity, all amounts to
be paid at the end of the period. Use of SDR allocation to clear arrears to the IMF is also
assumed. External grants are assumed to remain at around 1 percent of GDP per year.
This scenario assumes there is no debt relief, hence External arrears to bilateral creditors
are assumed to continue to be rolled over.

CONCLUSIONS
11.
Zimbabwe continues to be in debt distress and continues to accumulate external arrears.
The results of this DSA are broadly unchanged from those in previous DSAs with both public and external
debt ratios remaining high, and most of the external debt is in arrears. Public debt is also distressed, driven
mostly by external debt.
12.
Under the alternative scenario with clearing of arrears to the IFIs, which is expected to
eventually unlock concessional financing, Zimbabwe’s debt burden would only marginally
improve. With the exception of PV of debt-to-revenue ratios, all public and public-guaranteed
external debt burden ratios remain well above their respective indicative thresholds in the medium
term. This underscores the need for the Zimbabwe to follow sound economic policies, including a
prudent borrowing strategy, and to continue garnering support for debt treatment under the Paris
club.
13.
The authorities generally concur with the results and assessments of the DSA. They
agree that external debt is at unsustainable levels, debt service burdens are beyond Zimbabwe’s
debt servicing capacity, and as a result Zimbabwe continues to accumulate external debt arrears.
They agree that they would need to put all efforts to secure debt treatment under the Paris Club in
order to sustain the momentum for economic development, and remain hopeful that resolving all
arrears, including to the bilateral creditors in the near future. In this regard, the authorities intend to
continue their efforts to reach out to creditors.

Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Includes provisions for implicit contingent liabilities which are not included in the PPG debt stock reported in Tables 1 and 2 of the Staff Report.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by Ms. Kapwepwe, Executive Director and
Mr. Sitima-wina, Senior Advisor on Zimbabwe
May 2, 2016

Introduction and Context
Our Zimbabwean authorities appreciate the continued engagement with the Fund and thank
staff for the constructive discussions during the recent Article IV mission in Harare, and the
reviews of the Staff Monitored Program (SMP). The authorities agree with the assessment of
the staff report and also broadly concur with the analysis of the challenges facing the
Zimbabwean economy, especially on the need to continue with the transformation agenda and
on the importance of external financing.
Fund support has played a critical role in efforts to transform the economy and normalize
relations with the international community. Against this background, Zimbabwe has made
considerable progress through a strong performance under the SMP, formulated a reengagement strategy which has received broad support from creditors and development
partners. In addition, the authorities are pursuing key policies and structural reforms to
stabilize the macroeconomic environment and spur sustainable and inclusive growth.
The country’s output is increasingly constrained by infrastructure bottlenecks in electricity,
water, transport and the high cost of capital. This situation has been further exacerbated by
the impact of the El-Niño-induced drought. Nevertheless, our authorities remain committed to
their medium-term economic transformation agenda which, among others, addresses these
bottlenecks. However, the success of the economic transformation program remains at risk if
access to external financing continues to be limited. In this context, our authorities’ top
priority is to achieve full re-engagement with the international community as soon as
practical and unlock external financial flows.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
In light of inadequate external inflows, lower commodity prices, the dollar appreciation, and
the El-Niño-induced drought, the economic situation has continued to be challenging. The
drought could worsen the poverty levels which were at 72 percent in 2012. Overall, economic
growth for 2015 has been revised significantly from an earlier projection of 3.2
percent down to 1.5 percent in September 2015 and most recently to 1.1 percent following
further declines in agricultural production, mining and manufacturing sectors. The decline in
water levels has adversely affected hydropower generation and crop production, and resulted

2
in a decimation of livestock herds. In some parts of the country, higher rainfall totals were
registered so the loss of cattle was limited. In the Southern parts of the country, however, the
impact of the drought was more severe and cattle farmers incurred devastating losses. In
2016, growth is estimated at 1.4 percent, while inflation is projected to remain in negative
territory, only picking up over the medium term.
While this projected growth is still too low to ensure sustainable development and poverty
reduction, the authorities are taking bold policy reforms to bring growth to a higher
trajectory. For instance, recognizing that the contribution of the mining sector is crucial to
Zimbabwe’s long term growth prospects, the authorities have taken steps to increase
transparency and accountability in the diamond sector. In this respect, they have established
Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Corporation (ZCDC) to, among other functions, trace
diamond mining from extraction to sales and to transfer of proceeds.
In spite of growing spending pressures, the authorities remain committed to fiscal discipline.
The primary fiscal deficit (on a cash basis) at end December 2015 was lower than
programmed despite the high employment costs for the public sector. Employment costs
continue to be the main source of fiscal pressure consuming about 82 percent of all revenues.
In 2016, this will be compounded by the need to import maize to meet food security for 3
million vulnerable people following the El-Niño-induced drought. It is expected that the
pressure from employment costs will dissipate with the continued implementation of public
service reforms in the broader context of public expenditure rationalization.
The current account balance improved in 2015 on account of lower oil prices, weak
economic activity and fiscal consolidation efforts. It is expected to narrow in 2016, but
remain high over the medium term.
The Zimbabwean authorities have also made remarkable progress in strengthening the
financial sector and restoring confidence following the various measures taken by the
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ). Banking sector conditions have improved and all banks
now maintain capital buffers above the minimum requirements. NPLs have declined to 10
percent at end December 2015 from 21 percent at end September 2014. The authorities
remain committed to the multi-currency regime in the short-to-medium term.
Performance under the SMP
With support from the private sector, civil society and the general public, the authorities’
commitment has been instrumental in ensuring that the SMP remained on track despite the
substantial economic and financial challenges. Amid rising challenges, the Zimbabwean
authorities have continued to meet all their commitments under the Staff–Monitored Program
(SMP), through each successive review.
This third and last review is no exception. All the quantitative targets for end-December 2015
regarding the floor on the primary cash balance and the net international reserves target were
met with comfortable margins. The floor on protected social spending, the target for Poverty
Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) payments, and the ceiling on non-concessional debt
were also met. All three structural benchmarks for the third review relating to the financial

3
sector; amendments to the Public Financial Management (PFM) and Procurement Acts; and
the investment climate were also met. The benchmark on investment climate entailed
publication of guidelines on implementation of the indigenization policy.
During the 15 months SMP period, the authorities have also made remarkable progress in a
number of other areas including:
 Recapitalization of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) through the debt
assumption bill;
 Amendment of the Reserve Bank and Banking Acts;
 Establishment of the Zimbabwe Asset Management Corporation (Private) Limited
(ZAMCO) to tackle the high level of nonperforming loans (NPLs);
 Amendment of the Labor Act;
 Development of a strategy for reducing the public service wage bill; and
 Instituted reforms to the fiscal regime for the mining sector.
Current and Medium Term Reforms and Policies
As the staff report notes, Zimbabwe’s deteriorating economic conditions reinforce the
urgency to move forward and implement comprehensive ambitious reforms to transform the
economy, and to advance the re-engagement process. Clearly, without external financial
support, the reform efforts cannot be sustained. Instead, they might impose an unbearable
burden on a population that is already facing increasingly severe economic and social
challenges. Against this background, the authorities have pro-actively designed policies
geared at transforming the economy whose key priorities include:
(i) Fiscal discipline and expenditure rationalization away from employment costs toward
development and social spending to restore fiscal sustainability supported by strengthened
public financial management (PFM), enhanced revenue administration, and acceleration of
SOE reforms. In this area, the Public Service Commission already finalized audits covering
about 50 percent of public service employees and authorities have started to implement
measures to, among others, eliminate duplications and redundancies, rationalize posts, revise
leave policy and reduce employment costs which would result in a lower wage bill for 2016.
In the period ahead, the authorities aim to maintain total wage costs unchanged in nominal
terms until 2019. Other commissions will also perform audits and propose recommendations
to rationalize employment. Forensic and performance audits are being conducted on most of
the ten largest SOEs targeted for priority action and employments costs have already been
reduced in a number of them.
(ii) Further enhancing financial stability and depth to ensure that the financial sector plays
its role in savings mobilization and investment and contribute to economic development. The
levels of financial inclusion in Zimbabwe improved markedly from 60 percent in 2011 to 77
percent in 2014 placing Zimbabwe among the highest levels of financial inclusion in SSA.
Thus to further facilitate inclusive growth, the authorities launched the national financial
inclusion strategy in early March 2016;
(iii) Tackling the external arrears and advancing the re-engagement process to allow the
country to eventually access external financing. Accordingly, to clear the external arrears to

4
the IFIs, the authorities’ strategy presented in Lima seeks to: a) obtain bridge financing from
Afriexim bank to repay arrears to the AfDB, the African Development Fund, and IDA; b) get
a long-term loan from a bilateral creditor to repay the IBRD; and c) use of SDR holdings to
clear the arrears to the Fund; d) request debt treatment from the Paris Club; d) request a Fund
Financial supported program;
(iv) Enhancing agricultural productivity. In this area policy measures are focusing on land
reforms and addressing bottlenecks in the agricultural sector particularly on security of
tenure, compensation of former famers, irrigation and infrastructure rehabilitation and
development. Presently, the authorities are working on measures to improve the security of
tenure for resettled farmers which will lead to issuance of permits and tradable lease
agreements. In addition, they are working on a program to compensate former farmers and
will spearhead a comprehensive irrigation program aimed at supporting national food selfsufficiency.
(v) Addressing structural weaknesses to boost Zimbabwe’s growth potential. Given that the
Zimbabwe economy is operating below capacity, the authorities are taking steps to address
constraints to growth especially in infrastructure—electricity, water, transport; unavailability
and high cost of long-term capital; and high cost of doing business. On doing business, the
reported recent political situation has reasonably stabilized and the authorities plan to, among
other measures, establish a one-stop investment centre. They already published the new
framework, procedures and guidelines for implementing the indigenization policy on the
Zimbabwe Investment Authority (ZIA) in January 2016, as part of the structural benchmarks
under the SMP.
Update on the Indigenization and Economic Empowerment
In addition, in order to address conflicting positions in interpretation, President Mugabe, in a
recent gazetted statement further clarified that the Indigenization and Economic
Empowerment Policy is sector specific and will, thus be implemented differently across four
economic sectors namely: Natural Resources Sector; Non-Resources Sector; Financial Sector;
and Reserved Sector.
In order to ensure that the Natural Resources are exploited in a manner that safeguards the
best interest of the country’s current and future generations, in terms of the Policy,
Government and/or its designated entities will hold a 51% stake in businesses in the Natural
Resources Sector, with the remaining 49%, belonging to the partnering foreign investor(s).
The policy also provides for exceptions in compliance where government does not have 51%
ownership.
On Non-Resource Sectors, it is expected that businesses in this sector should exhibit
socially and economically desirable strategic objectives that contribute towards the turnaround and sustainable socio-economic transformation of the economy of Zimbabwe. Thus
the businesses should, among other things, aim to ensure beneficiation of raw materials for
the purposes of value addition and exporting; and transfer of appropriate technology to
Zimbabwe for the purpose of enhancing productivity; and creation of employment.

5
With regard to the Financial Services Sector, the banking sector shall continue to fall under
the ambit of the Banking Act, which is regulated by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, and the
insurance sector under the auspices of the Provident and Insurance Act. This policy position
is essential for the promotion of financial sector stability, confidence and financial inclusion.
These institutions will, nonetheless, be expected to make their contributions by way of
financing facilities for key economic sectors and projects, employee share ownership
schemes, linkage programs and such other financial empowerment facilities as may be
introduced by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, from time to time.
Businesses under the Reserved Sector category are reserved for Zimbabwean entrepreneurs
with the exception of existing businesses. The Reserved Sector category includes businesses
such as specific categories in Transportation; Retail and Wholesale Trade; Grain Milling; and
Tobacco Processing.
Cooperation and Financial Obligations to IFIs
To date, Zimbabwe continues to make efforts to cooperate with the Fund on policies and
payments, and to make good use of technical assistance (TA). The authorities continue to
make the agreed $150,000 monthly payment to the PRGT, the increased pari passu payments
to the World Bank and AfDB, and token payments to the European Investment Bank. The
authorities have committed to increase payments to the IFIs as their payment capacity
increases. In addition, Zimbabwe continues to benefit from targeted Fund TA to address
policy challenges, strengthen institutional capacity, and support its ongoing reform efforts.
Thus, the authorities’ intend to proceed with the re-engagement process based on the strategy
that was presented in Lima and received support from creditors and development partners.
Currently, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in the World Bank is preparing
proposals for possible investments in Zimbabwe that could be reviewed by its management
over the coming months.
In addition, on April 20, 2016, the Board of Directors of the African Development Bank
(AfDB) approved a US $25-million Trade Finance Line of Credit facility to Central Africa
Building Society (CABS) of Zimbabwe. This medium-term facility will help to support the
expansion of CABS’ operations as a provider of trade finance to local firms as well as Small
and Medium-sized enterprises within Zimbabwe’s tradable sector.
Conclusion and Next Steps
On the basis of the strong performance under the SMP, the authorities’ demonstrated
commitment to sound macroeconomic policy management, the policy intentions described in
the Letter of Intent, and the far-reaching economic transformation agenda, we believe that
our authorities’ have built a solid foundation for a path to full re- engagement, including
clearance of arrears to the IFIs, a Fund-financial arrangement, and debt treatment under the
Paris Club.
Our authorities are committed to repay the arrears to the IFIs as they take steps to normalize
relations with all creditors and anticipate that this will eventually culminate into a financial
arrangement with the Fund. They further expect that as soon as the arrears are settled, the

6
process to consider removal of the remaining remedial measures which would include
restoration of Zimbabwe’s eligibility to the PRGT will be effected.
Our authorities count on the Executive Board’s support in this process. The support of this
institution, and its ability to catalyze other creditors, will be even more crucial in the period
ahead as the country consolidates the commendable progress made this far in pursuance of its
objectives to achieve sustained economic development, reduce poverty, and improve living
conditions for the people of Zimbabwe.
