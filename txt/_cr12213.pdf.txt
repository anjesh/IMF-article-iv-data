STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

July 12, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: The recovery continues to be tepid, employment remains well below precrisis levels, and the housing market is stabilizing but is still at depressed levels.
Downside risks around the outlook have intensified, including from the worsening of
the euro area debt crisis as well as the uncertainty over domestic fiscal plans.
Short-term policy challenges: Fiscal deficit reduction should proceed at a measured
pace, to avoid undermining the fragile recovery. Monetary policy remains appropriately
accommodative, with room for some further easing if the outlook were to deteriorate.
Authorities’ measures to boost the housing market are a step in the right direction,
with scope for a more aggressive implementation to speed up the housing adjustment.
Medium-term policy challenges: A credible fiscal consolidation plan including
entitlement reforms and higher revenues is crucial for stable medium-term growth, and
would allow more room for short-run fiscal policy maneuver. More resources should be
devoted to active labor market policies, including those aimed at the long-term
unemployed, to prevent long-term unemployment from becoming structural. There has
been good progress over the past year in implementing the Dodd-Frank Act, but more
remains to be done to increase the resilience of the U.S. financial system.
Spillovers: Striking the right balance between fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic
policy support would benefit the rest of the world, as it would avoid the risk of a spike
in U.S. interest rates in the medium term and an abrupt decline in U.S. growth next
year, at a particularly delicate juncture for the world economy. Further monetary easing
may weaken the U.S. dollar, but would have positive spillovers from strengthening the
U.S. economy and hedging against downside risks.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED STATES

BACKDROP: STILL A FRAGILE RECOVERY
1.
The U.S. economy continues to recover at a tepid pace. After rebounding in the second
half of 2011, growth has decelerated to around 2 percent in the first half of 2012. Job creation,
surprisingly strong at the end of 2011 and in early 2012, has also slowed considerably since April.
The deceleration reflects in part a return to the sluggish growth rates that tend to characterize the
aftermath of financial crises and housing busts. It is also likely to reflect a number of other factors:








Continued fiscal withdrawal and less
favorable external conditions;
Seasonal adjustment issues following the
Great Recession, which may have made the
data for the fall and winter quarters look
strong relative to the spring, a pattern also
seen over the last two years;
The unusually mild winter, which may have
pulled forward some activity into late 2011–
early 2012;

The boom in gasoline prices between
November and February—which reversed after April—may have weighed on private
consumption in the spring.

2.
Strong headwinds persist on private consumption, as households continue to
deleverage amid weak—albeit stabilizing—house prices. For the U.S. household sector as a
whole, the net worth-to-disposable income ratio is now slightly above its pre-housing boom levels,
largely thanks to the recovery of financial asset valuations. However, these primarily affect upper
income groups, and the majority of U.S. households are still left with net-worth ratios well below
pre-boom levels, reflecting depressed house prices and elevated debt. Indeed, staff research finds
that middle-income households, whose balance sheets were hurt severely by the housing bust, have
made limited progress in increasing their net worth through saving (Selected Issues Paper
Chapter I). Reflecting the ongoing repair of balance sheets and tight credit conditions for
households, the growth of private consumption remains sluggish, broadly in line with weak growth
in incomes.1 House prices have recently shown some signs of stabilization, with the three main
house price indices increasing in February, March, and April. However, the risk of further declines
remains significant, given the large “shadow” inventory—properties that are likely to end up in

and saving have been subject to large revisions over the past year.

distressed sales (Figure 1).2 Foreclosures impose high costs on the economy, including through their
adverse impact on house prices and the resulting decline in households’ wealth and consumption.
Households’ access to credit remains tight, as weak house prices and broader economic conditions
weigh on their creditworthiness (Box 1). Recent actions by the GSEs to expand access to refinancing
could ease access to mortgages, and give some support to households’ disposable income and
spending.
3.
Residential construction has been improving, but from very depressed levels. The
number of housing starts, a major component in residential investment, has been rising since
2011Q3, with starts in 2012Q1 more than 20 percent higher than a year earlier (Figure 2). The
recovery is more evident in the multi-family sector, reflecting relatively higher demand for rental
units as the homeownership ratio continues to decline toward its pre-bubble levels. However,
housing starts remain at only about one half of their 1990s average. Persistently weak construction
activity is due to the overbuilding during the boom years and depressed household formation since
the crisis. Staff estimates that, despite four years of very low residential construction activity, there is
still an excess supply of housing that will be absorbed gradually as household formation normalizes
(Selected Issues, Chapter II).
4.
Business fixed investment seems to have lost some momentum, despite
extraordinarily low borrowing costs and relatively favorable financial conditions facing the
corporate sector. Indeed, cash-rich firms are tapping bond markets at very low rates, enjoying
easier access to bank credit, and have profit margins at historically high levels. The deceleration that
started in 2011Q4, following an uptick in 2011Q3, has been fairly broad-based. It likely reflects, in
part, the partial phasing out of accelerated depreciation tax incentives in January 2012, which may
have pulled equipment purchases forward into the second half of 2011. However, uncertainties
surrounding the future tax regime and the economic outlook—given the financial strains in the euro
area and risks surrounding fiscal policies at home—may also have played a role.
5.
Net exports failed to add to growth over the last two quarters. Imports rebounded over
2011Q4 and 2012Q1 after a slowdown associated with the Japanese earthquake’s disruptions in
mid-2011. Exports, which had been a bright spot in the recovery, decelerated through 2011, in line
with generally lower growth in foreign demand. Their rebound in 2012Q1 is likely to be temporary,
as evidenced by weak exports in April and May. The 7 percent real appreciation of the dollar
between its multi-decade trough in July 2011 and June 2012—driven by a flight to U.S. dollar
assets—may also have contributed to slower export growth (Figure 3). Reflecting also sharply higher
oil prices, the current account deficit edged up to 3.1 percent of GDP in 2011 and widened further in
2012Q1 to 3.6 percent of GDP.

2

The “shadow” inventory includes underwater, delinquent, re-performing and Real Estate Owned (REO) properties.
The latter are properties owned by a lender or guarantor—typically a bank or a government sponsored agency—
after an unsuccessful foreclosure auction. Re-performing loans are loans that were previously delinquent but have
become current following a modification.

6.
Fiscal policy is also weighing on growth, as the fiscal impulse turned negative in 2011
for the first time since the financial crisis. The U.S. general government deficit, at about
9½ percent of GDP in 2011, remains one of the highest among major advanced economies,
reflecting both cyclical weakness and a supportive structural stance. However, for the first time since
the onset of Great Recession, the fiscal impulse was negative last year—the general government
structural primary deficit fell by ¾ percent of GDP, in part due to stronger-than-expected revenues.
Fiscal policy remained a drag on growth also in 2012Q1 as defense spending declined with the
ongoing withdrawal of overseas troops, state and local governments continued to downsize, and
corporate investment incentives were scaled back. Meanwhile, policymakers have provided support
to the weak recovery by extending the payroll tax cut and emergency unemployment benefits
through 2012.
7.
The Fed responded to weaker-than-expected growth over the past year with a number
of easing actions. With the federal funds rate at its lower bound of zero, it used innovative tools:


The FOMC started to provide more explicit guidance on the path of the federal funds rate,
announcing in August 2011 that it anticipated economic conditions to warrant exceptionally low
levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013. Since January 2012, it has stated that
economic conditions were likely to warrant low rates at least through late 2014.



In September 2011, the Fed launched “Operation Twist,” comprising purchases of up to
$400 billion in Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6–30 years and sales of an equal
amount of securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less, to be completed by June 2012.
In addition, to support mortgage market conditions, it started reinvesting principal payments on
agency debt and MBS into agency MBS.



On June 20, 2012 the Fed announced that it would continue through end-2012 its program to
extend the average maturity of its securities holdings. This will entail sales or redemptions of
about $267 billion in shorter-term securities, and purchases of longer-maturity Treasury
securities of an equal amount, by the end of 2012. Once the maturity extension program is
completed, the Federal Reserve will hold almost no securities maturing through January 2016

Notes: The “rule-based rate” is the federal funds rate (FFR) predicted by a Taylor-Rudebusch rule (estimated by regressing the
FFR on the inflation rate and the deviation of the unemployment from the NAIRU). The “effective rate” is the actual FFR
adjusted for the easing provided through the Fed’s securities holdings. See Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Economic
Letter, 2010-18, for more details.

8.
These actions are estimated to have reduced yields on ten-year Treasuries by some
60 basis points, supporting economic activity (Box 2). Commonly-used elasticities would suggest
the policy-driven 60 basis point decline in the ten-year Treasury yield to be equivalent to a federal
funds rate easing of some 150 basis points, with a growth impact of roughly 0.3 percentage points
for each of the next two years.3 The impact of these policy actions has gone beyond the effect on
the term premium in longer-maturity Treasury yields: they seem to have postponed market
expectations of the start of policy tightening and to have lowered mortgage interest rates, albeit by
less than the decline in Treasury and MBS yields.4 Staff estimates that changes in the size and
composition of the Fed’s balance sheet provides at present an amount of “effective easing” broadly
consistent with the historical relationship between the federal fund rate and inflation and the
unemployment gap (the Rudebusch-Taylor rule).

9.
The transmission of the massive drop in longterm interest rates to aggregate demand has been
hampered by obstacles to refinancing in the
mortgage market. While under normal conditions a
large decline in interest rates would lead to very
significant mortgage refinancing, increasing disposable
income and spending, high loan-to-value ratios, tighter
credit standards, and rigidities in the mortgage market
have prevented this from happening.

For instance, in May 2012 30-year fixed mortgage interest rates were about 80 basis points lower than their May

10.
The degree of resource slack in the U.S. economy remains ample. The output gap
remains wide, even though staff has lowered its estimate of potential GDP relative to last year,
reflecting lower estimates of trend TFP and labor force participation.5 Staff’s current estimate of the
output gap for 2012, a sizable 4.1 percent of potential output, is nonetheless larger than projected
one year ago since the downward revision to potential output is more than offset by lower actual
output. The pattern of growth since the crisis thus far is in line with the historical experience of
advanced economies after financial crises, with a persistent deviation of output from the pre-crisis
trend (Selected Issues, Chapter III).
11.
The employment-to-population ratio has recovered only modestly after its sharp
decline in 2008–09, and long-term unemployment remains stubbornly high. The overall
increase in employment since the start of the recovery was barely stronger than the increase in
population, implying only a small improvement in the employment-to-population ratio, which
remains about 4 percentage points below its level in December 2007. Meanwhile, the labor force
participation rate has remained on a downward trend. The sluggish rise in the labor force, together
with the moderate increase in employment, enabled a drop of about 1 percentage point in the
unemployment rate over the last year, despite GDP growth only moderately above potential
(Figure 4). Over 40 percent of the unemployed have been out of work for over six months—marking
a record length and level for the United States. While unemployment remains primarily of a cyclical
nature, a large and persistent pool of long-term unemployed individuals raises the concern of skill
losses and a lower labor force participation rate over the medium term (Selected Issues, Chapter IV).
12.
The sizeable economic slack and well-anchored expectations have contained price and
wage inflation. Headline consumer price inflation increased to a peak of 3.8 percent in September
2011 due to rising commodity prices, but it has steadily declined since, to 1.7 percent in May 2012,
as oil prices have receded (Figure 5). Core consumer price inflation has hovered around 2 percent,
market- and survey-based measures of long-term inflation expectations remain stable, and the
January 2012 announcement by the Federal Reserve of a formal 2 percent inflation goal should help
keep inflation expectations well-anchored. Amid elevated labor market slack, wage inflation has
remained subdued throughout the recovery, and stood at 1.4 percent (year-on-year) in May 2012.

5

The downward revision to trend TFP reflects the downward revision of actual output. Staff revised downward its
projection of the labor force participation rate based on evidence suggesting that the older workers that have
dropped out of the work-force since the recession are unlikely to come back.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
13.
Growth is likely to remain moderate in the next two years, constrained by household
deleveraging, fiscal restraint, and subpar global demand. Staff projects growth of 2 percent in
2012, and a modest acceleration to 2.3 percent in 2013. Underlying these forecasts are the following
assumptions:


Households are projected to continue the process of balance sheet repair. House prices are
expected to bottom out around mid-2012 and increase very slowly thereafter, thus providing
limited support to household net worth. Bank credit conditions, which are still tight for
households and small businesses, are expected to continue to ease slowly. Consequently,
consumption growth is projected to remain subdued (Figure 6).



The fiscal sector is expected to act as a moderate brake on growth. The general government
(GG) structural primary balance is projected to improve by 1 percent of GDP in 2012, subtracting
about ½ percentage point from growth. The fiscal outlook for 2013 is highly uncertain given the
large number of expiring tax provisions and the threat of automatic spending cuts (the so-called
“sequester”) in the context of highly polarized politics. Staff’s baseline envisages a relatively
modest reduction in the GG structural primary balance in 2013 (1¼ percent of GDP), largely on
account of expiring stimulus measures, such as the payroll tax cut, and a decline in war-related
spending. The expiring Bush tax cuts and other revenue provisions are assumed to be extended
fully for one year, with the tax cuts for upper-income taxpayers assumed to expire from 2014.
The automatic spending cuts triggered by the failure of Congressional Committee on Deficit
Reduction last November are expected to be replaced by other back-loaded measures.



Monetary conditions are expected to remain accommodative, with the tightening of policy rates
beginning around late 2014 and a gradual unwinding of the Fed’s securities holdings starting in
early 2014, as the recovery slowly gains traction.



Private investment in equipment and software is projected to expand at a slower pace than at
the early stages of the recovery, but will remain a strong contributor to growth. After six
consecutive years of negative contributions to growth, residential investment is projected to
start adding to growth from 2012 onwards.



A stronger dollar and weaker global demand are projected to weigh on exports, with net
international trade subtracting from growth over 2012–2017. Weaker oil prices will partly offset
the negative impact of the dollar appreciation and weaker foreign demand on the current
account.



Headline and core inflation are projected to remain subdued, reaching the Federal Reserve’s
2 percent medium-term goal only in the medium term, thanks to a large output gap, weaker
energy prices, and well anchored inflation expectations.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT



UNITED STATES

The unemployment rate is projected to decline only slowly to 7.9 percent in 2013, as the
economy is projected to grow modestly above potential through next year and the labor force
participation rate is expected to stabilize. Long-term unemployment, which lags aggregate
unemployment, will likely remain elevated.

14.
Risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside. Risks are both external, particularly
from a worsening of global conditions from the euro area debt crisis, and domestic, particularly from
an impasse on the debt ceiling and a failure to reach an agreement on near-term tax and spending
policies, which would trigger a “fiscal cliff”. Over the medium term, a failure to adopt a plan that
would help achieve fiscal sustainability would also raise risks.

An intensification of the euro area debt crisis would weigh on U.S. growth. While U.S.
financial institutions have limited direct claims on the euro area periphery, their claims on the core
euro area and the United Kingdom are sizeable. A worsening of the euro area debt crisis that
involves these economies may thus affect the United States, through a variety of channels:

The trade channel. Lower demand in the euro area would reduce U.S. exports to the region
(which account for about 15 percent of overall U.S. exports or 2 percent of GDP). In addition,
renewed financial turmoil in the euro area would likely be accompanied by some U.S. dollar
appreciation on safe haven flows, implying a further drag to exports. For example, a two
percentage point drop in euro area growth (similar to the downward revision to euro area
growth projections for 2012–13 between the September 2011 and January 2012 WEO)
accompanied by a 5 percent real effective appreciation of the dollar (as occurred between
August and December 2011) could reduce U.S. GDP by between ¾ and 1 percentage point over
a two-year horizon.



Risks of generalized market contagion. The intensification of financial turmoil in the euro area
could spill over to the U.S. via a generalized increase in risk aversion and lower asset prices, even
though safe haven flows would likely reduce yields on safe assets, thereby offsetting part of the
rise in corporate bond spreads. While the changes in U.S. financial conditions that would occur
under intensified euro area turmoil are highly uncertain, a bout of financial stress similar to that
observed during the deterioration of the euro area crisis between July and November 2011
could reduce U.S. real GDP by about 0.6 percentage point over two years.6



Pressure on money market mutual funds (MMMFs). MMMFs have been major investors in the
liabilities of euro area banks. Although the exposure of prime MMMFs to the core euro area has
halved over the last year and its maturity shortened, it remains material. Distress in one of the
large euro area banks to which the MMMFs are exposed could trigger a run on MMMFs,
hampering wholesale funding conditions and with severe repercussions on the rest of the U.S.
financial system as well as U.S. nonfinancial firms.



Deleveraging by EU banks. Credit conditions could potentially be affected by a sharper
retrenchment of core euro area banks from their activities in the United States than observed so
far. The April 2012 Global Financial Stability Report projected a reduction of some US$230 billion
in the U.S. assets held by EU banks in its “weak EU policies” scenario. Although claims by EU
banks on the United States did fall by $170 billion during 2011Q4 (the latest quarter for which
data is available), this has not translated into a decline in U.S. bank credit; commercial and
industrial loans continued to expand in 2011Q4 and 2012Q1, by about $30 billion and
$45 billion, respectively. The reflects the fact the U.S. activities shed by EU banks have been
picked up by U.S. banks or other foreign banks, as well as the fact that EU banks’ claims on the
United States include loans extended to non-U.S. entities.

6

These estimates are based on simulations using a Financial Condition Index (FCI) for the United States. In particular,
staff simulated a one standard deviation permanent shock to financial conditions, using a VAR-based FCI (Swiston,
IMF/WP/08/161, 2008). The shocks were similar in size to the changes observed in the Summer/Fall of 2011 for stock
prices, corporate spreads, the LIBOR, and oil prices. In this stylized scenario, the higher LIBOR rate and corporate
bond yields, and lower equity prices would lower growth by 1 percentage point, but the fall in oil prices would
cushion some of their effect and reduce the net impact to -0.6 percentage point.

The main domestic downside risk is that inaction driven by political gridlock could
prevent or delay key policy decisions which are needed to support the recovery and restore
fiscal sustainability. In particular:

felt already in late 2012, with spending held
back by policy uncertainty—subtracting perhaps ½ percent from (annualized) growth in the
second half of 2012 according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).



Moreover, the federal debt ceiling will need to be raised most likely in early 2013, bringing back
the risk of heightened uncertainty and financial market disruption. Similar to the case of the
“fiscal cliff”, there is clearly the potential for negative confidence effects and financial market
reactions in anticipation of this event.



At the same time, failing to agree on a credible plan to put the federal debt on a sustainable
medium-term path could lead to a gradual erosion of the reserve currency status of the U.S.
dollar and put upward pressure on Treasury bond yields over the medium term―despite the
deficit reduction measures already legislated, the public debt ratio remains on an unsustainable
trajectory (Annex II).

17.
There are also upside risks, however, as pent-up demand could provide more support
to the recovery. Specifically, capital investment can turn out to be stronger than in staff’s forecast,
particularly in a less uncertain environment, given the strong balance sheets of non-financial
corporations. A more positive outlook for the housing market could also be envisaged, with pent-up
demand for housing and increased demand for rental units leading to a faster-than expected

recovery of housing starts than in our baseline scenario. Staff estimates that one hundred thousand
additional housing starts by end-2013 could lead to an increase in GDP growth of 0.2 percent in
2012 and 2013. And finally, a slower fiscal withdrawal than built in our baseline scenario would help
lift growth, especially if embedded in a credible medium-term consolidation framework that
removes policy uncertainty.

POLICY DISCUSSION
Discussions focused on what the U.S. authorities could do to sustain the recovery and reduce the
vulnerability to downside risks, while at the same time addressing key medium term challenges. In
particular the discussion centered on the appropriate pace, timing, and composition of fiscal
consolidation; the room and need for further monetary policy easing; the merit of additional measures
to unclog the housing markets and reduce the risks from persistently high long-term unemployment;
and the progress made over the last year in the reform of financial regulation and the remaining
challenges ahead.

in 2013, as they were confident that Congress would
take the cyclical position of the economy into account when designing fiscal policy for 2013. As in
previous consultations, the authorities considered staff’s medium-term outlook as excessively
pessimistic. They saw the rise in unemployment from its pre-crisis levels as primarily a cyclical
phenomenon, highlighting, nonetheless, that structural unemployment could rise in the absence of
policy action.

B. Fiscal Policy: Pace of Consolidation and Medium-Term Framework
19.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the adoption of a credible fiscal consolidation
framework is crucial for stable medium-term growth. The Budget Control Act adopted in the
summer of 2011 capped discretionary spending, but the Congressional Committee on Deficit
Reduction subsequently failed to agree on additional deficit-reduction measures. As a result, savings
in the form of deep automatic spending cuts (“sequester”) are scheduled to take effect starting from
2013. The overall savings from the discretionary spending caps and sequester would be significant
($2.1 trillion over 10 years), but still insufficient to stabilize the debt ratio (Figure 7).7 Since the
automatic spending cuts could disrupt government services and create an unwelcome drag on the
weak recovery, staff suggested replacing them with specific, back-loaded measures generating an
equal amount of savings. More broadly, policymakers should agree on an ambitious and
comprehensive consolidation framework, which would stabilize the public debt ratio by
mid-decade, and subsequently put it firmly on a downward path.8 A medium-term primary surplus
of at least 1 percent of GDP would help achieve this objective, even if interest rates were to rebound
from their current low levels. The authorities noted that they have repeatedly put forth detailed fiscal
consolidation plans, but a bipartisan agreement on a consolidation strategy would probably not
materialize before the November 2012 elections. Staff reiterated its long-held view that the
medium-term growth assumptions embedded in the administration’s fiscal proposals appear to be
optimistic, and remain well above projections by the IMF, the CBO, and Consensus.

7

Federal debt held by the public is projected to increase from about 70 percent of GDP to around 85 percent of GDP
in FY2022, with general government gross debt approaching 120 percent of GDP by CY2021. These projections
assume implementation of legislated measures, additional, modest policy effort over the medium term, and
continued low level of interest rates for several years. The Debt Sustainability Analysis in Annex II suggests that—in a
downside scenario—policy slippages, negative growth shocks, and much higher interest rates could raise the general
government debt ratio above 120 percent of GDP already within a 5-year horizon.

Country Report No. 11/202).

20.
Staff noted that the consolidation effort will involve politically-difficult decisions on
taxes and entitlement spending. Authorities emphasized that it is too early to predict the details
of a possible bipartisan agreement on a comprehensive fiscal consolidation plan, not least because
the contours of this plan would depend on the election results, but agreed that the plan will have to
address both the spending and revenue sides of the budget. Staff stressed that with discretionary
spending capped and defense outlays projected to fall significantly due to the withdrawal of troops
from Afghanistan and Iraq, attention must shift to entitlements, the key driver of long-term
spending. Given the size of the budget deficit, mandatory spending pressures, and the relatively low
U.S. tax ratio, a medium-term consolidation plan would also need to raise revenues. The authorities
acknowledged that bipartisan consensus on these issues has so far not been reached, but believed
that previous negotiations (including in the context of the President’s Fiscal Commission) identified
some common ground on which post-election negotiations could be based.
21.
Entitlement spending pressures reflect population aging and, in the health care sector,
excess cost growth. They are mostly linked to the public health care programs (especially Medicare
and Medicaid) and public pensions (Social Security).

health care sector, such as raising fees,
tightening eligibility (for example, raising the Medicare eligibility age), and trimming healthrelated tax expenditures which tend to be highly regressive (Selected Issues Chapter V). The
authorities noted that their budget proposal envisages substantial new health care-related
savings (about $360 billion over 10 years), although the measures directly affecting beneficiaries
are backloaded toward the end of decade.



Public pensions. In staff’s view, Social Security imbalances warrant an early parametric reform,
such as a modest increase in the retirement age, a modified benefit structure to further increase
progressivity, and a higher annual ceiling for Social Security contributions. According to a recent
report by the Social Security Trustees, the combined Social Security trust funds could run out of
resources in 2033—three years earlier than projected last year—at which point elimination of the
funding shortfalls would require a 25 percent cut in scheduled benefits. Considered separately,
the Disability Insurance trust fund will be depleted already in 2016. A specific reform proposal

The existing CMS experiments and demonstration projects include expanding primary care to help prevent costly
procedures; providing incentives for changes in the delivery process through bundled payments; improving

initiatives affect about 50,000 health care providers.
10

The state-level insurance exchanges (or market places), are meant to facilitate the expansion of insurance
coverage, including by helping consumers find plans personalized to their specific health conditions and budgets,
promoting insurance transparency and accountability, and facilitating the delivery of insurance subsidies.

improving the structure of corporate taxation,
including broadening the base, lowering marginal rates (the United States has the highest statutory
corporate tax rate in the OECD), and achieving a more efficient tax treatment of multinational
enterprises. When designing these reforms, however, staff noted that appropriate consideration
should be given to their possible international spillovers, especially from changes in the taxation of
foreign activities by U.S. corporations (Selected Issues Chapter VI discusses implications of
alternative options, including the President’s framework for corporate tax reform unveiled in
February).
23.
Staff called for a measured pace of deficit reduction given the persistent weakness in
economic activity. Authorities and staff concurred that the medium-term risks from persistentlyhigh deficits and growing debt need to be weighed against the risks of too rapid a withdrawal,
although staff saw the optimal pace of consolidation as more gradual than proposed in the
President’s FY2013 budget. The President’s budget proposal envisages a reduction in the federal
deficit by 3 percent of GDP in FY2013 (from 8½ percent to 5½ percent of GDP) due to expiring
stimulus, revenue-raising measures, and some defense savings. The authorities felt that this pace of
consolidation is consistent with their expectations of a substantial pickup in private demand.
According to the CBO, even if the proposed budget policies were implemented in full, the pace of
fiscal adjustment would likely be smaller.12 Staff suggested that, given the weak outlook and
downside risks, targeting a federal deficit of about 6¼ percent of GDP for FY2013—some
12

Specifically, the CBO estimates that the President’s budget proposal would imply only a 2 percent of GDP
adjustment, in part because the budget overstates spending this year. In addition, Congress has not acted upon
certain stimulus proposals by the Administration; if these were to be implemented, the FY2013 withdrawal could be
lower than 2 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED STATES

¾ percentage point of GDP higher than planned in the President’s budget proposal—would be
appropriate. This would be consistent with a reduction in the general government structural primary
deficit of around 1 percent of GDP in calendar year 2013. The deficit reduction should be as growthfriendly as possible. Potential spending measures to prioritize include infrastructure spending,
training programs to limit skill mismatches, and housing initiatives (all of which were proposed by
the Administration), as well as a further extension of emergency unemployment benefits. The
authorities noted that the discussion of fiscal policies in Congress will be very much influenced by
the cyclical position of the economy, and that policymakers generally agree that the budget deficit
should not be reduced too quickly if the outlook remains weak.
24.
State and local governments (SLGs) have continued their fiscal adjustment, but they
need to rebuild buffers and reduce contingent liabilities. The fiscal retrenchment triggered by
the balanced-budget rules and a phase-out of federal aid continued last year, with the SLGs
subtracting about ¼ percent from GDP growth. State and local employment have recently shown
signs of stabilization, but the authorities cautioned that local governments continued to face risks
from the weak housing market and property tax collections, and could weigh on growth for some
time. The rebuilding of rainy-day funds stopped this fiscal year, and while most states plan to make
some progress with rebuilding buffers during FY2013, the reserves in about half of the states remain
well below prudent levels, making the SLGs susceptible to spending cuts should revenues surprise
on the downside (Figure 8). A number of states have taken action to trim contingent liabilities from
the pension and health care obligations to their employees (in some cases supported by favorable
court rulings), but these liabilities generally remain sizeable. The authorities hoped that the
forthcoming modification of the GASB standards would create further incentives for the SLGs to
address unfunded pension liabilities, estimated by private analysts in a wide range of $1–4 trillion.13

C. Monetary Policy
25.
The discussion on monetary policy focused on whether the outlook and risks justified
further easing. Staff and the authorities agreed that the Fed’s unconventional monetary policy
actions since the crisis had supported economic activity and hedged against deflationary risks,
helping to keep inflation expectations well anchored. In the discussions, which occurred before the
June 20 easing action, staff argued that the slow pace of reduction in unemployment under its
baseline and the escalation of downside risks may call for further easing in the second half of this
year. The authorities noted that risk management considerations could argue in favor of this course
of action—like staff, they saw the risks to the outlook as being tilted to the downside, and argued
that the costs and policy challenges associated with the materialization of downside risks would
probably be larger than those associated with the outlook turning stronger than expected. At the
same time, the authorities and staff recognized that there were costs and risks associated with
providing additional policy accommodation, and that the very low level of long-term interest rates

13

18

Last year’s Selected Issues Paper VII (IMF Country Report No. 11/202) provides a discussion of SLG finances.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

might suggest that the benefits that can be achieved by further monetary policy accommodation
are limited.
26.
The authorities argued that further easing actions would be effective even in the
absence of severe market dislocation. Staff noted that that both Operation Twist and the forwardguidance announcements had lowered long-term yields, but argued that asset purchases may have
a greater impact in unsettled financial market conditions—that is, when arbitrage is imperfect,
liquidity premia are high, and risk spreads are elevated. The authorities agreed that the Fed’s first
large-scale asset purchase program, introduced under severely dislocated markets, had eased
financial conditions very substantially, but noted that the subsequent, smaller-sized programs had
also been effective, even if they were not introduced in particularly stressed conditions.
27.
Staff and the authorities agreed that easing actions would have a positive effect on
activity even if frictions in the mortgage market have weakened the monetary transmission
mechanism. Lack of competition and capacity constraints among servicers have reduced the passthrough of lower MBS yields into lower mortgage interest rates. Moreover, many households with
high-loan-to-value mortgages could not refinance at the lower rates and many homebuyers were
unable to obtain new mortgages due to tighter lending standards. Despite these frictions, staff and
the authorities agreed that the effect of lower longer-term yields on aggregate demand remained
positive. Moreover, the lessened sensitivity of economic activity to longer-term interest rates could
call for more rather than less action to ease monetary conditions. In addition, the authorities noted
that monetary policy operates through multiple channels—interest rates and the cost of capital
being only one of them.
28.
There was agreement that a number of tools could be used for further easing, with
staff arguing that additional MBS purchases would be a particularly promising option. Staff
argued that in view of the high share of long-maturity Treasury securities held by the Fed and the
importance of the housing sector to the outlook, further net MBS purchases could be another
effective option. The authorities agreed that further net MBS purchases could be helpful in some
circumstances, but also noted a tension between providing accommodation through further MBS
purchases and the desire by the FOMC to return, over time, to an all-Treasury securities portfolio.
There was also agreement between staff and the authorities that the effectiveness of MBS purchases
or other forms of monetary easing in supporting growth would be enhanced if policy actions and
proposals to expand access to mortgage refinancing were to gain further traction.
29.
Should global financial turmoil intensify, the Fed could intervene with emergency
liquidity facilities to mitigate the risks of severe financial disruption. The authorities noted that
dollar liquidity swap lines with foreign central banks, authorized by the Fed through February 2013,
are already in place to help ease strains in dollar funding markets. Authorities noted that the Fed’s
ability to provide institution-specific support is limited under the Dodd-Frank Act (DFA), but that it
retained the authority to establish broadly-available liquidity facilities to help stabilize funding
conditions for financial institutions if appropriate.

share of loans that have benefited from a
principal reduction under the modification program (Home Affordable Modification program of
HAMP) has also been on the rise, and early signs show that the tripling of the incentives for principal
reductions is receiving interest from investors, and is likely to spur further principal reductions in the
future. The recent State Attorneys General Settlement with the major banks, which resolved claims
about improper foreclosures and abuses in servicing the loans, could lead in the medium run to a
non-trivial reduction in foreclosures, including through up to $34 billion of principal reduction. Early
signs indicate that the settlement has led banks to delay foreclosures and also to increasingly
substitute them with “short sales” of underwater properties, which are less costly and count toward
the banks’ commitment for principal reduction under the settlement.14 The authorities highlighted
that greater reliance on short sales, as opposed to foreclosures, could support the housing market
going forward.
31.
The mission welcomed this progress, but also noted that more aggressive policy
action may be warranted to accelerate the resolution of the housing crisis. As noted in the
Fed’s November 2011 white paper, housing markets do not self-correct efficiently and, absent
forceful policies to support the market, prices could fall below their equilibrium levels due to
feedback loops from prices to demand and supply. If house prices are anticipated to decline,
potential buyers could stay out of the market even if interest rates are low. Moreover, a decline in
prices reduces housing equity, triggering further defaults and foreclosures. Foreclosures, in turn, put
renewed downward pressure on prices, not only by adding to the supply of houses for sale, but also

14

A short sale consists of the sale of an underwater property by the homeowner after an agreement with the lender.
The lender obtains the sale proceeds but releases its lien even though sale proceeds are below the value of the
outstanding mortgage. Compared to foreclosures, short sales typically lead to smaller discounts in the property
value. They are also likely to exert a smaller negative externality on the value of neighboring properties.

20

because they lead to a destruction of value and impose “deadweight” losses on the economy,
hurting consumer wealth and credit availability.15
32.
Staff noted that further policy measures could help speed up the recovery of the
housing market, while recognizing that there is no silver bullet. These could include:


Supporting mortgage modifications. Staff sees foreclosure mitigation policies—including
through mortgage modifications—as a key priority. Possible ways to strengthen and expand
mortgage modifications include the participation of the GSEs in the principal reduction program
and a forceful implementation of the recent expansion of HAMP, including by providing
appropriate incentives to servicers to ensure their full participation.16 Staff also noted the
potential usefulness of shared appreciation mechanisms, which allow lenders and borrowers to
share the benefits from future house price increases and could therefore lead to higher
participation by investors in principal reductions. The authorities indicated that the FHFA, the
independent conservator of the GSEs, is currently considering the participation of the GSEs in
HAMP-PRA, and noted that under the recently-announced increase in investor incentives under
HAMP-PRA, the GSEs are encouraged to participate and benefit from the same incentives as
private investors. The authorities recognized that the incentive misalignment between servicers
and investors has been a barrier to further principal reductions, but noted that an existing
program tackles the second-liens problem by forcing participating second-lien holders to
reduce the principal on the second liens by an equal proportion to the first lien. In addition,
incentives for extinguishing principal on second-lien modifications were increased to further
encourage second-lien principal reductions. The authorities agreed on the usefulness of sharedappreciation mechanisms, but argued that technical constraints might make them hard to
implement.



Supporting refinancing on a larger scale. Current refinancing volumes are not in line with the
historically low mortgage rates. The barriers to refinancing have clogged the monetary
transmission mechanism, which would have otherwise allowed high-propensity-to-consume
households to save on their monthly payments, also reducing their risk of delinquency. While
the recent expansion of HARP is allowing more underwater GSE loans to refinance, staff noted
that more could be done to boost refinancing, along the lines of recent proposals by the
Administration. These proposals include an easing of the frictions that hinder cross-servicer
refinancing and an expansion of the program to non-GSE borrowers (Box 5). Authorities noted
that these measures are contained in three bills that have been recently introduced in Congress.

15

It is estimated that foreclosed properties sell at around a 27 percent discount and lower the value of neighboring
properties by around 2 percent.

16

Currently, the incentives of servicers are not always aligned with those of investors. Many modifications that would
increase the net present value (NPV) of mortgages for investors are not carried out by servicers due to high
modification costs, and, in some cases, reluctance by servicers due to their significant holdings of second liens. When
servicers hold a second lien on the property in delinquency they have an incentive to avoid modifications since it
would also lead to losses on their second liens.



Facilitating the conversion of foreclosed properties into rental units. The recent pilot
program by the FHFA to facilitate the transition of foreclosed houses into rental units would
help reduce the negative impact of foreclosures on house prices by averting distressed sales.
Staff and authorities agreed on the benefits from a timely expansion of this program, especially
given buoyant rents, but authorities noted technical challenges in the implementation that are
likely to lead to delays.



Allowing mortgages to be modified in personal bankruptcy courts (the so called
“cramdowns”). Implementing this long-standing Fund recommendation would make the
treatment of primary residences in personal bankruptcies consistent with that of most other
types of secured debt and create incentives for voluntary modifications, at no fiscal cost
(Selected Issues Chapter VII). Authorities acknowledged staff’s arguments on cramdowns but
noted the lack of sufficient political support for this measure.

E. Challenges Facing the Labor Market
33.
Staff and authorities agreed that while cyclical factors explain most of the ongoing
labor market weakness, there is a risk that structural unemployment may increase in the
absence of policy action. The long-term unemployment rate, at 3.5 percent of the labor force, is
well above levels in previous recessions and has declined relatively little since the start of the
recovery. Elevated long-term unemployment raises the risk of a loss of human capital and
attachment to the labor force, and could lead to a lower participation rate or higher NAIRU in the
medium term. Staff also noted that the apparent shift in the Beveridge curve for some industries—in
particular, manufacturing—may suggest mismatches between the skills available among the
unemployed and the skills sought by employers.
34.
Authorities observed that a number of measures have been recently adopted to boost
employment, while others have been proposed. The Job Creation Act of February 2012
introduced an extension of the payroll tax cuts through 2012 and the requirement that recipients of
long-term unemployed benefits take up job search services, as well as training and education
services. Other measures to support the labor market by boosting labor demand through tax
incentives and helping the unemployed in their job search effort have been proposed by the
Administration but have not been approved by Congress. For example, the President’s American Job
Act of 2011 envisaged a one-year reduction in the portion of the payroll tax paid by employers for
incremental increases in their payrolls, and a $4,000 credit to employers for hiring long-term
unemployed workers. And the 2013 Budget proposed both active labor market policies, including
the Pathways Back to Work program that help low-income youth and long-term unemployed by
subsidizing their employment; and a 10 percent tax credit for new jobs and wage increases.
35.
Staff was supportive of these measures, and suggested that tax incentives could be
better targeted at employment creation and more resources devoted to programs that help
the long-term unemployed return to work. Staff suggested that tax incentives aimed at the longterm unemployed deserve more consideration, given these individuals’ higher risk of human capital
losses. In light of the protracted weakness in labor market conditions, staff also cautioned against an

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

abrupt reduction of the maximum duration of extended unemployment benefits, as these provide
an important social safety net. Ensuring adequate funding for active labor market policies, such as
training and support for job search, would also be critical, as these measures have been shown to
improve the employment prospects of long-term unemployed workers. Resources in this area are
generally lower in the United States than other OECD countries, and have fallen since 2007 as a ratio
to the long-term unemployed.

F. Financial Sector Conditions and Policies
36.
The authorities saw the outlook for the U.S. banking system as broadly positive. They
noted that earnings growth for the U.S. banking sector has been positive over the last 11 quarters,
and losses and bank failures have peaked in late 2010. However, a few States (Arizona, California,
Florida, Georgia, and Nevada) continue to suffer from higher rates of bank failures, reflecting
exposures to weak house prices and construction activity, in particular commercial real estate.
Authorities indicated that banks continue to report weak loan demand from small and medium
enterprises (SMEs), reflecting both the weak demand environment faced by these firms and the
decline in available collateral following the housing bust, given that SMEs tend to secure a large
share of liabilities with real estate. They also said that the supply of mortgage credit was still tight as
evidenced, for example, by the Fed’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, which shows almost no
easing of mortgage standards since the crisis. The large backlog of troubled mortgages, regulatory
uncertainty, and scaled-down real estate lending operations are weighing on banks’ willingness and
ability to supply mortgage credit.
37.
However, U.S. banks face risks from an intensification of stresses in global financial
markets. While agreeing that the banking system has made significant progress since the depth of
the recession (Box 3), staff expressed concerns about the potential vulnerabilities of the largest U.S.
banks to financial market stresses emanating from turmoil in the euro area, in light of their large
derivative portfolios (including with counterparts in the euro area) and relatively high dependence
on wholesale funding. The increase in CDS spreads for the largest U.S. banks over the past few
months could indeed reflect concerns about contagion from renewed global financial market
turmoil.17 The authorities noted that the stress testing from the second Comprehensive Capital
Analysis Review (CCAR) gave reassuring indications on the resilience of the largest U.S. banks to very
severe shocks. They agreed that severe shocks affecting large core euro area banks would
unavoidably have negative repercussions for U.S. financial institutions, given their size and
interconnectedness, but noted that the protracted period of turbulence had afforded U.S.
institutions time to adjust their exposures and prepare contingency plans. They also indicated that
the upward movements in CDS spreads for major U.S. banks may reflect investors hedging against
17

Self-reported data on the six largest U.S. banks (Bank of America, JPMorgan, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Goldman
Sachs and Wells Fargo) suggest that their aggregate net exposure to peripheral Europe (taking into account the
protection purchased and the full set of collateral) was about US$57 billion at end 2011. But the counterparty risk
behind these exposures remains a concern, considering that about 75 percent of all CDS trading globally is
concentrated amongst 20 major banks/brokers that include the five major U.S. banks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

UNITED STATES

the risks of greater stress in global financial markets by purchasing CDS of U.S. banks, as their
valuations are highly sensitive to changes in global economic conditions.
38.
Authorities noted that activity in segments of the shadow banking system is still
depressed, and unlikely to return to pre-crisis levels in the foreseeable future.


The MMMF asset base—US$2.5 trillion—is about one third below its end-2008 peak. Authorities
and staff agreed that runs on MMMFs following distress in one of the large euro area banks
remain a potential risk, even though prime MMMFs have halved their exposure to the core euro
area to about US$215 billion in May 2012 and shortened its duration.



Almost four years after the peak of the financial crisis, private-label securitization remains well
below its pre-crisis level. In particular, issuance of CDOs has evaporated while private-label
RMBS issuance has slowed to a trickle, which

39.
Staff underscored the challenges posed by the low interest rate environment for
insurance companies and defined-benefit pension funds. Authorities noted that low interest
rates may present challenges for corporations with defined-benefit pension plans, as they boost the
present value of future pension liabilities. The official estimate of corporate pension underfunding
was about $700 billion as of 2010, concentrated in industries such as airlines, auto, and steel.
According to the Society of Actuaries, employers have generally funded their plans in advance of
requirements, but the rising tide of required contributions in the coming years could create
difficulties for weaker companies.18 With regard to the insurance industry, the authorities noted that
18

24

After the end of consultation, Congress passed legislation that effectively eases the contribution requirements.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

the 2011 stress tests were reassuring, as insurance companies would maintain adequate capital
ratios even if interest rates stayed low for long. A greater challenge could come from a spike in
global financial stress: while the exposure to Europe and derivatives is not substantial, downgrades
of counterparties in derivative contracts could result in the specific contracts being out of
compliance with a specific state’s derivative use laws, in which case the insurer may be required to
take action, such as unwinding the contract or novating the contract to a counterparty that is in
compliance.
40.
Over the last year, continued progress has been made on the implementation of the
financial reform program, in line with the Dodd-Frank Act and the international regulatory
reform agenda. The authorities emphasized that implementing the reforms had been a daunting
process, given the volume of rulemaking to be completed in a relatively short period of time and
with limited resources. These difficulties, together with the authorities’ desire to “get things right”,
taking proper account the concerns raised by financial market participants, foreign authorities, and
the public during the consultation process were the main reasons for the delay in finalizing and
implementing parts of the DFA and global financial reforms. Still, progress was achieved in the
following areas, in many cases following the recommendations contained in the 2010 FSAP (Box 6):


Systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Final rules have been issued on the
submission of resolution plans (“living wills”) for SIFIs, and the criteria behind the designation of
non-bank SIFIs and Financial Market Utilities (FMU) for enhanced supervision and prudential
standards. Initial rulemakings to implement the orderly liquidation authority, which enables the
FDIC to place SIFIs into receivership, have been promulgated, and further rulemaking is in
progress. The authorities indicated that the designation process for FMUs is almost complete,
while that for non-banks is still at an earlier stage. Staff underscored the importance of
accelerating the process, as the actual designation of firms and the enhanced regulatory scrutiny
would further help identify and address systemic risk challenges.



OTC derivatives. Authorities have laid the groundwork for new regulations imposing mandatory
centralized clearing and improving transparency in OTC derivative markets, in line with the
Dodd-Frank Act and G20 commitments. While a number of rules have yet to be finalized,
authorities emphasized that reforms in this area need to be coordinated internationally, and that
the United States is closer to the implementation of new regulations on OTC derivatives than
other jurisdictions. Staff encouraged the authorities to finalize the rules as quickly as possible,
given the critical role played by the U.S. financial sector in global derivatives markets. Authorities
and staff agreed on the need to have strong supervision of Central Counterparties (CCPs), and
that systemically important CCPs should have access to Fed liquidity facilities in appropriate
circumstances.



Basel rules. Final rules have been issued requiring banks to increase their capital buffers for the
trading book and securitization activities, broadly following Basel 2.5 requirements (U.S. banks

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED STATES

continue to report capital ratios under Basel I).19 Initial rulemaking proposals have been issued
requiring banks to hold greater and higher quality capital buffers, in line with Basel III
requirements. The authorities were confident that the final rule on these standards would be
issued around the timeline agreed with the Basel Committee (January 2013), and noted that
most major U.S. banks are on track to meet the new requirements. Authorities also indicated
that the Dodd-Frank Act’s provision on greater capital buffers for systemically important banks
(with assets above $50 billion) will be implemented at the same time as the capital surcharge for
the Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) (between 2016 and 2018). While the
implementation of the two Basel liquidity standards will not begin until 2015 for the Liquidity
Coverage Ratio and 2018 for the Net Funding Stable Ratio, the U.S. authorities are working at
initial rulemaking proposals on both standards. Staff welcomed the progress and encouraged
the authorities to further advance in the rulemaking needed to fully implement the Basel III
framework in line with the internationally agreed timeline.
41.
The discussion also focused on areas where more remains to be done to increase the
resilience of U.S. financial system:


Regulation of the shadow banking system: Authorities and staff agreed that one area where more
progress is needed is the regulation of money market mutual funds. Given the size of this
industry, its prominence in short-term funding markets, and its susceptibility to runs,
strengthening the regulation of MMMFs is critical to enhance financial stability, especially as the
emergency facility used during the financial crisis to backstop the market is no longer available.
The menu of options to mitigate the risks posed by the MMMFs includes moving from stable to
floating net asset values, and imposing capital requirements and redemption limits. Authorities
and staff also concurred on the need to reduce the systemic risk stemming from the
dependence of the tri-party repo market on intraday credit provided by the clearing banks,
following the recommendation of the tri-party repo task force.



Volcker rule. Staff noted that a ban on proprietary trading could in principle reduce the risk of
significant losses on banks’ derivatives positions, which has been drawing renewed attention
after the recent events involving JP Morgan. But in staff’s view the effectiveness of this ban
would depend on striking the right balance between too rigid an interpretation of the law—
which could trigger a migration of risky activities outside the regulatory perimeter—and an
expansive interpretation of the exemptions envisaged by the statute, which could dilute it. At the
same time, it is important to minimize the potential adverse international spillovers of the law, as
well as its impact on market liquidity more generally. Authorities indicated that they are very
mindful of the concerns expressed by foreign authorities and markets, and that an appropriate

19

The final U.S. regulation on Basel II requirements (which became effective in 2008) fell short of fully adopting Basel
II standards, as it only required large U.S. banks adopt the so-called “advanced” approach for the calculation of riskweighted assets. To-date core banks remain in a transitory regime where they run both Basel I and Basel II
calculations, but Basel I capital requirements remain the legal minimum.

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

definition of market-making activities (allowed under the statute) should address most of these
concerns.


Insurance regulation. Staff reiterated their long-standing view that the lack of a national
regulatory framework for the industry could be an issue, given the difficulty in coordinating the
various state regulators on both domestic and international reform efforts. The authorities
pointed to the establishment of the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) at the Treasury as a significant
step forward, given FIO’s mandate and emerging capacity to coordinate federal effects and
develop federal policy on prudential aspects of international insurance matters.



Mortgage market reforms. Staff noted that, 16 months after the issuance of the initial rulemaking
proposal, it is important to expeditiously complete the regulation requiring banks that securitize
loans to retain a share of the risk, as this would remove uncertainty weighing on the recovery of
private securitization. Authorities noted that regulatory agencies are working on finalizing the
risk retention rules. Under the law, a bank will have to retain an ownership interest in any
mortgage it securitizes if that mortgage does not meet the new requirements of a Qualified
Residential Mortgage. The CFPB is still carefully reviewing the comments received on the
Qualified Mortgage (QM) proposed rules, which would impose mortgages underwriting
standards that ensure borrowers have the ability to repay. While staff argued that the
uncertainty related to risk retention and QM rules may be negatively affecting mortgage
lending, authorities noted that other frictions may hurt banks’ appetite for mortgage lending,
including capacity constraints and risks stemming from representations and warranties.



The future of the GSEs. Staff noted the importance of striking the right balance between the need
to support the recovery of the housing market and to enact structural reforms of the housing
finance system over the medium term featuring a much reduced role for the GSEs (as envisaged
in a 2011 Administration report to Congress—Box 7). The authorities noted the need to achieve
broad consensus on these reforms, which they saw as high priority for after the upcoming
elections. They also noted that the FHFA had recently issued a strategic plan outlining the next
phase of the conservatorships of the GSEs. Staff and authorities agreed on the need for a
medium-term strategy to reduce the role of GSEs, which may encourage a gradual shift in the
mortgage market towards private institutions, helping resolve some of the uncertainty weighing
on the housing market.

42.
Staff and authorities agreed that ensuring financial stability would require strong
oversight of systemic risk. Staff noted that, as the U.S. regulatory architecture remains highly
fragmented, it is essential to ensure strong coordination among its various agencies, in order to
identify and act on early signals of a build-up of systemic risk. The authorities agreed, but noted that
the Financial Stability and Oversight Council (FSOC) had greatly improved coordination and
cooperation among agencies, as their representatives meet frequently within the FSOC’s various
sub-committees and working groups. They also indicated that the Office of Financial Research can
play a useful role in this regard, including by allowing agencies to access a centralized database on
financial institutions’ positions and exposures, and developing a dashboard for systemic risk
indicators.

43.
Rapid completion and effective implementation of the new regulations requires
adequate funding for the regulatory and supervisory agencies. Authorities noted that agencies
continue to experience budgetary constraints which limit their ability to meet the deadlines
associated with the domestic and international reforms. Going forward, a lack of adequate resources
may hinder the ability of the agencies to effectively monitor financial institutions and markets, once
the new regulations come into force. Staff argued that lifting these resource constraints should be a
priority.

G. The United States and the World Economy
44.
Staff stressed that policy actions to raise savings over the medium term, including by
restoring fiscal sustainability, and to strengthen the recovery in the short term would make
important contributions to global growth and stability. With household saving rates projected
to remain close to current levels in the medium term, higher public savings would help ensure that
the U.S. current account deficit remains moderate as domestic investment gradually recovers. While
current external vulnerabilities are limited by the dollar’s reserve currency status and the United
States’ role as safe haven, restoring fiscal sustainability would also reduce potential future risks to
external stability. These could arise, for example, from a future decline in foreign demand for U.S.
debt securities triggered by market concerns about public debt dynamics, and imply sharply higher
U.S. interest rates, with adverse global spillovers—as discussed in the 2012 Spillover Report
(www.imf.org).
45.
The authorities agreed on the need for the U.S. to raise its saving rate, particularly
through fiscal consolidation, but expressed concerns that global demand could falter,
dragging down world growth. In this context, they saw decisive action to forestall the risk of a
euro area crisis, and boost demand and increase currency flexibility in surplus countries, as essential
to revive world growth and achieve global rebalancing, in line with goals of the G-20 Framework for
Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Growth. Such policy actions would improve the outlook for U.S.
exports and the current account, facilitating the rotation from domestic demand to external
demand. They also noted that they expect the U.S. bond market to remain deep, liquid, and
attractive to foreign investors.
46.
While the U.S. current account deficit has narrowed after the crisis, staff noted that the
U.S. external position remains weaker than justified by fundamentals and desired policies. The
current account deficit is expected to widen modestly in the next few years as the output gap
gradually closes, thus increasing imports, but lower oil prices feed through. This would lead to a
further deterioration in the net International Investment Position (NIIP) of the United States, which
reached -27 percent of GDP at end-2011. Model-based estimates suggest that the cyclicallyadjusted current account deficit is 1–2 percentage points of GDP weaker than the value implied by
fundamentals and desirable policies and that the real effective exchange rate is moderately
overvalued (0–15 percent), also in light of the recent appreciation of the dollar (Box 8). Staff argued
that over the medium term, fiscal consolidation aiming for a primary surplus of at least 1 percent of
GDP accompanied by some depreciation of the dollar and desired policies in partner countries
would allow for a strengthening of the current account balance of the order of 1–2 percent of GDP
28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

relative to staff’s projections. Such an outcome would be in line with maintaining external stability
and full employment. The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s current account projections but
did not take a view on the appropriateness of the level of the current account balance and the
dollar.
47.
Staff also stressed the negative impact that a materialization of the fiscal cliff would
have on other economies. Should the tail risk of the fiscal cliff materialize, the U.S. economy would
at a minimum stall next year, with growth turning negative in early 2013. Staff analysis for the 2012
Spillover Report (www.imf.org) suggests that the spillovers to the rest of the world would mostly
propagate through trade channels, with negative effects felt more strongly in the immediate
neighbors (Canada and Mexico) and a smaller but non-negligible growth impact elsewhere in
advanced Europe and Japan, also given their narrow policy space. Spillovers to emerging markets
would be more manageable given the lower sensitivity of their growth rates to U.S. growth, higher
trend growth rates, and generally larger policy flexibility. That said, existing models may not fully
capture the adverse effects of a drop in U.S. growth through lower commodity prices and exportrelated investments in emerging market economies, and sizable financial market reactions could
imply a much more severe magnitude and propagation of the shock. While acknowledging the
potential impact of a large fiscal adjustment on the U.S. recovery, the authorities were confident that
a political agreement would be reached to avoid a drastic fiscal tightening in 2013.
48.
Monetary policy actions in the United States have helped sustain the U.S. recovery,
thus supporting global growth, but also have spillovers on the rest of the world. In principle
monetary policy easing in the United States tends to be accompanied by declines in interest rates in
other countries, dollar depreciation, and U.S. capital outflows. However, identifying the strength of
these effects precisely is difficult, for several reasons: policy actions are often anticipated; they occur
in response to other shocks; and other events on domestic and international markets can coincide
with policy announcements or actions, making it difficult to disentangle the impact of the latter.


Staff analysis finds mixed evidence on the impact of recent U.S. monetary policy easing actions
on foreign interest rates and exchange rates, reflecting the fact that easing was in some
instances undertaken in the context of a material worsening of the global outlook (which tends
to strengthen the U.S. dollar on safe haven flows). The authorities broadly agreed with the
findings, noting the difficulty of assessing the effects when changes in the global economic
backdrop around announcement dates trigger effects that go in the opposite direction.



With regard to capital flows, staff analysis for the 2012 Spillover Report finds that U.S. investors
have significantly reduced their purchases of foreign bonds since the onset of the financial crisis,
despite the dramatic decline in U.S. interest rates. The destination of the flows, however, has
changed: U.S. residents have scaled down significantly their purchases of euro area and U.K.
bonds, and boosted purchases of bonds issued by Australia, Canada, and Latin America (in
addition to increasing holdings of U.S. Treasuries). The authorities noted that declining interest
rates would have contributed to higher bond outflows, ceteris paribus; however, monetary
easing occurred in response to weak growth and an unsettled global environment, where factors
such as high risk aversion, flight to safety, and demand for liquidity were key drivers of capital

UNITED STATES

flows. The authorities also noted that there are fundamental reasons for capital to flow to
emerging markets. Staff concurred, noting that the significant changes in the destination of
flows also reflected changes in relative growth prospects and cyclical positions post-crisis.
49.
The mission welcomed the authorities’ continued commitment to trade liberalization
and market access, in support of economic growth and expanded job opportunities. The
authorities are aiming for progress on multiple fronts; however, as a consequence of slower
progress in the multilateral trade framework, their short-term focus has shifted to the pluri- and
bilateral arenas. Accordingly, the authorities are pursuing opportunities for ambitious trade
agreements with certain APEC members in the context of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and, possibly,
with the EU, while also defining policies for trade and investment promotion in the Arab transition
economies. Following the recent implementation of the FTAs with Colombia and Korea, work with
Panama on pending FTA issues is continuing. Key trade-related issues, such as industrial policies of
trading partners, and IPR and technology protection will also be addressed under bilateral
investment treaties (BITs), based on the newly revised model BIT. Staff welcomed the authorities’
efforts to resist protectionist pressures and ensure continued consistency of domestic legislation
and practices with WTO principles and international obligations, including in reforms of agricultural
support programs. The mission encouraged the authorities to aim for multilateral trade
liberalization, including new approaches as necessary.

STAFF APPRAISAL
The main policy challenge is to use effectively the limited policy space available to support the
recovery in the near term, while restoring fiscal sustainability with a balanced approach to mediumterm consolidation and completing financial sector reforms.
50.
It is critical to remove the uncertainty created by the “fiscal cliff” in 2013 and
promptly raise the debt ceiling, pursuing a pace of deficit reduction that does not sap the
economic recovery. The threat of a fiscal cliff could create headwinds to economic activity already
later this year, and should the fiscal cliff materialize, the domestic growth effects would be severe,
with negative spillovers to the rest of the world. Policymakers should address the policy
uncertainties as soon as possible—including through a temporary extension of current policies if a
bipartisan agreement on tax and spending measures proves too difficult to achieve this year. A
smaller deficit reduction than envisaged in the President budget would be appropriate in staff’s
view, given the weak economy and downside risks, limited room for monetary policy to offset the
fiscal drag, and the risk of hysteresis effects. Staff’s recommended pace of adjustment would be
consistent with a federal deficit of about 6¼ percent of GDP for FY2013—some ¾ percentage point
of GDP higher than planned in the President’s budget proposal. This would imply a contraction of
the general government structural primary deficit of around 1 percent of GDP in calendar year 2013.
The composition of spending should be as growth-friendly as possible, with emphasis on highmultiplier policies such as infrastructure spending, training programs to limit skill mismatches and
hysteresis effects, housing initiatives (measures already proposed by the Administration), and a
further extension of emergency unemployment benefits. Meanwhile, the federal debt ceiling should

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

be raised well ahead of the deadline to help reduce uncertainty and avoid the risk of losses in
confidence and financial market instability as the cut-off date approaches.
51.
At the same time, a credible and comprehensive fiscal consolidation plan remains
urgently needed. Policymakers should agree as early as possible on a comprehensive set of
measures that would stabilize the public debt ratio by mid-decade, and subsequently put it firmly on
a downward path. This would enhance the room for fiscal policy maneuver in the near term, as well
as limit the possibility of an eventual spike in risk premia on U.S. sovereign debt, which would be
highly damaging both for the United States and the rest of the world. To achieve this objective,
policymakers could target a medium-term primary surplus of at least 1 percent of GDP, which would
stabilize the debt ratio even factoring in a significant rebound of interest rates from their current low
levels. In this context, the deep automatic spending cuts envisaged under the Budget Control Act
(the so-called “sequester”) should be replaced with specific, back-loaded measures generating at
least an equal amount of savings.
52.
This medium-term consolidation effort will need to include revenue-raising measures
and reforms to slow the growth of entitlement spending. With discretionary spending capped
and defense outlays projected to fall significantly, policymakers’ attention must shift to entitlements,
the key driver of long-term spending. Policymakers should fully implement the cost-saving
provisions of the health care reform and additional saving measures could be phased in gradually.
The Social Security imbalances warrant an early parametric reform. Given the size of the budget
deficit, age-related spending pressures, and the relatively low tax ratio, the medium-term plan
should also include higher revenues. Revenues could be raised through a menu of options, including
lower tax expenditures (which amount to some 7 percent of GDP and disproportionately benefit
high-income taxpayers), the introduction of a VAT and carbon taxes, and higher marginal personal
income tax rates. There is also room for improving the structure of corporate taxation, including by
base-broadening, lowering marginal rates, and achieving a more efficient tax treatment of
multinational enterprises.
53.
Monetary policy conditions appropriately remain very accommodative, with some
room for further easing should the outlook deteriorate. We welcome the Federal Reserve’s
recent decision to further extend the maturity of its securities holdings, which should put additional
downward pressure on long-term interest rates. Yields on longer-term Treasury securities are
extraordinarily low and the spreads between agency MBS and Treasury bond yields remain tight. We
estimate that the innovative tools adopted by the Fed over the past year have reduced 10-year
Treasury bond yields by some 60 basis points. Should the outlook worsen, further easing may be
warranted. In this regard, given the relatively high share of the Fed’s holdings of Treasury securities
at longer maturities and the importance of the housing sector for the outlook, additional net MBS
purchases could be considered. Their effectiveness in supporting growth would be enhanced if
policy actions and proposals to expand access to mortgage refinancing were to gain further traction.
Should global financial turmoil intensify, the Fed would need to stand ready to intervene with
emergency liquidity facilities to mitigate the risks of severe financial disruption.

54.
Timely and aggressive monetary policy easing by the Federal Reserve since the fall of
2008 has been instrumental in avoiding the risk of a depression in the United States—which
would have had severe implications for the world economy—and in appropriately sustaining the U.S.
recovery at difficult junctures. Easy monetary policy in the United States (as in other advanced
economies) may encourage portfolio outflows, particularly to economies with favorable growth
prospects and open capital accounts, and this can potentially create challenges for their
macroeconomic management. However, these effects are likely tempered in the current unsettled
external environment, characterized by high risk aversion and safe-haven flows to the United States.
55.
The U.S. current account deficit has declined after the crisis, but the external position
remains weaker than justified by fundamentals and desired policies. The current account deficit
is expected to widen modestly in the next few years as domestic demand strengthens but oil prices
decline, leading to a further deterioration in the U.S. net international investment position. Over the
medium term, fiscal consolidation aiming for a primary surplus of at least 1 percent of GDP
accompanied by some depreciation of the dollar and adjustment in partner countries’ policies would
allow for a strengthening of the current account balance of some 1–2 percent of GDP, consistent
with external stability and full employment.
56.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ recent measures to boost the housing market,
although further action may be warranted to remove the distortions that prevent a faster
resolution of the housing crisis. The authorities have responded to the persistent weakness in the
housing market with a host of measures—including the expansion of the mortgage modification
and principal reduction program and the easing of some of the frictions in the refinancing program.
Staff supports the timely and aggressive implementation of these measures, including the
participation of Government-Sponsored Enterprises in the principal reduction program and ensuring
adherence by servicers to the loosened eligibility criteria under the expanded modification program.
However, in light of the importance of the housing market in securing the economic recovery and
the downside risks to the outlook, additional steps could be taken to strengthen the housing
recovery. These include measures to facilitate the conversion of foreclosed properties into rental
units and supporting access to refinancing on a larger scale, in line with the Administration’s
proposals, which would also strengthen the positive impact of lower interest rates on aggregate
demand. Consideration should also be given to allowing mortgages to be modified in personal
bankruptcy courts.
57.
Policies are needed to reduce the risk that long-term unemployment could morph into
higher structural unemployment and reduce potential output. While staff views most of the
increase in unemployment as reflecting cyclical factors, the long-term unemployment rate is
significantly above levels seen in previous recessions and has declined relatively little since the start
of the recovery. Elevated long-term unemployment raises the risk of a loss of human capital and
attachment to the labor force, and could lead to a lower participation rate. Active labor market
policies, such as training and support for job search, have been shown to improve the employment
prospects of the long-term unemployed and thus should be adequately funded. Temporary tax

32

UNITED STATES 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

incentives to expand labor demand—particularly if targeted toward the long-term unemployed—
are also desirable.
58.
Staff welcomes the progress achieved over the past year in implementing the DoddFrank Act and global financial reforms. Progress included the issuing of final rules on the
submission of resolution plans (“living wills”) for systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs);
the set up of the orderly liquidation authority; the definition of the criteria behind the designation of
SIFIs for enhanced supervision and prudential standards; and the introduction of enhanced capital
standards under rules closely aligned with Basel 2.5 as of January 2013. Also, the United States is
among the jurisdictions that are close to implementing new rules on centralized clearing of overthe-counter derivatives, in line with G-20 commitments.
59.
But more remains to be done to increase the resilience of the U.S. financial system.
Given the size of the industry, its prominence in short-term funding markets, and susceptibility to
runs, strengthening the regulation of money market mutual funds remains critical, especially as the
emergency facility used during the financial crisis to backstop the market is no longer available.
Another important remaining task is to reduce the systemic risk deriving from the dependence of
the tri-party repo market on intraday liquidity provided by the clearing banks. While the Volcker rule
could in principle reduce systemic risk, its effectiveness could be hindered by an expansive
interpretation of exemptions allowed under the law and the migration of risky activities outside of
the regulatory perimeter. It is also important to minimize the potential adverse spillovers of the rule
on foreign entities and markets as well as market liquidity more generally. Removing the uncertainty
related to the implementation of the risk-retention provision of the Dodd-Frank Act may help
encourage a gradual recovery of private securitization and ease mortgage market conditions. Also,
there is a need to fully articulate a medium-term strategy to reduce the role of GSEs, building on the
2011 White Paper, so as to encourage a gradual shift in the mortgage market towards private
institutions.
60.
At the same time, adequate implementation of the new regulation requires providing
appropriate funding to the regulatory and supervisory agencies. Some agencies continue to
experience budgetary constraints that limit their ability to meet the deadlines associated with the
domestic and international reforms, and may hinder their ability to effectively monitor financial
institutions and markets once the new regulations come into force. Staff views the lifting of these
constraints as a high priority.
61.
A multilateral approach to economic policy management remains critical for systemic
countries such as the United States, whose policy actions have significant cross-border effects.
In particular, the fiscal consolidation plan would be consistent with the rebalancing of global
demand and reduction of global imbalances—together with efforts to increase domestic demand in
surplus countries, as highlighted in the G-20 Mutual Assessment Process. At the same time, striking
the right balance between fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic policy support would benefit the
rest of the world, as it would avoid the risk of a spike in U.S. interest rates in the medium term and
an abrupt decline in U.S. growth next year, at a particularly delicate juncture for the world economy.
Given the size of cross-border financial linkages, further progress in implementing financial reforms

coordinated with other jurisdictions in order to closely align key regulations and standards would be
globally beneficial, and reduce the scope for regulatory arbitrage.
62.
We welcome the authorities’ efforts to resist protectionist pressures, while facing a
challenging domestic and global economic environment. We encourage them to continue to
ensure consistency of domestic legislation and practices with WTO principles and international
obligations, including in reforms of agricultural support programs, and to aim for multilateral trade
liberalization, including new approaches as necessary.

This aggregate picture masks important differences across
sectors:

estimates.
Note: Value above zero line denotes tightening of financial
conditions; value below zero line denotes loosening of financial
conditions.



Credit conditions facing large corporates continue to be quite accommodative. Corporates are flush with
cash and have easy access to bond finance, while banks have expanded their commercial and industrial loans.



Credit conditions for small- and medium-sized businesses are less favorable. Small businesses rely
almost exclusively on credit from banks, and banks’ SME lending portfolio is still 15 percent below its peak in
2008. Meanwhile, small- and medium-sized businesses have traditionally relied on personal residence as
collateral and have faced difficulties obtaining credit as the value of home collateral remains low. Still, recent
surveys suggest that concerns about the sales and profit outlook are driving weak demand for credit, rather
than access to credit being a major constraint.



Credit conditions for households remain tight. While consumer loans—e.g., credit cards and auto loans—
are stabilizing, tight mortgage lending conditions have curtailed the amount of credit extended to borrowers.
Notably, new borrowers’ credit scores are higher for both prime and FHA mortgages relative to the pre-crisis
years. Additionally, the unresolved issues in the housing sector—shadow inventory, foreclosures, regulatory
reform—continue to weigh on banks’ appetite and capacity for lending.

Tight financial conditions for households also reflect the
continued weakness of the “shadow” banking system. The
“shadow” banking system—including the GSEs, other assetbacked securities providers, broker/dealers, and finance
companies—played an important role in credit to the real
sector before the crisis, particularly housing finance. With the
reduction of its role after the crisis, credit creation has been
affected, especially mortgages. Indeed, the decline in home
mortgages—from about $11 trillion in 2007 to about
$10 trillion in 2011—roughly mirrors the $1 trillion decline in
the private-label MBS market, while the volume of GSE-backed
MBS is still close to pre-crisis levels. By contrast, corporate
bond issuance rose over the same period.

Box 2. The Effects of Recent U.S. Monetary Policy Actions
The Fed responded to weaker-than-expected U.S. growth
over the past year with a number of unconventional
measures to ease financial conditions and support
economic activity. The FOMC announced in August 2011
that it anticipated exceptionally low federal funds rates at
least through mid-2013, and later (January 2012) extended
the period to late-2014. In September 2011, the Fed restarted
net purchases of MBS to support the housing sector and
launched “Operation Twist” (OT), entailing purchases of up to
$400 billion in U.S. Treasuries with maturities above 6 years
by June 2012, matched by sales of shorter-term securities.

Staff estimates suggest that Operation Twist was effective in reducing long-term U.S. Treasury yields,
but the pass-through to some riskier assets was more than offset by a deteriorating growth outlook.
OT aimed at lowering longer-term yields by expanding the share of the outstanding long-term securities
held by the Fed. While there is a wide range of estimates, results generally suggest that the Fed’s actions
had a significant and persistent impact on long-term Treasury yields.

share of outstanding publicly-held long-term Treasury
securities using regression analysis and controlling for underlying economic conditions. The results
suggest a decline of 11–50 basis points in the ten-year Treasury rate on the basis of the increase in the
Fed’s share of long-term government securities since the announcement of OT (through 2012Q1).

Long-term Treasury and MBS yields also fell following the forward-guidance announcements. By
providing explicit forward guidance on the path of the policy rate over a longer period, the Fed helped to
lower rates across the yield curve. The communication strategy could be particularly effective under the zero
lower bound on policy rates. The 10-year Treasury yields fell by a combined 34 bps in the days following the
FOMC statements, while 30-year government securities and MBS drop 20–48 bps. The impact on other
(riskier) assets was less noticeable, although stock markets rose and investment-grade yields fell somewhat.
The reaction of the U.S. dollar was mixed, depreciating only following the January announcement.
The Fed actions had some impact on mortgage rates. The immediate effect of OT announcement on
mortgage rates was subdued (the 30-year mortgage rate fell 7 basis points); however by end-2011,
mortgage rates had fallen by 15–20 basis points, partially reflecting the Fed’s MBS purchases. In addition,
mortgage rates dropped 10–17 basis points following each of the forward guidance announcements;
however, the drop was more modest than for the 30-year MBS yields, likely reflecting supply constraints and
limited competition.

Box 3. The Health of the U.S. Banking System
Major U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs) have attempted to strengthen their balance sheets in a
challenging operating environment. The major banks have struggled with an environment of low interest rates,
an uncertain macroeconomic and regulatory outlook, financial volatility, and continued legal problems. On the
whole, banks have realized profits, bolstered capital positions, and girded themselves against shocks. The benefits
of these actions were evidenced by most systemic banking institutions performing favorably in the authorities’
Spring 2012 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test. However, banks continue to be
challenged by large European exposures, credit rating downgrades, an uncertain earnings outlook, and investor
concerns escalated by a large bank’s disclosure of a major trading loss due to deficient risk-management
practices. As a result, share prices are low and default risk measures are elevated.

Recent earnings have been volatile and below historical averages. For the full-year 2011, all but one of the 19
CCAR institutions posted positive pre-tax net income. However, banks’ earnings are on average lower than in the
pre-crisis period at the top 4 BHCs, traditional banks, and other major BHCs. While many factors are contributing
to reduced earnings, securitization revenues have been low since the onset of the crisis. Provisioning expenses
have supported earnings; however, releases from loan loss reserves have contributed to leave system-wide reserve
coverage low by historical standards. Trading revenues have gained in prominence at the top 4 BHCs and the
more traditional banks, but they have helped to contribute to significant volatility in net income.

Sources: SNL Financial and Fund staff estimates.

Capitalization has improved substantially since the crisis due to a variety of actions taken by the BHCs. The
ratio of total equity to total assets rose to 9.6 percent in the first quarter of 2012, from a low of 7.5 percent in the
third quarter of 2008. Likewise, the tier 1 common capital ratio has improved from 5 percent at end-2008 to
10.9 percent as of March, as the composition of capital has shifted towards loss-absorbing common capital. To
achieve these gains, the major BHCs have undertaken a variety of measures:
•

Reduced or suspended common dividends. Over 2008–09, 16 of the 18 publicly-traded CCAR institutions cut
common dividends in at least one quarter, in some cases in response to regulators’ orders. As banks have
become more profitable, bolstered capital positions, and passed regulators stress tests, two-thirds of the

UNITED STATES

Box 3. The Health of the U.S. Banking System (continued)
publicly traded institutions increased distributions already and more increases are likely, although current
common dividends per share remain below 2007 levels at most BHCs.
•

Shift toward common equity. New common equity offerings at the CCAR BHCs have totaled more than
$160 billion since 2009. Most transactions occurred as the BHCs raised funds to repay preferred equity issued
through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). New capital issuance has slowed after 2009, when the
largest TARP repayments occurred. Transactions in 2010-11 have financed further CCAR institutions’ TARP
redemptions and acquisitions of new lines of business. Additionally, many BHCs have redeemed trust
preferred securities and other preferred equity ahead of the adoption of new capital rules excluding them
from regulatory capital. In some cases, BHCs replaced these securities with common equity.

•

Reduced regulatory measures of balance-sheet risk. Since end-2009, the CCAR institutions’ total assets have
grown about 10 percent, while risk-weighted assets have decreased 2.8 percent, as banks have recomposed
their balance sheets in favor of safer assets. Consequently, the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets has
fallen to an abnormally low level of 57 percent at the CCAR institutions. Banks have realized a major benefit
from de-risking, since they can hold less capital against their assets to maintain a high capital ratio. According
to staff estimates, the CCAR BHCs would need to raise about $230 billion in capital if they were to achieve
their March tier 1 common capital ratios with a share of risk-weighted assets in total assets in line with
historical norms. These actions have reduced the need for banks to further dilute shareholders. Of the 11
BHCs reporting a reduced share of risk-weighted assets to total assets relative to the pre-crisis average, more
aggressive de-risking was observed at BHCs that had more depressed share prices relative to their 2007
levels.

The results of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) exercise released in March suggest
that the largest U.S. banks would be resilient to a very severe shock. The exercise evaluated the capital
adequacy, including capital distribution plans going forward, of the 19 U.S. largest BHCs until end-2013 under
stressed scenarios, which included a deep recession, with rising unemployment and plummeting asset prices. The
scenario was more severe than those in the 2011 CCAR stress test exercise. Results showed one bank failing to
meet the required Tier 1 capital minimum of 5 percent and an additional three institutions missing the required
thresholds on the basis of their proposed capital distribution plans. The Fed approved the capital distribution
plans of 15 of the 19 institutions and the majority of those outlined increased dividends, share buyback programs
or both. Overall the results were reassuring and broadly in line with expectations.
However, market-based measures of the health of the 6 largest U.S. banks’ show continued investor
concerns, partly reflecting heightened risk aversion worldwide. Recent share prices have remained below their
post-Lehman highs, partly reflecting perceptions of both intensifying risks and a weakening outlook. Heightened
concerns over banks have not been confined to the U.S., as equity prices for Asian and European banks are also
broadly down. In line with depressed share prices, CDS spreads for the 6 largest BHCs have been ratcheting up
recently to levels well above the lows achieved in the post-Lehman era. The rise is due in part to concerns about
individual BHC’s funding structures, exposures to Europe, and expected rating actions, as well as worries about
financial institutions globally—the price for credit protection on European banks’ debts has also risen.

Box 4. Meeting Environmental and Fiscal Objectives with a Carbon Tax
The carbon tax is an effective instrument to reduce environmental risks from carbon emissions.
Atmospheric accumulations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases could raise temperatures by up to
6.5 degrees of Celsius over pre-industrial levels by 2100, with substantial risks to the global economy. A
carbon tax would provide incentives to reduce emissions and invest in energy-efficient and renewable
technologies. Several countries have implemented carbon taxes or similar fiscal instruments—for example,
Finland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark in the early 1990s, and Ireland and Australia more
recently. The U.S. Interagency Working Group recommended a carbon tax of about $20 per metric ton of
CO21 Such a tax could be raised by about 2–5 percent annually in real terms, cutting emissions by 5–
15 percent.
220

The carbon tax could raise substantial new budgetary
revenue, about $100 billion annually, or 0.6 percent of
GDP.2 Imposing the tax could somewhat reduce economic
growth in the short term, but the negative medium-term
effects should be very modest, especially if the new
revenues are used to reduce the national debt or partly
lower the burden of other taxes. The potential negative
effects would also be mitigated by granting U.S. companies
tax credits for purchasing emission offsets abroad—this
strategy would also be supportive of financial flows to
developing countries.

The carbon tax is straightforward to administer. The tax can be applied to the carbon content of fossil
fuel products ‘upstream’ in the supply chain, as a natural extension of the existing motor fuel taxes. The tax
administration would primarily involve approximately 150 petroleum refineries, 500 large natural gas
operators, and about 1,500 coal mines. Motor fuels should not be exempt from the carbon tax as the current
fuel taxes (which should continue to be levied) undercharge for the negative side effects of vehicle use such
as road congestion and local pollution.
The carbon tax would have distributional effects which need to be addressed through targeted
mitigation policies. A $20 carbon charge would increase gasoline prices by about 18 cents a gallon,
electricity prices by 1 cent per kWh, and coal prices by $40 per short ton. The carbon charges tend to be
regressive, but low-income households could be compensated through transfer payments, earned income
tax credits, and higher personal tax thresholds costing less than 10 percent of carbon tax revenues.3 Energyintensive, trade-exposed firms could also be granted transitory production subsidies.

Box 5. Recent Housing Policies and Remaining Frictions
The Administration has adopted, since 2009, a series of programs to address the foreclosure crisis. At
the center of the Administration's response to the housing crisis is the Making Home Affordable (MHA)
program, which was launched in March 2009, and included two key components: the Home Affordable
Refinance Program (HARP) and the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP).
The impact of the modification and refinancing programs has been so far too muted to make a dent
in the foreclosure crisis. Both HAMP and HARP were expected to reach millions of borrowers. While 1.8
million modifications have been initiated under HAMP as of May 2012 (since the program started in April
2009), only one million of these were made permanent. HARP has reached only around a million borrowers,
which is far below the potential given the large share of borrowers who are paying above-market interest
rates in the universe of GSE-owned and guaranteed loans.
More recently, these programs were expanded.
In October 2011, The FHFA expanded HARP by removing restrictions on very high loan-to-value (LTV) loans,
lowering the refinancing fees charged by the GSEs, and easing representations and warranties (the legal
obligation for originators to repurchase badly underwritten mortgages that become delinquent). In Q12012, average monthly HARP refinancing has been around 75 percent higher than its average in 2011. This
suggests that the program has had a material impact on the ability of high LTV borrowers to refinance.
As of June 2012 eligibility criteria for HAMP were loosened by allowing households with lower debt serviceto-income ratios to participate, and incentives for investors to carry out principal reductions under HAMPPRA were tripled. These incentives were also extended to the GSEs. The Federal Housing Finance Agency
(FHFA) is expected to make a final decision on the GSEs’ participation in HAMP. The participation of the GSEs
would increase the impact of the program given their market share.
However, remaining barriers and frictions in the programs could continue to hamper their success.



The recent expansion of HARP has eased representations and warranties only for same-servicer
refinancing. Refinancing with another servicer (cross-servicer refinancing) remains very challenging
for high loan-to-value borrowers. This lack of competition has been a major contributing factor to
the weak refinancing activity.



The disappointing results of the old HAMP have been due to several factors some of which remain
unaddressed under the new version. These include, among others: (a) a misalignment of the
incentives of investors and servicers due to the fact that modifications can be, in some cases, more
costly to servicers than foreclosures, (b) conflicts of interest between senior and junior lien holder, a
problem that the “Second Lien Modification Program” tries to address, and (c) legal frictions due to
ambiguities in the Pooling and Servicing Arrangements which can limit modifications both explicitly
and implicitly.

The Administration has recently proposed to further expand HARP by addressing additional frictions
and extending it to non-GSE loans. In the Administration proposals, representations and warranties on
cross-servicer refinancing would be eased in order to encourage competition on the refinancing market. The
proposal also aims to provide access to low-cost refinancing for non-GSE mortgages through the FHA. Three
recently proposed bills aim at implementing these proposals, but approval by Congress is uncertain. If
approved, the proposed changes would likely lead to a significant increase in refinancing. However, if
rejected, the FHFA has the authority to implement the proposed changes for the GSE market.

Box 6. Progress in Addressing U.S. FSAP Recommendations
Over the last year, further progress has been made in addressing the U.S. FSAP recommendations. The
authorities have continued to advance in the implementation of the DFA, as described also in section E,
which addresses the majority of the U.S. FSAP recommendations.
The restructuring, albeit limited, of the regulatory architecture has been completed. The transfer of the
responsibilities of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) to the OCC, the FDIC, and the Fed has been
completed, and the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
have become fully operational. However, challenges remain in coordinating the regulation and supervision
of commercial banks, thrifts, securities and derivative markets.
Regulation and supervision of the financial sector has been strengthened. The banking agencies have
begun to conduct annual stress tests, including within the CCAR, frequently conduct assessments across the
largest firms and meet periodically, also with foreign regulators, to discuss supervision of these firms. The
Fed proposed a rule to implement stricter prudential regulation for the largest BHCs and for SIFIs. The CFTC
has finalized the regulation of derivative clearing organizations (DCOs) and proposed rules with regard to
capital and margins for un-cleared swaps, and the SEC has proposed rules to improve the risk management
of central clearing counterparties (CCCPs). In the insurance sector, rules to strengthen the supervision of
insurance groups, the regulation of bond insurance and securities lending, and to increase information
sharing among state and federal authorities have been adopted. Resolution plans for large and complex
financial groups, “living wills”, are being finalized to meet the deadlines for submission to regulators which
span over the period between July 1, 2012 and end 2013 according to the size of the group.

Box 7. Recent Proposals on GSEs Reforms
In February 2011, the Administration issued a report to Congress containing three alternative options
for winding down the GSEs and reducing the government’s role in housing finance:
 The first option is a completely privatized system of housing finance, with government insurance
limited to low-income and other special borrowers, such as veterans.
 The second offers a plan similar to the one above, but would develop "a backstop mechanism" to
ensure that new homeowners retain access to credit during a crisis.
 In the third option, the government would continue to leave the mortgage market to private
players, but would offer reinsurance for the securities backed by a targeted range of mortgages.
In February 2012, the FHFA set out a strategic plan outlining the next phase of the conservatorships
of the GSEs, outlining three key strategic goals:

Building a new infrastructure that would allow private investors to replace the GSEs in the
secondary mortgage market including by helping to create a single securitization platform, a
standardized pooling and servicing agreement, and databases that would increase transparency for
borrowers and investors;
 Contracting the GSEs’ footprint and transferring credit risk to private investors through increased
guarantee fees, loss-sharing arrangements, and greater reliance on mortgage insurance;
 Maintaining foreclosure prevention efforts through loan modifications, increased focus on shortsales and other foreclosure alternatives, and the implementation of real estate owned (REO) initiative.
Staff will examine reform plans in future consultations.

Box 8. The U.S. External Sector: Trends and Model-Based Assessments
After staging a strong rebound in late 2010 and early 2011,
capital flows to and from the United States have slowed
significantly with the intensification of global financial
turmoil. During the period 2011Q2–2012Q1 net purchases of
U.S. assets by foreign residents were around 3 percent of GDP,
entirely accounted for by foreign purchases of Treasury
securities. During the same period net purchases of foreign
assets by U.S. residents were virtually zero, with significant FDI
and very modest portfolio outflows offset by a $600bn reduction
in external bank claims (primarily on the euro area, the United
Kingdom, and the Caribbean).
The U.S. NIIP worsened by $1.5 trillion in 2011, reflecting
the current account deficit as well as unfavorable valuation
effects primarily due to the decline in foreign equity prices
(reducing U.S. assets by some $570 billion) and the increase in
the value of U.S. bonds due to lower U.S. interest rates (which
increased U.S. liabilities by some $250 billion). As of end-2011
the NIIP stood at -27 percent of GDP, a relatively modest level
if compared to cumulative net financial flows to the U.S., which
are around 50 percent of GDP, also thanks to largely favorable
net valuation effects over that period. Based on staff
projections for current account balances and growth over the
next five years, the U.S. NIIP would gradually deteriorate to -35
percent of GDP by 2017.
U.S. external assets and liabilities have a different
instrument and currency composition. U.S. external assets
are predominantly denominated in foreign currency, with FDI
and portfolio equity together accounting for over 50 percent of
total assets excluding financial derivatives. Hence the value of
U.S. external assets (and the U.S. NIIP) tends to decline in
periods of stress on global stock markets and an appreciating
dollar. In contrast, the lion share of U.S. external liabilities are
dollar-denominated and consist of debt instruments,
consistent with the central role of U.S. government debt
securities as reserve assets. U.S. portfolio debt liabilities
account for about 45 percent of total U.S. liabilities and about
60 percent of U.S. GDP.

The U.S. dollar has appreciated in recent months (some
7 percent since its trough in July 2011) but remains some
10 percent below its long-run average. An alternative measure of international relative prices constructed
by the Federal Reserve Board (measuring the level of U.S. prices relative to those prevailing in its trading
partners) is instead closer to its long-run average, reflecting on the one hand the depreciated level of the
dollar, and on the other hand the shift in U.S. trading partners over time towards countries with lower price
levels than advanced economies.

Box 8. The U.S. External Sector: Trends and Model-Based Assessments (continued)
Model-based current account and exchange rate assessments
Model-based estimates suggest that the current account deficit is above its medium-term norm and
that the real exchange rate is moderately overvalued. Specifically, staff’s analysis finds that a structural
current account deficit of 1½–2½ percent of GDP over the medium term (implying a current account
adjustment of 1–2 percent of GDP relative to the staff baseline) and real exchange rate depreciation of about
0‒15 percent would be consistent with fundamentals and desirable policy settings.



Under the new External Balance Approach (EBA), estimates of “policy gaps” (measuring deviations of
domestic and partner-country policies, such as the relative fiscal stance or reserve accumulation, from
“desirable” levels) imply a current account gap for the United States of around 2 percent of GDP.1
Similarly, CGER current account methodologies (such as the MB and ES approaches) find current
account gaps of around 1-2 percent of GDP.



Estimates based on real exchange rate models in both EBA and CGER tend to find little sign of
overvaluation (0 to 5 percent), with the worsening in fundamentals, such as the terms of trade and the
NIIP, broadly offset by the weakness of the dollar relative to its historical average (see above). Measures
of relative international price levels, such as the WARP—which find U.S. prices relative to those in
trading partners closer to their long-run average—could be consistent with somewhat higher
overvaluation, given the weak fundamentals. The estimates for real exchange rate misalignment from
the current-account based methodologies mentioned above are in the 5–15 percent range, implying an
overall model-based range of about 0–15 percent.

Nature/Source of

1. “Fiscal cliff”

Overall Level of Concern
Likelihood of Severe Realization
of Threat in the Next 1–3 Years
(high, medium, or low)
Low
Political gridlock could trigger a
much larger fiscal withdrawal than
envisaged in our baseline scenario.

2. Lack of
medium term
plan for fiscal
consolidation

Low
Failure to agree on a credible plan
to put the federal debt on a
sustainable medium-term path
could lead to a gradual erosion of
the reserve currency status of the
U.S. dollar and upward pressure on
Treasury bond yields.

3. Weaker

Low
Faster-than-anticipated
transitioning of units in foreclosure
into distressed sales

4. Contagion
from Euro area
debt crisis

Medium
A significant worsening of the euro
area debt crisis may affect the
United States through trade and
financial channels

Expected Impact if
Threat is Realized
(high, medium, or low)
High
A fiscal consolidation of over
4 percent of GDP in 2013 would
reduce annual growth to around
zero.
High
Loss of confidence and higher
interest rates would undermine the
recovery of private domestic
demand, and have severe financial
market repercussions, domestically
and internationally, given the central
role played by US Treasuries in
global financial markets.
Medium
This could further weaken house
prices in the near term. A 10 percent
decline in house prices relative to
the baseline would subtract about
0.3 percent from 2013 growth.
Medium
Impact would occur through the
trade channel, and a tightening of
financial conditions, including stress
in MMMFs.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED STATES

ANNEX II. UNITED STATES: PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS (DSA)
1.
Congress has legislated about $2.1 trillion in medium-term fiscal consolidation
measures.


The Budget Control Act adopted in August 2011 capped discretionary spending, saving
about $900 bn over 10 years relative to the CBO baseline.



The Act will trigger additional savings in the form of automatic appropriations cuts
(“sequester”) worth $1.2 trillion over 10 years. Unless modified by Congress, the cuts are
scheduled to come into effect in January 2013.

2.
Despite these substantial legislated savings, U.S. public finances remain on an
140

unsustainable trajectory. Under the staff’s baseline

GDP by CY2021.
3.
Furthermore, the fiscal projections are being substantially improved by the current low
interest rates environment. Reflecting the weak economy, highly accommodative monetary policy,
and the safe haven status of the United States, real interest rates have fallen well below GDP growth.
As a result, the debt-stabilizing primary balance is currently negative (Annex Table) and will remain
so over the standard 5-year DSA horizon despite the staff’s projection for a substantial increase in
Treasury yields over the medium term. In staff’s view, however, aiming for a medium-term primary
surplus of at least 1 percent of GDP would be appropriate to put the public debt ratio firmly on a
downward path, while building a sufficient margin for the higher interest costs of public debt
(Treasury bond yields are projected to continue growing beyond the 5-year DSA window). As
discussed in the IMF’s Fiscal Monitor, the targeted primary surplus would be even higher in the long
run to bring the debt ratio closer to the pre-crisis levels by 2030.
4.
Sensitivity analysis. The analysis in Annex Figure suggests that the public debt dynamics is
highly sensitive to growth and interest rate assumptions, primarily reflecting the fact that the U.S.
public ratio already exceeds 100 percent of GDP.

Payments Restrictions. The United States accepted Article VIII of the IMF's Articles of

Agreement and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions and multiple currency practices
with the exception of limited restrictions on certain payments and transfers imposed for security
reasons. The United States currently administers approximately 30 economic sanctions programs,
which restrict certain payments and transfers for transactions against particular foreign
governments, entities, and individuals. The United States administers, inter alia, sanctions programs
relating to Burma, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Sudan, and continues to block certain previously
frozen assets of the former Yugoslavia. Several other sanctions programs, including those relating to
Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Somalia, Syria, Western Balkans, and Zimbabwe are “list-based” programs,
affecting only members of certain government regimes and other individuals and groups whose

activities have been determined to threaten the foreign policy or economy of the United States. The
United States also implements similar list-based sanctions programs against: narcotics traffickers;
terrorism-related governments, entities, and individuals; and proliferators of weapons of mass
destruction.

Article IV Consultation. The 2011 Article IV consultation was concluded in July 2011 and

the Staff Report was published as IMF Country Report No. 11/201. A fiscal ROSC was completed in
the context of the 2003 consultation. An FSAP involved two missions, during October 14–November
3, 2009 and February 17–March 12, 2010. The FSSA was discussed at the board, together with the
2010 Article IV Consultation, on July 26, 2010.
The 2012 Article IV discussions were conducted from May 21–June 8, 2012. Concluding meetings
with Treasury Secretary Geithner and Chairman Bernanke of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System occurred on June 27 and July 3rd, respectively. The Managing Director, Ms. Lagarde,
and WHD Director, Mr. Eyzaguirre, participated in the concluding meetings. A press conference on
the consultation was held on July 3, 2012. The team comprised (at different times) Gian Maria MilesiFerretti (head), Roberto Cardarelli, Oya Celasun, Francesco Columba, Jihad Dagher, Geoffrey Keim,
Eric Le Borgne, Paulo Medas, Martin Sommer, and Julien Reynaud (all WHD); Sally Chen (SPR); and
Stephen Smith (MCM), with contributions from Jack Grigg, Thornton Matheson, and Ian Parry (FAD);
Nadia Rendak, Andrew Giddings, Yan Liu, Steve Dawe and Emmanuel Mathias (LEG); John Kiff
(MCM), Ranil Salgado, Marshall Mills, Katrin Elborgh-Woytek and Lars Engstrom (SPR).
Ms. Lundsager (Executive Director) and Mr. Lindquist (Advisor) attended some of the meetings.
Outreach included discussions with the private sector and think tanks. Unless an objection from the
authorities of the United States is received prior to the conclusion of the Board’s consideration, the
document will be published.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV
July 27, 2012

CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Approved By

Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti and Tamim Bayoumi

This Supplement contains additional information on staff estimates of current account and
real exchange rate gaps, capital flows, reserve policies, and the international investment
position (IIP) that underpin the exchange rate assessments presented in the Staff Report (¶46
and Box 8). On the first two criteria, the estimates rely on CGER methodologies (as described
in IMF Occasional Paper 267), as well as EBA methodologies (as described in an annex of the
Pilot External Assessment Report (www.imf.org).
•
CGER estimates have been updated to take into account changes in real exchange
rates and macroeconomic projections between the reference period for the Spring 2012
World Economic Outlook (on which the estimates are based) and June 2012, as well as staff’s
estimates for trade elasticities.
•
EBA estimates have been updated to reflect changes in real exchange rates,
underlying current account estimates, and other fundamentals between the period for which
the gap is estimated (the year 2011 for the current account regression, the Spring 2012 WEO
reference period for the real exchange rate regression) and June 2012.
The estimates are presented in the Table below. Overall, they are consistent with staff’s
assessment of a current account deficit 1–2 percentage points of GDP weaker than the value
implied by fundamentals and desirable policies in the U.S. and its trading partners and with
staff’s view of a moderate real exchange rate overvaluation (0–15 percent).
Turning to the other three criteria, the United States has a negative IIP (particularly large in
debt securities), continued net portfolio debt inflows, and low levels of reserves. While these
would normally imply a significant potential vulnerability, risks are limited given the dollar’s
role as the world’s major reserve currency and associated safe haven status.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the United States
July 30, 2012
1.
This note reports on information that has become available since the staff report
(SM/12/192) was issued and does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Data released since the completion of the Article IV consultation in early July
point to a slowdown in near-term growth. Annualized real GDP growth is estimated at
1.5 percent for the second quarter, marginally lower than staff’s projection of 1.7 percent and
lower than the 2 percent growth estimated for the first quarter. The deceleration was largely
due to a slowdown in private consumption growth, likely reflecting the run up in gasoline
prices through April, and slower job creation and lower income expectations in the face of
growing uncertainty. The national accounts revisions released on July 27th indicate that
growth was lower in 2010 and higher in 2011 than previously thought.
3.
On July 18, 2012, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) designated
eight financial market utilities as systemically important, subjecting them to Fed
supervision and heightened prudential standards. The designated utilities perform a variety of
functions, including the clearing and settlement of cash, securities, and derivatives
transactions. On the same date, the FSOC published its second annual report, followed by the
issuance of the inaugural annual report of the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Financial Research
on July 20th. The potential threats to U.S. financial stability identified in these reports are
largely in line with those highlighted in the Staff Report.
4.
Financial conditions do not appear to have changed noticeably since the end of
the consultation, despite intensified financial stresses in the euro area. Second-quarter
earnings for major U.S. financial institutions were mostly above expectations, mainly as
lower provisioning expenses offset the negative impact of lower trading profits, sluggish loan
growth, and low interest rates. The pick-up in mortgage refinancing activity under the Home
Affordable Refinancing Program has also boosted revenues. CDS spreads on major U.S.
banks and equity prices for financial institutions remain around their end-June levels.
5.
Two notable analytical reports have been published on the fiscal policy front.
First, the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation have examined
implications of the recent Supreme Court ruling on health care reform. Since the ruling has
effectively allowed states to choose whether to expand eligibility for coverage under their
Medicaid program, it is projected that about 3 million more people than initially estimated
will remain uninsured once the reform is implemented, implying lower federal government
spending (around $84 billion over a decade). Second, a task force headed by Richard Ravitch
and Paul Volcker highlighted well-known problems with state and local budgets, such as
unfunded pension and health care liabilities and lack of transparency in accounting practices.
Many of the task force recommendations are in line with those of staff—as described, for
example, in the Selected Issues Paper “Fiscal Challenges Facing the U.S. State and Local
Governments” (IMF Country Report No. 11/202).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with the
United States
On July 30, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United States.1
Background
The U.S. economy continues to grow at a tepid pace of around 2 percent, employment remains
well below pre-crisis levels, and the housing market is stabilizing but remains depressed. Strong
headwinds persist on private consumption, as households continue to deleverage amid weak—
albeit stabilizing—house prices. Business fixed investment seems to have lost some momentum
recently, despite the extraordinarily low borrowing costs and relatively favorable financial
conditions facing the corporate sector. Residential construction has been improving, but from very
low levels. Exports decelerated throughout the last year, in line with generally slower growth in
foreign demand. The U.S. current account deficit has remained broadly stable. Overall, the slow
pace of the recovery is consistent with past international experience in the aftermath of housing
and financial crises.
Monetary policy remains highly accommodative, and the Federal Reserve responded to weakerthan-expected growth over the past year with a number of easing actions. Fiscal policy has begun
weighing on growth, as the budget deficit is being gradually reduced. Continued progress has
been made on implementation of the financial reform program, in line with the Dodd-Frank Act as
well as the international regulatory reform agenda.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with
officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities.

2

Growth is likely to remain moderate in 2012 and 2013, constrained by household deleveraging,
fiscal restraint, and subpar global demand. Following a robust rebound after the recession,
private investment in equipment and software is projected to expand at a slower pace, though it
will remain a strong contributor to growth. After six consecutive years of declines, residential
investment is projected to start making positive contributions to growth. A stronger dollar and
weaker global demand are projected to weigh on exports. Headline and core inflation are
projected to remain subdued, reaching the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent goal over the medium
term. Downside risks around the outlook have intensified, including from the worsening of the
euro area debt crisis as well as the uncertainty over domestic fiscal plans. On the financial sector
front, the outlook for the U.S. banking system is broadly positive but subject to risks from an
intensification of stresses in global financial markets.
With regard to policy actions, the Federal Reserve has indicated that economic conditions are
likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through late 2014, and
unveiled plans to further extend the average maturity of its securities holdings. The authorities
recently enacted measures to ease mortgage modifications and refinancing. Last summer,
Congress legislated budgetary savings worth about $2.1 trillion over the next decade, but
negotiations regarding additional measures to reduce deficits over the medium term have been
unsuccessful so far. The fiscal outlook for next year is extraordinarily uncertain given the large
number of expiring tax provisions and scheduled automatic spending cuts.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the continuing moderate economic recovery in the United States,
while noting the downside risks to the outlook stemming from external and domestic
uncertainties. Directors called on U.S. policymakers to use effectively the limited policy space
available to support the recovery in the near term and restore medium term fiscal sustainability
with a balanced approach to consolidation. This will be important also to assist the global
recovery, given the systemic importance of the United States.
Directors highlighted the need to adopt a measured pace of deficit reduction that does not sap the
recovery. In particular, Directors agreed that removing the uncertainty created by the “fiscal cliff”
in 2013 and promptly raising the debt ceiling are both critical. They stressed the importance of
agreeing as early as possible on a comprehensive medium term fiscal consolidation plan, based
on both higher revenues and lower entitlement spending, that would stabilize the debt ratio by
mid decade and gradually reduce it afterwards.
Directors broadly agreed that monetary policy will need to remain highly accommodative for quite
some time. Most Directors considered that there is room for further easing should the outlook
deteriorate, although a number of Directors observed that the effectiveness of additional
monetary easing could be limited in the prevailing very low interest rate environment. Some

3
Directors highlighted the potential adverse global spillover effects of very low interest rates
through capital flows and higher commodity prices. Directors also noted that, while the United
States external current account deficit has declined, the external position remains weaker than
justified by fundamentals and desired policies.
Directors welcomed the recent actions and proposals by the Administration to bolster the housing
market, and urged their timely and aggressive implementation. Given the importance of the
housing sector to the economic recovery, Directors concurred that further measures may be
needed, including measures to facilitate the conversion of foreclosed houses into rental units,
allowing mortgages to be modified in personal bankruptcy courts, and facilitating refinancing on a
larger scale.
Directors welcomed the slowly improving conditions in the labor market. They noted that
persistently high long term unemployment creates the risks of human capital losses and reduced
attachment to the labor force. They concurred that training and job-search support should be
adequately funded, and temporary tax incentives should be implemented to help reduce long
term unemployment.
Directors commended the authorities for the significant progress achieved over the past year in
implementing domestic and international financial reforms. They emphasized the need to
increase the resilience of the U.S. financial system, including by strengthening the regulation of
money market mutual funds, finalizing the Volcker Rule with due consideration of its cross border
implications, accelerating the adoption of Basel III capital rules, and winding down the role of
government-sponsored entities. They encouraged the authorities to strengthen coordination of
financial sector regulation and supervision, and to allocate appropriate resources to regulatory
and supervisory agencies.
Directors stressed the importance of a multilateral approach to economic policy management in
the United States, and commended the United States for its active engagement in fostering
international coordination on financial regulatory reforms. They underscored that the United
States can make important contributions to global growth and stability by adopting a credible
medium term plan for fiscal consolidation at a pace that does not undermine the recovery, as well
as by further strengthening its financial sector. Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued
commitment to secure the success of multilateral trade negotiations.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's views
and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post
assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after
Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a
particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2012 Article
IV Consultation with the United States is also available.
