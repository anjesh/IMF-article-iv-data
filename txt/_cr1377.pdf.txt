STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
FIFTH REVIEW UNDER THE POLICY SUPPORT INSTRUMENT,
AND REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION OF ASSESSMENT
CRITERIA

KEY ISSUES
Rwanda faces two main challenges: Near term, conducting policy and maintaining
macroeconomic stability under highly uncertain prospects for donor aid and the global
environment; medium-term, sustaining strong growth and poverty reduction while
gradually reducing high dependence on foreign aid.
Outlook and risks: Growth is projected to ease to 7.7 percent in 2012 and settle
around 7 percent over the medium term. Risks to the outlook mainly stem from
possible cutbacks in aid, spillovers from the crisis in Europe and the weak global
environment, and higher food and petroleum prices.
Policy discussions centered on four themes: sustaining rapid inclusive growth over the
medium term; strengthening fiscal policy so it can contribute to growth in the face of
declining external aid; enhancing the monetary policy framework and strengthening
the financial sector to support macroeconomic stability and growth; and maintaining
external stability through increased exports and a strong debt management policy.
Main policy recommendations:


Align spending priorities in FY 2012/13 with available financing. Stand ready to
scale back spending should delays in aid disbursements extend beyond the current
fiscal year.



Use the proceeds of the eurobond exclusively to retire short-term debt and
complete strategic investment projects as planned.



Review recommendations of the recent technical assistance mission to strengthen
domestic revenue mobilization.



Strengthen the monetary policy framework and foreign exchange market reforms
to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and ensure that the exchange rate
responds better to market fundamentals.



Staff supports the granting of a waiver for the nonobservance of the Quantitative
Assessment Criterion (QAC) on NDF, the conclusion of the PSI 5th review, and the
modification of end-December 2012 QACs.

THE CONTEXT
1.
Rwanda has been an economic
success story. Real GDP growth averaged
above 8 percent a year in the last decade;
inflation has been subdued since 2009;
foreign reserves has been kept at adequate
levels; poverty declined from about
57 percent in 2005/06 to below 45 percent in
2010/11, and income inequality declined
notably.
2.
Strong policies have played a key
role in Rwanda’s continued success:


Fiscal and monetary policies centered on
maintaining macroeconomic stability
(Box 1).



Concerted efforts to improve public
financial management (PFM), maintain
good governance, and reform the business
environment—placing Rwanda among the
top African economies in the World Bank‘s
Doing Business Index.



A deliberate focus on mobilizing and using
foreign aid in support of economic
development and poverty reduction.



An economy that increasingly benefits
from opening up to new products and new
markets.



A strong emphasis on homegrown and
adapted interventions to enhance the
inclusiveness of growth, and strengthen
the provision of social services, especially
to the rural poor, as shown in the recent
household survey.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

3.
The mission took place amid high
uncertainty regarding donor assistance. A
number of bilateral and multilateral donors
have delayed budget support disbursements
for FY2012/13. The delayed budget support
envelope is estimated at about 3 percent of
GDP.
4.
The challenges ahead are sustaining
this good economic performance under
highly uncertain prospects for donor aid and
the global environment; and, in the medium
term, sustaining strong growth and poverty
reduction while gradually winding down
Rwanda‘s high dependence on foreign aid.
5.
Overcoming these challenges will
require continued prudent economic
management in the near term, and further
progress addressing Rwanda‘s key
vulnerabilities in the medium term: low
government revenue, high aid dependency,
narrow export base, and weak infrastructure.

RWANDA

Box 1. Rwanda’s Response to the 2010 Article IV Consultation’s Key Recommendations


Fiscal policy. Unwind fiscal stimulus and embark on a medium-term path of fiscal consolidation;
complement revenue mobilization efforts with tax policy reforms
Progress: fiscal policy has been aligned with the macroeconomic framework agreed on with the IMF.
Revenue mobilization efforts centered until recently on tax administration, and are now being
complemented by tax policy recommendations from a recent Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) technical
assistance (TA) mission.



Monetary policy. Review regularly the monetary stance to enable timely response to inflationary pressures;
use more actively the policy rate, and introduce reforms toward greater exchange rate flexibility.
Progress: monetary policy has been generally accommodative, in the context of low inflation. The national
Bank of Rwanda (NBR) has become more proactive recently, raising the key repo rate in May for the third
time since October 2011.



Export diversification. Improve business environment and step up efforts to broaden the export base.
Progress: the authorities have developed a National Export Strategy (NES), and established a high-level
coordinating body, the Industrial Development and Export Council (IDEC), to oversee its implementation.
The IDEC is to identify priority expenditures to advance the NES within the existing budgetary envelope.



Access to finance. Enhance the competition in the banking sector, and strengthen the supervisory capacity
of microfinance institutions, while improving access to finance.
Progress: the 2011 FSAP update found that the banking system has recovered from a period of
restructuring and banks are well capitalized, and competition among banks has increased. Challenges relate
to the strengthening of the frameworks for the supervision of credit cooperatives.

POSITIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
6.
Growth continued to be strong in
the first half of 2012, but is projected to
slow in the second half of the year. The
Rwandan economy grew by 8.6 percent
year-on-year in the first half of 2012, driven
by the construction and services sectors
(Table 1, and Figures 1 and 2). However, for
the whole of 2012, real GDP growth is
projected to ease to about 7.7 percent, in part
because of weaker agricultural output in the
second half of the year and lower-thanplanned government spending caused by
delays in budget support disbursements by
some donors.
7.
Inflation has declined, mainly in
response to slowing import prices for food
and petroleum products. Headline inflation
declined to 5.6 percent in September 2012
while core inflation was down to 2.1 percent

(Figure 4). Inflation is however, expected to
pick up toward the end of the year, to
7.5 percent, buoyed by increased domestic
fresh food prices owing to poor weather and
the lagged effects of higher exchange rate
depreciation since mid 2012.
8.
The current account deficit has
widened because of strong import growth
and delays in aid inflows. Exports of goods
and services have remained strong in 2012,
because rising mineral exports and markedly
higher tea prices have more than offset lower
prices for a number of traditional exports,
including coffee. Meanwhile, imports have
increased rapidly driven by higher imports of
capital goods and materials for the
construction sector. Moreover, aid delays
have resulted in lower official transfers. As a
result, the current account deficit (including
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

RWANDA

aid inflows) has widened, and for 2012, is
projected to reach about 11.3 percent of GDP.

offset by under-execution of domestically
financed capital expenditures.

9.
Efforts at fiscal policy consolidation
continued in FY2011/12. The overall fiscal
deficit (cash basis, after grants), was
0.7 percent of GDP lower than targeted
(Table 3). This was the result of
greater-than-projected revenue and lower
spending. The higher revenue reflected higher
income tax revenue on account of an
unexpectedly large clearance of arrears and
higher revenue from taxes on goods and
services and international trade (boosted by
higher imports). On the spending side,
higher-than-budgeted current spending,
mainly on wages and salaries, was more than

10.
Monetary policy has been
tightened since mid-2012, following an
extended period of accommodation.
Against a background of rapid growth in
broad money and credit to the private sector
in the first half of the year (Table 4, Figure 5),
the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) raised its
key repo rate (policy rate) in May 2012 by 50
basis points (to 7.5 percent) and increased the
use of repo operations to mop up excess
liquidity. As of end-October, the exchange
rate depreciated by 3.7 percent since the
beginning of the year.

SATISFACTORY PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
11.
Performance under the PSI remains
strong. With one exception, all end-June
quantitative assessment criteria (QAC) and
indicative targets were met (MEFP Table 1).
The quantitative assessment criterion on net
domestic financing (NDF) was missed by a
small margin,1 for which the staff supports the
granting of a waiver because it is minor and
has no bearing on program performance.
12.
The structural reform agenda is
moving ahead, albeit with some delays.
Seven of 11 structural benchmarks (SBs) have
been met, of which two with delay (MEFP
Table 2). The SBs the publication of quarterly
budget execution report (continuous), and
the preparation of own DSA have been met
with some delays, mainly owing to capacity
constraints. Four SBs have not been met: The

medium-term debt management strategy will
be submitted to Cabinet in late November
2012. The benchmarks on the revision of the
investment code, introduction of electronic
tax registers and the completion of technical
specifications for the integrated financial
management information system (IFMIS) are
expected to be completed in the first half of
2013.

RWANDA

FAVORABLE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK BUT RISING RISKS
A. Baseline Scenario
13.
The macroeconomic outlook
remains generally favorable, provided
delays in budget support disbursements
are temporary. The baseline macroeconomic
framework assumes (i) budget support will
resume in the second half of FY 2012/13; and
(ii) issuance of a US$350million eurobond
before end-2012 to retire unfavorable debt
and to finance the completion of the Kigali
Convention Center (KCC):
 Growth is projected at 7.7 percent in 2012
and 7.6 percent in 2013, driven by
expansion in services and construction, and
to stabilize at around 7 percent over the
medium term.
 Inflation is projected to continue its
convergence toward the authorities

medium-term target of 5 percent (in line
with the East African Community, EAC,
convergence criterion on inflation), largely
driven by lower import prices for food and
fuel.

B. Downside Risks
14.
Risks arise mainly from possible
cutbacks in aid and a more challenging
global environment. The mission focused
discussions on the macroeconomic
implications of a potential downside scenario
(Box 2). Under this scenario, delays in budget
support are assumed to extend beyond the
current fiscal year. Staff estimated such delays
could lower growth in 2013 by 1½ percentage
points and possibly more, depending on
magnitude of the second round effects.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
Discussions focused on policies to
mitigate short-term risks and preserve hard
won macroeconomic stability, and reforms
to raise Rwanda’s competitiveness and
growth potential. Staff and the authorities
organized the discussions around four themes:
(i) sustaining rapid, inclusive growth;
(ii) strengthening fiscal discipline while

remaining supportive of growth in the face of
declining external aid; (iii) modernizing the
monetary policy framework and strengthening
financial sector reforms in support of financial
deepening and greater access to credit; and
(iv) underpinning external stability through
export diversification and improved
competitiveness.

Box 2. Rwanda: The Downside Scenario—Impact of Protracted Delays in Aid
The baseline assumes delayed budget support from the first half of FY2012/13 (about 3 percent of GDP)
will be disbursed in the second half of the fiscal year, minimizing the macroeconomic impact. However, a
further delay in budget support could have a much more significant macroeconomic impact. This has
been estimated using two possible scenarios:


Scenario 1. The government adjusts fully to the shortfall in donor funds by cutting domesticallyfinanced capital spending and the central bank refrains from intervening in the foreign exchange
market because of concerns about the level of reserves. The direct hit to investment amounts to
3 percent of GDP and the direct impact on growth is estimated at about 1½ percentage points
(assuming an import content of investment of 50 percent). Further, in the absence of alternative
external financing, imports would decline and inflation would rise.



Scenario 2. The government could attempt to respond to the loss in aid by resorting to domestic
financing to fill the funding gap. The direct impact on growth would be smaller than in Scenario 1,
but the impact on inflation would be larger.

Two caveats are in order: first, the two scenarios are based on a relatively limited delay in aid
disbursements; the suspension of budget support for all of 2013 would have twice as large direct
effects as those outlined above. Second, the scenarios do not consider second round effects on private
sector investment, growth, the exchange rate, and inflation which could be much larger. Sharply lower
levels of investment and growth and higher rates of inflation would lead to a contraction in real
household incomes and consumption. The social situation could deteriorate rapidly, particularly in
Kigali, because unemployment in construction and other sectors dependent on domestic demand
would rise. The poor and vulnerable, including day laborers in construction and their dependents,
would be especially hard hit.

A. Sustaining Rapid, Inclusive
Growth
16.
The Rwandan government remains
committed to an ambitious economic
growth and poverty reduction agenda over
the medium and long term. Its main
objective, articulated in its Vision 2020 and
being incorporated in its second Economic
Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy
(EDPRS II), envisages Rwanda becoming a
middle-income country by 2020 and the
poverty rate falling below 30 percent by
2017/18 (Box 3). The government recognizes
that these are ambitious goals, which would,

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

among other things, require average annual
real growth of 11½ percent. The mission team
lauded the authorities for their ambitious
agenda and their emphasis on inclusive
growth and poverty reduction, but noted the
importance of basing the EDPRSII and the PSI
medium-term scenario on resources that have
already been identified.
17.
The authorities agreed with the
mission that for purposes of policy design,
the medium-term macroeconomic
framework in the EDPRS II and for the PSI
program should be based on prudent
growth assumptions. Real GDP growth is
projected to moderate over the medium term

RWANDA

to about 7 percent a year. Such growth is
consistent with the prevailing domestic and
external environment, a gradual decline in
public investment-to-GDP ratio necessitated
by the projected decline in aid inflows,
gradually increasing domestic resource
mobilization, and recourse to external
commercial borrowing limited to complete
large strategic projects currently underway.
The government medium-term fiscal program
would remain anchored on two key objectives:
to limit recourse to domestic financing and
avoid crowding out private sector credit
growth; and to preserve debt sustainability.
18.
The mission highlighted the
challenge of scaling up public investment
and the associated resource requirements
using a dynamic general equilibrium model.
The authorities appreciated the discussion and
said they would draw on the simulation results
in the development of their EDPRS II. The
simulations show that scaled-up investment
would provide a boost to growth but
mobilizing the required resources for the

additional investment would be challenging
(Box 4). For example, relying only on domestic
resources would lead to unrealistic increases in
taxation and excessive crowding out of
consumption and private investment.
Conversely, relying solely on external
commercial borrowing would quickly lead to
an unsustainable buildup in external debt.
Simulations that incorporate a combination of
increases in tax revenue, expenditure
rationalization, and judicious resort to external
borrowing are the most realistic. The
simulations also demonstrate the importance
of relying to the extent possible on
concessional loans, and of the efficiency of the
public investment process—converting the
largest possible share of the investment into
effective capital. The authorities appreciated
the discussion and said they would draw on
the simulation results in the development of
their EDPRS II.

Box 3. Rwanda: The Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy II (EDPRS II)
The Rwandan authorities are, along with stakeholders, in the process of articulating their next poverty
reduction strategy, the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) II for the period
2013/14-2017/18. The authorities expect to submit it to Cabinet in early 2013.
The authorities are mostly satisfied with the progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs,
Appendix IV) achieved under the EDPRS I covering the period 2007/8-2012/13, particularly when compared
with what was achieved under the previous poverty reduction strategy. They emphasized that, while output
growth, including in agriculture, remained high throughout, the rate of reduction in the poverty headcount
has accelerated. They attribute this to an enhanced focus on the inclusiveness of growth and specific
interventions aimed at tackling rural poverty. These include policies to change the composition of
agricultural output from sweet potatoes and bananas (suitable for making alcoholic beverages) to wheat,
and cassava (more nutritious) and the distribution of cows and small livestock (goats etc.) to the vulnerable
among the rural population. The authorities regard the latter as a form of social protection.
For EDPRS II, the authorities are determined to build on the achievements under EDPRS I and do even
better. Their objectives are to sustain rapid economic growth in all sectors, accompanied by a structural
transformation of the economy away from agriculture to industry and services and the narrowing of the
external trade deficit. While they would like to see, consistent with Rwanda reaching middle-income country
status by 2020, growth of 11½ percent per annum going forward, they admit that such a scenario is
contingent on external financing that is currently not available. For immediate policy purposes, the
macroeconomic framework is based on external resources that have already been identified.
The EPDRS II will focus on four thematic areas supported by ongoing attention to foundational issues. The
thematic areas are: (i) economic transformation, seen as essential for high growth; (ii) rural development,
seen as essential for poverty reduction; (iii) productivity and youth employment, seen as essential for
economic development; and (iv) accountable governance, seen essential for citizen engagement and
ownership. The foundational issues include continued commitment to macroeconomic stability, sound
public financial management, social protection, early childhood development and basic education, and
primary healthcare and the fight against malnutrition.
Specific policies to underpin the inclusiveness of growth and rural development include measures to further
increase agricultural productivity, not least through land consolidation, and population settlements (villages)
to lower the cost of provision of basic infrastructure, such as roads and electricity, and increase urbanization.

Box 4. Rwanda: Simulations of the Public Investment-Growth Nexus
Staff is collaborating with the authorities on a project to estimate the impact of scaling up public investment on
growth in Rwanda using a dynamic general equilibrium (DGE) model with low-income county characteristics.1
The goal is to explore how Rwanda can sustain rapid growth going forward, in particular the role that public
investment can play. The model has been used for a number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere.
A key feature of the model is that public investment is productive and complementary to private capital.
Thus, raising public investment gives a boost to economic growth. However, the government faces a budget
constraint and must finance any additional investment through tax increases (or spending cuts) or
borrowing (domestic, or external concessional or non-concessional). The model also allows for a variable
efficiency of public investment, i.e. the rate at which investment is converted into productive capital. To the
extent possible, the model has been calibrated to reflect data on the structure of the Rwandan economy.
In contrast to some of the other country cases, Rwanda has already seen a significant scaling up of public
investment and enjoyed rapid economic growth in the last decade. The medium-term macroeconomic
framework in fact assumes some scaling down of public investment along with a decline in inflows, with real
GDP growth gradually easing to an annual rate of about 7 percent.
One set of simulations, incorporating the assumed paths for public investment and aid used in the
macroeconomic framework, broadly confirms the internal consistency of the framework and established a
baseline. The other simulations focus on scaled-up investment paths for different assumptions regarding the
financing of the additional investment. A common theme of the simulations is that a substantial scaling up
of public investment (in the order of 5 percentage points of GDP a year over 10 years) is required to
generate a significant boost to economic growth (a cumulative 10-20 percentage points during the
simulation).
However, such scaling up of investment requires large amounts of resources. Covering this resource need
solely through additional tax revenue requires a prohibitive rate of taxation (more than double the current
rate) that sharply compresses consumption. On the other hand, drawing exclusively on external commercial
borrowing rapidly undermines external debt sustainability. The most promising approach is one that
combines a realistic increase in domestic resource mobilization over the medium term, takes advantage of
all available concessional financing, and judiciously resorts to commercial borrowing. The level of efficiency
of public investment, a broad proxy for the quality of institutions and processes, is also of paramount
importance.

B. Fiscal Policy: Supporting
Growth in the Face of Declining Aid
19.
Fiscal policy for FY 2012/13 remains
broadly in line with the PSI objectives. The
baseline fiscal framework differs from the
approved FY 2012/13 budget mainly in two
respects:

It assumes that budget support
committed for the first half of FY2012/13 but
not delivered will be disbursed in the second
half of the fiscal year. The government has
appropriately postponed some spending to
the second half of the fiscal year to avoid
excessive resort to domestic financing. The
authorities have also identified contingent
spending items—amounting to about
0.4 percent of GDP—that will not be
undertaken if specified components of
committed budget support, deemed at highest
risk of prolonged delay, are not disbursed in
the course of the fiscal year. More generally,
the authorities committed to adjust policies by
reducing spending or increasing the revenue
to make up for shortfalls in financial assistance
relative to the
MEFP ¶52
program.

It incorporates the issuance before
end-2012 of a eurobond in the amount of
US$350 million, the proceeds of which will be
on-lent to the Kigali Convention Center (KCC)
and Rwandair to retire governmentguaranteed loans (US$200 million) as well as
to finance the completion of the KCC project

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

(US$150million) before end-2013. Previously, it
had been assumed that these independent
companies would be able to mobilize the
required financing themselves, albeit with
government guarantees. Because they have
not been able to, the government has decided
to borrow the required funds and lend them to
the companies, thereby increasing its net
lending for FY
MEFP ¶45, 48, 50
2012/13 and
2013/14.
4858
20.
Excluding the impact of the
eurobond, the overall fiscal picture is
largely in line with the approved FY
2012/13 budget (Table 3). Total revenue and
grants are expected to amount to 25.3 percent
of GDP. The tax revenue-to-GDP ratio is
projected to be marginally lower than the
previous year, because some one-off items
that boosted revenue in FY2011/12 are not
expected to accrue again to the same extent,
such as the collection of tax arrears, and
because of delays in the implementation of
some revenue measures planned for
FY2012/13. Total spending and net lending are
projected at 32.4 percent of GDP (or
28 percent of GDP excluding transactions
related to the eurobond in line with the
original budget target). Accordingly, the
overall deficit (including grants) is projected at
7.1 percent of GDP (or 2.8 percent of GDP
excluding net lending to KCC and Rwandair
financed by the proceeds from the eurobond).

RWANDA

21.
The government has established a
solidarity fund (―Agaciro‖) to finance
priority projects
relevant to the
MEFP ¶51
achievement of the
MDGs. The Agaciro fund solicits voluntary
contributions from Rwandans at home and
abroad. It is fully integrated into the budget
and, for FY2012/13, is expected to contribute
about RWF 2 billion (less than 0.05 percent of
GDP) to domestic capital spending. The staff
underscored the importance of holding
Agaciro operations to the highest standards of
public financial management, including strict
enforcement of transparency and
accountability rules, and to avoid coercion in
the solicitation of contributions, lest it become
a new form of taxation.

23.
The government is continuing to
strengthen public financial management
and has started to prepare a new strategy
to cover 2013/14－2017/18. Notable recent
PFM achievements include the preparation of
a medium-term debt strategy (MTDS) and
their own DSA using the joint IMF-World
Bank template. The MEFP lists the authorities‘
priority PFM plans for FY2012/13, the last year
of the current PFM reform strategy. An
independent evaluation of the lessons
learned under this strategy is underway and
will inform the design of
its successor.

The authorities are accelerating tax
policy reforms to support revenue
mobilization. They recognize that Rwanda‘s
tax effort—about 14 percent of GDP, financing
only about 60 percent of government
spending—makes Rwanda highly dependent
on aid and could not be increased further by
relying solely on revenue administration
reforms. The authorities recently invited a FAD
technical mission to explore new tax policy and
revenue administration reforms to increase the
government tax base. The mission prepared a
set of recommendations for the authorities‘
consideration (Box 5). These included
measures that could have an early impact on
the revenue yield, whereas others are of a
longer-term nature. The authorities are
studying the recommendations to determine
how best to best incorporate them into fiscal
policy. The mission underscored that efforts to
improve revenue mobilization should be
incorporated in the 2013/14 budget.

Box 5. Rwanda: Recommendations to Improve Revenue Mobilization
A recent technical assistance mission that visited Kigali (September 27-October 10) recommended measures to
increase taxpayer compliance, expand the tax base, and improve revenue mobilization. Specifically, the mission
identified the following eight critical areas:



Taxpayer compliance. Implement a holistic approach to compliance management to ensure optimal use of
the resources of the Rwandan Revenue Authority (RRA) in managing compliance, tackling tax evasion and
fraud, and reducing the tax gap.



Tax unit. Improve capacity at the tax policy unit to improve tax policy design.



Tax gap analysis. Prepare detailed input-output tables to enable the conduct of the analysis.



Personal income tax (PIT). Complement withholding taxes on dividends and interest with a capital gains tax
at a similar rate; ensure indexation to inflation of nominal variables in the PIT structure.



Tax expenditures. Better target incentives to investors that meet certain requirements in support of priority
activities.



Indirect taxation. Review the schedules for exemptions and zero-rating in the VAT. Raise the VAT threshold
to be consistent with those under the PIT. Adopt specific tax rates for the excise tax system that are indexed
to inflation.



Property taxation. Use property taxes more effectively, both on immovable fixed assets and motor vehicles,
by raising rates and broadening the tax base.



Extractive industry taxation. Incorporate best international tax design practices in the current tax regime.

C. Modernizing the Monetary
Framework and Enhancing
Financial Sector Policies
24.
The mission supported the recent
tightening of the monetary stance
considering inflation risks stemming from
rapid credit growth and exchange rate passthrough. The NBR indicated it will be more
proactive in using the key repo rate as well as
repo operations and treasury bill auctions to
tighten liquidity conditions, as needed. It will
also sell foreign exchange to banks in line with
the agreed foreign exchange cash flow plan.
While agreeing with the NBR approach, the
mission underscored the importance of
limiting the sale of foreign exchange to
smooth foreign exchange volatility.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25.
The program targets a decline in
the growth rates of reserve money and
broad money to about 16–17 percent at
end-2012 and end-2013. Growth in credit to
the private sector is
MEFP ¶59
also set to slow, albeit
more gradually to about
18 percent by end-2013.
26.
The NBR has adopted a more
flexible reserve money targeting
framework. The NBR will increasingly focus
on a wider set of indicators—including
quarterly growth estimates, the composite
index of economic activity (CIEA), and interest
rate and exchange rate developments—to
supplement the traditional operational target
(reserve money) to anchor inflation

RWANDA

expectations. The NBR will introduce, with
immediate effect, a reserve money band of +/2 percent around a central reserve money
target. While targeting the center of the band,
the upper and lower bounds will provide
leeway to the NBR as it attempts to guide
banking liquidity and short-term interest rates
to move in line with its targeted monetary
policy stance. The authorities and staff agreed
to change the quantitative assessment
criterion on reserve
money, setting it
MEFP ¶60, 62
at the upper
bound of the band.
27.
The mission welcomed recent steps
taken by the NBR to strengthen the
liquidity management framework and
encouraged further reforms. The NBR
introduced new standing borrowing and
deposit facilities (June 2012), and improved the
reserve requirement system—including by
extending the maintenance period to two
weeks. The NBR also reduced the prudential
ratio on the net foreign exchange open
position of banks and changed the
denomination in which the reserve
requirement for foreign exchange deposits is
constituted in local currency. Looking ahead,

the mission underscored the importance of
continuing the reforms of the reserve money
targeting and liquidity management
framework, including through improving the
signaling role of the key repo rate, and
eliminating the one-day repos to stimulate the
development of the interbank money market.
28.
The authorities remain confident
about the health of the financial sector.
They point to the continued banking
expansion, improvement in capitalization, and
decline in the ratio of non-performing loans
(Box 6, and MEFP 21). They recognize that,
while improving, profitability of banks has
been relatively low because of high overheads.
The mission cautioned the authorities about
the exposure of banks to the real estate sector,
and the risks and challenges stemming from
the rapid establishment of local savings and
credit cooperatives (―Umurenge SACCOs‖). The
authorities reaffirmed their strong
commitment to financial sector stability—
including continued close supervision of
banks, and strengthening of the management
capacity and supervisory framework of the
SACCOs, as they consolidate into a large
cooperative bank by end-2014.

Box 6. Rwanda: Financial Sector Profile
The 2011 FSAP update found that the stability, structure, and efficiency of Rwanda’ s financial sector improved
significantly thanks to key reforms and stricter enforcement of regulations by the central bank. The banking
system recovered from a period of restructuring, banks have become well capitalized, and NPLs have improved.
However, banking system profitability remains low due to high overhead.



The banking system has recovered from a period of restructuring (2007-08) and is better
capitalized, provisioned, and liquid. Rwanda‘s banking sector consists of nine commercial banks and five
specialized banks (one development bank, three microfinance banks, and one cooperative bank).



The banking system is highly concentrated, but competitive. The three largest banks accounted for
about 50 percent of total bank assets at end-June 2012, down from 60 percent as at end 2010. The
distribution of loans and deposits is concentrated in a few institutional clients, and corporate lending is
by and large concentrated in construction and housing.



Bank assets doubled between 2006 and 2010, and grew by another 37 percent by end-June 2012,
while NPLs declined significantly. NPLs stood at 6 percent (end-September 2012) compared with
11.3 percent (end-2010). High overheads relating to network expansion and higher write offs and
stricter enforcement of provisioning led to a decline in profit margins and lower effective spreads.
Financial depth remains low even by EAC standards; ratio of private sector credit-to-GDP stood at
12 percent in 2010, rising to 13.5 percent in June 2012.



Stress tests showed that banks appear to be relatively healthy, although some vulnerability
remains. Tests for banks‘ exposure to agriculture and housing showed that banks‘ core capitalization
remains generally adequate. Additional tests showed that credit concentration and liquidity risks appear
limited—although these conditions may have changed since the FSAP update because of the rapid
growth in credit. Furthermore, banks suffer from assets and liabilities mismatch, because a large portion
of assets with maturities of more than one year are funded by short-term liabilities.



The recently established savings and credit cooperatives (SACCOs) have substantially increased
financial inclusion and financial development. Established in 416 geographically defined sectors
(Umurenge) by members under government initiative, financially sound SACCOs are expected to
consolidate into district SACCOs. Financially sound district SACCOs are expected to form a national
cooperative following discussion with SACCOs‘ members. The NBR will continue to oversee their
consolidation and supervision.



Banking regulation and supervision have been strengthened. The NBR law (2007) and the law
governing banking regulation (LOB) strengthened the legal framework for banking supervision, while
important regulations on capital adequacy, liquidity, credit concentrations, insider regulation, and
corporate governance were also put in place in recent years. Specifically, a regulation on loan
classification and provisioning published in 2011 requires banks to be more vigilant on credits risk
administration and monitoring. Under the guidance of FSAP recommendations, the process of
amending the banking law and its implementing regulations is ongoing and is expected to be
completed by end-2013. In addition, NBR continues to strengthen its own supervisory capacity.
Currently the team comprises 19 Inspectors for 14 banks and about 100 forex bureaus.



Staff conducted an assessment of Rwanda’s anti-money laundering and combating the financing
of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework in June 2012. The assessment report will be finalized in the first
half of 2013. Staff encourages the authorities to apply for membership to the Eastern and Southern
Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG).

D. External Stability: Revising
Debt Policy and Improving Exports
29.
The authorities have requested an
increase in the non-concessional borrowing
ceiling (NCB). The increase accommodates
the authorities‘ plan to issue a eurobond
(US$350million, or about 5 percent of GDP) by
end-December. The proceeds will be used to
retire existing unfavorable governmentguaranteed loans to the KCC (US$120 million)
and Rwandair (US$80millions); and to
complete construction of the KCC
(US$150million) by end 2013.2
30.
The new borrowing does not
change the conclusions of the last DSA
update (Box 7 and Appendix III). As in
previous updates, only one indicator (NPV of
debt-to-exports) is breached under one stress
test (export shock scenario), in spite of the
higher net borrowing. This occurs because: (i) a
large proportion of the new borrowing is
expected to be used to retire less favorable
existing debt; and (ii) the thresholds for
assessing debt distress have been raised on
account of Rwanda‘s improved capacity ratings
using the 2011 CPIA scores. The next full DSA
will be conducted in the context of the next
PSI review.
31.
Rwanda has achieved significant
gains in various global rankings of
competitiveness. In the 2013 Ease of Doing
Business Report, Rwanda ranked 52nd in the
world (down from 48th in 2012), but still
substantially higher than other EAC countries.
Nevertheless, challenges remain in some areas,
especially ―trading across borders‖.
Accordingly, the authorities have formulated a
National Export Strategy (NES) to further
2

beginning of the current program (Country Report No.
10/200).

improve export competitiveness and diversify
the export base, and constituted a high-level
coordinating body, the Industrial Development
and Export Council (IDEC), to oversee its
implementation. An immediate challenge for
the IDEC is to identify priority areas for support
within the existing medium-term budgetary
envelope.
32.
On balance, the real exchange rate
is broadly in line with fundamentals. All
three estimates consistent with the
consultative group on exchange rate (CGER)
methodology suggest a modest overvaluation
of the currency of between 1 and 10 percent
(Box 8). The authorities also shared with the
mission their study on the assessment of the
exchange rate (a SB for end-September 2012),
which broadly concurred with staff‘s analysis
and findings.
33.
An external stability assessment
suggests that the external sector risks are
manageable. The current account deficit is
expected to decline to about 5.4 percent of
GDP by 2017. The key reason for the
narrowing deficit is the declining need for
capital imports because many of the large
strategic investment projects included in the
EDPRS have been, or soon will be, completed.
Further, the authorities‘ efforts to develop the
export sector—both by diversifying into new
markets, and improving the export base—are
expected to support robust export growth and
lower the trade gap. Furthermore, as noted
earlier, the exchange rate appears to be
broadly in line with fundamentals, and reserves
are comfortable (Appendix III).
34.
Rwanda has accepted the obligations
of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and
maintains a system free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.

Box 7. Planned Eurobond Issuance: Background and Implications for Debt Sustainability

1

Context. Rwanda plans to raise US$350 million (about 5 percent of GDP) from international capital markets in
December 2012 through a 10-year eurobond. The proceeds would be used to retire existing publicly-guaranteed
debt and to fund the completion of the KCC, a strategic investment project. All proceeds of the eurobond will be
placed with the central bank and fully disbursed by end-2013. With the early repayment of existing borrowing, the
net increase in debt would amount to 2.2 percent of GDP.
Assumptions used in assessing debt sustainability. The impact of the authorities‘ plans was assessed using the
latest debt sustainability template for low-income countries. The new template takes into account the 2011 CPIA
scores, which raises Rwanda‘s institutional capacity classification from ―medium‖ to ―strong‖. As a result, the
indicative thresholds for assessing debt distress have also been raised. The medium-term macroeconomic
framework underlying the analysis is the baseline described in this report, which critically assumes that aid flows
resume in the first half of 2013, with no further delays thereafter.
Implications. Based on these assumptions, the analysis shows that Rwanda‘s debt outlook improves slightly
because of improvements in institutional capacity. Similar to the last DSA update (IMF Country Report 12/152), the
external debt remains well below the indicative thresholds under the baseline and most stress test scenarios. Only
one indicator is breached (PV of debt-to-exports ratio) under one shock (export shock, figure below and Appendix
Figure 1). However, because the net increase in borrowing is limited, and the bulk of the new borrowing goes
toward retiring less favorable existing debt, the magnitude and duration of the breach is now smaller: the breach
peaks at 18 percent (56 percent previously) and only lasts only two years (four years previously).

Risks. This assessment is contingent on the realization of the assumed macroeconomic framework, including the
full resumption of aid. As discussed in Box 2, in a downside scenario, the macroeconomic framework underlying
any DSA would be less favorable, and could have adverse consequences.

Box 8. Rwanda: Exchange Rate Assessment and External Competitiveness
The exchange rate was assessed using all three CGER approaches: macroeconomic balance, equilibrium real exchange rate, and
external sustainability. The same methodologies used in the previous exchange rate assessment (Country Report No. 11/19) were
employed.
For the macroeconomic balance and external sustainability approaches, the real exchange rate elasticity of the current account
was assumed to be 0.46, based on the estimates derived in (Country Report No. 11/19). The equilibrium real exchange rate was
assessed by comparing Rwanda‘s fundamentals – such as openness, aid flows, terms of trade, and fiscal position – all measured
relative to its 30 largest trade partners based on a 5-year moving average of trade weights from 2007-11 taken from the
Direction of Trade Statistics.
The results are outlined in the table below. Taken together, all three approaches suggest that the Rwandan franc is broadly in
line with fundamentals. However, this should be interpreted with caution given the uncertainty of the point estimates in all
methodologies.

This assessment suggests that there is merit in allowing for a greater degree in market-determination of the exchange rate. From
a competitiveness perspective, the rigid management of the exchange rate could be an impediment to the development of a
viable export sector. However, this does not imply that the exchange rate should be the primary vehicle for improving
competitiveness. Rather, it appears that there are structural impediments to developing Rwanda‘s export sector. These include:






A narrow export base,
Dependence on a relatively small set of markets,
No access to the sea, and
A small, albeit growing, industrial sector.

A novel new dataset1 that allows analysis at a more disaggregated level yields some additional insights.



Rwanda‘s perennial exports (defined as exports that routinely show up in trade statistics for the country) are unusually
volatile, even by regional standards. While the share of perennial exports can be expected to decline as new varieties of
exports become entrenched, the extreme volatility makes it difficult to build the trade and supply networks needed to
create a strong export core.



The share of new varieties in exports is extremely high. While experimentation with new varieties is important in driving
dynamism, too much variety implies high costs. Further, the high rate of appearance of new varieties suggests that most
experiments are not succeeding, which is again, not conducive to developing a strong industrial core.



Similarly, new varieties are not long-lived in Rwanda. For all countries, the survival rate for new varieties is low – the majority
of these products will not survive beyond the second year after their appearance in the trade statistics. The rate of survival
in Rwanda is particularly low: after 4 years, as the cumulative survival probability is less than 10 percent compared to nearly
20 percent in other EAC countries. And as successful new varieties also tend to exhibit high growth, this results in a much
lower cumulative growth rate from new products in Rwanda.

The NES aims to address many of these factors, including by developing the non-traditional export sector, and exploring new
markets, particularly in other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Further, regional efforts to improve transport links within the EAC could
yield substantial benefits in terms of improving connectivity and lowering transport costs.

PROGRAM ISSUES
35.
The authorities propose, and the
staff supports, modifications of
end-December 2012 QACs, reflecting the
revised fiscal projections for FY2012/13 and
the revised monetary program, as well as the
issuance of the eurobond. Specifically, (i) the
floor on net foreign assets (NFA) of the
central bank will be revised upward to take
into account the combined effects of
increased sales of foreign exchange by the
NBR in response to higher demand including
for imports in the second half of 2012 and
the addition of the unused portion of the
proceeds of the eurobond; (ii) reserve money
will be revised slightly downward in line with
the intended tightening of the monetary
stance; (iii) the ceiling on NDF will be revised
downward to take account of the combined
effects of somewhat greater domestic
financing during the first half of FY2012/13
and the deposit of the unused

Rwanda has recorded notable
economic achievements over the last
decade. Economic growth has been strong

sharply. The government‘s emphasis on
inclusive policies in its poverty reduction
strategies is exemplary.

portion of the proceeds of the eurobond at
the NBR; and (iv) the ceiling on
non-concessional borrowing will be raised
from US$255 million to US$605 million to
accommodate the gross impact of the
eurobond. In addition, indicative targets for
domestic revenue, priority expenditure, and
consolidated domestic debt will be adjusted
to reflect revised assumptions and
projections.
36.
Structural conditionality under the
PSI supports capacity building in key
areas. The medium-term debt management
strategy will be submitted to cabinet in late
November 2012. The introduction of
electronic tax registers and the submission to
cabinet of revised investment code have
been postponed to January 2013, and the
completion of the technical specifications for
the integrated financial management
information system (IFMIS) to April 2013.
39.
Staff also commends the authorities
for their continued commitment to
prudent macroeconomic policies. The
authorities have appropriately postponed
some government spending from the first half
of the fiscal year to the second half and
identified contingent spending cuts, pending
resolution of aid disbursements delays. The
central bank has also tightened its monetary
stance to slow reserve money growth and
mitigate exchange rate and inflation
pressures.
40.
The budgetary framework for the
remainder of FY 2012/13 needs to be
carefully executed. The government should
align spending priorities, carefully taking into

RWANDA

account availability of financing. At the same
time, it should minimize to the extent possible
recourse to domestic bank financing to
preserve macroeconomic stability.
41.
Delays in donor support, if
prolonged, could be disruptive to growth
and poverty reduction. The direct impact of
a shortfall in budget support of about
3 percent of GDP extending beyond the
current fiscal year would be a decline in
growth of at least 1½ percentage points.
However, the overall impact would likely be
greater depending partly on the
government‘s policy response.
42.
The staff supports the eurobond
issuance on macroeconomic grounds and
from a debt management standpoint. The
previous DSA update suggests Rwanda‘s debt
sustainability outlook would remain largely
unchanged because the net addition to the
stock of outstanding debt would be relatively
small. It will be critical for the authorities to
follow through on their plans to retire
commercial debt and to actually complete
critical investment projects.

NBR should take advantage of the flexibility
afforded by the new reserve money band to
better manage liquidity and signal its
monetary stance to markets. It should take
advantage of its full set of indirect monetary
policy instruments.
44.
The real exchange rate is broadly in
line with fundamentals. The authorities
should strengthen foreign exchange market
reforms and allow greater exchange rate
flexibility to ensure that the exchange rate
responds better to market forces and facilitate
a more efficient foreign exchange allocation.
45.
Staff recommends the conclusion of
the 2012 Article IV Consultation and the
completion of the fifth review under the
PSI. It is proposed that the next Article IV
Consultation takes place within 24 months,
subject to the provisions of the decision on
consultation cycles in program countries.

Rwanda needs to redouble its efforts to
raise the revenue-to-GDP ratio. The recent
delays in aid put into stark relief Rwanda's
need to reduce its aid dependence through
greater domestic resource mobilization. Tax
revenue is well below regional as well as subSaharan African norms. The authorities should
carefully consider the tax policy and revenue
administration recommendations of the
recent FAD technical assistance mission to
design a medium-term strategy for
significantly increasing the revenue-to-GDP
ratio.
43.
The NBR should use the new
flexible reserve money targeting
framework to carry out more efficiently
the tightening of the monetary stance. The

APPENDIX I. LETTER OF INTENT
Kigali, Rwanda
November 20, 2012
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C., 20431

Dear Ms. Lagarde,
The attached Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) reviews recent economic
developments in Rwanda and implementation of Rwanda‘s economic program under the
three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI), which was approved by the IMF Executive Board on
June 16, 2010. The attached MEFP is an update of the previous MEFP and sets out policies and
programs the Rwandan Government intends to implement for the fiscal year 2012/13 and the
medium term. The PSI is set to expire on June 29, 2013.
Program implementation remains strong. Growth is robust and inflation remains in the single
digits. All end-June 2012 quantitative assessment criteria were met, except the target on the net
domestic financing (NDF), which was missed by a small margin (about 0.5 percent of GDP),
because of a typographical error in the QAC table prepared at the time of the 4th review.
Structural reforms are proceeding broadly as planned. Two structural benchmarks (the
publication of the quarterly budget execution report for June and the preparation of an own
DSA) have been met with delay. Four benchmarks (medium-term debt management strategy,
revision to the investment code, specification of technical requirements for IFMIS and
introduction of electronic tax registers) have taken longer than expected. The medium-term debt
management strategy will be submitted to cabinet in late November; the other three
benchmarks have been re-programmed for the sixth review.
In light of the satisfactory performance outlined in the attached MEFP, the government requests
the completion of the fifth review under the PSI. The government also requests approval of the
modification of the assessment criteria for end-December 2012 with respect to (i) NFA of the
central bank to reflect delays in the disbursement of donor budget support inflows and the
accrual of the proceeds from the issuance of a eurobond later this year; and (ii) NDF to also
reflect revisions to the fiscal program because of delays in the disbursement of donor budget
support inflows and the inclusion of the sovereign bond proceeds and their use in the revised
fiscal program. Furthermore, the government requests the ceiling on the continuous assessment
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 37

RWANDA

criteria on the untied non-concessional borrowing be raised from US$255 million to US$605
million to allow additional borrowing for retiring short term debt and completing priority
projects that are underway. It does not materially affect our debt sustainability, as shown by the
DSA, which we recently conducted and presented to the IMF team. The government also
requests approval of end-December 2012 assessment criteria and structural benchmarks for this
period.
The government is confident that the policies and measures set forth in the attached
memorandum will deliver the objectives of the program. We stand ready to take any further
measures that may become appropriate for this purpose. The government will consult with the
IMF—at its own initiative or whenever the Managing Director of the IMF requests such a
consultation—before the adoption of any such measures or changes to the policies described in
the attached memorandum.
The government will provide the IMF with such information as the IMF may request in
connection with the progress made in implementing the economic and financial policies and
achieving the objectives of the program. It is expected that the sixth and final review will take
place before end-June 2013.
The Government of Rwanda authorizes the publication and distribution of this letter, its
attachments, and all reports prepared by the IMF staff.

Sincerely yours,

/s/

Attachment I. Rwanda: Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies
November 20, 2012
UPDATE
1.

In this updated Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), the

Government of Rwanda reiterates its commitment to achieving sustained economic growth and
poverty reduction. The strategies to achieve these goals are set out in the Economic
Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) for 2008–121 and Rwanda‘s Vision 2020.
As the EDPRS is expected to end in June 2013, the Government of Rwanda is in the process of
preparing the EDPRS II which is expected to be submitted to Cabinet in January 2013. Against
this background, the Government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are cooperating on
a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) to support macroeconomic policies and structural
reforms that underlie strategies in the EDPRS.
2.

This MEFP reviews performance through end-June 2012 and describes policies and

targets for end-December 2012, the revised 2012/13 fiscal year and the medium term.

MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Macroeconomic Developments
Growth developments
3.

The Rwandan economy recorded GDP growth of 9.9 percent in the second quarter of

2012, higher than the 7.5 percent registered in the first quarter. The growth was mainly driven by
an expansion in services which grew by 14 percent and industry which grew by 9 percent, led by
17 percent growth in the construction sector. This performance demonstrates that the Rwandan
economy is resilient to the challenging international economic climate.

1

Rwanda‘s latest EDPRS Country Report No. 08/90 and Joint Staff Advisory Note Country Report No. 08/91 were
issued to the Executive Board on February 14, 2008. A progress report was issued to the IMF Board on June 23
2011 (IMF Country Report No, 11/154).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 39

RWANDA

Inflation developments
4.

Inflation in Rwanda has been on a declining trend, falling from 8.3 percent in December

2011 to 5.6 percent in September 2012. This decline is due to the fall in imported inflation (from
7.9 percent in January to 1.2 percent in September) and the slowdown in domestic inflation to
6.7 percent in September (from 9.7 percent in May 2012).
5.

Core inflation which excludes fresh foods and energy from the overall CPI has been

significantly decelerating and stood at 2.1 percent in September 2012 from 3.6 percent in June
2012, 5.3 percent in March 2012 and 8.3 percent in December 2011. Declining core inflation
reflects the effectiveness of the monetary and exchange rate policies implemented by the
National Bank of Rwanda.

Fiscal developments
6.

The fiscal deficit for FY2011/12 was 1.2 percent of GDP, smaller than projected

(1.9 percent of GDP), due mainly to the over performance of tax revenues and
lower-than-planned expenditure owing to delays in implementing foreign and
domestically-financed capital projects.
7.

Domestic revenues during FY2011/12 exceeded target. Domestic revenue collected in

FY2011/12 reached RWF 591.8 billion compared with RWF 565.1 billion targeted in the revised
budget. The excess collections came from tax revenue which stood at RWF 557 billion. This
exceeded the target of RWF 530.2 billion by RWF 26.8 billion. The excess collection of RWF
26.8 billion for FY2011/12 came from the good performance of real GDP growth and ongoing
administrative reforms that continue to broaden the tax base and help improve compliance. The
improvement in compliance resulted in collections of some ―one-off funds‖ especially from
arrears amounting to RWF 6.5 billion (0.2 percent of GDP). This improved performance came
mainly from direct taxes that exceeded target by RWF 17 billion and excess collections in taxes
on goods and services by RWF 4.9 billion. Regarding non-tax revenue, the amount that accrued
to the budget by end June 2012 amounted to RWF 34.7 billion, slightly lower than the RWF
35 billion projected on account of lower collections from administrative fees and charges, as well
as dividends.
8.

Budget support grants that accrued to the FY2011/12 budget amounted to RWF

265.7 billion compared to RWF 279.1 billion projected showing a shortfall of RWF 14.4 billion.
9.

Capital grants that accrued to the budget of FY2011/12 amounted to RWF 191.6 billion

showing an excess of RWF 7.2 billion compared to RWF 184.4 billion projected because of an
over performance of the project grants from the Global Fund.

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

10.

Budgetary loans that accrued to the budget of FY2011/12 amounted to RWF 53.5 billion,

RWF 1.3 billion higher than RWF 52.2 billion expected.
11.

Spending in FY2011/12 was broadly on track. Total expenditure and net lending during

FY2011/12 amounted to RWF 1098 billion representing 99.3percent of the projection of the
revised FY2011/12 budget (RWF 1105.6 billion).
12.

The recurrent expenditure at RWF 613.9 billion was almost equal to the revised budget

estimate of RWF 614.1 billion.
13.

Total capital spending at RWF 482.9 billion was RWF 14.8 billion lower than the revised

budget allocation RWF of 497.7 billion. Both domestically and externally funded portions
contributed to the shortfall in spending. In the case of the domestically financed portion, the
main reason was the delay in finalizing all tender documentation for procurement as well as
delays in other administrative procedures.
14.

The budget for FY2011/12 was closed with net domestic finance equivalent to a negative

RWF 32.7 billion lower than the negative RWF 21.4 projected and net foreign financing
equivalent to RWF 95.1 billion lower than the RWF 116.8 billion projected on account of tax
revenue collection over performance and lower capital spending.
Tax policy measures for 2012/13
15.

Two out of four tax policy measures announced in the budget 2012/13 have been

implemented so far: tax rate for imported construction materials has been increase to 10 percent
from 5 percent (import duties, VAT and excise duties), starting July 2012, and the gaming tax has
been effective since September 2012.
Progress towards key revenue administration measures in 2011/12 approved budget:
a)

Introduce Electronic Sales Register (ESR) for recording taxpayers‘ transactions and limit

VAT evasion and help track potential taxpayers (Structural benchmark for end-January 2012): All
the necessary preparatory work has been finalized. Implementation has been delayed by the law
and Ministerial order that are not yet published in the official gazette.
b)

Introduce e-filing and e-payment systems to reduce the time spent serving taxpayers,

compliance costs incurred by taxpayers, and improve service delivery: All taxes Pay-As-You-Earn
(PAYE), Value Added Tax (VAT), Excise, income tax including withholding taxes are being filed
online. E-filing is also being used in filing social security contributions. E-payment is also being
used but with few banks.
c)

Conduct a customer satisfaction survey to inform the next areas of focus for strategic

planning purposes: the final report was produced in December 2011. A number of the report
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 41

RWANDA

recommendations have been implemented for instance focused training for SMEs on book
keeping, awareness campaigns of new initiatives in the tax administration, involvement in tax
policy development by SMEs, etc.
d)

Introduce new tax compliance risk assessment system in the Domestic Taxes Department

(DTD) that will orient audit function to high risk taxpayers: a number of risk management tools
were developed and are being used by DTD in the data matching exercise that orients audit
plans. Tender to acquire advanced risk management tools and data warehouse in order to
improve analysis and data matching for audit planning was made and is at evaluation stage.
e)

Implement electronic single window (ESW) system at customs that will allow parties

involved in trade and transport to lodge standardized information and documents using a single
point: the development of the ESW between the RRA and four other government agencies
(Magerwa, Rwanda Development Board (RDB), Rwanda Bureau of Standards (RBS) and Ministry
of Health) was finalized. The pilot phase of the ESW system was launched in Feb 2012 and since
then communication and awareness campaigns are being done through the web and local
media. The roll out of the system to other customs offices (in Kigali) was successfully done in
April 2012 and preparations for connecting other agencies are in advanced stages.
f)

Establish a One-Stop-Border Post (OSBP) at Kagitumba and Rusumo border posts with

24 hour operations to facilitate cross border trade: for Kagitumba, final design and tender
documents were approved by stakeholders and the tender was launched end of September
2012. For Rusumo, construction works for OSBP facilities and the Bridge have started. The OSBP
project is externally funded with direct payment and control over any delays in the procurement
processes or delays caused by the contractors is limited.
g)

Operate electronic cargo tracking equipment to ensure the protection of cargo from

source to destination: Evaluation of bids was done in February 2012 and the evaluation report
was submitted to the World non – objection letter in August 2012 and recommended
re-tendering.
h)

Fully automate collection of pension funds and health insurance contributions and bring

those out of the PAYE net into the system; the collection of pension and medical insurance
contributions was integrated in the e-Tax system and is now operational.

Monetary and exchange rate developments
16.

Broad money, M3, recorded an annual increase of 16.2 percent at end August 2012,

almost the same level as projected for the whole year 2012. Broad money supply was driven
mainly by growth in credit to the private sector which increased steadily faster than initial annual
projections for 2012 reaching 33 percent by end August 2012 on annual basis. The development
42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

in credit to private sector is in line with the dynamic economic activities recorded this year.
Targets on reserve money, the anchor of monetary program, were achieved using different
monetary policy instruments. Regarding monetary program implementation, the National Bank
of Rwanda has achieved end June 2012 net foreign assets and reserve money targets.
17.

Regarding the exchange rate policy, the NBR kept the RWF exchange rate fundamentally

market driven, while intervening on the domestic foreign exchange market by selling foreign
exchange to banks to smooth the RWF exchange rate volatility. As of end September 2012, the
RWF nominal exchange rate depreciated by 3 percent against the U.S. dollar, compared with
1.6 percent in the full year of 2011. This depreciation was mainly due to high demand for foreign
exchange driven by rapid increase in demand for imports.
18.

In 2012, credit to the private sector has increased substantially driven by a higher

dynamism in economic activities, mainly construction, manufacturing and services sectors. In
terms of share of economic sectors, as in the previous periods, credit to the private sector has
been granted largely to small and medium enterprises, rather than firms, with respectively
62.4 percent and 37.6 percent of the total outstanding credit by end June 2012.
19.

Short-term interest rates have been fairly stable after rising in response to the policy rate

which was increased by 0.5 percentage points in May to7.5 percent in line with the NBR policy of
tightening the monetary policy stance. The repo rate stabilized around 7.4 percent between May
and August 2012. The interbank rate increased in line with changes in the KRR, to an average of
8.9 percent between May and August, from an average of 7.5 percent between January and
April 2012. The T-bills weighted average rate also increased to 10.7 percent in August 2012 from
8.3 percent in May. Regarding market rates, the lending rate has stabilized between 16.3 percent
and 17.0 percent as a result of higher competition within the banking system. The deposit rate
increased to an average of 8.8 percent between May and August from an average of 8.0 percent
during the first fourth months of 2012.
20.

To enhance the efficiency of the money market operations, on June 1, 2012, the NBR has

recently introduced a fixed repo maturity of seven days in place of various maturities that have
been in place since February 29, 2012. The reserve requirements have been modified and since
June 1, 2012 are constituted only in local currency. Also, the maintenance period was extended
to two weeks from one week to support the averaging system. In addition, the standing deposit
and lending facilities were introduced on June 1, 2012; and on August 1, 2012, the overall foreign
exchange risk exposure for banks was set at ± 10 percent of their core capital in line with the
practice in most of EAC countries.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 43

RWANDA

Financial sector reforms
21.

The NBR is in the process of reviewing the financial sector legal and regulatory

framework. This review will respond to the FSAP recommendations. In this regard, the NBR Law
and the Banking Law are undergoing review for amendment to cater for the FSAP recommended
reforms. In addition, the Draft law on Deposit Insurance Fund has been prepared and pending
discussions with stakeholders.
22.

To strengthen the capacity for banks supervision, continual both in-house and outside

trainings will be conducted, especially for the new 5 inspectors recruited in August 2011.
23.

Banking sector soundness indicators have continued to perform well. The ratio of capital

to risk-weighted assets rose to 25.1 percent end June 2012, from 24.4 percent in June 2011, while
the ratio of non-performing loans declined from 9.6 percent to 5.7 percent in the same period of
2012. Profits also increased between June 2011 and June 2012. Mindful of the potential
challenges linked to the exposure of banks to the real estate sector currently representing
27.30 percent of the total loan portfolio, the BNR remains committed to ensure that the
regulatory framework of the financial system is able to take proactive actions accordingly. To this
effect, a new regulation on loan classification and provisioning was published in 2011 that
reduced mortgage collateral up to 50 percent and a loan can only be restructured once. In
addition, the regulation requires banks to closely monitor the performance of these loans and
potential risks related to various sectors.
24.

To strengthen the supervision of SACCOs, in May 2011, the NBR recruited 60 inspectors

located in 30 districts of Rwanda to monitor and closely supervise SACCOs. An action plan to
consolidate SACCOs was elaborated with two phases. In phase I, SACCOs will be consolidated at
district level by end-December 2013, and in the second and final phase, the SACCOs will be
consolidated to form a Cooperative Bank at national level by end-December 2014. So far, a
harmonized credit policy for SACCOs has been put in place and has been operational since July
2012. For capacity building, a lot has been done to strengthen the capacity of SACCOs
themselves and SACCOs‘ Supervisors. Several trainings were conducted by the World Bank
Consultants for NBR SACCO Inspectors appointed in districts aiming at enhancing their
supervision capacity. In the second quarter of 2012, the Rwanda Cooperative Agency (RCA),
provided computers (desktops and printers) to all 416 Umurenge SACCOs and CGAP
management tools were configured in these computers and all 416 SACCOs.
25.

The NBR undertook various initiatives to widen financial access such as mobile financial

services and agent banking. By end-June 2012, three banks started to work with agents and two
banks are in the process of launching agent banking. One new bank is performing well and now
has eight branches across the country. Two microfinance institutions were upgraded to
microfinance banks with minimum capital of RWF 1.5 billion each. By end-June 2012, the number
44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

of bank branches and outlets was 580. Similarly, the usage of ATMs to enhance intermediation
and lower transaction costs grew by over 69.6 percent from 135 ATMs recorded end June 2011
to 229 ATMs end June 2012. In addition, the RIPPS system has been upgraded to enable linkage
to Regional Payment Systems; the East Africa Payment Systems (EAPS) and the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Regional Payment and Settlement System (REPSS) to
facilitate cross-border payments in the East African Community and COMESA region. Moreover,
the Visa National Net Settlement System (NNSS) has been operational since March 1, 2012. The
NNSS facilitates domestic transactions to be settled in local currency and the central bank is the
settlement agent. By end-June 2012, six banks were already participating in NNSS. Points of Sale
(POS) had also increased to 385 from 227 at end 2011. In view of the above, the 2012 Finscope
Survey showed that total adult population with access to financial services increased to
71.8 percent in 2012 from 47.5 percent in 2008; and the percentage of adult population without
access decreased from 52.4 percent in 2008 to 28.1 percent in 2012.

External Sector
26.

The overall balance of payments in the first half of 2012 recorded a deficit of USD

195.5 million mainly owing to higher-than-projected imports. Although exports and current
transfers improved significantly, the current account recorded a larger deficit of US$ 500.3 million
becsue of a larger trade deficit of USD 605.5 million. Net income and services were also negative,
and at US$ 147.3 million accounted for around 45percent (of the projected amount for
end-2012).
27.

Rwanda continues to attract remittances from diaspora. About 64 percent of private

transfers were remittances, estimated at US$ 50.2 million in the first half of 2012, in line with the
annual projection of US$ 111.4 million.
28.

Sustained by traditional and non-traditional products, exports increased on an annual

basis by 22.6 percent by end-August 2012 compared to 0.6 percent initially projected for the
whole year 2012. This performance is mainly attributed to minerals which were boosted by high
prices of coltan and wolfram. Coffee exports were lower by 14.6 percent in spite of higher
volume (12.6 percent), because of a fall in prices on international markets. Despite higher prices,
tea exports have performed poorly in both value and volume terms, on account of weak
domestic production affected by adverse weather conditions.
29.

Compared to an increase of 13.7 percent in import value f.o.b. initially projected for the

whole year 2012, an annual increase of 28 percent was recorded by end-August 2012. This
higher-than-expected increase in imports is driven mainly by higher domestic demand for
investment goods notably equipment, raw materials for industry, and inputs for the services
sectors. Capital, intermediate and energy imports therefore accounted for 73 percent of total
imports by end-August 2012, continuing the trend observed in the last five years.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 45

RWANDA

30.

The need to finance the larger import bill along with uncertainties about donors‘ budget

support disbursements has put pressure on the foreign exchange market, leading to relatively
rapid nominal depreciation of the RWF against U.S. dollar, estimated at about 3 percent between
December 2011 and September 2012.

Statistical Developments
31.

Efforts to improve the quality of national accounts are continuing. To compile a high

quality Supply and Use Table (SUT) and to produce robust benchmarks for the rebasing of gross
domestic product (GDP), the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) is conducting an
Integrated Enterprise Survey (IES) for reference year 2011. The 2011 IES will collect benchmark
data on non-agriculture non-household sector economic activities using the 2011 Establishment
Census (2011 EC). Data collection started in May 2012 and results are expected by
end-December 2012.
32.

To support these ambitious targets, the NISR is strengthening its human capacity. NISR

has recruited 47 new staff including economists and strengthened the Economic Statistics
Department, which now has a director and four principal statisticians in charge of national
accounts, trade and services, prices and agricultural/industrial statistics.
33.

Significant progress also has been made in agricultural statistics. The recruitment of key

consultants is complete, and four missions were undertaken by four experts of Agricultural
Assessments International Corporation (AAIC). They prepared a paper comprising an assessment
of the current situation; recommendations for action and next steps. The finalized paper was
published at end-March 2012 (structural benchmark) and afterward, they continued to support
NISR and MINAGRI to implement the new recommended methodology.
34.

In addition, NISR is planning to hire international experts with the help of the NISR

Basket fund to advise them on the development of the national accounts. The objective is to
support further improvements in the quality of the accounts, with particular emphasis on the
statistics related to the balance of payments, government financial statistics, and the SUT (for
2011).The technical assistance will also support capacity building across the entire range of
economic statistics produced by NISR.

B. Program Performance
35.

As of end-June 2012, only one of the quantitative assessment criteria was not met,

while the structural benchmarks were broadly observed (Tables 1 and 2). The quantitative
assessment criterion on net domestic financing (NDF) was missed by a small margin
(RWF 23.9 billion), because of a typographical error in the quantitative assessment criteria (QAC)
table at the time of the fourth review. The NDF would have been met had the target been

RWANDA

correctly set in line with the fiscal policy and the macroeconomic framework agreed to at the
time of the discussion for the fourth review.
All the structural benchmarks were met with the exception of the following:


The submission to cabinet of the public debt policy and medium-term debt strategy (MTDS),
planned for end-June 2012, will be met with delay. A first draft of the MTDS was discussed
with key stakeholders (the Ministry of Finance and the central bank) and a revised draft
incorporating comments that involved broadening the scope of the strategy is now planned
for submission to the cabinet in late November 2012.



The benchmark on the specification of the technical requirements for IFMIS was not met and
has been delayed until April 2013.



The benchmark on introducing electronic tax registry to improve issuance of VAT invoices by
taxpayers planned to be launched for end- May 2012, has not been met because we are
waiting for the law promulgation.



Revision of the investment code by June 2012: Part of its revision on the increase in tax rates
for imported construction material from 5 percent (imports duties, VAT and excise duties) to
10 percent is effective since July 2012, but the broad revision is expected to be done by
January 2013.

C. Economic Outlook
Outlook
36.

The outlook for the 2012/13 fiscal year is in line with the Medium Term

Macroeconomic Framework and program objectives set out in the initial MEFP for the PSI.
In 2012, domestic economic activity is expected to expand at 7.7 percent. The growth rate will be
led by construction and services. Over the medium term, output growth is projected at 7 percent
on average. Inflation is targeted at 7.5 percent for end-2012 and 6.5 percent for end-2013
before stabilizing at 5 percent over the medium-term.

Risks to the outlook
37.

Risks from developments in the global environment: Risks from further global

economic slowdown remain high and this could potentially have adverse affects on the Rwandan
economy over the medium term. The government will continue to implement prudent policies
(price stability and policies aiming at sustaining growth) to cushion from downside risks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 47

38.

Delays in aid disbursements: about USD 200 million in bilateral and multilateral general

budget support disbursements which were expected in July–December 2012 have been
reprogrammed for January-June 2013.

GOVERNMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
A. Medium-term objectives and poverty reduction strategy
39.

Rwanda has recently conducted a household living conditions survey (EICV 3). The survey

results show that poverty has been reduced by 12 percentage points in the last five years (from
2005/6 to 2010/11). This represents in nominal terms, more than a million Rwandans being lifted
out of poverty. The results of the last surveys (EICV 3 and DHS 4) have shown that a lot of
progress has been made in achieving the targets we had committed to under our EDPRS for the
implementation of our Vision 2020. By 2010/11, more than 85percent of the targets under our
EDPRS had been achieved.
40.

Some of the targets under the national Vision 2020 had already been achieved by 2011,

while many others are on track. With the progress made in the last five-years, Rwanda is on track
to achieve all MDGs – though not all targets—some well before 2015. As such, the country has
decided to revise those targets to the level of our ambitions. One such target is the GDP per
capita, it was set at US$ 900, and we have now revised it to US$ 1,240.
41.

The national development plan, EDPRS2, has two key goals: (i) reducing poverty faster to

reach a poverty headcount of less than 30 percent; and (ii) ensuring that the economy remains
on a path of high and sustained economic growth to achieve an average double-digit GDP
growth over the decade. The country sees high and inclusive growth as the guarantee of
sustainability of results achieved towards the MDGs.
42.

These goals imply that the country will need to step up its efforts and do many things

differently. The EDPRS 2 is being developed to address four key areas: (i) economic
transformation, (ii) rural development, (iii) productivity and youth employment and
(iv) accountable governance.
43.

Although a double-digit GDP growth is the desired objective, the revised macroeconomic

framework under this review is built on a more conservative growth outlook, on account of
economic downside risks stemming from threats of global economic slowdown (weak global
demand, low prices for Rwandan exports, and high oil prices) and the current uncertainty around
some donors‘ disbursements.
44.

Quantitative assessment criteria and indicative targets and structural benchmarks for the

th

6 and final review under the current PSI arrangement are set out in Table 3 and Table 4.

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

B. Fiscal Policy
45.

Fiscal consolidation through increased revenue mobilization and expenditure

prioritization to close the fiscal gap remain the key components of the government‘s mediumterm strategy. Consistent with this strategy, the budget for FY2012/13 has been revised to reflect
uncertainties and delays in donor budget support disbursements. In addition, this revision has
also taken into account the expected flows from the sovereign bonds issuance and the use of
these funds, as well as the accrual and use of funds from the ―AGACIRO‖ Development Fund
(AgDF).
46.

Total revenue and grants are now projected at RWF 1211.1 billion (25.3 percent of GDP).

Domestic revenue collection amounts to RWF 712.4 billion (14.9 percent of GDP) while grants are
estimated at RWF 498.6 billion (10.4 percent of GDP). Domestic tax revenue is contributing RWF
641.2 billion (13.4 percent of GDP) while non-tax revenue (including reimbursements from
peace-keeping operations and from the ―AGACIRO‖ fund) is projected at RWF 71.2 billion
(1.5 percent of GDP).
47.

Total expenditure and net lending is now projected at RWF 1541.5 billion (32.4 percent of

GDP). Recurrent spending is estimated at RWF 668.3.2 billion (14 percent of GDP) while RWF
653 billion (13.7 percent of GDP) is now allocated for capital expenditure. The estimate for net
lending is revised upwards and is now projected at RWF 220.3 billion (4.6 percent of GDP).
48.

The revised budget is now expected to close with an overall cash deficit of RWF

338.5 billion (7.1 percent of GDP). Net domestic financing will now show a small build up of
government deposits of RWF 15.4 billion (0.3 percent of GDP) mainly representing the unused
funds from the sovereign bonds receipts.
49.

Regarding tax revenue collections, the implementation of the on-going administrative

measures outlined in paragraph 15 are expected to allow the achievement of the projected
target.
50.

For expenditures, the revised upward figure of RWF 1541.5 billion includes RWF

7.9 billion of interest payments on the sovereign bond in FY2012/13. The revised net lending
figure of RWF 220.3 billion also includes RWF 204.3 billion (4.3 percent of GDP) of the proceeds
from the sovereign bond issuance, which have been allocated to some strategic investment
projects for the early retirement of expensive debt and for the completion of one project. The
government is committed to use the proceeds from the sovereign bonds issuance solely for the
approved strategic investment projects.
51.

The slightly increased capital expenditure figure of RWF 653 billion (13.7 percent of GDP)

also includes a small spending amount of RWF 2 billion for some projects to be funded with
funds that will accrue from the AgDF under domestic capital expenditure. Consistent with
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 49

RWANDA

national objectives of the government, the AgDF which has been set up recently by the
government is to solicit voluntary contributions from Rwandan citizens in the country and in the
diaspora as well as from other friends of Rwanda. The proceeds from the fund will be used to
augment central Government funds to finance some priority projects which will allow the
government to achieve the MDG targets. To ensure transparency, the government has designed
rules and regulations concerning the accrual and utilization of the contributions to the fund. The
accounts will be audited annually by the Auditor General. The capital expenditure figure also
includes an RWF 7.8 billion grant from USAID for projects in the agriculture sector with foreign
financed capital. This amount was originally programmed as a budget support grant for recurrent
spending.
52.

Because of uncertainties concerning the disbursement of budget support funds, the

government has decided to set aside an RWF 18 billion (0.4 percent of GDP) expenditures as
contingent expenditure under the domestically financed capital budget. This amount will not be
spent if the disbursements from donors are not made to ensure no increase in net domestic
finance. The contingent expenditure is in agriculture, health, infrastructure (roads) and justice.
53.

Net domestic finance: The revised FY2012/2013 budget is projected to close with a net

build up of deposits amounting to RWF 15.3 billion (0.3 percent of GDP) mainly representing the
remaining unused balance from the sovereign bonds proceeds.
54.

Fiscal policy over the medium term reflects the fiscal consolidation policy of the

government. This envisages increases in domestic resource mobilization and expenditure
reprioritization to reduce expenditure and thereby not only reduce the fiscal gap but also reduce
the reliance on donor funding. Consistent with this objective domestic revenue collection
(excluding payments from peacekeeping operations) are projected to increase by 0.3 percent of
GDP annually in the medium-term and reach 15.2 percent of GDP by 2016/2017. At the same
time total expenditure and net lending is projected to go from 1541.5.4 billion (32.3 percent of
GDP) in FY2012/13 to RWF 1808.9 billion (22.9 percent of GDP) by 2016/2017. Consistent with
these projections, the overall deficit (including grants) is projected to decline from 6.9 percent of
GDP in FY2012/13 to 1.6 percent of GDP by 2016/2017. Over the medium term the contribution
from non tax revenue is not expected to increase as a result of the permanent loss of dividends
in the face of increasing privatization of public enterprises.

Revenue mobilization
55.

Tax policy measures for FY2012/13: the revision of the investment code will be completed

by November 2012 (structural benchmark). The introduction of the Electronic Sales Register
(ERS) for recording taxpayers‘ transactions, limiting VAT evasion and helping track potential
taxpayers is now planned to start in January 2013 (structural benchmark), after the promulgation
of the VAT law. A recent FAD/IMF mission has provided recommendations for both revenue
50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

administration and tax policy reforms. The government will examine the recommendations from
the mission and will discuss possible implementation of the recommendations with the next PSI
review mission.

Public financial management and reforms
56.

The PFM reform agenda is firmly on track as has been noted in the various reviews that

have been undertaken in previous years. The major objectives of the government is to address
the key existing challenges that include among others: addressing the apparent disconnect
between planning and budgeting, evaluating difficulties in automating public financial
management operations, creating a critical mass of professionals across the key PFM functional
areas and building PFM capacity at decentralized level. Below is a set of priority measures that
has been drawn to help address the existing challenges in the PFM area.
Priority measures for 2012/13
57.

The key priorities for the 2012/13 are as follows:

i.

Complete the design of the detailed system and technical requirements of the Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) including functional, technical
requirements documents and quality review by end of April 2013 (structural benchmark).

ii.

Elaborate the EDPRS II 2013-2018 and pertinent sector and district strategic plans. The
EDPRS I is ending by June 30, 2013, and we are now finalizing the recruitment of the
thematic experts that will help in the elaboration of the EDPRS II.

iii.

Review the program structure of the budget and revamp the Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF). This assignment will help in aligning the strategic plans of MDAs to
the program structure of the budget, a key weakness identified in numerous PFM
diagnostic studies.

iv.

Support implementation of the Fiscal Decentralization Strategy (FDS). This was approved
by the cabinet last year and full scale implementation will be a major focus this fiscal
year.

v.

Continue with phase two of the Implementation of the Electronic Tax Registers to
efficiently collect VAT. This project is expected to help RRA expand the tax base and/or
avoid any potential tax leakages to finance the country‘s national needs.

vi.

With the support of IMF East AFRITAC the GoR has finalized updating the law on state
finances and property. It is expected that the law will be finalized in the next fiscal year
thereby paving the way for sensitizing GoR officials on the new law.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 51

RWANDA

vii.

As part of the national plan to build a strong accountancy profession, the government
will continue to support the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Rwanda (ICPAR)
so it will be in a position to launch its first ever professional accountancy qualification
examination (CPA-Rwanda) and help in building a critical mass of certified accountants.

viii.

Public procurement is one of the critical pillars in the public financial management
reform agenda. Upon realizing there is an urgent need to create a critical mass of
procurement professionals, MINECOFIN has helped the School of Finance and Banking
(SFB) secure the services of the International Training Centre of the International Labor
Organization) as part of the arrangement to develop capacity at SFB to meet Rwanda‘s
training needs in procurement. The first phase has been completed and the second
phase is currently ongoing with short-term courses begun.

ix.

The basic structure for a professional internal audit cadre is already in place and this is
being complemented by automating all internal audit processes by using electronic
working papers software. The ultimate objective is to increase efficiency.

x.

The current Public Financial Management Reform Strategy is set to expire on June 30,
2013. The government, in conjunction with the contributing development partners, is
undertaking a final independent evaluation of the Public Financial Management (PFM)
Reform Strategy 2008/9-2012/13 to take stock of the lessons learned so it can inform the
next PFM Reform Strategy for 2013/14-2017/18, scheduled to be completed within the
current fiscal year.

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
58.

The NBR will implement policies to minimize risks of monetary inflation while supporting

the government economic growth objective. To achieve the expected results, the NBR will
continue to closely monitor developments in underlying factors of inflation to take appropriate
measures, using the monetary policy instruments. Inflation is projected to rise gradually backup
to 7.5 percent by end 2012 before receding anew to about 6.5 percent by end 2013 and
stabilizing at about 5 percent over the medium term.
59.

In 2013, lower inflation is expected to be achieved through improvement in supply-side

policies and a further tightened monetary policy stance. The growth rates of reserve money and
broad money are both projected to slow down to 16.3 percent in 2013. Growth in credit to the
private sector will continue to drive broad money growth, while gradually slowing down from
29 percent at end-2012 to about 18 percent in 2013 reflecting a tighter monetary policy.
60.

To improve the monetary policy transmission mechanism, the NBR will move to a more

flexible monetary targeting framework. The NBR will introduce a reserve money band of ±
2 percent around a central reserve money target. In this framework, the NBR will target the

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

center of the reserve money band, while the PSI quantitative assessment criterion on reserve
money will be set at its upper limit.
61.

The NBR will continue to strengthen its capacity in modeling and forecasting with the

support of different partners, including the Bank of England, the IMF, the International Growth
Center (IGC) and the Macroeconomic and Financial Management Institute for Eastern and
Southern Africa (MEFMI) among others. In the short term, the NBR will complete ongoing studies
to support building a small macroeconomic model for Rwanda supported by MEFMI to realize
policy simulation and assist the NBR‘s Monetary Policy Committee.
62.

To improve money market efficiency, the NBR will soon introduce and explain to banks

the change in the use of the policy rate – the key repo rate. The NNR will change the role of the
key repo rate from a reference rate for interbank operations to a reference rate for central bank
operations on money markets. The repo and reverse repo transactions will be fixed at only 7 days
maturity, with the repo rate remaining within the new corridor for which the lower and upper
limits will be respectively the rates on overnight deposit and lending standing facilities.
63.

The exchange rate will remain market driven, and the NNR will continue to intervene on

the foreign exchange market only to smooth exchange rate volatility. To further develop the
foreign exchange market, NBR will continue to build the capacity of market players and promote
interbank trading. The Dealers‘ Association was launched in August 2012 and the capacity
building plan is being developed in collaboration with different partners, including the
International finance Corporation (IFC). In addition, the NBR will continue to encourage banks to
access the newly established NBR (lending and deposit) standing facilities. Furthermore, the
government will work closely with the NBR to finalize as soon as possible discussions on a MOU
for the conversion of existing claims on the government into marketable securities before
December 2012.

D. Financial Sector Reforms
64.

The NBR will continue to pursue the FSAP recommended reforms in pension, insurance,

banking and microfinance institutions relating to the expansion of market access and financial
deepening.
65.

An action plan (FSDP II) clearly showing all reforms to be implemented and their

respective timeframe (next 5 years) for the entire financial sector; FSAP recommendations will be
in place by end December 2012.
66.

An action plan to consolidate SACCOs was elaborated in two phases. For phase I,

SACCOs will be consolidated at district level by end December 2013 and for the second (final)
phase; SACCOs will be consolidated to form a cooperative bank at national level by end
December 2014. In addition, the NBR is committed to carrying out continuous capacity building
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 53

RWANDA

for inspectors and managers of SACCOs. The program to enhance the institutional capacity of
SACCOs and their MIS including the automation of their operations will be undertaken in
2013/14. UNCDF‘s MicroLead Program has approved a $2.4 million dollar investment for
technical service provision for the UMURENGE SACCOs by the World Council of Credit Unions
(WOCCU).

E. External Sector Policies
Objectives and policies
67.

Increased domestic demand for imports and high energy prices are expected to

negatively affect the external sector performance in 2012 and 2013. In 2012 the value of exports
is projected to increase by 16.2 percent led by non-traditional exports which will contribute
about 50 percent of the total receipts. Despite a slight recovery in coffee exports in the later part
of the year, the yield in 2012 is projected to be about 2 percent lower than in 2012 on account of
lower international prices. Although the volume of tea exports is projected to increase by only
1.5 percent in 2012, total receipts are expected to rise by 7.7 percent on account of higher
international prices. Regarding minerals despite higher volume and prices for wolfram and
coltan, total receipts are projected to decline by about 13 percent owing to a sharp decline in the
volume and prices for cassiterite.
68.

Mirroring the performance in the first eight months of the year, the value of imports

(f.o.b.) is projected to rise by 20 percent in 2012. This development reflects the higher demand
for capital goods, raw materials for industry and inputs in the services sector. As a result of this
high level of imports, the trade deficit is projected to widen from US$ 1.1 billion in 2011 to
US$ 1.3 billion in 2012.
69.

Reflecting the delayed disbursement of donor support funds in 2012, the current account

deficit (including official transfers) is expected to deteriorate from 7.3 percent of GDP to
11.3 percent of GDP. However net capital and financial flows of US$ 879.7 million (including the
Sovereign bond receipts of USD 350 million and FDI of US$150 million) will allow the
achievement of an overall balance of payments surplus of US$94 million. Gross reserves will
therefore reach US$ 1,144.2 million at end-2012 equal to about 5.2 months of imports of goods
and services.
70.

In 2013, a recovery in the export of coffee and minerals is expected. This recovery

together with improved performance of non- traditional exports will increase the value of exports
by about 9 percent. Reflecting the high demand for imports especially of capital goods for
ongoing projects (including KCC), imports in value terms (fob basis) are projected to rise by
about 8 percent in 2013. Despite the widening of the trade deficit by about 7 percent in 2013,
the expected disbursement of the delayed donor budget support funds in 2013 will result in a
slight narrowing of the current account deficit (including official transfers) from 11.3 percent of
54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

GDP in 2012 to 10.2 percent of GDP in 2013. With a slightly reduced capital and financial flows in
2013, the overall balance of payments is projected to close with a deficit of USD 153.5 billion
which will be financed with an equivalent draw down of reserves including the unused funds
from the sovereign bonds issuance carried over from 2012. As a result, gross official reserves at
end-2013 are projected to decline to USD 989 million, which will cover 4.6 months of imports of
goods and services.
71.

In the medium term, exports in value terms are projected to increase on average by

about 8.2 percent a year. This reflects the expected results of the implementation of the
comprehensive national export strategy. A large portion of this projected increase will come from
non-traditional exports. Imports in value terms will respond to the investment requirements of
the country and in the medium term will be expected to rise annually. Mirroring the projected
decline in donor budget support grants, the current account balance will be expected to decline
gradually in the medium term.
72.

Consistent with the on-going improvements in ‗doing business‖ in Rwanda public and

private capital flows are expected to increase to partly offset the projected decline in grants. This
development will also respond to the expected rise in FDIs to finance private sector projects in
many priority areas especially in mining, hotels, banking and retail sectors. The overall balance of
payments in the medium term is projected to register small deficits that will be financed with
some drawdown of reserves. Official reserves however are expected to remain at comfortable
levels—covering four to five months of imports of goods and services.

Medium Term Debt Strategy (Debt Management and DSA)
73.

The GoR remains committed to sustainable debt levels while ensuring adequate financing

of its development programs. The GoR‘s overall objectives for the medium term debt strategy
are three fold:


To ensure that the GoR‘s financing needs and payments obligations within the provisions
of the development plans are met at the lowest possible cost over the medium to long
term, consistent with a prudent degree of risk;



To establish a sustainable debt service profile consistent with the GoR‘s medium term
repayment capacity;

 To promote the maintenance and further development of the market for domestic
government securities and diversify the GoR‘s funding sources by reducing external
resources exposure while ensuring that domestic debt sustainability is not compromised.
74.

Borrowing both domestically and externally assumes the introduction of a longer

maturity bond in domestic currency that can also target the regional market (which is in line with
GoR‘s objectives of domestic securities market development) and the use of non-concessional
funding.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 55

RWANDA

75.

Rwanda will go to the international debt market before the end of this year to raise

US$ 350 million for strategic projects. Some of the funds will be used for early repayment of
expensive non-concessional debt by end-December. The remaining balance will be used for
additional debt repayment and completion of one project in 2013. With the early repayment of
debt, the stock of non-concessional borrowing will only increase by US$ 150 million. The GoR
commits to ring fencing the proceeds of the sovereign bond issuance for the purposes identified
in this memorandum.
76.

A debt sustainability analysis, including the eurobond has been conducted. The analysis

reveals that Rwanda‘s external debt level including the sovereign bonds debt remains sustainable
although vulnerable in the presence of shocks to export growth.

F. Statistics and Other Issues
77.

The NISR will continue to improve the quality of its economic statistics in general and the

national accounts in accordance with the improvement action plan of the national accounts. The
NISR has completed the recruitment of the key consultants in agriculture statistics, and they have
already undertaken four missions to assess the current situation, review agricultural statistics
including sampling methodology and start implementation of the program of seasonal
probability surveys. For the period October 2012 to January 2014, the experts will help NISR to
conduct and analyse the agriculture survey for the agricultural year 2013 using the new
methodology.
78.

The results of the recently completed Establishment Census 2011 have been used to

select a sample of 950 establishments for the 2011 Business Survey and Non Profit Institutions
Survey. Data collection was completed by end-October 2012 (structural benchmark) as planned.
79.

The data from these benchmark surveys, combined with other source of data, will be

used to develop detailed input-output (I-O) and supply-use tables (SUT) and to rebase the GDP
estimates in 2011 constant prices.
80.

With the help of IMF East AFRITAC, NISR will rebase the CPI statistics using the results of

the EICV3 by end of June 2013. The rebasing of the GDP estimates using 2011 constant prices is
expected to be finished by end of December 2013.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
November 20, 2012
1.
This memorandum defines the quantitative targets described in the memorandum of
economic and financial policies (MEFP) for the period June 30, 2010–June 29, 2013 supported by
the IMF Policy Support Instrument (PSI), and sets out the data reporting requirements. This
Technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) supersedes the TMU issued in Country Report
No. 12/152.
I. Quantitative Program Targets
2.
The quantitative program will be assessed through assessment criteria (AC) and indicative
targets (IT) for the duration of the program.
3.
AC will apply to the following indicators for December 31, 2012 (the test date)
throughout the program period; other dates are IT:


Floor on stock of net foreign assets (NFA) of the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR);



Ceiling on stock of reserve money;



Ceiling on flow of net domestic financing (NDF) of the central government;



Ceiling on contracting or guaranteeing of new non-concessional external debt by the
public sector; and



Ceiling on stock of external payment arrears of the public sector.

4.

IT targets apply to the following indicators throughout the program period:


Floor on flow of domestic revenue collection of the central government;



Ceiling on flow of net accumulation of domestic arrears of the central government;



Ceiling on stock of consolidated domestic debt of the public sector; and



Floor on flow of priority spending.

5.
Assessment criteria on contracting or guaranteeing of new non-concessional external
debt by the public sector and stock of external payment arrears of the public sector are
applicable on a continuous basis for the duration of the program.
6.
Program exchange rates. For accounting purposes, the following program exchange
rates, which are end-December 2011 rates, apply for 2012:

Ceiling on net domestic financing of the government
8.
A ceiling applies to NDF. The ceiling for December 31, 2012 is cumulatively measured
from December 31, 2011 is indicated in Table 3. Quantitative Assessment Criteria and Indicative
Targets for end-December 2012.
9.
Definition. NDF of the government is defined as the change in the sum of (i) net banking
sector credit to the government and (ii) non-bank holdings of government domestic debt.
10.

Net banking sector credit to the government is defined as



Consolidated credit to the government from the banking system (NBR and commercial
banks, as recorded in the monetary survey), including credit to the government,
provinces and districts. The outstanding consolidated government debt held by the
banking system,1 includes government debt to the NBR amounting to RWF 38.6 billion

1

Consisting of bank holdings of treasury bills, bonds (domestic), old development bonds (pre-1994 debt), new
development bonds (including those used for recapitalization of banks), and other accounts receivable.

62

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

incurred as a result the overdraft to the prewar government and the 1995 devaluation 2,
as well as the current overdraft with the NBR. Credit to the government will exclude
treasury bills issued by the NBR for monetary policy purposes, the proceeds of which are
sterilized in deposits held as other NBR liabilities.


less total government deposits with the banking system (as recorded in the monetary
survey), including in the main treasury account, the accounts of line ministries, the fund
for assistance to genocide survivors, the Rwanda Revenue Authority, the electoral
commission, the demobilization commission, fonds routier, the privatization account, and
the accounts of any other autonomous public enterprises and public agencies over which
the government has direct control over their deposits. Thus, this definition excludes any
government deposits, over which the central government does not have any direct
control (i.e., for project accounts, Global Fund money meant for the private sector,
counterpart funds, and fonds publics affectés).

11.
Non-bank holdings of government domestic debt consist of non-bank holdings of
treasury bills, bonds (domestic and non-resident), old development bonds (pre-1994 debt), new
development bonds (including those used for recapitalization of banks), and other accounts
receivable.
12.
Grants extended by the Global Fund that are under the control of the central government
are programmed at US$200.2 million for 2012, corresponding to RWF 120.9 billion at the
program exchange rate.
Adjusters to NDF:


The ceiling on NDF will be adjusted upward by the amount of any shortfall between
actual and programmed budgetary loans and grants3 (defined in Table 2. Quantitative
Assessment Criteria and Indicative Targets for end-December 2012), up to a maximum of
US$80 million, evaluated in Rwandan francs at the program exchange rate. The ceiling
will be adjusted downward by the amount of any excess of actual over programmed
budgetary grants and loans above US$24 million, evaluated in Rwandan francs at the
program exchange rate.



The ceiling on NDF will be adjusted upward by the extent to which in Rwandan francs at
the program exchange rate the proceeds of any sovereign bonds issued before
December 31, 2012 less any amount used to retire government-guaranteed external
loans of the Kigali Convention Center (KCC) fall short of US$230 million.

2

The authorities will inform Fund staff of any substantive changes in government accounts with the banking
system, which may affect the calculation of net bank claims.
3

Budgetary grants exclude COMESA and HIPC grants, but include Global Fund.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 63

RWANDA



The ceiling on NDF will be adjusted upward by the amount of expenditure for food
imports in the case of a food emergency.

13.
Reporting requirement. Data on NDF (showing separately treasury bills and
government bonds outstanding, other government debt, and central government deposits), each
type of debt to be shown by debt holder, will be transmitted on a monthly basis within five
weeks from the end of each month. Deposits of the government with the NBR and with the
commercial banks will be separated from the deposits of the public enterprises and autonomous
public agencies and agencies that the government does not have any direct control over.
Floor on flow of domestic revenues
14.
A floor applies to domestic revenue. The floor for December 31, 2012 is cumulatively
measured from December 31, 2011.
15.
Definition. The floor on domestic government revenue is defined as total government
revenue (tax and non-tax revenues), per the central government fiscal operation table, but
excluding external grants, and privatization receipts.
16.
Reporting requirement. Detailed data on domestic revenues will be transmitted on a
monthly basis within five weeks of the end of each month.
Floor on priority expenditure
17.
The floor applies to priority spending of the government. The floor for December 31,
2012 is cumulatively measured from December 31, 2011. Other dates are indicative targets.
18.
Definition. Priority expenditure is defined as the sum of those recurrent expenditures,
domestically-financed capital expenditures, and net lending that the government has identified
as priority in line with the EDPRS. Priority expenditure is monitored through the computerized
SIBET expenditure management system which tracks priority spending of the annual budget at
the program level.
19.
Reporting requirement. Data on priority expenditure will be transmitted on a monthly
basis within five weeks of the end of each month.

Net accumulation of domestic arrears of the government
20.
A ceiling applies to net accumulation of domestic arrears of the government.4 The ceiling
for December 31, 2012 is cumulatively measured from December 31, 2011.
21.
Definition. The net accumulation of arrears is defined as the difference between the
gross accumulation of new domestic arrears (measured as the difference between payment
orders and actual payments related to payment orders issued) and gross repayment of any
arrears outstanding since the beginning of the year under review (including repayment of float
during the review year and the repayment of older arrears).
22.
Reporting requirement. Data on repayment of domestic arrears and the remaining
previous year‘s stock of arrears will be transmitted on a monthly basis within five weeks of the
end of each month.
C. Limits on External Debt
Limit on new non-concessional external debt of the public sector
23.
A ceiling applies to the contracting and guaranteeing by the public sector of new nonconcessional borrowing debt with nonresidents (see below for the definition of the public sector,
concessionality and debt). The ceiling is given in Table 3. Quantitative Assessment Criteria and
Indicative Targets for end-December 2012 which applies continuously from end-June 2010 to
end-June 2013; it excludes the swap agreement of US$50 million signed in November 2009
between the NBR and the IFC, a loan of US$13.1 million for the purchase of two air planes in
2009, and euro 8 million for loan contracted by the BRD from the European Investment Bank in
September 2011. The ceiling also excludes non-concessional borrowing by one state-owned
bank, the Bank of Kigali, which is assumed not to seek or be granted a government guarantee.
The ceiling also applies to private debt for which official guarantees have been extended,
including future swaps involving foreign currency loans guaranteed by the public sector (see
below for swaps), and which, therefore, constitute a contingent liability of the public sector.
Adjuster to the limit on new non-concessional external debt of the public sector
24.
The ceiling on the contracting and guaranteeing by the public sector of new
non-concessional borrowing debt with nonresidents will be adjusted downwards to the extent to
which the proceeds of a sovereign bond issued before end-December 2012 falls short of
US$350 million. Additionally, the ceiling will be adjusted downwards by an amount equivalent to
any repayment of existing non-concessional external borrowing included under the ceiling, as set
out in ¶23 above, such as US$200 million earmarked for the early repayment of guaranteed

A negative target thus represents a floor on net repayment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 65

RWANDA

borrowing by the Kigali Convention Center (US$120 million) and RwandAir ($80 million) in 2012
and 2013.
25.
Definition of the public sector. The public sector comprises the general government
(the central government, the NBR, local governments which include provinces and districts) and
entities in which the government holds a controlling stake—owning more than 50 percent of the
shares or the ability to determine general corporate policy.5 This definition of public sector
excludes the Bank of Kigali.
26.
For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal obligation of
the public sector to service a debt in the event of nonpayment by the debtor (involving
payments in cash or in kind), or from any implicit legal or contractual obligation of the public
sector to finance partially or in full any shortfall incurred by the debtor.
27.
Definition of concessionality For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes
a grant element of at least 35 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the
difference between the present value (PV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a
percentage of the nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is
calculated by discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt.6 The
discount rates used for this purpose are the currency specific commercial interest reference rates
(CIRRs), published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation Development (OECD). For debt
with a maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year-average CIRR will be used to calculate the PV of
debt and, hence, its grant element. For debt with a maturity of less than 15 years, the six-month
average CIRR will be used. To both the ten-year and six-month averages, the same margins for
differing repayment periods as those used by the OECD need to be added (0.75 percent for
repayment periods of less than 15 years, 1 percent for 15 to 19 years, 1.15 percent for 20 to
29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more).
28.
The definition of debt, for the purposes of the limit in the AC, is set out in point 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt, effective December 1, 2009). It
not only applies to the debt as defined in Point 9 of the Executive Board decision, but also to
commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. The definition of
debt set forth in No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in
Fund Arrangements reads as follows:

5

Government control of an entity can be established based on the following criteria: (i) ownership of the majority
of the voting interest; (ii) control of the board or other governing body; (iii) control of the appointment and
removal of key personnel; (iv) control of key committees of the entity; (v) golden shares and options;
(vi) regulation and control; (vii) control by a dominant public sector customer or group of public sector
customers; and (viii) control attached to borrowing from the government.
6

The calculation of concessionality will take into account all aspects of the loan agreement, including maturity,
grace period, payment schedule, upfront commissions, and management fees.

66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

(a) The term "debt" will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent,
liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in
the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to
make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services,
at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or
interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms,
the primary ones being as follows:
(i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis
of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including
deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers' credits) and
temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans
under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest,
by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements);
(ii) suppliers' credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to
defer payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered
or services are provided; and
(iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee
has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually
shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lesser
retains the title to the property. The debt is the present value (at the inception
of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or
maintenance of the property.
(b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9(a) above, arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a
contractual obligation that constitutes debt. Failure to make payment on an
obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on
delivery) will not give rise to debt.
Limit on the stock of external payment arrears
29.
A continuous assessment criterion applies to the non-accumulation of payment arrears
on external debt contracted or guaranteed by the public sector. External payment arrears consist
of external debt service obligations (principal and interest) that have not been paid at the time
they are due, as specified in the contractual agreements, but shall exclude arrears on obligations
that are subject to rescheduling.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 67

RWANDA

Consolidated Domestic Debt of the Public Sector (DD)
30.
For program purposes, DD excludes treasury bills issued by the NBR for monetary policy
purposes. The ceiling on DD applies to domestic commitments contracted or guaranteed by the
public sector. This also applies to private debt for which official guarantees have been extended
either implicitly or explicitly. The authorities would inform Fund staff of any changes in debt
position of public sector entities.
Adjusters:


In the case of a shortfall in programmed budgetary loans and grants (per paragraph 12),
the ceiling on consolidated domestic debt of public sector will be adjusted upward by the
same amount as the increase in the ceiling in the NDF, but capped per paragraph 12.



The ceiling on the DD will be adjusted upward by the amount of expenditure for food
imports in the case of a food emergency.

31.
Reporting requirement. Data on domestic debt of the public sector, including treasury
bills issued by the NBR for monetary policy purposes, will be transmitted on a monthly basis
within five weeks of the end of each month.
D. Targets for Monetary Aggregates
Net foreign assets of the National Bank of Rwanda (NFA)
32.

A floor applies to the NFA of the NBR for December 31, 2012.

Definition. NFA of the NBR in Rwandan francs is defined, consistent with the definition of the
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) template, as external assets readily available to, or
controlled by, the NBR net of its external liabilities. Pledged or otherwise encumbered reserve
assets (including swaps) are excluded; such assets include, but are not limited to, reserve assets
used as collateral or guarantee for third party external liabilities. Foreign assets and foreign
liabilities in U.S. dollars are converted to Rwandan francs by using the U.S. dollar/Rwanda franc
program exchange rate. Foreign assets and liabilities in other currencies are converted to
U.S. dollars by using the actual end-of-period U.S. dollar/currency exchange rate. Foreign
liabilities include, inter alia, use of IMF resources (CCFF and post-conflict emergency assistance
purchases and SAF/ESAF/ECF disbursements).
Adjusters:


68

The floor on NFA will be adjusted downward by the amount of any shortfall between
actual and programmed budgetary loans and grants (per footnote 4). This adjustment
will be capped at the equivalent of US$80 million, evaluated in Rwanda francs at the
program exchange rate. In the case of excess of actual over programmed budgetary
loans and grants, the floor of the NFA remains unchanged for the first US$24 million.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

Subsequently, the floor will be adjusted upwards by any amount in excess of
US$24 million, evaluated in RWF at the program exchange rate.


The floor on NFA will also be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount of shortfall
(excess) between actual and programmed encumbered reserve assets, evaluated in
Rwanda francs at the program exchange rate.7



The floor on NFA will be adjusted downward by the extent to which in Rwandan francs at
the program exchange rate the proceeds of any sovereign bonds issued before
December 31, 2012 less any amount used to retire government-guaranteed external
loans of the Kigali Convention Center (KCC) fall short of US$230 million.



The floor on NFA will be adjusted downward by the amount of expenditure for food
imports in the case of a food emergency, evaluated in Rwanda francs at the program
exchange rate.

33.
Reporting requirement. Data on foreign assets and foreign liabilities of the NBR will be
transmitted on a weekly basis within seven days of the end of each week, including breakdown of
assets that are pledged or encumbered. This transmission will include daily and weekly data on
the NBR‘s foreign exchange liabilities to commercial banks (including required reserves with the
NBR) and the exchange rate used for their conversion into Rwanda francs will be shown
separately.
Reserve money
34.
A ceiling applies to the stock of reserve money for December 31, 2012 as indicated in
Table 3. Quantitative Assessment Criteria and Indicative Targets for End-December 2012. The
ceiling is the upper bound of a reserve money band (set at+/- 2 percent) around a central
reserve money target).
35.
The stock of reserve money for a given quarter will be calculated as the arithmetic
average of the stock of reserve money at the end of each calendar month in the quarter. Daily
average of all the three months in the quarter will constitute the actual reserve money to be
compared with the target.
36.
Reserve money is defined as the sum of currency in circulation, commercial banks‘
reserves, and other nonbank deposits at the NBR.

7

The programmed amount of encumbered reserve assets stands at zero at December 2012.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 69

RWANDA

Adjuster:


The ceiling on the stock of reserve money will be adjusted symmetrically for a change in
the required reserve ratio of commercial banks. The adjustor will be calculated as (new
reserve ratio minus program baseline reserve ratio) multiplied by actual amount of
liabilities (Rwanda Franc plus foreign-currency denominated) in commercial banks.

37.
Reporting requirement. Data on reserve money will be transmitted on a weekly basis
within seven days of the end of each week. This transmission will include a daily and a weekly
balance sheet of the NBR which will show all items listed above in the definitions of reserve
money.
II. Other Data Reporting Requirements
38.
For the purposes of program monitoring, the Government of Rwanda will provide the
data listed in Table 1 below, weekly data within seven days of the end of each week; monthly
data within five weeks of the end of each month; annual data as available.
39.
The authorities will inform the IMF staff in writing at least ten business days (excluding
legal holidays in Rwanda or in the United States) prior to making any changes in economic and
financial policies that could affect the outcome of the financial program. Such policies include
but are not limited to customs and tax laws (including tax rates, exemptions, allowances, and
thresholds), wage policy, and financial support to public and private enterprises. The authorities
will similarly inform the IMF staff of any nonconcessional external debt contracted or guaranteed
by the government, the NBR, or any statutory bodies, and any accumulation of new external
payments arrears on the debt contracted or guaranteed by these entities. The authorities will
furnish an official communication to the IMF describing program performance of quantitative
and structural assessment criteria and benchmarks within 8 weeks of a test date. The authorities
will on a regular basis submit information to IMF staff with the frequency and submission time
lag as indicated in Table 1. The information should be mailed electronically to the Fund.
(email: afrrwa@imf.org).

APPENDIX II. RWANDA: EXTERNAL STABILITY ASSESSMENT
Current
account

Background: Improvements in cash crop production have
raised export volumes in recent years, but investment needs
have led to a persistent deficit. The narrow export base makes
Rwanda vulnerable to commodity price movements. Aid flows
cover the bulk of the deficit.
Assessment: Structural reforms to improve export capacity are
crucial. Investment projects need to be prioritized in order to
manage risks.

Real exchange
rate

Background: Unlike elsewhere in the EAC, the NBR has kept the
nominal USD-RWF rate relatively stable.
Assessment: The CGER assessment finds that the real exchange
rate to be broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals,
though there is some evidence that it may be overvalued.

Capital account
and financial
flows

Background: Aid continues to form the bulk of capital flows,
and the overall BOP expected to record a surplus in 2012. In
recent weeks, major donors delayed part of their disbursements
in light of a UN report examining Rwanda‘s role in the conflict in
DR Congo. Thus far, donors have not withdrawn support. The
authorities have provided guarantees for non-concessional
foreign borrowing, though these remain well within agreed
limits.
Assessment: Barring unexpected developments arising from the
UN‘s investigations, near-term prospects for aid are unchanged.
However, support from traditional donors is likely to diminish in
the future as Rwanda approaches middle-income status. On the
other hand, Rwanda could tap funds from non-traditional
donors, as well as accessing concessional resources from
multilateral donors.
Background: Rwanda ‗s reserves are projected to cover 5.1
months of imports and are expected to remain above 4 months
over the medium term.
Assessment: The reserve levels appear adequate. A more
flexible exchange rate setting could reduce the pressure on the
NBR to maintain a relatively high level of reserves compared to
its EAC peers.

International
reserves

Debt
sustainability

Background: With HPIC completion, Rwanda‘s debt position is
sustainable. The most recent DSA update reaffirmed Rwanda as
being at moderate risk of debt distress. The authorities have
provided guarantees for non-concessional foreign borrowing,
though these remain well within agreed limits.
Assessment: A preliminary DSA confirms that Rwanda remains
vulnerable to export shocks. However, the thresholds used to
assess debt distress have been raised due to an improvement in
Rwanda‘s institutional capacity. As a result, both the magnitude
and length of the breach is lower.

Overall assessment: The
external position does not
show immediate risks but
medium-term challenges
need to be addressed.
Rwanda remains vulnerable
to external shocks,
including aid shortfalls and
commodity price
fluctuations. Strong
program performance and
improvements in capacity
suggest there is greater
capacity to assume greater
non-concessional
borrowing over the
medium term.
Policy priorities: A gradual
transition to a more
market-determined
exchange rate regime
would be desirable, both to
improve the conduct of
monetary policy and
support efforts to enhance
export competitiveness.
While borrowing remains
low and sustainable under
most scenarios, the
authorities should use their
capacity to tap nonconcessional resources
prudently. This would
include a careful vetting of
projects, with priority
placed on necessary
improvements where public
sector involvement would
yield the greatest benefit.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Decision point—point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country qualifies
for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance—amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at
the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point—point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as
defined in footnote 4 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of
pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).

14

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts cannot be added.
15

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim period.

X. Safeguards Assessments:
The 2007 safeguards update assessment noted that since 2003, the National Bank of Rwanda
(NBR) strengthened its own safeguards: External audits were completed on time, the Committee
of Auditors became operational, and the Internal Audit Department helped in the strengthening
of controls over monetary program data. The update assessment‘s priority recommendations
concerned timely publication of the audited financial statements, further improving external
audit arrangements, and conformity with of IFRS. Safeguards policy does not require an update
safeguards assessment in the case of the non-financial arrangement with the Fund. However,
such assessment may be voluntary requested by the country, and the NBR has made a formal
request for the update assessment.
XI. Exchange System:
The currency of Rwanda is the Rwandan franc. On December 1998, Rwanda accepted the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the IMF and maintains a system free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. As of
October 31, 2012, the official exchange rate was RWF 627.2 per U.S. dollar. The exchange rate has
depreciated slightly since end-2011. The de facto exchange rate regime is currently classified as
crawl like and the de jure as floating. With effect from December 27, 2010, the official exchange
rate is the weighted average computed from a previous foreign exchange interbank market
transaction and an intervention transaction by the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR). The Average
Reference Rate, formerly used for the official exchange rate, was eliminated. The NBR applies a
margin of +/-0.8 percent to the official rate to derive a customer rate. With a view to introducing
more flexibility in its exchange rate policy, since March 24, 2010, NBR introduced an exchange
rate corridor framework.
XII.

Article IV Consultation:

1

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that
are qualified for the assistance. The debt relief covers the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004
which remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief. The MDRI is financed by
bilateral contributions and the Fund's own resources, as well as the resources already disbursed to the member
under the HIPC Initiative (see Section VII above).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Rwanda
On November 28, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Rwanda.17
Background
Rwanda has been an economic success story. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth
averaged above 8 percent per year in the last decade; inflation has been subdued since 2009;
foreign reserves have been kept at adequate levels; poverty based on the household living
conditions survey declined from about 57 percent in 2005/06 to below 45 percent in 2010/11;
and income inequality declined notably.
Macroeconomic developments have been generally favorable this year. The Rwandan economy
grew by 8.6 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2012, driven by the construction and
services sectors. Headline inflation declined to 5.4 percent in October 2012, mainly in response
to slowing import prices for food and petroleum products while core inflation was down to 2.5
percent.
The current account deficit has widened due to strong import growth and delays in aid inflows.
Exports of goods and services have remained strong in 2012, as rising mineral exports and
markedly higher tea prices have more than offset lower prices for a number of traditional
exports, including coffee. Meanwhile, imports have increased rapidly, driven by higher imports
17

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

of capital goods and materials for the construction sector. Moreover, aid delays have resulted in
lower official transfers. As a result, the current account deficit (including aid inflows) has
widened and, for 2012, is estimated to reach 11.3 percent of GDP.
Fiscal consolidation continued in the July 2011-June 2012 fiscal year. The overall fiscal deficit
(cash basis, after grants), was 0.7 percent of GDP lower than targeted, as a result of greaterthan-projected revenue and lower spending. The higher revenue reflected higher income tax
revenue due to unexpectedly large clearance of arrears, as well as higher revenue from taxes
on goods and services and international trade (boosted by higher imports). On the spending
side, higher-than-budgeted current spending, mainly on wages and salaries, was more than
offset by under-execution of domestically-financed capital expenditures.
The monetary policy stance has been tightened since mid-2012, following an extended period of
accommodation. Against a background of rapid growth in broad money and credit to the private
sector in the first half of the year, the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) raised its key repo rate
(policy rate) in May 2012 by 50 basis points (to 7.5 percent) and increased the use of repo
operations to mop up excess liquidity. As of end-October, the exchange rate had depreciated by
3.7 percent since the beginning of the year.
The macroeconomic outlook remains generally favorable, provided delays in budget support
disbursements are temporary. For the whole of 2012, real GDP growth is projected at about
7.7 percent, easing compared to the first half of the year because of weaker agricultural output
and lower-than-planned government spending caused by delays in some budget support
disbursements. Growth is expected to be sustained at 7.6 percent in 2013, driven by an
expansion in services and construction, and to stabilize at around 7 percent over the medium
term. Inflation is projected to continue its convergence toward the authorities’ medium-term
target of 5 percent per year.
Risks to the outlook arise mainly from possible cutbacks in aid and a more challenging global
environment. Staff estimates indicate that a prolonged delay in the delivery of budget support
could lower growth in 2013 by 1½ percentage points and possibly more, depending on the
magnitude of second round effects.
Rwanda’s macroeconomic policies are supported by the IMF’s Policy Support Instrument (PSI),
which was approved in June 2010. The 5th review under the PSI was completed in conjunction
with the conclusion of the 2012 Article IV consultation.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Rwanda’s strong economic performance in the last decade,
including under the PSI-supported program. Sustained rapid economic growth, relatively
subdued inflation, and a sharp decline in poverty and income inequality have been underpinned
by sound and inclusive policies supported by the donor community. Although the outlook
remains favorable, it is subject to highly uncertain prospects for donor aid and the global
environment, while the export base is narrow and poverty needs to be further reduced. Directors
therefore stressed the importance of maintaining sound economic management and the
momentum of structural reform, and promoting regional stability.
Directors considered the overall stance of fiscal policy to be appropriate. They welcomed the
steps taken to address delays in budget support, including identification of contingent spending
cuts, and urged a cautious execution of fiscal policy to take into account available financing.
They underscored the importance of prioritizing spending and minimizing recourse to domestic
bank financing.
Directors called for stepped-up efforts to strengthen the domestic revenue base and reduce the
aid dependence. They encouraged the authorities to reform tax policy and revenue
administration in line with the recommendations of a recent IMF technical assistance mission.
Directors welcomed the steps the authorities have taken to strengthen public financial
management and debt management capacity. They noted the authorities’ planned issuance of a
euro bond before end-201218, and agreed that the bulk of the proceeds should be used to retire
shorter term external debt to help preserve debt sustainability. At the same time, Directors
stressed the need to maximize the use of concessional financing.
Directors supported maintenance of a tight monetary stance to contain inflationary pressures.
They welcomed the central bank’s adoption of a more flexible reserve money targeting
framework to improve liquidity management and the effectiveness of monetary policy. They
commended efforts to improve the functioning of the foreign exchange and money markets, and
encouraged greater exchange rate flexibility to protect against external shocks.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to increase financial inclusion by strengthening
financial intermediation in the rural areas. They noted that the risks and challenges stemming
from the rapid expansion of local savings and credit cooperatives and the growing exposure of
banks to the real estate sector call for strong financial sector regulation and supervision.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to improve the business
environment, strengthen competitiveness, and broaden the economic base. The ongoing work
on an ambitious new economic development and poverty reduction strategy will be important in
18

The euro bond launch was subsequently postponed.

this regard. Directors emphasized that the strategy’s targets should be realistic and consistent
with available financing.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fifth Review Under the Policy Support Instrument
for Rwanda
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed today the
fifth review under a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Rwanda. In
completing the review, the Board approved a waiver of nonobservance of the
quantitative assessment criterion on net domestic financing (NDF).
The Executive Board approved a three-year PSI for Rwanda on June 16, 2010 (see
Press Release No. 10/247). The IMF's framework for PSIs is designed for low-income
countries that may not need, or want, IMF financial assistance, but still seek IMF
advice, monitoring and endorsement of their policies. PSIs are voluntary and
demand driven (see Public Information Notice No. 05/145.)
Following the Executive Board‘s discussion on Rwanda, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Rwandan authorities are to be commended for their satisfactory implementation of the
economic program supported by the Policy Support Instrument, carried out against a
challenging global economic environment. Economic growth has continued to be strong,
inflation remains contained, and poverty has further declined.
“Fiscal and monetary policies remain appropriate. Delays in budget support have required
postponing some government spending, and fiscal policy during the remainder of the fiscal
year will need to be carefully executed to minimize recourse to domestic bank financing and
avoid crowding out the private sector. Meanwhile, the central bank has appropriately
tightened the monetary stance to slow credit growth and mitigate exchange rate and inflation
pressures.
“Strengthening the domestic revenue base and public financial management are important

RWANDA

objectives, including for reducing aid dependency. The recommendations of a recent
technical assistance mission on tax policy and revenue administration represent a good basis
for broadening significantly the tax base.
“The government has taken important steps to strengthen Rwanda‟s debt management
capacity. It will be critical in the period ahead to continue with prudent management of debt
and complete large ongoing investment projects. It will also be important to maintain the
momentum of structural reforms to improve the business environment, strengthen
competitiveness, and broaden the economic base, in order to sustain economic growth and
further reduce poverty,” Mr. Shinohara added.

Statement by Mr. Assimaidou on Rwanda
Executive Board Meeting
November 28, 2012
1. On behalf of my Rwandan authorities, I would like to thank the Board, Management
and Staff for their continued support. Staff‟s last visit to Kigali to conduct the Article IV
consultation and the 5th review of the PSI helped to confirm the significant progress made
over the last decades in transforming the economy, and to identify and develop the strategy to
meet the challenges that still constrain this endeavor. My authorities very much appreciate
the candid and open discussion that took place and broadly share the thrust of the staff report
as a fair reflection of results achieved and issues at stake.
2. The PSI continues to serve Rwanda well as an appropriate anchor for the authorities‟
policies geared towards maintaining macroeconomic stability, supporting growth and the
overall economic development, and reducing poverty. My authorities have maintained the
momentum of strong and sustained reforms that have led to robust output growth in the last
decade – above 8 percent a year- and made significant advances in reducing poverty, from
57 percent in 2005/06 to 45 percent in 2010/11, equivalent to lifting about a million people
out of poverty. The authorities are committed to keep pace with the macroeconomic policies
and structural reforms that underpinned these achievements, as evidenced by their
performance for the period under review.
3. Amid a domestic environment of mounting social needs and capacity constraints,
paired with the international environment of global slowdown and delayed donor aid, my
authorities have maintained the momentum of reforms and economic development leading to
strong results. In view of this performance, my authorities request the Board‟s support for the
conclusion of the 5th review under the PSI and the 2012 Article IV consultation, including a
waiver on the nonobservance of the quantitative assessment criterion on net domestic
financing, which was missed by a small margin.
Recent Developments and Program Performance
4. My authorities’ performance under the PSI continues to be strong. All but one
end-June quantitative assessment criteria and all indicative targets were met. Structural
reforms are also proceeding well, albeit some with delays due to capacity constraints and the
heavy workload caused by the volume of pressing reforms on the government agenda. Key
steps have been taken; the homegrown DSA is now completed and the medium-term debt
management strategy will be submitted to Cabinet in late November 2012. My authorities
reaffirm their commitment to step-up efforts to implement other important measures in early
2013, including in the public financial management and investment climate areas.
5. The benign macroeconomic management paired with structural reforms in major
sectors, has supported output growth. After standing strongly at 8.6 percent in 2011, real
GDP growth is projected to ease to 7.7 percent in 2012, partly due to a poor weather-caused
weak agricultural output and delayed capital spending. The supply gap in domestic fresh food
should push inflation upward, to 7.5 percent at end-2012, against a low 5.6 percent in
September, and still well below its 2011 peak of 8.3 percent. My authorities are taking

RWANDA

actions, including from the monetary side to help inflation edge down to their medium-term
target of 5 percent, in line with the East African Community convergence criterion.
6. Aid disbursements from a number of bilateral and multilateral donors, estimated at
about 3 percent of GDP, have been delayed, hence taking a toll on the government fiscal
stance, widening the current account deficit and cutting back growth. My authorities view
these adverse developments as temporary. They are continuing discussions with partners
aimed at settling misunderstandings and resuming financing flows as planned.
Challenges and Policies Going Forward
7. Structural transformation for Growth and poverty reduction. Though the global
slowdown and the setback in donor assistance have constrained growth this year, my
authorities continue to endeavor along the lines set forth under their Vision 2020 and
reflected in their successive Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategies
(EDPRS). It is to create a thriving broad-based economy away from agriculture towards
industry and services, which would grow at sustained double-digit rates over the medium
term and generate employment opportunities to lift more people out of poverty. In this
regard, the authorities intend to keep pace with their development plans that helped reduce
poverty by 12 percentage points in the last five years, as the recent household living
conditions survey showed. The authorities‟ EDPRS 2 is being developed accordingly,
addressing four key areas: (i) economic transformation, (ii) rural development,
(iii) productivity and youth employment, and (iv) accountable governance. The government‟s
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms for 2012/13 and the medium term will be
consistent with this framework.
8. Fiscal policy. Maintaining an environment of macroeconomic stability continues to
guide my authorities‟ fiscal and monetary policies. The fiscal stance in FY 2011/12 was
characterized by higher-than-projected revenue and lower-than-planned spending. The
drivers on the revenue side were income tax and taxes on goods and services and
international trade, while under-execution of domestically-financed capital expenditures
contributed to reduce spending. Going forward, my authorities remain committed to their
strategy of fiscal consolidation through increased revenue mobilization and expenditure
prioritization. In this vein, the government has already implemented two out of four tax
policy measures planned for FY 2012/13; since July 2012, the tax rate for imported
construction materials has been increased from 5 to 10 percent and the gaming tax has been
effective since September 2012. Other important revenue administration measures are in their
final steps of preparation. These include: introducing Electronic Sales Register for recording
taxpayers„transactions and limiting VAT evasion; introducing e-filing and e-payment
systems to save time and improve service delivery; and establishing a One-Stop-Border Post
at Kagitumba and Rusumo border posts with 24-hour operations to facilitate cross-border
trade.
9. My authorities are cognizant of the need to overhaul tax policy, with the view to
raising further the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio. Moreover, in the face of uncertain donor

2 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RWANDA

assistance, the government‟s overarching goal of reducing aid dependency over the
mediumterm
is acute more than ever. For FY 2012/13, the authorities will continue to keep a prudent
stance, including by reducing spending to make up for shortfalls in external assistance and by
stepping-up revenue mobilization effort where necessary. For their broader tax policy reform
agenda, the government will take advantage of the recommendations made by the recent
FAD mission.
10. Monetary policy and the financial sector. Monetary policy over the past years has
been supportive of growth by facilitating credit to the private sector. With the slow recovery
worldwide and the ensued adverse impact on exports, my authorities appropriately used the
policy mix to enhance the domestic demand. Going forward, my authorities are working on
revamping the monetary framework and the key instruments for conducting policy, with the
view to enhancing transmission mechanisms. As regard the banking sector, it remains
healthy, well-capitalized and competitive. My authorities will continue to strengthen the
whole financial sector, to make it a sound provider of financing for productive activities. In
that regard, the NBR will closely monitor compliance with the existing laws while taking
steps to improve them, in line with the FSAP recommendations. Financial inclusion remains
a key concern to my authorities; in this vein, they are committed to helping the development
of the saving and credit cooperatives (SACCOs) on a sound footing. The NBR will pay a
particular attention to the supervision of this specific sector.
11. Investment financing and debt. My authorities intend to issue in December 2012, a
10-year Eurobond worth US$ 350 million. The proceeds will be used to retire an existing
publicly-guaranteed debt and fund the completion of a strategic investment project, the
Kigali Convention Center. As assessed by staff, this one-off operation will not change the
conclusions of the last DSA update, nor will it materially affect Rwanda‟s debt sustainability.
Conclusion
12. Over the past years, Rwanda has strived to implement an ambitious economic growth
and poverty reduction agenda with remarkable success. It has at the same time endeavored to
mitigate the impact of the global slowdown on its main indicators. Through sound policies,
my authorities have continued to help the economy recover its strong growth rates exhibited
throughout the last decade, and also made important inroads in curbing down poverty. These
achievements have been made possible along with a long period of macroeconomic stability.
The PSI instrument has proved an appropriate anchor as Rwanda leveraged the gains of this
favorable environment.
13. Yet, the challenges stiff facing the economy are daunting, and my authorities are
committed to pursue their efforts of structural transformation towards a more sustainable
growth model. From a still shallow tax base and the associated aid dependency, to the narrow
export sector, my authorities are fully aware of the needed structural reforms to remove the
bottlenecks and achieve the ambitious goals of their Vision 2020. In this endeavor, my
Rwandan authorities will continue to rely on the assistance of their development partners and
the Board‟s support.
