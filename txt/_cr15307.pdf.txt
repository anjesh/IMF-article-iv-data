IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Cambodia

On October 26, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Cambodia.
Cambodia’s economic growth has been one of the fastest among Asia’s developing economies in
recent years. It averaged 7.0 percent in the last five years driven by robust garments exports, real
estate, and construction. Economic activity remained strong with growth rate at 7 percent in
2014, notwithstanding appreciation of the real effective exchange rate following U.S. dollar
strengthening and growing competition from other low-cost garment producers. Inflation fell in
2014 and through 2015 owing to strong external disinflationary pressures from lower food and
oil prices.
The current account deficit (CAD) is estimated at around 12 percent of GDP in 2014, and is
largely financed by FDI and official loans. Gross official reserves increased to US$4.7 billion by
end-August 2015, nearly 4 months of prospective imports. The fiscal deficit narrowed in 2014 to
1.3 percent of GDP from 2.1 percent in 2013, supported by stronger revenues owing to improved
enforcement in tax and customs administration as well as higher-than-planned grants.
Private sector credit has grown by nearly 30 percent (year-on-year) on average in the past three
years, and rose to about 33 percent by the second quarter of 2015. The credit-to-GDP ratio
doubled over this period to over 50 percent and the loan-to-deposit ratio reached over
100 percent in early 2015. This reflects new foreign bank entry, increased foreign funding of
domestic banks and buoyant domestic activity. There is also evidence of increasing credit
concentration in the real estate and construction sectors. The National Bank of Cambodia raised
the reserve requirements in September 2012 by 0.5 percentage points to 12.5 percent and
expanded reserve requirements to banks’ foreign borrowings in March 2015.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

The short-term outlook remains broadly favorable. Growth is projected to remain robust at
7 percent in 2015, while inflation is projected to rise gradually to about 2 percent by end-2015.
The CAD is projected to narrow to around 11 percent in 2015 due to lower oil prices and some
diversification in the exports industry. The fiscal deficit is projected to rise modestly to 2 percent
in 2015 (below the budget, which targets a deficit of 4.2 percent) as a result of strong measures
to improve revenue administration. However, the spending mix is deteriorating due a higher
wage bill, while capital spending declined.
This outlook is subject to substantial downside risks, both domestic and external. Domestic risks
include rising financial sector vulnerabilities stemming from rapid credit growth; fiscal pressures
and erosion of competitiveness from wage increases and the uncertainty related to wage policy
and labor disputes. External risks arise from a stronger U.S. dollar, growth slowdown in Europe
constraining garments exports and weaker-than-expected growth in China having negative
spillovers through the foreign direct investment, banking and tourism channels.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Cambodia’s robust economic performance, the noteworthy
progress made in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and the ongoing transition to
lower middle-income country status. They saw Cambodia as being well placed to take advantage
of the transformation of regional trade patterns to expand and diversify its export base and
further integrate into global supply chains. At the same time, Directors noted that domestic risks
and the evolving external environment underscore the need to act decisively to address financial
sector vulnerabilities, safeguard policy buffers, and foster economic diversification.
Directors commended the authorities for the improvements in tax administration, as a result of
adoption of the Revenue Mobilization Strategy, which have led to a large increase in revenues
and the replenishment of government deposits. They emphasized that going forward continued
efforts to mobilize higher revenues will be needed to create fiscal space for social spending and
capital expenditure. They also recommended that future increases in public wages should be
contingent on fiscal performance and be accompanied by civil service reforms. Directors
emphasized that continuing to reform public financial management will be important to ensure
spending effectiveness and enhance budget transparency, and underscored the need to continue
to improve the monitoring of risks from contingent liabilities.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors advocated a pro-active approach to manage and mitigate risks to financial stability
while still protecting growth. They welcomed the recent expansion in the coverage of reserve
requirements to include banks’ foreign borrowing, but saw a need for additional measures.
Directors recommended raising reserve requirements and putting in place well-designed
macroprudential measures to moderate the pace of credit growth and guard against excessive risk
taking. They also considered that prudential regulations on large deposit-taking micro-finance
institutions should be upgraded and aligned with those of banks, and that efforts should be made
to better monitor developments in the real estate and construction sectors.
Directors welcomed the introduction of negotiable certificates of deposit and the increased
activity in this market. They saw further progress in developing an interbank market as important
for laying the groundwork for a more effective monetary framework, promoting de-dollarization
and supporting a more flexible exchange rate policy over time.
Directors noted continued progress in implementing the 2010 FSAP recommendations, and
encouraged the authorities to expedite the pace of implementation. They recommended, in
particular, further efforts to strengthen the crisis management framework and the supervisory
capacity of the National Bank of Cambodia, as well as considering a moratorium on offering new
bank licenses until supervisory capacity improves.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to promote economic diversification
and inclusive growth. Efforts to improve competitiveness should focus on upgrading
infrastructure and boosting rural access, strengthening human capital, and improving the
investment climate by reducing the overall cost of doing business.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 1, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context. Economic activity remained strong driven by garments exports, real estate, and
construction. Inflation decelerated strongly in late 2014 due to the sharp decline in oil
prices and REER appreciation. While the outlook remains broadly positive, it is subject to
substantial domestic risks as a result of rapid credit growth. External risks include
weaker-than-expected growth in the EU and China and continued appreciation of the
U.S. dollar.
Safeguarding macro and financial stability. Rapid credit growth, increasingly financed
by bank flows from abroad, and with greater exposure to the real estate and
construction sectors, poses significant macro financial risks. Raising reserve requirements
and introducing well-designed macroprudential policies would help to moderate the
pace of credit growth. Better monitoring of real estate developments is needed to
contain risks. Further strengthening banking supervision and the regulatory framework,
and completing a broader crisis management framework would support macro-financial
stability.
Securing a strong fiscal buffer while meeting development needs. Deficits have been
reduced on strong revenue performance. Continued fiscal consolidation is necessary to
maintain adequate government deposits in view of spending pressures from a higher
wage bill and an expected fall in official assistance. Steadfast implementation of the
Revenue Mobilization Strategy is needed to safeguard fiscal space, and provide resources
for development. Future public wage increases should be contingent on fiscal
performance, and be accompanied by broad civil service reform.
Promoting competitiveness, diversification, and inclusiveness. The changing
patterns of China’s trade and further regional integration through the ASEAN Economic
Community provide opportunities for economic diversification. Greater investment in
human capital and improving the business climate will help sustain robust growth and
enhance competitiveness, foster economic diversification, and inclusiveness.

substantially reducing poverty and inequality. It is poised
to become a lower middle-income country next year.
Looking ahead, further regional integration through the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) and
Cambodia’s strategic location close to fast-growing major economies can provide tailwinds as
Asia rebalances, regional wages rise, and production networks further integrate. However, to
capitalize on these opportunities and achieve sustainable and inclusive growth, wide-ranging
reforms need to be undertaken and vulnerabilities addressed.

2.
Past Fund advice. Policies are broadly in line with past Fund advice, but further reforms
are needed to ensure macro-financial stability. The authorities are implementing the Revenue
Mobilization Strategy (RMS), improving revenue collection, and strengthening public financial
management. They introduced Negotiable Certificate Deposits (NCDs) to develop the interbank
market and expanded reserve requirements to banks’ foreign borrowing to contain credit
growth. They have agreed on a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish a crisis
management framework. As explained in this report, going forward, continuing efforts are
needed to contain macro-financial risks to preserve financial stability, continue fiscal
consolidation to secure a strong fiscal buffer, and promote competitiveness and inclusiveness.

Inflation and output gap. While inflation
decelerated strongly in the last few months of 2014
due to the sharp oil price decline and REER
appreciation, average headline inflation in 2014 was
3.9 percent, about 1 percent higher than in 2013.
The modest positive output gap (estimated at
0.7 percent) would have led to higher inflation in
2014 had external disinflationary pressures not been
so strong.2 Strong disinflation continued in the first
half of 2015, with inflation falling to 1 percent in May.
For the rest of the year, inflation is projected to rise
gradually to around 2 percent by end-2015, reflecting
the recovery in food prices and stabilization of global
energy prices.

Credit developments. Rapid credit growth,
which accelerated to 31 percent (y/y) by end-2014
(and remained on average around 33 percent in
2015 Q2), is posing an increasing risk. The credit-toGDP ratio has doubled in three years to over
50 percent, exceeding the median emerging market
(EM) and double the low-income country (LIC) levels.
The speed of financial deepening has been striking,
with credit growing much more rapidly than in peer
Asian economies during their take-off. The loan-todeposit (LTD) ratio breached 100 in February 2015.3
This reflects both supply and demand factors:

Staff estimates show that lower oil prices would boost growth (by 0.3–0.7 percent) in 2015, improve the current
account balance, and lower inflation. Most of the oil market is controlled by private companies. There is evidence
of limited pass-through of international prices to domestic prices; therefore most of the windfall will be saved as
higher profits.

Staff’s calculation of a real-time coincident index based by pooling together high-frequency (monthly)
economic indicators including imports, exports, and private sector credit, implies economic activity has been
growing slightly above trend by about 0.5–1.0 percent.

3

The average LTD ratio masks the distribution of risks: a number of banks have LTDs much higher than
100 percent. LTD ratios are significantly higher in microfinance institutions that collect deposits but rely heavily
on external financing, with an average of 193 percent in 2014.

accommodative monetary policy, new foreign bank entry, and buoyant domestic activity. Real
estate-related lending grew by 53 percent (y/y) on average in 2015 Q2, while real estate prices
rose on average 10–20 percent y/y in 2014. Credit growth is projected to be around 3034 percent in 2015–16, and the credit-to-GDP gap is expected to exceed 10 percent by early
2017.4 Cambodia’s GDP growth has been one of the most credit-intensive, however, it has not
been accompanied by an increase in private investment.
6.
External stability. The current account deficit (CAD) is estimated at around 12 percent of
GDP in 2014, and largely financed by FDI and official loans. Moderating garment exports and
tourism growth were offset by lower power projects-related imports. The CAD is projected to
narrow to around 11 percent in 2015, primarily due to

August 2015, the REER appreciated by 8 percent

exchange rate targeting has supported price stability by providing a credible nominal anchor,
further strengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as higher wage pressures, may weigh on
Cambodia’s competitiveness.

BIS analysis suggests that credit-to-GDP gap of 10 percent or more above trend indicates a high probability of
serious banking strains in the following 2–3 years (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 2010, Drehmann and
others, 2010, etc.).

Box 1. Cambodia: External Sector Assessment1
The external position is relatively strong with the current account deficit predominantly financed by stable FDI and official
inflows. The REER is estimated to be broadly in line with fundamentals. In view of high dollarization and financial fragilities,
staff assesses that there is room to build additional reserves to increase resilience.
BOP Developments. The overall balance of payments (BOP)
has averaged an annual surplus of 2.5 percent of GDP from
2004 to 2014. A widening current account deficit since 2011
corresponds to large FDI inflows to finance the construction
of large power generation projects. Developments with the
capital and financial account were dominated by the
increase in direct investment from an average of
6½ percent of GDP for 2008–10 to 11¼ percent for 2011–
13. While the surge in direct investment may not be
maintained, imports would likely drop in line with the
completion of the power projects.

(2006) model to incorporate these features.3The results
suggest that current reserve coverage might not be adequate. According to this model, the optimal level of reserves
ranges from 27 to 30 percent of GDP, which is equivalent to additional reserves of US$200 to US$500 million. Moreover,
the high level of foreign currency deposits, at more than 1½ times of gross official reserves, seriously limits the central
bank’s lender of last resort capacity, and is lower than regional comparators. Therefore, a higher level of reserves—than
that suggested by the traditional reserve adequacy metrics—may be warranted.

Risks, spillovers, and policy response. The outlook is broadly positive but subject to
substantial downside risks.
Domestic risks. The main risk reflects the rising
financial sector vulnerabilities from rapid credit
growth. Other domestic risks include fiscal
pressures and erosion of competitiveness from
wage increases potentially outstripping
revenues and productivity improvements. The
uncertainty related to wage policy and labor
disputes could disrupt garment production and
weigh on investor sentiment.

External risks stem from a stronger U.S. dollar and/or a protracted growth slowdown in
Europe constraining garments exports, amid stiff competition from other low-cost
producers and wage pressures. Weaker-than-expected growth in China would also have
spillovers through the FDI, banking and tourism channels (Risk Assessment Matrix and
Box 2). If financial market stress re-emerges across the Euro area due to the Greece crisis, it
would affect Cambodia through the FDI, trade, tourism, and banking channels via its impact
on its Asian neighbors. Specifically, funding costs for Cambodian banks and microfinance
institutions (MFIs), which rely increasingly on external funding, would increase leading to
liquidity pressures and a credit crunch.



Policy response. The room for policies to support growth in the face of large external shocks
is limited, in view of high dollarization and a lack of monetary control, as well as insufficient
fiscal space over the medium term. Efforts to build policy buffers and resilience should be
stepped up preemptively. Should downside risks materialize in the near term and prove not
to be short-lived (e.g., prolonged slowdown in the EU), efforts to diversify the economy
should be expedited. Given the indexation of wages to the U.S. dollar and dollarized balance
sheets, exchange rate flexibility may not provide a boost to the CA balance in the near term.
In case of limited financial instability, liquidity buffers should be utilized. However, in the
event of severe financial stress, a more comprehensive approach will be required,
underscoring the importance of preemptively strengthening the crisis management
framework.

Authorities’ views. There was broad agreement between staff and the authorities on the
macroeconomic outlook and risks. The authorities have a similar assessment of the impact of
recent oil price developments on the current account, and project a slowdown in exports for this
year. They showed concerns regarding spillovers from Greece and EU growth on garment
exports. They also noted risks related to the expected US interest rate hike. On the external
sector assessment, while agreeing with staff on the medium-term assessment, authorities were
more optimistic about the prospects for FDI this year.

Box 2. Cambodia: Analysis of External Spillovers into Cambodia1
Given its high degree of openness, Cambodia is particularly vulnerable to spillover effects from its major
partners.2 Cambodia receives large inflows of external income (official transfers, grants and FDI) that amounted to
22 percent of GDP in 2014. It is strategically located near some of the fastest growing economies in the world, and
has close links through FDI, trade, tourism and banking channels. China, United States, Hong Kong SAR, the EU,
and Thailand together correspond to almost half of all the external transfers received, over 65 percent of all trade,
and about a quarter of all tourist arrivals in the country.
A long-run structural macro-econometric model was developed to evaluate the nature and strength of
linkages with top trading partners, and to quantify inward spillovers of external shocks. Using quarterly data
between 1996Q1 and 2013Q1 on core macroeconomic variables, we estimated a VARX* model.3 Two long-run
relationships were identified: 1) an augmented output equation, which postulates a relationship between domestic
output, partners’ GDP, the REER and external income; 2) an equation linking partner and domestic inflation rates.
The empirical results highlight the vulnerability of the Cambodian economy to external shocks. A negative
shock of one percent to partner’s GDP growth results in significant output losses in Cambodia, corresponding to
around 1.3 percent after one year. A 1 percent negative output shock in China and the United States is associated
with an output loss of 0.5 percent in Cambodia after one year, and the same shock to the EU corresponds to an
output decline of 0.3 percent. It causes a

Empirical results also show the limited
impact of the exchange rate in Cambodia.
As expected by high dollarization, the longrun exchange rate growth elasticity is
relatively low. A one-percent REER
depreciation leads to about 0.3 percent
increase in output growth, and the impact on
inflation is only 0.2 percent and is not
significant.

growth in the near term. Following Kilian
(2009), a structural VAR model was estimated to disentangle the impact of oil supply and demand shocks to real
GDP in Cambodia.4 Using this estimation and the decomposition of the recent oil price shock in WEO (2015), the
impact on Cambodia’s GDP is estimated to be 0.7 percent of GDP if the pass-through of international oil prices to
domestic prices is unchanged.5

Finally, this model also shows that external transfers have substantially driven Cambodia’s growth in the
past. Cambodia will face challenges after it graduates from low-income status and grants start to decline. In this
context, structural reforms to increase potential growth will become even more important in the medium-term.

Construction and real estate-related lending constitute around 19 percent of total credit stock and grew by
44 percent (y/y) on average by 2015 Q2.

6

Residential real estate prices in prime locations have increased by over 30 percent and commercial prices by
over 20 percent (y/y) in December 2014. Loan-to-value ratios are reported to trend upward of 70–80 percent.

RR for KHR is 8 percent, while RR for dollars and foreign borrowings are 12.5 percent.

After NBC’s policy change in pricing structure, the role of NCDs as liquidity absorbing instruments for the NBC
has improved. The volume of outstanding NCDs has increased from US$2 million in November 2013 to over
US$100 million in February (10 percent of fixed deposits) in 2015. NCDs are also an important step in fostering
the emergence of a formal secured interbank market. Additionally they provide a simple and transparent form of
collateral for use in the overdraft facility.

Past policy measures. Past monetary tightening (increase of reserve requirements (RR)
by 50 basis points to 12½ percent in September 2012) did not dent credit growth momentum
amid excess liquidity, strong deposit growth, reliance on foreign funding and the entry of new
banks.7 In August 2013, in line with past recommendations, the NBC issued NCDs, both in U.S.
dollars and Khmer riel (KHR), to help develop the interbank market. After a slow start, in recent
months, the primary NCD market has gained momentum and is expected to support banks’
liquidity management and lay the groundwork for market-based monetary policy operations.8
The expansion of reserve requirements to banks’ foreign borrowing was instituted in March 2015,
in line with previous Fund recommendations.

recommendations.9 To strengthen the
crisis management framework, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on establishing
information sharing was signed with the MEF, the NBC and Securities Exchange Commission of
Cambodia (SECC) in July 2014. The next step is to improve the quality of information, make
progress on forming technical teams, and to provide robust resolution powers. While the NBC’s
current focus on liquidity risk and broader crisis management seems appropriate, with growing
financial stability risks, the NBC should accelerate efforts to implement other FSAP
recommendations (Table 8). These include strengthening supervision and upgrading regulation
of the non-bank financial sector.

12.
Growing financial stability risks. The priority is to address growing financial stability
risks by stabilizing and moderating the pace of credit growth to more reasonable levels, while
closely monitoring the effect on growth. LTDs in banks have risen indicating a heavier reliance on
noncore funding, with 20 banks having LTD ratios over 100 and 12 banks with LTD ratios over
200 percent. The rise in noncore liabilities reflects the increased reliance on short-term external
borrowing, raising liquidity risks. In the event of a spike in global financial market volatility, a
reversal of foreign funding could lead to tightening of domestic liquidity conditions, leading to
potential liquidity stress and a credit crunch, with adverse spillovers to real economic activity.
Furthermore, some MFIs are now larger than some mid-sized commercial banks, and competing
with banks while being subject to looser regulation. Real estate developers are also reportedly
offering loans to buyers and are financed by foreign funding, while not being subject to stringent
regulatory and supervisory oversight. Credit is increasingly being channeled to the real estate
sector, which is exhibiting pockets of vulnerability.

Under the current LR, banks can satisfy the minimum LR requirement of 50 percent but have a shortfall of maturing assets
over maturing liabilities in the next 30 days. Although a large portion of banks’ balance sheet are invested in liquid assets, they
may face a short-term liquidity risks. The NBC is working on upgrading regulations on Liquid Asset Ratio (LAR) and Liquidity
Risk Management (expected to be implemented by early next year). The LAR encourages banks to hold a prudent amount of
liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30-day period and to better monitor true liquidity conditions.

Policy recommendations. The following policy measures would mitigate financial
stability risks and foster market development:


Monetary policy needs to be tightened in view of the positive output gap and rising
financial stability concerns. Specifically, RR should be raised substantially to moderate the
pace of credit growth and to curb aggregate demand.



Given the growing systemic relevance of large MFIs, and to prevent regulatory arbitrage,
prudential regulations should be upgraded/tightened to match those of banks.10
Specifically, RR should also be expanded to include foreign funding of deposit-taking
MFIs. Real estate developers, often providing supplier’s credit and increasingly funded by
foreign flows, should be brought under strict regulatory and supervisory control.



To contain systemic risk, well-designed macroprudential tools should be introduced
(Box 3). Fragility from high LTDs needs to be managed by a phased introduction (and
tightening) of LTD limits. In order to enhance resilience and build buffers, imposing
countercyclical capital requirements would be a good option. Given the growing exposure
to real estate, higher capital requirements and risk weights linked to real estate, as well as
sectoral concentration limits, are possible policy measures. Better monitoring of
developments in the real estate sector is warranted, including by enhancing data collection
on real estate sales and prices as well as construction activity. Limits on loan-to-value ratios
could be imposed once sufficient progress is made on improving data availability.



Enhancing the prompt corrective action framework, as well as instituting a broader crisis
management framework, should be expedited to mitigate vulnerabilities. Building on the
MoU, the crisis management framework should provide a sound institutional
arrangement with explicit inter-agency coordination mechanisms, including the exchange
of information, and improve inadequate resolution powers.



In light of the rapid expansion of the banking system and the move to risk-based
supervision, supervisory capacity remains stretched, especially in light of emerging risks.
In view of this, the 2010 FSAP recommendation to impose a moratorium on offering new
bank licenses remains valid. Also, in light of growing financial stability risks, the
implementation of other FSAP recommendations should be expedited.



To continue improving liquidity management, the NBC could offer shorter-term liquidity
absorption facilities as well as increasing the usage of NCDs by improving their attractiveness
through better pricing (as outlined in recent Fund TA). The progress of interbank market
development needs to be properly managed and monitored since it may further increase risk
of contagion, especially for banks that rely on short-term borrowing. Progress on upgrading
the liquidity ratio to cover only truly usable liquid assets should continue.

10
Currently, MFIs have lower RR requirement on deposits (8.5 percent) and can borrow externally without being
subjected to RR.

Box 3. Cambodia: Supporting Macro-Financial Stability with Macroprudential Policies1
Well-designed macroprudential measures, along with risk-based supervision and enhanced
micro-prudential policies are needed to moderate the ongoing risk buildup. Given the alreadystretched supervisory capacity and limited data availability, measures should be well-tailored and
implementation requirements need to be manageable.2
First, banks should be encouraged to be more reliant on internal sources of funding to reduce
risks. Stable funding requirements, such as Loan to Deposit (LTD) ratio, ensure that banks hold stable
liabilities to fund their assets. LTD ratio limits can also serve as a brake on excessive credit growth.
Although there are no easy rules of thumb and large presence of foreign banks makes Cambodia
unique among peers, the current LTD ratio in Cambodia far exceeds the level commonly observed in
LICs and EMs (80 percent, IMF 2014). This highlights the need for tightening LTD ratios, especially for
banks above a certain threshold.3 Tightening requires gradual phase-in to take into account
adjustment costs for financial institutions.
Second, enhancing resilience of the banking system would help minimize impact of systemic
risk. Imposing a countercyclical capital buffer (CCB) would be an option. Although most banks have
considerably higher capital than global standards, a widening credit-to GDP gap combined with the
fact that the credit-to-GDP ratio is high compared with peers indicates that the CCB would help
mitigate vulnerabilities.4 The current practice that supervisors can advise banks to hold additional
capital could help in the transition to the CCB.
Third, measures should be considered to limit banks’ growing exposure to the booming real
estate market and to ensure sound underwriting standards. The NBC could increase the risk
weights associated with real estate lending. Although price-based limits are preferable to quantitative
limits to minimize distortions, sectoral concentration limits can be useful in reducing credit supply and
building banks’ resilience by diversifying loan portfolios.5, 6 Other measures that could be considered,
include sectoral loan-to-value (LTV) limits and debt to income ratio (DTI). These can address the
demand for credit and complement capital tools especially when a real estate boom accompanies a
broader credit boom. However, without official housing prices and real-estate-related data, the priority
is to accelerate improvements in data availability and data quality for successful implementation.



Policies to reduce high dollarization include: (i) ensuring macroeconomic stability
through prudent fiscal, monetary, and structural policies; (ii) further developing the NBC’s
ability to forecast and target short-term liquidity; (iii) introducing deposit insurance for
local currency deposits; (iv) maintaining adequate international reserves; (v) marketbased measures to promote the riel (e.g., lower-cost and convenient services for riel use,
larger spread between foreign currency and riel RR).



The stable exchange rate against the U.S. dollar continues to serve as an important
nominal anchor, given limited monetary control.11 Going forward, the development of
money and foreign exchange markets is needed to promote de-dollarization and allow
for the implementation of an effective monetary framework, including exchange rate
flexibility to respond to external shocks.

14.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with the thrust of staff’s
recommendations, but were concerned about the growth implications. Specifically, the
authorities noted that they would consider introducing macroprudential measures, but were
concerned about the potential impact on growth, and viewed implementation capacity as a
constraint. However, they were keen on identifying risks, improving data collection and creating a
comprehensive risk assessment report.

B. Securing the Fiscal Buffer While Meeting Development Needs
15.
Developments in 2014. The fiscal deficit narrowed in 2014 to 1.3 percent of GDP (from
2.1 percent in 2013, GFS 2001), supported by stronger revenues as well as higher-than-planned
grants. Solid growth and improved tax and customs administration (particularly better auditing
and enforcement) following the government’s adoption of the Revenue Mobilization Strategy
(RMS) drove up tax revenues sharply (by around 2.2 percentage points of GDP to 13.9 percent in
2014).12 However, the spending mix deteriorated as current spending increased by 1.3 percent of
GDP, mostly driven by a higher wage bill, while capital spending fell by 0.6 percent of GDP. The
improvement in the fiscal balance resulted in the replenishment of government deposits to
7.1 percent of GDP.
16.
2015 Budget. The overall deficit is projected to widen to around 2 percent of GDP in
2015 (GFS 2001), imparting a modest positive fiscal impulse. The increase in the wage bill
(0.7 percent of GDP) is expected to fully offset higher revenues. A smaller-than-budgeted
11

Cambodia’s de facto exchange rate regime was reclassified as “stabilized” from “other managed,” effective
January 2014.
12

Initiated in late 2012, the RMS focuses on strengthening revenue administration, revenue policy and the
institutional framework in order to continue raising domestic revenue by at least ½ percent of GDP annually over
the medium term. Improved tax administration includes enhanced taxpayer registration, filing support, auditing,
and arrears management. For customs, the focus is on strengthening clearance processes (customs declaration, risk
management, and audit) and cross border control (smuggling, valuation), On revenue policy, the RMS focuses on
excises, VAT, widening tax base, rationalizing tax incentives and holidays, and imposing property taxes.

CAMBODIA

(4.2 percent of GDP) deficit, however, would be more consistent with the economy’s cyclical
position, and would boost government deposits further. Higher-than-expected revenues this
year should be saved, and nonwage current expenditure contained.
17.
Emerging fiscal pressures. In the near term, strong revenue efforts have temporarily
eased fiscal pressures. However, pressures are expected to reemerge in the medium term as the
wage bill is projected to continue rising due to electoral promises and an expected fall in official
assistance with the attainment of LMIC status.13 These pressures are especially challenging as
fiscal policy plays the main countercyclical role, given high dollarization and weak monetary
control. Additionally, in the absence of government bond markets, deposits serve as the only
financing buffer against shocks, including financial system fragilities.14 Therefore, consolidation is
needed, even though the Debt Sustainability Analysis indicates a low risk of debt distress.
18.
Wage increases. Cambodia’s public wage bill is
among the highest compared to peers. The planned
wage increase will lead to compression of growth-critical
capital expenditure and other priority spending. Also, it
will become challenging to maintain an adequate fiscal
buffer. Moreover, if revenue performance falls short of
expectations and/or GDP growth moderates more than
projected, the fiscal buffer will deplete rapidly. Large
public wage increases may also spillover to elevated
wage demands in the private sector, hurting
competitiveness.

In late 2014, the government pledged to raise the civil servants’ minimum monthly wage to US$250 by 2018
from about US$100 in 2013/14, matching the opposition’s campaign promises.

14

Government deposits, with a target of 5½ percent of GDP, serves as the fiscal anchor in Cambodia. The
minimum threshold of deposits to withstand financing shocks based on historical data is estimated at
2¾ percent of GDP (i.e., two standard deviations of domestic financing over 1995–2012) and deposits of
5½ percent of GDP would provide an additional fiscal space of 2¾ percent of GDP.

If higher revenues from RMS implementation are used to finance rising public wages, capital
spending will be squeezed. The Global Competitiveness Index shows that Cambodia has a large gap
in infrastructure compared to neighboring countries. Crowding out growth-enhancing public
investment, therefore, may lower growth potential. Thanks to the strong revenue performance in 2012–
14, government deposits have been rebuilt and are estimated to rise temporarily to 8 percent of GDP
in 2015. However, higher expenditure from promised wage hikes is expected to drag deposits down to
around 4⅓ percent of GDP in the medium term, below the level of a comfortable fiscal buffer of

dropping by around 1 ppt to 12.2 percent of GDP and fiscal deficits increasing to around 7 percent of

Wage policy formulation would benefit from a more systematic approach and should be
accompanied with efficiency-improving civil service reform. Wage increases should be based on
key indicators (e.g. availability of resources, cost of living, productivity, fiscal performance, and priority
objectives). Wage increases should also be part of a broader civil service reform to improve
productivity of the civil service, strengthen its capacity and accountability by rationalizing allocation
and size.

Policy recommendations. To maintain adequate fiscal buffers while meeting
development and infrastructure needs requires several policy actions:


Given the spending pressures from higher
wages, a sustainable and systematic
implementation of the RMS is key to
achieving the government target of raising
domestic revenues by on average ½ percent
of GDP annually. Furthermore, efforts should
also focus on advancing other key elements
of the RMS, including reviewing excises and
VAT thresholds, rationalizing tax incentives
and enhancing the institutional framework.



Given Cambodia’s high public wages compared to peers, future increases should be
formulated contingent on projected fiscal performance (including meeting revenue
targets and maintaining an adequate fiscal buffer) and be accompanied by deeper,
efficiency-enhancing civil-service reforms.



Social spending and capital expenditure,
particularly on infrastructure, should be
safeguarded to support diversification, boost
competitiveness, and increase inclusiveness.



Continued progress in monitoring the risks
from contingent liabilities via the PPP unit in
the MEF would be important. Also, fiscal risks
can be mitigated by adopting a ceiling on PPP
guarantees and listing all contingent liabilities
in the annual budget law to enhance fiscal transparency.

20.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment. They
remained strongly committed to implementing the RMS and also agreed on the need to
rationalize investment incentives and review other tax policies in the RMS in the medium term.
Wage pressures remained an important concern, and the authorities were aiming to achieve a
compression ratio of about three and limit the wage bill to less than 50 percent of current
spending.15 The authorities are continuing to work on improving monitoring contingent
liabilities. The debt management committee has recently revised the debt policy framework,
which now includes a ceiling on government guarantees at 4 percent of GDP and designates a
contingency fund account for contingent liabilities related to enterprises in the power sector.

15

The compression ratio is defined as the ratio between the salaries in the top and bottom scales in the
government payroll.

C. Promoting Competitiveness, Diversification, and Inclusion
21.
Diversification. Cambodia’s growth
performance has been impressive but has relied on a
narrow base, rendering growth volatile.16 While there are
emerging signs of diversification across sectors and
export destinations, the economy remains largely
undiversified.17 Cambodia has gained market share in
labor-intensive products, such as garments, from China.
Looking ahead, the ongoing transformation in China’s
trade patterns and regional factory relocation could offer
a unique opportunity to diversify Cambodia’s production
and export base.18 However, in order to take advantage of
these opportunities, structural bottlenecks need to be
addressed. Cambodia’s rank has stalled in both the World
Bank’s Doing Business Report (2015) and the World
Economic Forum (WEF)’s the Global Competitiveness
Report (2014–15), as a result of concerns regarding
governance, access to finance, institutional efficiency,
education and skills, and inadequate infrastructure.19, 20, 21

22.
Competitiveness. Recent wage developments
are weakening competitiveness. The comparative
advantage from the large supply of low-skill labor
allowed Cambodia to become one of the top recipients
of FDI and exporters of garments in the world.
However, recent trends suggest that average real wages
are growing faster than in other countries and are
outpacing gains in productivity. At the same time, the
REER has appreciated, though not as much as
competitor countries (Vietnam, Bangladesh, Lao PDR).

Cambodia’s growth volatility has been around 5.5 percent, higher than the average of Asian LICs (4.5 percent).

There is evidence of FDI flows into nontextile manufacturing firms (e.g., electronics, automobile parts) from
China, Korea, and Japan.

This deterioration in competitiveness is particularly challenging in a highly dollarized country.
Therefore, maintaining competitiveness through improving the business climate and ensuring
that wages do not outstrip productivity will be important.
23.
Poverty and social indicators. Progress on poverty alleviation and improving social
indicators has been encouraging. Strong gains in reducing poverty have been realized as the
poverty rate declined from 50 percent in 2004 to 18 percent in 2012. Cambodia achieved the
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving poverty in 2009. Also, consumption of the
bottom income quintile has increased sharply and ameliorated income inequality. While further
efforts to improve health and education remain important development priorities, improvements
in maternal health, early childcare and primary education programs in rural areas were
achieved.22 Financial inclusion has progressed, with the access to bank accounts rising rapidly,
though remaining below peers.23
24.
Policy recommendations. The priority should be lowering the overall cost of doing
business by reducing transportation, energy, and logistics costs, improving the legal and
regulatory environment, and upgrading public services.


With higher electricity supply expected to materialize in future, the priority is to lower its
price, improve supply, and boost rural access.



Following major improvements in highways, secondary roads are needed for better
market access and integration with regional supply chains.



Improve the quality of education, building on impressive gains in access to elementary
education. Vocational and industry-led training programs can address immediate skill
gaps most efficiently.



Streamlined government procedures and improved
governance in doing business. More transparent and
predictable customs procedures can expedite crossborder flows of goods and integration with regional
supply chain network. In addition, strengthening the
anti-corruption framework would help address
governance concerns and ease constraints on doing
business.

According to the World Bank’s Global Findex database, the percentage of people having accounts increased
from 3.7 percent in 2011 to 22.2 percent in 2014, and among the lower income segment (bottom 40 percent) the
percentage of people having accounts increased from 0.8 percent to 17.9 percent over the same time period.



Further gains in ameliorating inequality require improved public service delivery
(especially in health and education), reducing skill gaps, and fostering a dynamic
agricultural sector.

25.
Authorities’ views. The authorities emphasized their efforts to improve the business
environment. They also showed concern with the recent deterioration in external
competitiveness, and have prepared an Industrial Development Policy 2015–25 to provide a
roadmap to boost investment and broaden the country’s economic base.24 The focus is in line
with staff recommendations (i.e., reducing electricity costs, simplified registration and accounting
standards for SMEs, etc.).

STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Economic setting. Growth remains strong and is projected to remain steady in 2015 and
to rise modestly over the medium term. Inflation is projected to rise gradually over 2015,
reflecting the recovery in food prices and stabilization of global energy prices. Rapid credit
growth accelerated, reflecting both supply and demand factors. The external position is stable
and the real effective exchange rate is assessed to be broadly in line with fundamentals.
27.
Risks. The outlook is subject to substantial downside risks. External risks stem from a
stronger U.S. dollar and/or a protracted growth slowdown in Europe constraining garments
export and tourism growth. Weaker-than-expected growth in China would also have spillovers
through the FDI, banking and tourism channels. Domestic risks include materialization of
financial sector vulnerabilities from rapid credit growth, fiscal pressures and erosion of
competitiveness from wage increases.
28.
Monetary policy and prudential regulations need to be tightened further in order to
contain financial sector vulnerabilities. Rapid credit growth, increasing bank flows from abroad,
and greater exposure to the real estate and construction sectors pose macro-financial risks.
Reserve requirements should be raised to moderate the pace of credit growth. Prudential
regulations on large deposit-taking micro-finance institutions (MFIs) should be upgraded/
tightened to match those of banks to prevent regulatory arbitrage. Moreover, reserve
requirements should also be expanded to include foreign funding of MFIs.
29.
Macro financial policies. Given the increase in financial sector risks, well-designed
macroprudential tools should be introduced. Fragility from high loan-to-deposit (LTD) ratios
needs to be managed by a phased introduction (and tightening) of LTD limits. Imposing
countercyclical capital requirements would help enhance resilience and build buffers. Given the
growing exposure to real estate, higher capital requirements and risk weights linked to real

The IDP has three goals: i) to increase the share of the industrial sector in GDP by 10 percentage points to
30 percent by 2025; ii) increase exports of non-garment exports (especially agricultural products) to 15 percent of
GDP by 2025; iii) encourage formal registration of 80 percent of SMEs. The discussion focused on how to
improve business climate (which specific actions broadly in line with staff’s recommendations).

estate, as well as sectoral concentration limits are possible policy measures. Better monitoring of
developments in the real estate sector is warranted, including by enhancing data collection.
30.
Supervision and market development. Given that supervisory capacity is stretched, a
moratorium on new bank licenses should be imposed. Strengthening the crisis management
framework is critical to manage systemic risk and should be expedited. Also, to contain rising
financial stability risks, the implementation of FSAP recommendations should be expedited.
Going forward, developing money and foreign exchange markets is needed to promote dedollarization and to implement an effective monetary framework, including exchange rate
flexibility to help absorb external shocks.
31.
Fiscal policy. While strong revenue growth has temporarily eased fiscal pressures, fiscal
consolidation is necessary to maintain adequate government deposits in view of spending
pressures from a higher wage bill. Steadfast implementation of the RMS is needed to sustain
revenues. Wage increases should be formulated contingent on projected fiscal performance and
be accompanied by deeper, efficiency enhancing civil-service reforms. Better managing
contingent liabilities is critical to safeguard fiscal space. Continuing to reform public financial
management will help to ensure spending effectiveness.
32.
Diversification and inclusiveness. Greater investment in education and a reduction in
the overall cost of doing business will enhance competitiveness, economic diversification, and
promote inclusiveness. Upgrading infrastructure, in particular ensuring cheaper and more reliable
electricity supply, also remains a key priority. Efforts to enhance the business climate should
include removing regulatory impediments to expedite integration with regional supply chains.
33.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
As part of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), the IMF Executive Board on January 5, 2006,
approved relief on 100 percent of debt incurred by Cambodia to the IMF before January 1, 2005. This
resulted in the forgiving of all of Cambodia’s outstanding debt to the IMF, a total of SDR 56.8 million
(about US$82 million). The authorities intend to spend the resources over a number of years, initially on

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMBODIA

rural irrigation projects. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) transferred the full MDRI proceeds to the
Ministry of Economy and Finance effective March 2006.
Safeguards Assessment
A voluntary safeguards assessment of the NBC was completed in January 2010 at the request of the
authorities, which updated the previous March 2004 voluntary assessment. The update assessment
found that the NBC had taken steps to strengthen aspects of its safeguards framework; however,
important recommendations proposed in 2004 were still outstanding, and some new risks had emerged
in the area of external audit.
Exchange Rate Arrangement and Payments System
Cambodia’s exchange regime is classified as stabilized. The de jure regime is a managed float. The
official exchange rate, which is expressed in riels per U.S. dollar, applies to all official external
transactions conducted by the central government and state enterprises, and is used for accounting
purposes by the NBC. It is determined by the foreign exchange market, with the official rate adjusted to
be within 1 percent of the market rate on a daily basis.
Cambodia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on January 1, 2002. Cambodia
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation
Cambodia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation
discussions were held in Phnom Penh during November 4–15, 2013. The Executive Board approved
the staff report (IMF Country Report 14/33) on January 27, 2014.
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
The joint IMF-World Bank FSAP mission took place in March 2010 and the assessment was
completed in October 2010.
Technical Assistance
Technical assistance is currently focused on bank supervision, monetary operations, public financial
management, tax and customs administration, macro-fiscal and revenue forecasting, financial sector
supervision, and macro-financial statistics. Delivery is through a resident advisor at the NBC,
peripatetic experts, and short-term visits from headquarters.
Resident Representative
The IMF Resident Representative in Phnom Penh (Ms. Yong Sarah Zhou) was appointed in July 2015.
Mr. Faisal Ahmed, former Resident Representative, assumed the post for the Cambodian IMF office
from July 2011 to July 2015.

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
(July 2015)
The Bank and the IMF country teams for Cambodia, led by Mr. Mathew Verghis (Practice
Manager GMFDR) and Ms. Jain-Chandra (IMF Mission Chief for Cambodia), maintain a close
working relationship and have an active dialogue on a range of macroeconomic and structural issues.
Recent key areas of cooperation and coordination include:
 Macroeconomic policy advice to the authorities. The IMF and the World Bank staffs have
consulted each other on key macroeconomic policy messages to the authorities to avoid sending
conflicting messages. Bank staff share and discuss the review of macroeconomic developments
and country pages. IMF staff share policy notes and analytical background notes related to
Article IV consultation missions.
 Financial sector reform and FSAP. The World Bank and the IMF teams have worked closely
together while undertaking the 2010 FSAP. In line with the FSAP recommendations, technical
assistance missions are now ongoing and close coordination between the IMF and the World Bank
continues.
 Public financial management and tax and customs administration reform. Both institutions
are working closely together under the Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP)
including 2014-18 revenue mobilization strategy as well as tax and customs administration reform.
Both teams are members of the Development Partner Committee (DPC) of the PFMRP, a
coordination mechanism for all Development Partners’ support for the PFMRP under a Sector
Wide Approach, and share information as much as possible on the work done in this area. The
partial launch of the FMIS on July 20, 2015 marks a major milestone towards the full
implementation of a comprehensive transaction processing, improved financial control, and more
transparent and timely financial report generation facility.
 Trade Facilitation and private sector development. Both institutions are providing technical
supports to GDCE/MEF on customs and border reform, regulatory reform, and streamlined import
and export procedures. Under WBG Trade Related-Assistance in Cambodia program (TRAC)
contributed to better logistics, non-tariff measure (NTM), trade repository, investment incentive
policy, and making it easier for exporters to integrate into regional production networks. Under
the WBG Trade Facilitation Facility (TFF) supported the GDCE/MEF to develop Cambodia National
Single Window (CNSW) blueprint. Trade Development Support Program (TDSP) continues to
support the expansion of ASYCUDA to 51 customs checkpoints in different geography, MAFF on
SPS automation system, and MOC on certification of country origin automation, trade-marks
registration system, and business registration automation system. Cambodia gained ranking
46 places in the Logistics Performance Indicators (LPI) between 2010–14 and abolished
unnecessary certificates of origin (CO) required by the importing countries.
 Article IV consultations. IMF Article IV consultations regularly share their macroeconomic data
with the World Bank and hold working sessions to try and reconcile macroeconomic data sets. The

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMBODIA

collaboration is closest on the debt sustainability analysis, a joint product, but extends more
broadly into other areas of the consultation as well. World Bank staff are also invited to and do
participate in some of the key meetings. The IMF also participated in some of the WB capacity
building TA missions on contingent liabilities. Both institutions are considering using the TA
mission findings to further strengthen the DSA analysis.
 Structural reforms. The IMF staff and the World Bank teams have worked together to share views
on a range of other issues, including structural reforms for improving investment climate,
economic diversification, customs modernization, and rural development.
Based on the above partnership, the World Bank and the IMF share a common view about
Cambodia’s macroeconomic and structural reform priorities. These include:
 Sustaining growth. Growth remains robust although there are signs of deceleration. While
decelerating, the garment sector together with construction, and services, in particular finance and
real estate, continues to propel growth. Overall macroeconomic management remains appropriate
but there are signs of weaknesses in the areas of productivity and competitiveness. Fiscal
consolidation continues with further improvements in revenue collection resulting from enhanced
administration. Sustaining growth would require continued fiscal consolidation and prudent
management of the banking sector risks. Improving the business climate, reducing infrastructure,
energy, and skills bottlenecks, promoting private sector development and economic
diversification, improving governance and the delivery of public services and supporting rural
development continue to be essential to promote self-sustaining and inclusive growth.
 Managing public finances and debt. Fiscal policy remains the main instrument for
macroeconomic management given high dollarization. Prudent fiscal management is, therefore,
critical and needs to be underpinned by improved revenue collection, prioritized spending, and
better monitoring of contingent liabilities, including through the budgetary and public debt
management framework and further progress in budgetary transparency.
 Safeguarding financial system stability and improving the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Implementing the key recommendations of the 2010 FSAP remains critical to safeguarding
financial stability. These include implementing a moratorium on new bank licenses, strengthening
coordinated supervision, developing the foreign exchange market, and improving the supervisory
capacity. Financial stability risks from the buoyant real estate markets need to be managed
through strengthened supervision and improved data collection. Developing an interbank market
remains a necessary step for a transition to more effective and market based monetary policy
operations.
 Improving governance. Both the World Bank and IMF have stressed the critical role of
governance in improving the quality of service delivery and fostering private sector development,
which is the engine of growth.
The teams are committed to continue the close cooperation going forward. The table below
details the specific activities planned by the two country teams over the next 12-month period along
with their expected deliveries.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(July 2015)
As of December 31, 2014, Cambodia has received $2.11 billion in Asian Development Bank (AsDB)
lending, grants, and technical assistance including 77 loan projects and programs of
$1,798.26 million with low interest, and 21 Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants of $255.71 million.
Cumulative disbursements to Cambodia as of 17 April 2015 for active sovereign lending and grants
are $476.80 million.
The sector composition of active lending, grants, and technical assistance as of 17 April 2015 is:
(i) agriculture, natural resources and rural development, $359.81 million; (ii) education
$106.77 million; (iii) energy, $76.58 million; (iv) finance, $15.44 million; (v) health, $10.00 million;
(vi) industry and trade, $11.95 million; (vii) public sector management (PSM), $28.14 million;
(viii) transport, $407.25 million; and (ix) water and other urban infrastructure and services,
$97.70 million.
The AsDB Cambodia Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), 2014–2018, endorsed by the Board on
November 28, 2014, aligns with Cambodia’s strategic planning cycle and the priorities reflected in
the Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency, Phase III (RSIII) and the
National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP, 2014–2018). Consistent with the government’s
economic reform priorities, the impact of the CPS will be reduction in poverty and vulnerability. The
CPS embeds the three strategic agendas of the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 into all AsDB
operations: (i) inclusive economic growth; (ii) environmentally sustainable growth; and (iii) regional
cooperation and integration (RCI).
The 2014–18 CPS builds on two strategic pillars for AsDB’s activities in Cambodia: (i) rural-urbanregional links, and (ii) human and social development, and one facilitating pillar: PSM. Expanding
rural-urban-regional connectivity is an integrated approach to developing those areas where most
poor people live and focuses on transport and economic corridor development to link national value
chains with the region and the world. This pillar develops rural-urban-regional infrastructure
(including irrigation and water management, rural electrification, rural roads, rural water supply,
urban infrastructure, road maintenance, and trade facilitation) and supports the commercialization
of farms and competitiveness of agribusiness through improved connectivity. The second pillar,
targeted human and social development, supports access to, and the quality of, secondary
education, and targeted skills development through technical and vocational education and training
linked to evolving demands of the labor market. PSM covers decentralization and deconcentration
and public financial management reforms and acts as facilitating pillar to improve country and
sector governance and mitigate project-level fiduciary risks.
AsDB has been a leading development partner of the finance sector in Cambodia since 1999. A
comprehensive approach was required to rebuild the financial system in a devastated economy that
had no finance sector. The Third Financial Sector Program (TFSP) has been operating since 2011 and
supported implementation of recommendations of the 2010 Financial Sector Assessment Program

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

CAMBODIA

(FSAP) and initial stages of the government’s updated Financial Sector Development Strategy, 2011–
2020. After successfully rebuilding the basic foundation of the banking industry under the First and
Second Financial Sector Programs, the TFSP supports the sector’s expansion to cover the important
subsectors of nonbanking services and capital markets, and to boost investor’s and beneficiaries’
confidence in the system with a stronger legal and regulatory framework, necessary infrastructure,
and better quality of services, including consumer protection. Beyond this, AsDB will support
improved access to formal sources of finance, especially in rural areas, both through related AsDB
initiatives, such as those to support growth of commercial farms and rural enterprises, and through
private sector operations, which will focus on finance sector development, including private equity,
transport, agribusiness, water supply and sanitation, and trade and supply chain finance for SMEs.
AsDB has provided policy and advisory technical assistance for public private partnerships (PPPs) in
Cambodia. AsDB has assisted the government to review existing policies, laws, regulations, and
institutional arrangements; develop a strategic framework for PPPs; and proposed changes to the
law on concessions in order to make the PPP process effective. A capacity development technical
assistance project for PPPs is currently implemented to help build the institutional capacity of
government’s agencies involved in PPPs.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(September 2015)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. Extensive technical assistance (TA) has been
provided by the IMF, United Nations Development Programme, Asian Development Bank (AsDB), and World
Bank, as well as by bilateral partners, leading to substantial capacity improvements. Currently, Cambodia is
participating in Statistics Department’s (STA's) project on the Implementation of the System of National
Accounts and International Comparison Program, funded by the government of Japan. This project will provide
TA to build statistical capacity and improve both national accounts and price statistics. Despite the progress
made in improving data statistics, several shortcomings in macroeconomic data still hamper timely and
comprehensive analysis.
National accounts. Despite improvements in recent years, weaknesses remain in the quality and timeliness of
national accounts data. The quality of GDP estimates remains hampered by the lack of comprehensive and
reliable source data on a production and expenditure basis, in part due to resource constraints and weak data
collection techniques. In November 2011, a TA mission assessed current methodologies used to compile
national accounts estimates and provided support with the development of the quarterly national accounts
estimates. In 2014 February, another TA mission was conducted mainly to assist the National Institute of
Statistics (NIS) processing the results of Cambodia’s first ever 2011 Economic Census of Cambodia (EC2011) for
improving GDP estimates. The purpose of the EC2011 was not particularly focused on national accounts, hence
TA concluded further improvements are needed to convert EC 2011 data into national accounts data following
the System of National Accounts (SNA) concepts and definitions. The TA mission also assessed the
implementation of the previous mission recommendations and found that progress has stalled partly due to
resource constraints. Statistics Sweden has been assisting the NIS for improving the national accounts
compilation.
Price statistics. The compilation of the consumer price index (CPI) suffers from insufficient coverage. An
updated CPI series was introduced starting in April 2012. Geographic coverage of the series has been expanded
to include Phnom Penh plus five provinces. A STA TA mission visited Phnom Penh in April 2012 to assist with
updating/improving the CPI. The authorities indicated a need for assistance with developing a producer price
index (PPI), but no funds have been allocated to support the compilation of an ongoing PPI.
Government finance statistics (GFS). The Ministry of Finance and Economy began implementing reforms to
the government accounting system and budgetary nomenclature in 2007, based on the Government Finance
Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001, with the assistance of the IMF. In addition, several STA missions have assisted
with GFS compilation procedures within the GSFM 2001 framework. In 2011, Cambodia agreed to participate in
the GFS project funded by the Government of Japan. As a result, authorities have benefited from three TA
missions in 2012, 2013, and October 2014 to assist them in the compilation and implementation of GFS. The
objectives of latest TA were (i) finalizing the Charts of Accounts (CoA) mapping into GFS, which will allow
integration into the new Financial Management Information System (FMIS) and use of the FMIS to produce GFS
tables; and (ii) addressing questions related to the compilation of below-the-line data based on the GFSM 2001

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMBODIA

and its update, the GFSM 2014. The new CoA is implemented starting January 2015. Despite improvements,
further actions are needed in areas such as integrating the coverage of GFS to broader public sectors and local
governments, develop and implement the functional classification of expenditure, reconciling data with
monetary and financial statistics and external sector statistics data.
Monetary and financial statistics. The NBC compiles the balance sheet and survey for the central bank and
other depository institutions in accordance with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. Since
August 2005, the NBC has reported monthly monetary and financial statistics to STA using the Standardized
Report Forms. The NBC received TA during the FSAP on the compilation of financial soundness indicators (FSIs).
The NBC now compiles monthly core FSIs and shares them with IMF staff irregularly. Some data inconsistencies
continue to pose a challenge to the interpretation of FSIs. STA’s TA mission focused on the methodology of
compilation of FSIs is scheduled in September 2015.
External sector statistics. Cambodia is part of the Asian module of the Project on the Improvement of External
Sector Statistics (ESS) in the Asia Pacific Region, (funded by the government of Japan launched in October
2012), which aims to improve the accuracy, availability, comparability and timeliness of ESS in the region. The
project consists mainly of short-term TA missions in three years. Third TA mission in September 2014 reviewed
progress in the implementation of the action plan agreed during first TA mission in April 2013 and second TA
mission in November 2013. Additionally, mission focused on improving direct investment statistics and
strengthening interagency cooperation in data sharing for balance of payments purposes. The NBC has made
progress in improving the compilation system following the 2013 TA missions. The most significant
accomplishments include: (i) conducting a series of training sessions with commercial banks to enhance their
understanding of the international transactions reporting system (ITRS); (ii) initiating the work for establishing
the business register in cooperation with other government institutions; and (iii) preparing the draft direct
investment survey questionnaire. However, further actions are needed in the following areas: (i) improving
inter-institutional cooperation among government institutions; and (ii) improving coverage and address
methodological inconsistencies. Foreign direct investment, which is believed to be large, relies excessively on
approvals, and gaps exist with respect to large build-operate-transfer projects in the energy sector. It is
welcomed that the NBC is launching survey on foreign direct investment. The NBC receives monthly data from
the General Department of Customs and Excise (GDCE) broken down into main commodities, which it uses to
generate quarterly BOP figures as well as for internal analysis purposes. The quarterly trade figures, which are
much more robust because they include updated monthly figures, needs to be provided to the NBC in timelier
and more systemically manner. A significant improvement of Cambodia’s external sector statistics can be
achieved if compilers strive to enhance and increase the use of the existing ITRS, which can serve as a costefficient and comprehensive data source to capture BOP transactions. Gaps also exist in public external debt
and official transfers (e.g. grants), and no data are available for private external debts.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

October 1, 2015

Approved By
Markus Rodlauer and Masato Miyazaki (IMF)
Satu Kahkonen (WB )

International Development Association

This Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) shows that Cambodia’s debt distress rating remains low
with all debt burden indicators projected to remain below the respective thresholds. In line with last
year’s DSA, the results also indicate that debt sustainability continues to be vulnerable to growth,
exports, fiscal shocks, and the materialization of contingent liabilities, calling for continued
structural reforms to increase the economy’s resilience against external shocks, and to mobilize
fiscal revenues.
1.
This DSA continues to assess the risk of debt distress as low. The indicative debt
distress thresholds remain unchanged from the 2013 Article IV DSA. Under the baseline scenario,
the external and the public debt distress indicators never breach the policy-dependent indicative
thresholds, and the PV of external debt follows a downward trend in the medium term. Downside
risks to the baseline scenario include external arrears, and the materialization of contingent
liabilities. The macroeconomic assumptions underlying the baseline scenario remain broadly
similar to last year’s DSA, with Cambodia assumed to issue domestic debt (e.g., government
bonds) over the long term. The debt-to-GDP ratio at end-2014 was slightly higher than the
previous estimate due to larger disbursement of bilateral debts, especially from China.1
Cambodia’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating remained unchanged at
“medium performer.”

has been driven largely by
disbursement of bilateral loans. The corresponding net present value (PV) of the external debt is
23.3 percent of GDP at end 2014, a significant increase from 19.0 percent of GDP at end-2012,
primarily because the amortization schedule of existing debt assumes larger principal
repayments in more recent years compared to the last DSA.
3.
With greater disbursement of bilateral debt over the past five years, the share of
multilateral creditor debt has continued to decline. The share of bilateral debt, including
arrears, in total external public debt has increased from 50 percent in 2009 to 69 percent in 2014.
China remains the largest bilateral creditor, contributing to 62 percent of the total bilateral debt
stock and about 90 percent of bilateral debt disbursement during the past three years. Cambodia
remains in arrears to the Russian Federation and the U.S. (nearly 15 percent of total debt or
5 percent of GDP), and the status of negotiations of these arrears has remained unchanged since
the last DSA. Cambodia is not servicing its debt with these two creditors. The Cambodian
authorities have been in contact with the Russian and U.S. authorities at least on an annual basis,
but further efforts are needed to conclude agreements under the Paris Club framework. Since
prospects for resolution remain unclear, this DSA continues to assume no debt restructuring,
with arrears continuing to build up over the projection period.
4.
The negligible level of domestic debt remains unchanged. Cambodia has virtually no
domestic public debt at present. There is a small amount of bonds (US$4 million) issued in the
early 2000s and some old claims on the government (the total equal to half percent of GDP, with
no interest) that were carried over from the 1990s and remain to be recorded in the monetary
survey.
5.
While the authorities have made progress on the monitoring of contingent
liabilities and debt management, the fiscal risks from contingent liabilities need
continuous monitoring. The development of the debt management strategy and its submission
to the parliament in conjunction with the budget and the establishment of the public private
partnership (PPP) unit in the MEF to monitor future PPP approvals are welcome. Progress in
measuring already assumed contingent liabilities is underway and receives technical assistance
from the World Bank. Further strengthening the capacity of the MEF to deal with PPPs contracts,
particularly on legal issues, would be recommended. Other recommendations include the
adoption of an annual ceiling on PPP guarantees and the listing of all contingent liabilities in the

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMBODIA

annual budget law to enhance fiscal transparency. Although debt remains sustainable with a low
risk of distress, closer monitoring of fiscal risks from contingent liabilities and further
strengthening of capacity to analyze these risks is needed to safeguard the fiscal space.

Macroeconomic Framework
6. The macroeconomic framework underlying the baseline scenario remains broadly in line
with the previous DSA.


Growth and inflation: Economic activity remains strong driven by robust exports, real
estate, and construction. GDP growth is expected at 7.0 percent in 2015 and is projected to
gradually increase to 7.3 percent by 2018 assuming continued improvements in business
climate, physical infrastructure, and human capital. Over the long term, growth is projected
to moderate to 7 percent. Inflation dropped to 1.1 percent in 2014 led by lower energy and
commodity prices. In the medium term, it is expected to average 3 percent, in line with the
authorities’ informal target and partner countries’ medium-term inflation.



External stability: Despite lower garment export and tourism receipts, the current account
deficit, including official transfers, is expected to stay flat at around 12 percent of GDP in
2014, partially due to the moderation in imports related to near completion of large power
projects and lower garment materials imports, and to remain fully financed by FDI and official
loans. For the medium-term, the current account deficit is projected to decline to 7 percent
of GDP, as a result of further moderation in imports after the completion of large power
generation projects and improved competitiveness and diversification spurred by the
participation in the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), which should support robust export
growth. Gross official reserves are projected to remain at around 4 months of prospective
imports through 2020. External debt disbursement is projected to average about
US$550 million annually during 2015‒20 (about 2½ percent of GDP on average), and with
this, the debt to GDP ratio is projected to gradually decline to 30 percent by 2020.



Fiscal sustainability: Buoyant revenue collection efforts have improved revenue
performance significantly in 2014 and stringent procurement measures have slowed the
execution of non-wage current expenditure and locally financed capital expenditure, more
than offsetting the continuous increase in the wage expenditure. As a result, the 2014 fiscal
deficit narrowed to 1.3 percent of GDP (GFS 2001), compared to 3.1 percent implied by the
budget, and government deposits are expected to increase temporarily to 7.1 percent of
GDP, before declining to around 4 percent of GDP in the medium term. Effective
implementation of the list of tax administration measures contained in the Revenue
Mobilization Strategy (RMS) should continue to generate revenue gains, raising domestic
revenue by ½ percent of GDP on average over the medium term, in line with the authorities’
goal under the Public Financial Management Reform Program. Budget pressure in recent
years eased due to strong revenue collection, but large wage increases have limited space to
enhance growth critical social and infrastructure spending. In this context, it is important to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMBODIA

ensure that the domestic revenue expansion is used most efficiently and effectively. Mediumterm fiscal consolidation is therefore anchored to safeguarding government deposits and
ensuring long-term fiscal debt sustainability, while striking a careful balance to provide
resources for Cambodia’s vast development needs against rising wage pressures and an
expected gradual decline of concessional external funds. In view of this, domestically funded
capital spending is projected to increase from 1.8 percent GDP in 2014 to 3.4 percent in 2020
to cushion the decline in externally funded capital spending, thereby ensuring that the
overall capital spending is maintained at around 8 percent of GDP. With continued efforts to
increase efficiency of public investment program and by containing the nonwage current
spending in terms of GDP, the fiscal deficit, excluding grants, is projected to decline from
about 6 percent of GDP in 2013 to 4.6 percent in 2020. Compared to the 2013 DSA, loans
from the non-Paris Club official bilateral donors are assumed to be on less concessional
terms. This difference in the loan terms increases external debt by 3 percent of GDP by 2033.


Domestic debt: As Cambodia’s financial sector continues to develop, it is expected that the
government will start issuing domestic government bonds to provide additional fiscal
financing. By issuing debt starting from ¼ ppt of GDP annually in 2021 and gradually
increasing to about ½ ppt of GDP in 2035, the total stock of domestic debt would reach
about 3.7 percent of GDP by 2035. This remains low compared to the average domestic debt
in low-income countries (LICs) of about 15 percent of GDP. However, this conservative
estimate is in line with the authorities’ intention of not issuing domestic debt over the
medium term and to focus more on mobilizing domestic revenue and raising government
deposits (i.e., savings, not borrowings).

EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
7.
Under the baseline scenario, the external DSA shows that Cambodia’s risk of debt
distress is low (Figure 1, Tables 1a and 1b). The PV of debt-to-GDP, debt-to-exports, and debtto-revenue ratios never breach their respective policy-dependent indicative thresholds and are
projected to decline over the projection period. Moreover, the debt service-to-exports and debt
service-to-revenue ratios remain well below the thresholds throughout the projection period,
partly due to the concessional nature of the debt.
8.
Even though standard debt stress tests do not indicate any major vulnerability, they
highlight that large exchange rate or export shocks could potentially have a major impact
on the debt dynamics. Change in export value growth remains the most important risk to
sustainability. As shown in Figure 1, this shock would bring the PV of debt-to-GDP to 36 percent,
just 4 percent under the indicative threshold. Similarly, a large one-off depreciation would bring
the PV of debt-to-GDP to about 35 percent. While this highlights the importance of continuous
monitoring of debt dynamics, the PV of external debt declines over the projection period and
does not currently indicate any major vulnerability.
9.
Given the minor role played by domestic debt, the public sector DSA closely tracks
the external debt sustainability (Figure 2 and Tables 2a and 2b). In particular, the PV of public

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMBODIA

debt-to-GDP and the public debt service-to-revenue ratios would decline gradually over time,
and the debt service-to-revenue ratio would remain low in most scenarios for the entire
projection period. It is assumed that, with the development of the domestic bond market, the
domestic financing sources will increase after 2020 and the domestic debt will reach about
3.7 percent of GDP over the long run.
10.
Public debt is vulnerable to a large exchange rate depreciation shock and to a loose
fiscal policy. Under a one-off real depreciation shock, the PV of public debt-to-GDP would reach
35 percent in the short-run, and then would decline over time. If the primary balance remains
unchanged at the 2014 level, the PV of public debt-to-GDP would increase to about 27 percent in
the medium term. However, public debt is projected to decline over the projection period under
all scenarios and do not present any major vulnerability.
11.
Potential contingent liabilities might threaten debt sustainability if they
materialize. The investment in power generation and distribution projects under PPPs is large,
and if for any reason problems arose potentially leading to a total loss of investment costs,
substantial liabilities could be added to the debt stock. The World Bank has provided technical
assistance to determine the size of contingent liabilities. Other potential contingent liabilities
include the fiscal cost to support the financial sector during a banking crisis. Staff calculations
suggest that support in the form of bank recapitalization and backstopping demand deposits
would amount to around 15 percent of GDP.21
12.
The authorities broadly agreed with the overall results of the DSA. The debt
management unit at the Ministry of Economy and Finance conducts annual DSA analysis as part of
their budget process. They use results of these analyses to propose annual ceilings of new net
disbursements, which so far have been only external disbursements. The authorities use for their
exercise the same terms for new loans, current account deficits, projected loans disbursement, but
are more conservative than staff on the medium-term real GDP growth assumption. More generally,
they reach the same conclusion of low risk of debt distress. The MEF showed concerned about the
accumulation of contingent liabilities from PPPs and have imposed annual ceilings on PPP
guarantees.

CONCLUSION
13.
Cambodia remains at low risk of debt distress under the baseline scenario. The
baseline projections and the standard stress tests show limited risk to external debt given that
none of the indicators breach their thresholds. Downside risks to the baseline scenario include
the materialization of contingent liabilities and issues arising from the external arrears. The
most extreme stress tests indicate that Cambodia’s debt sustainability remains vulnerable to
shocks to the exchange rate, growth, exports, and fiscal position. This suggests the importance of
preserving macroeconomic stability and diversifying the economy and exports to increase the
economy’s resilience to external shocks, and the necessity of the successful implementation of
the revenue mobilization strategy.
The median direct fiscal cost of banking crisis in emerging market countries is estimated at
11.5 percent of GDP (Laeven and Valencia (2010), IMF Working Paper 10/146).

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate ch
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Cambodia authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Table 2b. Cambodia: Sensitivity Analysis for Key Indicators of Public Debt 2015-2035

Statement by Mr. Marzunisham Omar, Executive Director;
Ms. Pornvipa Tangcharoenmonkong, Alternate Executive Director; and
Mr. Suasdey Chea, Advisor to the Executive Director on Cambodia
1.
On behalf of the Cambodian authorities, we would like to express our gratitude to the
IMF mission team for the constructive discussions and exchange of views on macroeconomic
developments and policy recommendations for the Cambodian economy. In particular, the
authorities appreciate the discussions on the need for reinforcing fiscal buffers, strengthening
monetary policy instruments and the transmission mechanism, as well as enhancing supervisory
practices, which would all contribute towards a more sustainable economic growth for
Cambodia. The authorities are in broad agreement with staff’s assessment and would take staff’s
policy recommendations into consideration when formulating future policies.
Recent Economic Development and Outlook
2.
Cambodia has achieved a remarkable average annual growth rate of 7.7 percent in the last
two decades. The 2014 World Bank Economic Update acknowledged that “Cambodia has joined
the Olympians of growth” and is the sixth fastest growing economy in the world. Cambodia is
also one of the largest recipients of foreign direct investment (FDI) and a top exporter of textiles.
This strong growth has been accompanied by a significant decline in poverty from around
53 percent in 2004 to 18 percent of population in 2013. Cambodia is also one of a few countries
that have outperformed the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) on poverty
reduction and other social indicators before its 2015 deadline. The authorities are determined to
transform Cambodia from a low income country to a low-middle income country by 2016 and a
middle income country by 2030.
3.
In recent years, Cambodia’s economic growth has been one of the fastest among Asia’s
developing economies. After recording an annual average growth rate of 7.2 percent over the last
five years, the growth momentum is expected to remain strong at 7 percent and 7.3 percent in
2015 and 2016, respectively. This solid growth will continue to be underpinned by strong exports
and tourism, as well as robust real estate and construction activities. Strong FDI flows are also
expected to be sustained. The return of domestic political stability after a year-long political
deadlock and the easing of labor tensions following the 2014 minimum wage increase are also
expected to support growth.
4.
Headline inflation is low and has decelerated by nearly half of what it was in 2014, from
3.9 percent to 2.6 percent in 2015, due mainly to the sharp decline of global oil prices and
appreciation of the real effective exchange rate (REER). Over the medium-term, headline
inflation is projected to average around 3 percent.
5.
On the external front, the current account deficit is expected to gradually narrow, falling
to 10 percent of GDP in 2015 from 12 percent of GDP in 2014, mainly due to the decline in oil
prices. Despite the US dollar appreciation, the REER has remained relatively stable and as
assessed by staff, is in line with fundamentals. Gross official reserves remain ample at to
US$4.7 billion at end-August 2015, covering four months of prospective imports. Although this

level of reserves is considered sufficient, the authorities agree on the merits of building more
reserves buffer. The authorities also share a similar assessment on the impact of recent oil price
developments on the current account and the slowdown in garment exports. However, over the
medium-term, the authorities are optimistic on sustained FDI flows and are committed to
prioritizing public investment, diversifying the economy through structural reform, enhancing
the business environment and competitiveness, and fostering a more inclusive growth.
6.
The authorities share the staff’s view that the outlook is broadly positive but subject to
downside risks, particularly on the external front. The slow recovery in Europe and the
appreciation of the US dollar have contributed to a moderate growth in the tourism sector and
stronger competition in garment exports, while the weaker-than-expected growth in China has
created spillovers through FDI, banking and tourism channels. These developments warrant
further reforms to ensure economic diversification and macro-financial stability.
Monetary Policy
7.
The stable exchange rate against the US dollar continues to serve as an important nominal
anchor, keeping inflation low and stable. Nevertheless, the authorities are fully committed to
developing the interbank and money markets as well as foreign exchange markets to promote the
use of the local currency (Khmer Riel) and allow for a more effective and flexible monetary
framework. In managing dollarization, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) and the
authorities have recently developed policies and action plans to support market-based monetary
policy, promote the greater use of the local currency, and reduce dollarization in the long term.
8.
The authorities have tightened monetary policy by increasing the reserve requirements
(RR) by 50 basis points to 12.5 percent in 2012. In 2013, in line with the Fund’s past
recommendations, the NBC issued negotiable certificate of deposits (NCDs), both in US dollar
and Khmer Riel (KHR), to help develop the interbank market. This has also helped to facilitate
banks’ liquidity management and market-based monetary policy operations. In addition, the
expansion of reserve requirements to cover banks’ foreign borrowing was instituted in March
2015, in line with the Fund’s recommendation.
Financial Stability
9.
The authorities concurred that Cambodia has experienced an increase in financial
deepening, with credit growing more rapidly than in peer Asian economies during their take-off
period. Credit growth remains in line with Cambodia’s level of development and the required
diversification of the economic base. Moreover, despite the strong credit growth, it is important
to note that the core financial soundness indicators are healthy and credit quality remains sound.
Credit has also been to a large extent directed to productive sectors to support the country’s
development and facilitate economic growth. Nevertheless, the authorities recognize that this
rapid credit growth and the growing exposure to real estate and construction sectors represent a
potential pocket of vulnerability to financial stability. Mindful of these risks, the authorities have
introduced several measures to reign in credit growth, including increasing in the reserve
requirements. Going forward, the authorities will continue to closely monitor the developments
on this front and remain committed to implement prudent policies to stabilize credit growth and

maintain a strong financial system. The authorities are, however, mindful of the impact of these
measures on growth.
10.
The supervision framework has been strengthened and data collection has improved in
recent years, with technical assistance from the Fund. The authorities are aware that Microfinance institutions (MFIs) are becoming more systemic and have stepped-up efforts to enhance
the supervision framework for MFIs and stand ready to implement prudential measures if
necessary. In strengthening the supervision and regulation of MFIs, the NBC remains committed
to a risk-based approach that is consistent with the FSAP recommendations. The recent revision
of the liquidity ratio requirements also remain in line with the recent Fund technical assistance
advice and previous Article IV recommendations. In strengthening collaboration and crisis
management frameworks, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on establishing information
sharing was signed between the Ministry of Finance, the NBC and Securities Exchange
Commission of Cambodia (SECC) in 2014. The NBC continues to provide internal and external
training for its staff in order to enhance capacity and quality of bank supervision. However,
given its limited capacity, the NBC welcomes further technical assistance from the Fund to
strengthen capacity building.
11.
Overall, the NBC continues to closely monitor the financial system for any signs of
emerging risks that may arise from the rapid credit growth and stands ready to strengthen the
prudential and supervisory measures on banks, MFIs and other credit intermediaries. The
authorities recognize the importance of safeguarding the financial system from the potential
impact of slower global growth and are committed to working closely with the Fund on
identifying risks, improving data collection and enhancing the crisis resolution frameworks for
the financial sector.
Fiscal Policy
12.
The fiscal deficit has been reduced to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2014 from 2.1 percent in
2013, supported by stronger revenues and lower capital spending. Tax revenues have increased
robustly by 2.2 percentage points of GDP to 13.9 percent in 2014, due mainly to the authorities’
recent adoption and enforcement of the Revenue Mobilization Strategy (RMS) as well as
improved tax and customs administration. Further, in order to strengthen fiscal buffers, the
authorities are determined to prioritize expenditure and strengthen revenue mobilization and
governance.
13.
In the near term, the budget deficit is projected to moderate further, consistent with the
economy’s cyclical position. The authorities have committed to the wage bill increase equivalent
to 0.7 percent of GDP by 2016, to be supported by the higher-than-expected revenues collection
and expenditure prioritization. Nevertheless, the authorities aim to limit the wage bill to less than
50 percent of current expenditure in order to allow for more capital expenditure for infrastructure
investment. The authorities will also expedite civil service reforms in order to increase efficiency
and productivity.
14.
The authorities have been continuously working on improving the monitoring of
contingent liabilities. In addition, the debt management committee has recently revised the debt

policy framework, which now includes a ceiling on government guarantees at 4 percent of GDP.
The authorities have also designated a contingency fund account for contingent liabilities related
to enterprises in the power sector. The authorities remain strongly committed to the
implementation of the RMS, and recognize the need to rationalize investment incentives and
review other tax policies over the medium term.
15.
The Debt Sustainability Analysis indicates that Cambodia’s risk of debt distress is low,
while public debt continues to decline. The authorities remain committed to reducing the fiscal
deficit and maintaining the debt-to-GDP ratio below 30 percent over the medium term to ensure
debt sustainability and to secure stronger fiscal buffer over the longer term.
Continuing the Reform Agenda
16.
Cambodia’s strong growth performance has significantly improved income distribution
and the consumption-spending by the bottom income quartile continues to increase. In
addressing structural bottlenecks, the authorities remain committed to implementing public
investments on roads, railways, bridges and irrigation to further promote rural and inclusive
growth. Public investment in these infrastructure projects will also help crowd in private
investment. The recent completion of the 1,300 megawatt hydropower projects will provide
affordable electricity to the general population and enhance Cambodia’s business climate and
competitiveness. Encourage by the improvements in maternal health, early childcare and primary
education in the rural areas, the authorities will continue to prioritize the development of
education and healthcare, especially in the rural areas.
Closing Remarks
17.
Over the medium term, robust economic growth supported by exports, tourism and
construction activities have worked in favor for Cambodia’s economic prospect. However,
lingering global uncertainty and the planned slowdown in China’s economic growth could pose
downside risks to Cambodia’s growth outlook. The authorities are committed to preserve
macroeconomic and financial stability in order to ensure sustainable growth and stand ready to
implement any available measures as deemed appropriate.
18.
Finally, the authorities would like to express their appreciation to the Fund for its
continuing support in providing high-quality technical assistance which has resulted in a broad
base strengthening in capacity across the Cambodian government. The authorities will continue
its efforts to further improve the macroeconomic framework in line with the Fund’s policy
recommendations and look forward to continuing support from the Fund.
