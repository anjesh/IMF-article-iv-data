STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 10, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. Panama’s economy continues to grow strongly, buoyed by the Panama Canal
expansion and large public infrastructure projects. Annual real GDP growth averaged
about 9 percent over the past five years, the highest in Latin America. Together with
declining public debt ratios and a sound financial sector, this has led to an upgrade of
Panama’s sovereign debt rating. Over the medium term, Free-Trade Agreements (FTAs)
with major trading partners should help sustain FDI flows. The creation of a Sovereign
Wealth Fund to save additional revenue from the expanded Canal should further
strengthen the economy’s resilience to external shocks.
Risks. Short-term risks are mainly associated with unsettled external conditions, with
longer-term risks linked principally to domestic structural challenges. A significant U.S.
slowdown or renewed global financial turmoil would affect Panama, given its close
integration with the U.S. economy and global trade, and reliance on external financing.
Given a closed output gap, high inflation, and easy credit conditions, the further
relaxation of the fiscal targets raises overheating risks, as the fiscal stance is now
markedly pro-cyclical. Longer term issues include the need to advance reforms to
transition to a more sustainable medium-term growth, and address fiscal challenges to
spur further investments in infrastructure and social needs within lower deficit limits.
Policy Challenges. With Panama’s output above potential and external risks looming
large, discussions focused on the importance of achieving a tighter fiscal stance than
the one currently envisaged by the authorities in order to avoid overheating risks and
preserve room for maneuver in the near term. Ongoing efforts to upgrade financial
sector supervision and strengthen the financial safety net should be accelerated,
including by closing existing data gaps, enhancing non-bank supervision and
establishing a liquidity facility.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Panama’s per capita GDP has more than doubled over the past decade, driven by a
steady rise in public and private investment underpinned by a stable macroeconomic
environment and prudent policies. Unemployment is at historic lows, and poverty has declined
owing to rapid economic growth and stronger social safety nets. Macroeconomic stability anchored
by full dollarization has favored the expansion of domestic services and activities mostly centered
around the Panama canal and the Colón Free Zone (or

well as transportation, storage and communications
(Figure 1). Canal traffic and activity in the Colón Free Zone (CFZ) have been supported by strong
demand from South America and emerging Asia. After a slight softening in the second quarter,
economic activity picked up again in June, and growth is projected at 10.7 percent for the year.
3.
Both headline and core inflation started to decline in September, and fell markedly in
November. Headline inflation hovered around 6 percent until August due to rising world food
prices, demand pressures (including the effect of the 17 percent minimum wage increase granted at

The canal conglomerate refers to all activities related to the Panama canal, including ports, shipping, logistics,
commerce including the CFZ, and financial and telecommunication services. As of 2008, the canal conglomerate

the beginning of the year), and higher-than-envisaged public sector spending. A decline in world
food and fuel prices led headline inflation to drop to 4.5 percent through November. Core inflation
declined from 5.9 percent in 2011 to 4.1 percent in November, due to a decrease in services’
inflation. December headline inflation is projected at 5 percent (y/y).
4.
Budget deficit ceilings have been revised upwards. The original 2012 budget deficit
target of 2 percent of GDP was revised to 2.7 percent in March, mostly to accommodate higher
energy subsidies.2 The deficit ceiling was further raised to 2.9 percent for 2012 and 2.8 percent in
2013 (from 1.5 percent of GDP) upon the approval of the law on the Sovereign Wealth Fund in June
2012 (Savings Fund of Panama or FAP, Box 1). Following severe floods and mudslides in November,
Parliament approved an amendment to the FAP law, which would allow withdrawals starting in 2012
instead of 2015 as envisaged in the original FAP law approved in June. A supplementary budget for
the reconstruction would have to be presented to Parliament in early 2013, along with a request to
raise the 2013 fiscal deficit ceiling by an equivalent amount (above the 2.8 percent ceiling).
5.
Fiscal performance in the first nine months of 2012 was boosted by a strong increase
in tax revenue. Tax revenue increased by 27 percent, mostly owing to strong corporate income tax
collection. This improved performance reflects the full impact of the 2009-10 tax reforms, recent
changes in the estimation of income tax, and enhanced tax administration including the creation of
a Large Taxpayers’ Unit (LTU). As spending expanded at a lower pace during the same period
(capital spending grew by 13 percent, and current spending by 12 percent), the fiscal deficit
remained contained at 2.4 percent of GDP (Figure 2).3
6.
Public debt vulnerabilities are low.
Gross public debt declined to 44.9 percent of
GDP as of end-2011,4 and staff’s debt
sustainability analysis indicates that it remains
on a downward trajectory (Figures 2 and 7).
Proactive liability management has helped
smooth the amortization profile. Dependency
on external issuance is being reduced through
the market makers program, initiated in June
2011. Since then the share of domestic debt
issuances has grown to 24.6 percent of total
public debt, and secondary market transactions
amount to over half of primary issuances (Chart

While the ceiling under the Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law (SFRL) was 2 percent, the law allowed carrying over
the unspent amount in the previous year to the next year, in this case, the equivalent of 0.7 percent of GDP. This is no
longer allowed under the revised SFRL.

3

Recent amendments to the Tax Code included replacing the monthly advance income tax (Amir) by the previous
system of estimating income tax payments based on the previous year’s income.
4

The SFRL’s debt limit (once public debt has reached 40 percent of GDP it must remain below that level) is defined
as the ratio of total Non-Financial Public Sector’s debt net of Fiduciary Development Trust Fund/FAP assets.

2). Following the upgrade by Moody’s in October, Panama’s sovereign debt rating is now on par
with that of Brazil, Mexico and Peru. Sovereign spreads have been low and stable (Figure 3).
7.
The external current account deficit is projected to improve somewhat in 2012. The
current account deficit widened to 12.8 percent of GDP in 2011 due to high imports of capital goods
and reinvested earnings, with Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows (9.2 percent of GDP) providing
the bulk of the external financing. Notwithstanding an improvement in the goods and services
balance in the first three quarters of 2012, the current account deficit is projected to remain elevated
at 12 percent of GDP in 2012, largely due to a strong increase in the repatriation of profits and
dividends abroad and the reinvestment of earnings by foreign companies. The deficit will continue
to be largely financed by FDI flows, which grew by 56 percent (y/y) in cumulative nominal terms by
end-September 2012. The Canal expansion project is about 45 percent completed, and is now
expected to be finished by early 2015 (about 6 months behind schedule).
8.
Credit conditions have remained supportive of domestic demand. The banking system,
including local affiliates of foreign banks, has been shielded so far from unsettled external
conditions thanks to the system’s diversified ownership structure, high reliance on deposit funding,
low exposure to European banks, as well as rapid economic growth. Underpinned by strong capital
and liquidity ratios, bank credit has continued to expand at a healthy pace (14.3 percent as of
September 2012 y/y), though credit to the CFZ, commercial and residential real estate, and tourism
grew more rapidly. Liquidity ratios have declined but remain comfortable, at 21 percent in
September 2012. Non-performing loans are low and provisions are increasing (Table 5). Interest
rates on deposits have declined to historic lows but lending rates have been broadly stable owing to
strong credit demand (Figure 3).
9.
The difficult political environment may jeopardize the continuity of the reforms going
forward. Although President Martinelli’s party retains a majority in Congress, some recent reform
initiatives, mostly relating to the privatization of state assets, had to be withdrawn due to strong
popular opposition. The proposal to allow the sale of remaining state shares in partially privatized
enterprises was blocked by the National Assembly and a draft law regulating public-private
partnerships had to be withdrawn. A law that would have allowed the sale of public land in the CFZ
was repealed following violent demonstrations. The next presidential elections are scheduled for
May 2014.
10.
The overall track record of implementation of Fund advice is positive, though the
recent fiscal stance has been more expansionary than envisaged in the 2011 Article IV
consultation. There is a fluid dialogue with the authorities, who have sought staff’s advice and
technical expertise on major policy initiatives and structural reform efforts, such as the establishment
of the FAP and a liquidity facility. In the context of their ambitious program of modernization of the
state, the authorities are also fairly intensive users of Fund’s technical assistance, in the areas of
public financial management, revenue administration, financial sector supervision, and statistics.
Nonetheless, some recent decisions, particularly in the fiscal area, are at odds with staff’s
recommendations, and there has been slow progress with some technical assistance projects (Text
Box 1).

PANAMA

Text Box 1: Panama: Response to Fund Advice


A sustained fiscal consolidation effort since 2004-05 led to notable declines in public debt. After being
appropriately countercyclical in 2009, fiscal policy remained moderately expansionary thereafter, in
contrast with staff’s recommendation of a modest consolidation starting in 2010. Fiscal deficit ceilings
under the SFRL through 2017 have been revised upwards.



The design of the FAP follows best international practices, though staff recommended aiming at fiscal
balance in the medium-term to avoid borrowing at higher costs than the returns on FAP assets and
achieve faster public debt reduction.



The authorities welcomed the 2011 FSAP and are making good progress in strengthening regulatory
and supervisory frameworks for bank and nonbank oversight. The authorities plan to strengthen the
financial safety net through the establishment of a liquidity facility, supported by Fund technical
assistance. The AML/CFT legal framework is also being upgraded.



On tax administration, the Large Tax Payer Unit is operational, and a law creating an independent
revenue agency will be presented to Parliament in January 2013.



In the area of public financial management, some inroads have been made in strengthening fiscal
accounting, though progress in adopting international public sector accounting standards and GFSM
2001 classification has been slow. In spite of delays, the authorities remain committed to establishing a
Single Treasury Account. A recent decree requires the publication of projections of expenditures under
deferred payment schemes (including turnkey projects) in budget documents, as recommended by
staff.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS

the real estate sector, but anecdotal evidence
suggests that there could be some oversupply in the tourism and high-end real estate segments
(both mortgages and commercial real estate). Nonetheless, banks’ exposures to these segments are
limited, owing to very conservative lending practices (e.g. low loan-to-value ratios, life insurance
requirements, conservative property assessments, and automatic payroll deductions for mortgages).

13.
Although the higher fiscal deficits do not compromise debt sustainability, they imply
reduced room for maneuver should negative shocks hit the economy. The cyclically-adjusted
primary balance could deteriorate by up to 0.9 percentage points of GDP in 2012. The authorities
indicated that they intended to maintain the 2012 fiscal deficit below the revised SFRL ceilings,
though this would still imply a positive fiscal impulse. The 2013 fiscal deficit ceiling would be raised
by the amount needed for reconstruction after the floods, and spending pressures could intensify
further ahead of the 2014 presidential election.
14.
The projected current account path is consistent with medium-term external
sustainability. The external current account deficit is projected to gradually converge from 12
percent of GDP in 2012 to its underlying level of about 7.5 percent of GDP by 2017 as the public
investment cycle unwinds. FDI inflows are expected to be boosted by FTAs with major trading
partners and would continue to finance the bulk of those deficits (Text Box 2). Although high at
about 120 percent of GDP in 2011, total external debt (excluding external liabilities of offshore
entities) would remain sustainable and resilient to most standard shocks (Annex I and Figure 8).
Non-resident bank deposits account for almost two-thirds of total private external debt, but most
are time and savings deposits; short-term debt accounts for only about 20 percent of total external
debt. An exchange rate assessment exercise conducted using the CGER methodologies shows that,
in spite of a modest recent appreciation, Panama’s real effective exchange rate remains broadly in
line with fundamentals. However, further real appreciation would undermine competitiveness.

of recessions or natural disasters.

Text Box 2. Panama: Recent and Forthcoming Free Trade Agreements
Panama has been actively seeking preferential trade agreements with major trading partners:



The FTA with the US came into effect in October 2012. The agreement was signed in 2007 and
ratified by the U.S. Congress in 2011. Over 87 percent of US exports of consumer and industrial products
became duty-free with remaining tariffs phasing out over ten years. Nearly 56 percent of U.S.
agricultural exports became duty-free with remaining tariffs to be phased over fifteen years. The
agreement also eliminates a 50 percent port duty for U.S. ships, which should encourage ship repair and
the development of shipyards.



An Economic Partnership Association Agreement with the European Union, jointly negotiated
with the Central American countries, was ratified by the European Parliament in December and
could enter into force in the first half of 2013. The EU is the second most important destination of
Panama’s exports and the agreement is expected to increase growth for the Central American region for
up to 1.4 percent of GDP in the medium term. In particular, the agreement aims at creating a Free-Trade
Area in goods and services between the two regions. The EU will eliminate tariffs immediately on most
agricultural goods and virtually all duties on manufactures, and the rest within seven years.



An FTA with Canada was ratified by Canada’s parliament in December and could enter into force
in the first quarter of 2013.. Coverage of the Canada FTA is similar to that with the U.S. and includes
market access for goods, cross-border trade in services, telecommunications, investment, financial
services and government procurement.

Panama also has FTAs in place with Chile, Peru, Taiwan and Singapore and a variety of commercial
agreements with other countries (i.e. Dominican Republic, Colombia, Israel and Mexico). Other
commercial agreements are in negotiation with South Korea, the European Free-Trade Association and
Trinidad and Tobago.

B. Spillover Risks
16.
Panama’s extensive trade and financial linkages make it vulnerable to external shocks,
but strong fundamentals would mitigate their impact. Panama is closely linked to both the U.S.
business cycle as well as to world trade, through the Panama canal.5 Panama is an important
regional banking hub, and domestic macro-financial linkages are significant due to the large size of
the banking sector (Box 2 and Figure 5).6 Strong fundamentals and low vulnerabilities, including a
reliance on stable services’ exports and small and shallow capital markets would however mitigate
the impact of external shocks. Panama’s economy proved remarkably resilient during the 2008-09
global crisis and rebounded very quickly afterwards, owing to a rapid policy response, low
government funding needs, ample capital and liquidity buffers in the financial system and the
relatively rapid reversal of the freeze in foreign credit lines.
17.
Staff’s analysis indicates that external real and financial shocks could have a significant
impact on output and credit growth. External shocks also appear to have a larger and
longer-lasting impact on Panama’s output through their effect on real domestic credit (Box 2 and
Figure 5). Among the global downside risks mentioned in recent IMF’s multilateral surveillance
reports, scenarios directly affecting Panama’s main trading partners and global financial markets
would be the most relevant for Panama.


In the short term, under the low-probability scenario of a “full” U.S. fiscal cliff that could lead to a
contraction of U.S. output between 4.8 and 1.8 percent relative to the baseline,7 Panama’s
growth would be between 2 and 6 percentage points below staff’s baseline projection (9 percent
in 2013) reflecting the impact transmitted mainly through trade channels. Lower U.S. demand
would also impact Canal traffic, which is already slowing from its record year in 2011, and
related activities, including ports and the CFZ.



A sudden stop in capital flows to the Latin America region, or an idiosyncratic slowdown in key
South American trading partners, such as Colombia and/or Venezuela, the main destinations of
CFZ exports and important sources of foreign bank deposits, would also affect domestic activity
and credit.



The ongoing crisis in Europe is expected to have a limited direct effect as exposure to the region
through financial channels and trade linkages is low, and even second round effects of the
European crisis on global financial conditions and trade would only have a relatively mild impact
on Panama.

5

Panama canal traffic represents about 4 percent of world trade.

6

See Chapter 1 of the Selected Issues Paper “Spillovers to Panama: Impact of Trade and International Financial
Shocks”.
7

Fund staff estimates of the impact of the U.S. fiscal cliff on U.S. output range from a contraction of 1.8 to 4.8
percent of GDP, assuming a fiscal retrenchment of 4 percent lasting through the whole of 2013. However, this
remains a low-probability event, with temporary turmoil followed by an agreement in the first quarter more likely.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PANAMA



In the medium term, a hard landing in China would affect growth for trading partners, including
South American commodity exporters, and thus Canal activity, as South-East trade represents an
increasing share of total traffic (about 16 percent of the total in 2011), ports and activity in the
CFZ, with knock-on effects on credit and domestic non-Canal activity.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS

and undermines the credibility of the fiscal anchor. Loose imported monetary conditions and the

the revised ceiling.
19.
In staff’s view, a more neutral fiscal stance would lead to faster debt reduction and
help contain inflation. Staff recommended keeping overall deficits at or close to the previous SFRL
targets of 2-2½ percent of GDP in 2012-13, consistent with small primary surpluses. This could be
achieved by a combination of lower subsidies and further improvements in tax administration.
Phasing public investment projects over a longer period of time could also be considered.


Total energy subsidies increased to about 1 percent of GDP in 2011 following increases in
imported fuel prices. The authorities indicated that the electricity subsidy was being gradually
reduced while the electricity tariffs had been increased, with tangible gains from the reforms
starting in 2013. Staff noted that better targeting of broad-based subsidies would also be
necessary, and that efforts to promote the development of alternative energy sources to reduce
dependency on imported fuel should be accelerated.



The authorities’ plan to establish an independent tax revenue agency, and the recent
operationalization of the LTU are expected to further improve tax collection. The LTU covers 72
companies responsible for 25 percent of income tax collections. The authorities also noted that
land valuation is being accelerated and that property tax collections should improve starting in
2013.



The authorities noted that the government’s strategic plan aimed at filling critical infrastructure
gaps over a five-year period, taking advantage of the current favorable financing conditions and
that implementation shouldn’t be delayed (Box 3). They pointed out that overheating pressures
would be mitigated by the fact that infrastructure investment was expanding productive
capacity, and was aimed at attracting complementary private investment, particularly in the
logistics sector. They added that most of the public investment program was sustainably
financed out of current savings. Staff agreed that, during the implementation phase, investment
was expanding potential output (the output gap is projected to peak at only 1.4 percent of GDP
in 2013), and that debt levels remained sustainable. However, staff also noted that debt
dynamics were increasingly driven by the growth performance.

20.
In discussing contingent liabilities associated with public sector enterprises and
turnkey projects, staff noted that they could pose fiscal risks. Public enterprises recently
excluded from the SFRL’s definition of the non-financial public sector have ambitious investments
plans to be financed by debt.9 Liabilities arising from turnkey projects amount to about 6 percent of
2011 GDP over 2014–16, with 20 percent of each annual investment budget reserved for these
projects.10 Staff strongly encouraged the authorities to accelerate the adoption of International
Public Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and the 2001 GFSM classification of public accounts to ensure
a more transparent and comprehensive coverage of all public sector actual and contingent liabilities.
This would also help estimate the real size of the public sector’s participation in the economy. The
authorities noted that the debt unit was monitoring all public sector liabilities, and that after some
delays they were prepared to start the bidding process for a new financial information system that
would support the move to IPSAS.

B. Addressing Spillover Risks
21.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the outlook and risks, and
were appreciative of the spillover analysis. They concurred that a weaker external environment
could help further reduce domestic demand pressures. Given strong domestic fundamentals, they
agreed that the main risks to the outlook would stem from the materialization of a large external
shock. In that situation, they indicated that the large share of capital spending (38 percent of total

expenditures) provided flexibility to the budget. While they agreed that fallout from a shock to U.S.
output such as the realization of the fiscal cliff could have a significant impact, they also pointed out
that linkages with Latin America and Asia had increased in recent years through their share of CFZ
and Panama canal activity. Over the medium term, the authorities noted that the expanded canal
would see a higher diversification of goods and shipping routes, which would reduce vulnerability to
conditions in individual trading partners. At the same time, the FAP would allow for the
implementation of countercyclical fiscal policies.
22.
The authorities are accelerating plans to set up a fund to buffer against liquidity
shortages in order to strengthen the financial safety net.11 Although the financial system is
sound and has been resilient to past shocks, the authorities and most private sector counterparts
and analysts agreed that Panama would be vulnerable to liquidity risk. In the absence of a Lender of
Last Resort (LOLR), most banks maintain ample liquidity in their balance sheets, but this wouldn’t
suffice to protect the sector in case of a large systemic liquidity shock. Following a high-level
seminar in September that engaged all stakeholders, the authorities requested continued Fund
support to finalize the design of a liquidity facility by June 2013. Following Fund technical assistance
recommendations, the facility would provide LOLR support in case of temporary liquidity shortages.
Given limited resources, the authorities saw merit in starting with a fund aimed at preventing
smaller, idiosyncratic liquidity shocks, while exploring other funding options in order to gradually
build up the capacity to address larger, systemic liquidity needs. They indicated the National Bank of
Panama had agreed to provide initial resources in order for the liquidity fund to become
operational.

C. Bolstering Financial System Supervision
23.
The authorities are making headway in implementing the recommendations from the
2011 FSAP. The legal framework for insurance and capital markets was recently upgraded, and a
draft law on cooperatives is to be presented to Parliament in early 2013. Banking oversight will
benefit from new regulations on operational and interest rate risks, and the regulation for
monitoring credit risk is being overhauled. The design of capital requirements and reporting
standards for holding companies will strengthen consolidated supervision. The monitoring of
macro-prudential and systemic risks is being enhanced: the Superintendency of Banks (SBP) has
identified systemically important banks and initiated a quarterly Financial Stability Report (Text Table
1).
24.
Staff and the authorities concurred that the current favorable macroeconomic
conditions provide an opportunity to accelerate financial sector reforms. Among the key
priorities, efforts to build capacity to monitor systemic risks and upgrade the supervision of
non-bank financial institutions should be continued.



No institution in Panama has an explicit mandate to maintain financial stability or formulate
macro-prudential policy. The recently-created Financial Coordination Committee (CCF)12 has
already contributed to improving coordination among the supervisory agencies. Staff
recommended that the CCF should be given a clear mandate to monitor systemic risks, sufficient
resources to implement that mandate, and power to implement macro-prudential measures as
needed. In addition, the mission highlighted that data gaps and capacity constraints hinder
adequate monitoring of systemic risks. The authorities concurred that the analysis of systemic
risk should be strengthened, but considered the current institutional arrangement adequate.
Following discussions with staff on institutional and operational elements of a macroprudential
framework, the authorities expressed interest for technical assistance in this area.13



Although they represent only 22 percent of total financial system’s assets, current weaknesses in
the supervision of non-bank financial institutions pose significant reputational risks for the whole
system.14 In particular, prudential requirements need to be tightened in some segments (e.g.
cooperatives). The mission welcomed recent and forthcoming upgrades to the regulatory
framework, and urged the authorities to further enhance the capacity to supervise non-bank
financial institutions.



The legal frameworks for AML/CFT and tax transparency are being upgraded. The authorities
noted that a new AML/CFT law is being prepared and could be presented to parliament in early
2013. The authorities noted that the law would incorporate recommendations from the October
2012 AML/CFT mission, including the requirements of the new Financial Action Task Force
recommendations. Staff also encouraged the authorities to publish the AML/CFT assessment.
Panama’s failure to complete Phase I of the OECD Global Forum’s peer review process could
have negative repercussions. Approval of a law immobilizing bearer shares, expected to be
presented to Parliament in January 2013, would be needed for Panama to comply with the
international standards for transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes.

12

The CCF was created in 2011 to improve coordination among financial sector supervisors and harmonize
regulation, It’s members include the Superintendents of (i) Banks (SBP), (ii) Insurance and Reinsurance (SSRP), (iii)
Capital Markets (SMV); as well as of the head of the Panamanian Autonomous Institute of Cooperatives (IPACOOP),
the Director of Financial Companies of the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MICI), and the Director of the Public Sector
Workers Pension Funds (CICAP).

D. Ensuring a Smooth Transition to the Medium-Term Growth Path
25.
An important medium-term challenge is to ensure a smooth transition to a more
sustainable and inclusive growth as the large public infrastructure projects unwind. Staff
pointed out that, based on the experiences of other middle-income countries and a vast empirical
literature, the quality of the investments and accompanying macroeconomic policies were key
determinants of the impact of public investment on growth. The mission noted that, in Panama, (i)
further improvements in project selection, planning, and monitoring in the context of the ongoing
structural fiscal reform efforts would help ensure that public investment is of good quality; and that
(ii) productivity would need to be enhanced through ongoing competitiveness and training and
education reforms, in order to ease current skills mismatches and raise productivity as well as living
standards. The authorities agreed with staff on the structural reform priorities as essential to address
potential supply bottlenecks and ensure broad-based growth. Nonetheless, they were confident that
there wouldn’t be a sudden drop in economic activity following the completion of the Canal
expansion and the large public investment program. They pointed out that substantial private
investment projects, including a US$6.5 billion investment in copper mining due to start in 2013, and
new public investments, such as the building of a second line of the Panama City metro, would help
support growth.

Addressing Structural Fiscal Issues
26.
Ensuring that the large public infrastructure projects are of high quality and
productivity-enhancing will require further upgrades to public financial management. In
particular, staff noted that budget planning, accounting, and monitoring should be strengthened
further. Moving toward medium-term budgeting would support implementation of fiscal policy
objectives. In spite of delays, the authorities confirmed that they remained committed to the
establishment of a Single Treasury Account, which would help strengthen cash management and
improve the predictability of budget execution. Staff welcomed ongoing efforts to strengthen
investment planning and monitoring capacity through training and modernization of information
systems, and noted that improvements in project selection, stronger procurement procedures and
internal audits would help ensure that public investment is of high quality and cost-efficient.
27.
Recent tax reforms made the system more progressive on the income taxation side,
but they fell short of raising collections to the levels achieved by peer countries (Box 4).15 Staff
welcomed recent improvements in the tax performance but noted that stronger revenue collection
over the medium term would be necessary to preserve social and capital expenditure within lower
deficit limits. Higher revenue collection would also be necessary to offset forthcoming revenue
losses associated with the entry into force of FTAs with major trading partners.16 Staff highlighted
that the efforts to strengthen tax and customs administration should focus on continuing to
improve tax education, strengthening controls and improving the communication between the two

revenue collecting agencies to reduce evasion. Staff and the authorities also agreed that there was
room to further reduce exemptions and tax expenditures.

Enhancing Competitiveness
28.
Improving competitiveness is an essential element of the government’s strategy. The
authorities emphasized that reforms implemented during 2012 helped improve Panama’s score and
ranking in various competitiveness surveys, and it is now ranked the second most competitive
economy in Latin America after Chile by the World Economic Forum. Measures included further
facilitating business startups and reducing the time required for various administrative procedures.
Bottlenecks in the logistics chain are being tackled, through the ongoing modernization of customs
procedures to facilitate integration with the region, the development of ports, roads and airports
infrastructure, and upgrades to the law on Free Trade Zones, in order to take full advantage of the
FTAs and boost synergies with the canal conglomerate. Staff noted that remaining weak points such
as the justice system should be tackled, and agreed with the authorities that ongoing education and
health reforms would help improve access to basic services (see below).

Labor Market and Social Policies for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth
29.
The scarcity of educated and trained workers may constrain growth in the medium
term. Staff noted that the recent contribution of capital accumulation to growth has neared 60
percent, with relatively small shares of labor and particularly total factor productivity (Chart 7). Rising
labor demand in the context of rapid economic growth has driven unemployment down and led to
wage increases, but there is growing evidence of skills mismatches. Almost half of all employers
indicate that they are looking for skilled workers, particularly in construction and services (Figure 6).
At the same time, youth unemployment is high

30.
Although Panama’s growth performance has been impressive, social indicators have
improved slowly. The rapid development of the areas surrounding the canal and Panama City has
not been accompanied by similar progress in rural and indigenous areas where most of the poor
live. Over two-thirds of the current public investment program resources are allocated to projects in
and around the capital city. Nonetheless, the authorities noted that, based on regular income
surveys, poverty and extreme poverty had declined since 2010 from 29.8 and 12.2 percent,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PANAMA

respectively, to 25.8 and 10.4 percent as of March 2012. Staff concurred that the expanded coverage
of safety nets, in particular the flagship conditional cash transfer (“red de oportunidades”), and
transfers for the elderly (“100 a los 70”), were bearing fruit, but noted that their efficiency could be
improved through better targeting and ex-post monitoring.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Panama’s economy continues to expand at a fast pace, driven by high public
investment and robust private demand. At the same time, downside risks to the already weak
global outlook have become more prominent. In this context, the main near-term policy challenges
remain to avoid overheating and strengthen fiscal and financial buffers. Structural policies should
focus on ensuring a smooth transition to sustainable medium-term growth rates as the large
infrastructure projects are completed.
32.
The outlook is favorable, with broadly balanced risks. Easy credit and fiscal conditions
should continue to support public and private consumption in 2013. Inflation has started to decline
but demand pressures in the context of a tight labor market should keep it above that of the U.S. in
the coming years. Overheating risks are expected to continue to ease as public investment projects
and the Canal expansion unwind, in the context of weak external demand. The banking system is
healthy, though strong credit growth should be closely monitored, together with rising household
and corporate leverage. The large current account deficits are largely investment-driven and
financed by robust FDI inflows. The real effective exchange rate remains in line with fundamentals,
though further real appreciation could erode competitiveness. Public and private external debt is
high as a share of GDP but remains sustainable over the medium term.
33.
A tighter fiscal stance than currently envisaged would be essential to preserve fiscal
space and avoid overheating. The recent revision in fiscal targets implies a positive fiscal impulse
in 2012. Given a closed output gap and loose imported monetary conditions, fiscal deficits should
be kept firmly below the revised ceilings as envisaged by the authorities. Reconstruction costs
following the November floods should be accommodated within the existing budget envelope so as
to avoid further stimulating the economy and deplenishing FAP capital. Frequent revisions to the
legal deficit ceilings undermine the credibility of the fiscal anchor.
34.
Further fiscal restraint could be achieved through enhanced tax administration and
better expenditure management. The establishment of a large taxpayer unit, and plans to create
an autonomous revenue agency represent notable advances. Further strengthening controls at the
tax and customs agencies and developing a taxpayer culture through improved customer service
should improve tax collection in the medium term. On the expenditure side, better planning,
accounting and monitoring of capital investment and further reducing broad-based subsidies are
necessary not only to contain deficits but also to ensure the quality of spending and limit fiscal risks.
35.
Enhanced fiscal and financial buffers would help cope with adverse spillovers. Strong
fundamentals would mitigate the impact of external shocks, but shocks to the U.S. or other major
trading partners could have a sizeable impact on Panama’s output. Panama would also be

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PANAMA

vulnerable to a global liquidity shock. In the medium term, the FAP would allow implementation of
countercyclical policies, but in the short run stronger fiscal buffers would be needed. Progress with
plans to strengthen the financial safety net through the creation of a liquidity facility is welcome.
36.
There has been good progress in implementing FSAP recommendations, though
efforts to upgrade financial sector supervision could be accelerated. The Council of Supervisors
has the potential to become a powerful watchdog of financial system stability including, if needed,
by implementing macro-prudential policies, but its mandate and technical capacity will have to be
adapted. On the banking side, the SBP’s efforts to monitor macro-prudential and systemic risks are
timely, but need to be supported by the closing of existing data gaps, including on private sector
leverage and housing prices at market value. Existing weaknesses in nonbank supervision could pose
potential reputational risks to the financial system and upgrades to the legal framework for
non-bank supervision should be accompanied by enhanced capacity of the respective supervisory
agencies.
37.
Continued improvements in competitiveness and recent education reforms should
help sustain growth over the medium term. Recent improvements in the business environment
are welcome. Addressing remaining bottlenecks in the logistics chain will ensure that Panama can
reap the full benefits of the FTAs and of the Canal expansion. The government’s initiatives to
improve the quality of public education and the availability of vocational training in partnership with
the private sector should help develop the mix of skills required by a modern, service-based
economy and raise living standards of all Panamanians.
38.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV Consultation takes place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. Panama: Main Parameters of the Savings Fund and the Revised SFRL
In June 2012 the National Assembly approved Law 38 creating a Sovereign Wealth Fund (“Fondo de Ahorro
de Panama”, or FAP) in Panama, to become operational in December 2012. The objectives of the Fund are to
(i) introduce a stabilization mechanism for emergency situations and for economic slowdowns; and (ii) create a
long-term sovereign savings instrument. Startup capital of US$1.2 billion (about 3.5 percent of GDP) was
transferred from the now liquidated Fiduciary Fund for Development. Starting in 2015, yearly contributions of the
Panama Canal Authority to the budget in excess of 3.5 percent of GDP are to be transferred to the FAP.
Funds can only be transferred to the National Treasury under the conditions defined in the amended Social
and Fiscal Responsibility Law (SFRL): (a) state of emergency declared by the Cabinet when the cost associated
with an emergency is equal to or exceeds 0.5 percent of GDP; and (b) economic slowdown. There would be no
withdrawals if (i) FAP assets are less than 2 percent of the previous fiscal year’s GDP; and (ii) the annual
contribution of the ACP falls short of 3.5 percent of GDP. Other important provisions include (1) an option to
repay up to 0.5 percent of GDP in sovereign debt when FAP assets exceed 5 percent of GDP of the previous year,
(2) a requirement that all FAP’s interest revenue be transferred to the budget on a yearly basis, and (3) an option
to make limited purchases of domestic debt on external or domestic secondary markets), in order to help develop
the local capital market.
The revised SFRL’s fiscal limit is no longer set on the NFPS Balance but on a newly defined fiscal indicator,
the NFPS Adjusted Balance, defined as the NFPS Balance minus the deposits into the FAP. Until 2017, the
revised law defines a transition period with higher deficits than previously envisaged, starting from 2.9 percent of
GDP in 2012 to gradually decline to the new deficit target of 0.5 percent by 2018. From 2018 onwards, the budget
1
will implicitly target a non-canal deficit of 4 percent of GDP (Figure 1). Based on this fiscal framework and the

authorities’ baseline long-term macroeconomic scenario, the FAP will accumulate about 9 percent of GDP in
resources by 2025 with the debt-to-GDP ratio declining to about 25 percent. This modified fiscal framework also
implies that there will be a large jump in total expenditures in 2015 due to higher deficits and increased transfers
from the canal.

Box 2. Spillovers to Panama and Domestic Macro-Financial Linkages
A high degree of trade openness and reliance on external financing makes Panama vulnerable to adverse
developments in the global economy. A structural VAR analysis suggests that global demand and international
financial shocks have a relatively large and lasting impact on real activity in Panama as well as on real private sector
credit. Furthermore, Panama’s real credit appears to amplify the response of Panama’s output to external shocks at
longer time horizons.
While the U.S. remains Panama’s most important trade partner, the importance of China and Latin America
has been growing (Box Figure 1). The U.S. accounts for about 20 percent of merchandise exports and for about a
third of total canal traffic (measured in tons) and of re-exports of the CFZ. In the last two years China has become
Panama’s second most important partner for merchandise trade. Colombia, Costa Rica, and Venezuela together
account for 40 percent total CFZ re-exports in 2012, or more than the U.S.

reflecting a strong presence of other Central and South American banks in Panama.

The impact of external spillovers to Panama’s output and domestic credit is quantified using impulse
responses from an SVAR model. The VAR model includes Panama’s real GDP, Panama’s real domestic private
credit, Panama’s trade balance to GDP ratio, global demand and the VIX index as a proxy for global financial
conditions. Global demand is proxied by a trade-weighted average of the real GDP of Panama’s main trading
partners, the U.S. real GDP and the ratio of world trade to world GDP.

real GDP level by above 0.4 percent after the first quarter and by almost 0.7 percent after a year. There is a
delayed impact on real credit, with an increase of almost 1 percent after two years.



a positive one standard deviation shock to the VIX index would reduce Panama’s real output by 0.4 percent
after the first quarter and would have a long-lasting effect. Panama’s real output would decline by almost 1
percent after a year. Real private credit would not be affected on impact, but would decline by 1.3 percent
after a year.



a positive one standard deviation shock to the U.S. real GDP leads to a larger increase in Panama’s output
after one quarter, while a shock to world trade would have an immediate impact on Panama’s output,

Panama’s real credit appears to amplify the output response to external shocks at longer time horizons,
suggesting that the real credit response is demand-driven in Panama.

Large public infrastructure projects are expected to
continue to drive growth over the coming years.
Panama’s public investment is projected to increase from
an average of 5.7 percent of GDP in 2003-09 to 12.2
percent of GDP per annum over 2010-14. In addition to the
Panama canal expansion project (US$5.25 billion or 20
percent of 2010 GDP), the Public Investment Program (PIP)
totals US$15 billion or over 50 percent of 2010 GDP (Chart
1). The Panama canal’s capacity will roughly double when
the project is completed in 2015, which will lead to
significant economies of scale and a diversification in canal
transit. The PIP focuses on logistics, tourism, agriculture and
financial services which were selected as sectors where
economic growth returns and employment generation
would be the highest.

calculations.
There is evidence of complementarities between this
public investment and private investment. The Canal expansion has fostered the development of private ports,
the building of roads has improved connectivity between logistics centers, and the expansion of airports in the
provinces has fostered private investment in tourism as well as higher value-added agricultural exports. Public
investments were also aimed at developing new industries around the logistics hub, such as light manufacturing
and value-added warehousing. Investments in education and hospitals should help improve social conditions over
the medium-term.

Panama’s investment surge is comparable in size to that
experienced by a group of 12 middle income countries
(Chart 2). Panama’s public investment to GDP ratio in the
peak year was 9.8 percentage points above the pre-surge
period average, somewhat higher than the group’s average
(6.2). Real GDP growth rose above historical averages over a
two-year period following the peak of the public investment,
suggesting a lag in the returns to investment. After the
surge, output growth has tended to revert back to pre-surge
averages, or in some cases to decline (e.g. Seychelles).

Going forward, tax administration reforms can help increase tax revenue in the context of a diminished
appetite for further comprehensive tax reforms. The establishment of a large taxpayer unit and of an
independent revenue agency should help strengthen controls and develop a taxpaying culture, in part through
better client service.

In spite of these advances, various indicators of tax
performance show that Panama still lags behind the
region and its income peer group (Figure 1). Panama
scored 48 percent in tax effort, compared with a median
of 78 percent for middle income countries, tax effort
being the difference between actual tax revenue to
estimated tax collection capacity, based on a country’s
economic, social, institutional and demographic
characteristics. Similar results in income peer group
countries can be attributed to either a legal framework
that allows for a large level of exemptions (Guatemala) or
fairly low tax rates (Singapore and China SR, Hong Kong).
In Panama’s case, besides the low tax rates (VAT, personal
income), exemptions, in particular from custom duties,
corporate income tax, real estate tax, and VAT, have
deprived the budget of significant amounts of revenue,
although they have been reduced during the course of the
decade (from almost 15 percent to 4 percent of tax
revenue). VAT rates and VAT revenue-to-GDP ratios in
Panama remain well below those of the region as well as the
median for middle-income countries.

23

1996

The tax reforms implemented in 2009-10 yielded
important revenue gains and improved the
composition of revenue. The reform package aimed at
strengthening collection through the closing of loopholes
and improved compliance (with the mandatory
installation of fiscal cash registers in businesses). The VAT
rate was increased and personal income tax rates were
lowered. Tax revenue increased by about 1.8 percentage
points of 2010 GDP (compared to a projected 2.5
percentage points of GDP, as some measures came into
force with a delay). VAT collection improved, and the
share of sales tax in total revenue increased.

Panama has carried out three tax reforms over the
past decade (2002, 2005 and 2009-10). Overall, the
reforms made the system more progressive as they
allowed for a combination of tax rate reductions (e.g., on
the income side) and increases (e.g., VAT), and broadened
the tax base.

1/ Nonfinancial public sector, including Panama Canal Authority. Non-government assets formerly held by the Fiduciary Fund are not netted out.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/
5/
6/
7/
8/
9/

The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex I. Panama: External Stability Assessment
Balance of Payments
The high external current account deficits projected for the near term are mainly
investment-driven and financed by foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, and do not pose a
risk to external sustainability. The significant current account deficits reflect a temporary jump in
import spending related to the Canal expansion (which is undergoing its most capital-intensive
phase of construction during 2011-2012) and the import-heavy nature of ambitious public
infrastructure investments. After adjusting for these factors (see Annex Table 1 below), the
underlying current account balance is estimated at 7.3 percent (close to its historic norm) and is
projected to converge to this value in the medium term without major policy adjustments. Panama
is not reliant on either short-term, non-deposit debt or portfolio investment inflows— the two main
sources of external finance that would be most affected should the global economy experience a
relapse. Excluding the public sector borrowing associated to the Canal expansion, FDI represented
85 percent of total net capital inflows in 2011 (and accounted for 9.1 percent of GDP). Repatriation
of profits and dividends and reinvested earnings associated with these FDI inflows (which averaged
6.5 percent of GDP over the past five years) contribute to relatively high structural current account
deficits.
Furthermore, Panama's current account deficit may be overestimated given that BOP
statistics do not factor in the credit flows associated with the repatriation and reinvestment of
profits and dividends from residents’ FDI abroad. According to inward FDI data reported by
counterpart economies for the CDIS, the stock of Panama’s outward FDI amounted to 78 percent of
GDP as of end-2011. Similarly, the negative net international investment position of Panama (which
reached 72 percent of GDP by end-2011) is likely overestimated.

Real Effective Exchange Rate
Panama’s CPI-based Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) has been appreciating since 2011,
but remains in line with fundamentals with no evidence of misalignment. After depreciating
during most of the decade due to fiscal consolidation and low inflation, higher deficits and inflation
above trading partners translated into modest appreciation pressures in 2011 (1.7 percent). The
REER appreciated by 3.5 percent as of September 2012 (y/y), and it is now at about the same level as
in the base year (2005). Exchange rate assessment results from standard CGER methodologies show
no evidence of misalignment (Annex Table 2). However, further real appreciation driven by inflation
above trading partners could erode competitiveness.

1/ The MB approach calculates the difference between the medium-term CA balance and an estimated equilibrium CA "norm".
The ES approach calculates the difference between the actual CA balance and the NFA-stabilizing CA balance.
The real exchange rate gap is calculated to bring the current account balance in line with its NFA-stabilizing level or
medium-term MB norm. NFA is net foreign assets as a share of GDP (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2011), with the 2007 NFA
position assumed close to the long-run equilibrium. The ERER is estimated as a function of medium-term fundamentals.

International Investment Position and External Debt
The net international investment position has remained broadly stable over the past decade.
Large gross FDI and net bank liabilities explain the overall negative position (Annex Figure 1). Going
forward, the IIP is projected to deteriorate somewhat until 2014-15 as FDI liabilities associated with
the public infrastructure projects expand and to stabilize as a share of GDP by the end of the
projection period.
Results of the debt sustainability analysis indicate that external debt, while relatively high as a
share of GDP, is sustainable over the medium term. The total stock of public and private external
debt, net of offshore banks’ foreign liabilities, represented close to 120 percent of GDP by end-2011.
Non-resident deposits in Panama’s on-shore banks accounted for 44 percent of total external debt
and 65 percent of private external debt, and approximately 15 percent of these deposits were
short-term (Annex Table 3). External debt should gradually decline as a share of GDP over the
projection period, as a large part of the current account deficits is expected to continue to be
financed by non-debt creating flows (FDI), and average annual real GDP growth is projected to be
close to 7 percent.
Standard stress tests suggest that Panama’s external indebtedness is resilient to a series of
shocks. The results of standardized sensitivity tests do not fundamentally alter the external debt
outlook. Shocks to interest rates, current account and growth have a contained impact on Panama’s

external debt-to-GDP ratio, which would remain within manageable levels. In most cases, the
external debt would stay below 110 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period. The
external debt outlook, however, is somewhat vulnerable to a large real devaluation of 30 percent,
which would push up the debt-to-GDP ratio by 31 percentage points to 142 percent in 2017. Given
that Panama is a fully-dollarized economy, however, this scenario would necessarily entail a large
and sudden internal price and wage deflation.

International Reserves
In Panama, international reserves are the liquid external assets of the National Bank of
Panama (BNP). Official reserve assets amount to 9 percent of GDP, or about 35 percent of shortterm public and private external debt. Official reserves were also 10 percent of total deposits, while
individual banks’ liquid assets amounted to an additional 21 percent of total deposits as of
September 2012. Given the open current and financial accounts and the full dollarization of the
economy, the balance of payments would adjust automatically to an external financing shock
through a reduction in the money supply and lower domestic demand. In a fully dollarized
economy, liquid assets would mainly serve to protect the banking system in case of a systemic
liquidity shock and the ensuing credit crunch and contraction in economic activity.

Non-Price Competitiveness
Survey-based competitiveness rankings improved in recent years (Annex Figure 1). Overall,
Panama ranks better than most of its peers in South America except Chile. In terms of
competitiveness areas, Panama ranks well on market efficiency, financial development, technological
readiness and infrastructure. However, it ranks below peers in terms of labor market efficiency,
access to health care, and primary education. Panama’s governance indicators also compare
favorably with most of its South American peers, particularly in terms of government effectiveness
and regulatory quality, though there is room for improvement as regards control of corruption and
rule of law.

Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Panama (NBP) was subject to
the transitional procedures with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement, which was approved on June
30, 2000, and expired on March 29, 2002. The transitional procedures required a review of the NBP’s
external audit mechanism only. The assessment was completed on July 12, 2001 and concluded that
NBP’s external audit mechanism was at the time adequate.

Nonfinancial Relations
XI.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
Panama uses the U.S. dollar as the primary means of payment in the local economy. Its national
currency (balboa) is issued in the form of coins only and serves as a unit of account. The exchange
rate of the balboa is fixed at B 1 per U.S. dollar. Panama has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
XII.
Last Article IV Consultation
The 2011 Article IV consultation was concluded on February 22, 2012. Panama is on the standard 12
month consultation cycle. The 2011 Consultation was delayed in order to coincide with the Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) process.
XIII.
FSAP: A first-time FSAP was concluded in September 2011. It confirmed the banking
sector’s strength and resilience to potential shocks, noting nonetheless that data gaps prevent a full
analysis of macro-financial linkages.
XIV.
Technical Assistance
Panama is a large recipient of technical assistance (TA) directly through the Fund or CAPTACDR.
Latest assistance concentrated in the area of the national accounts, both on output compilation and
improvement of registering financial services. Assistance in the fiscal area included work on
government financial statistics and steps necessary to implement requirements under the GFSM
2001 manual. Assistance in the area of the balance of payments included work on the appropriate
classification of reserves. In the financial area, TA concentrated mostly on improving data
compilation on a regional level, and of non-financial groups, as well as on IFRS adoption.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of December 18, 2012)

ASSESSMENT OF DATA ADEQUACY FOR SURVEILLANCE
General: Data provided to the Fund has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
The accuracy, timeliness, and publication of economic statistics has improved, but weaknesses in
national accounts, government finance, and balance of payment statistics need to be addressed.
Real Sector: Although the timeliness of real sector data provision has improved, the data are often
subject to sizable revisions. The World Bank is supporting a project for changing the base year of the
national accounts to 2007, which started in the second half of 2010 and should be completed by the
third quarter of 2013. The IMF national accounts technical assistance mission conducted in 2010-11
noted slow progress in expanding coverage of financial activity as well as the overestimation of the
deflator used to calculate the financial services output at constant prices. During 2011-2012, progress
was made in compiling financial and insurance services following the 2008 System of National Accounts
(2008 SNA), as well as in broadening the coverage of household output, employment, compensation of
employees, and mixed income in informal activities for 2007-2008. Quarterly national accounts and the
monthly economic activity index have benefited from the use of monthly VAT records as source data,
and from the correct application of the proportional Denton method for aligning quarterly data to
annual data (reducing further revisions) and ARIMA X-12 for seasonally-adjusting the quarterly series.
Government finance statistics: Further efforts are needed to improve the quality of fiscal data. Apart
from timeliness, data consistency in terms of transfers between public sector units should be improved;
and the coverage of the public enterprises should be made universal. Since September 2004, the
operational balance of the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) was excluded from the official definition of the
nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) used for fiscal policy purposes. Information on the ACP is only available
in the Annual Report posted in its website (www.pancanal.com) on a fiscal year basis. There is a need to
ensure a consistent and timely flow of ACP statistics on a calendar year basis. Moreover, in 2011, three
public enterprises have been excluded from the NFPS accounts and public debt (Tocumen International
Airport, ETESA, an electricity distribution company, and ENA, the National Highway company). It would
also be necessary to compile and disseminate information on these entities in a timely fashion. The
recent decree establishing a sovereign Savings Fund of Panama mandated reporting of deferred
payment schemes (e.g. turnkey projects) in budget documentation.
The authorities are receiving technical assistance from the IMF Statistics Department (STA) to implement
the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) and the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD)
conducted a mission on observance of fiscal standards and codes (ROSC) in October 2005. The
authorities, however, cannot elaborate fiscal statistics in accordance with GFSM 2001 without a priori
reforming public accounting. In 2011-12, FAD assessed Panama’s progress in implementing the Single
Treasury Account (STU) and improving government accountability and internal audit. Further assistance
on making the STU operational was received from CAPTAC during 2012. While the authorities took
important steps in improving these areas, further work would be needed to achieve compliance with
international best practices. The August 2012 CAPTAC report on fiscal statistics for financial
programming also emphasized the need to increase the information and analysis of turnkey projects’
impact on fiscal sustainability.

Monetary and Financial Statistics: Panama regularly reports monetary data for depository corporations
using the standardized report forms (SRFs) for publication in the International Financial Statistics.
Panama participated in a regional project for harmonizing monetary and financial statistics in Central
America and the Dominican Republic, supported by CAPTAC. The aim was to facilitate cross-country
comparison and regional analysis. The second stage of the harmonization project developed a work
program to expand the institutional coverage to include the missing other depository corporations and
all other financial corporations (OFCs). The authorities have recently submitted test SRF data for the
OFCs, which are being reviewed by STA. Panama does not report Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) to
STA. Nevertheless, the authorities informed STA that they are working on their compilation. Data gaps
prevent a deeper analysis of systemic risks as the authorities do not collect adequate data on real estate
prices, loan write-offs, loan-to-value ratios, and leverage indicators for households and corporates.
Balance of payments: Weaknesses in foreign trade flows calculations, particularly those involving the
Colon Free Zone, need to be addressed. Substantial changes in the composition of trade flows over the
last decade render the current methodology to estimate volume indices obsolete. Quarterly data are
available with a delay of about one quarter, and are subject to revisions thereafter. Revised estimates in
key trade and investment data may result in substantial revisions of the current account of the balance of
payments. These revisions may reflect improvements in coverage, but they also suggest that there is
room for improvement in quality control procedures. Data are not yet available on nonfinancial private
sector debt and transactions involving financial derivatives, resulting in large swings in errors and
omissions. Data on outward FDI and repatriation of profit and dividends from these investments are not
yet being collected, implying that the current account deficit and the International Investment Position
(IIP) are likely being overestimated. Quarterly IIP data have been compiled since 2002, and annual data
are available since 1998. The definition of international reserves is currently being revised with TA
support from STA, to ensure that the reserve assets reported by the National Bank of Panama are
consistent with those published by the Contraloria, and that they meet the criteria defined in the
international reserves template. STA also recommends that the Contraloria should be the only agency in
charge of compiling and disseminating international reserves data.
DATA STANDARDS AND QUALITY
Panama has participated in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since December 2000,
but the metadata need to be updated. Following an SDDS assessment mission conducted by STA in April
2011, the authorities have a work program aimed at meeting the requirements for Panama’s subscription
to the SDDS. A data ROSC was published in October 2006.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 13, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Panama
On January 25, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Panama. 1
Background
Panama’s growth performance continues to exceed expectations, buoyed by the Panama Canal
expansion and large public infrastructure projects. Annual real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
growth averaged about 9 percent over the past five years, the highest in Latin America.
Unemployment is at historic lows, and the output gap has closed. Rapid economic growth and
stronger social safety nets have helped reduce poverty. Over the medium-term, recent and
forthcoming Free-Trade Agreements with major trading partners are expected to boost trade in
services and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The recent creation of a Sovereign Wealth Fund
to save additional revenue from the expanded Canal aims at further strengthening the
economy’s resilience to external shocks.
Panama’s economy expanded by 10.6 percent in 2011, and continued to grow at the same
pace in the first three quarters of 2012. Construction, commerce, and transportation, storage
and communications have been the most dynamic sectors. Canal traffic and activity in the
Colón Free Zone have been supported by strong demand from South America and emerging
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

Asia. Rising world commodity prices and domestic demand pressures have kept inflation at
relatively high levels through 2011 and most of 2012. Headline and core inflation started
declining in the third quarter, mostly owing to lower food and domestic services price pressures,
with inflation in 2012 projected at 5 percent (year-on-year). Panama’s financial sector remains
well-prepared to absorb even large external shocks; banks remain well-capitalized, liquid and
profitable. After widening to 12.8 percent of GDP in 2011, the current account deficit improved
somewhat in the first nine months of 2012. A sharp improvement in the goods and services
balances was almost offset by a deterioration in the income balance, associated with a 56
percent increase in FDI flows.
Panama’s baseline outlook is positive, with broadly balanced risks. Implementation of large
public infrastructure projects and strong domestic demand in the context of loose imported
monetary conditions are expected to continue to support growth and domestic demand.
Overheating pressures would moderate as public investment unwinds. At the same time, the
global economy remains weak, and downside risks have intensified. Panama’s trade and
financial openness increases the country’s vulnerability to external shocks, though strong
domestic fundamentals would mitigate their impact. A key medium-term challenge is to ensure
the transition to more sustainable and inclusive growth, including through further improvements
in education and training.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors commended Panama’s impressive economic performance over the
past decade, underpinned by strong fundamentals and sound policies. Large public investments
are expected to continue to drive growth this year, despite a weak external environment.
Directors encouraged the authorities to take advantage of the favorable conjuncture to
strengthen policies and buffers. They agreed that, in the near term, policies need to be geared
toward building up fiscal space and enhancing crisis prevention tools. Going forward, a key
challenge will be to foster sustained and more inclusive growth.
Directors saw merit in a tighter fiscal stance for 2013–14 to forestall overheating and
recommended keeping overall deficits below the revised ceilings. Further improvements in tax
administration and expenditure management could support the needed adjustment. More
broadly, Directors agreed that frequent revisions to the legal deficit ceilings could undermine the
credibility of the fiscal framework. They also agreed that the recently-established sovereign
wealth fund would help reduce policy pro-cyclicality and further shield the economy from shocks
going forward.
Considering Panama’s extensive financial linkages, Directors emphasized the importance of
further strengthening the financial safety net. They welcomed the progress in implementing the

3
recommendations from the 2011 Financial Sector Assessment Program, including the plans to
establish a facility for emergency liquidity assistance. Directors also acknowledged recent steps
to enhance the monitoring of systemic risks and noted the importance of closing existing data
gaps. Improving the supervision of non-banks, strengthening the mandate of the Council of
Supervisors, and further developing macroprudential tools remain important policy priorities.
Directors also welcomed the ongoing efforts to upgrade tax transparency and the legal
framework for combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
Directors welcomed recent and prospective trade agreements between Panama and its major
trading partners that should help support inward foreign direct investment and ensure sustained
growth as large public projects unwind. Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that the
projected current account deficit and external debt paths are consistent with medium-term
external sustainability but that further appreciation of the real exchange rate could undermine
recent gains in external competitiveness.
Directors underscored the importance of continued efforts to reduce poverty and inequality, and
to tackle youth unemployment. In this context, ongoing training and education reforms should
help alleviate skills mismatches, while targeted assistance to the poorest through conditional
cash transfers should improve living standards in rural and indigenous areas.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mr. Nogueira Batista, Executive Director,
Mr. Oliveira Lima, Alternate Executive Director and Mr. Maciá, Advisor
on Panama
January 25, 2013
1.
Our authorities thank the IMF staff for their continued assistance and advice on
economic policy and other related issues.
2.
Panama’s economic growth remains solid despite the unstable world economy. Real
GDP growth is estimated to have reached 11 percent in 2012, one of the highest in the world,
outperforming by far all other Latin American economies. This growth is supported by the
ongoing Panama Canal expansion, the execution of an ambitious public investment plan,
increasing FDI inflows and the consolidation of the country as a financial and logistics hub.
The authorities expect GDP growth to be 8.5 percent in 2013.
3.
High economic growth rates have led to rapid increases in employment and wages.
The unemployment rate currently stands at 4 percent – an all-time low. Poverty levels have
experienced a significant decline. According to the most recent figures, extreme poverty
declined from 15.3 percent in 2009 to 10.4 percent in 2012, while general poverty declined
from 33.4 to 25.8 percent. The strong economic performance and the effectiveness of
conditional cash transfers have served as catalysts for the reduction in poverty levels.
4.
Inflation was moderate in 2012 in face of a more benign external scenario of lower
food and fuel prices. CPI inflation (end-of-year) declined from 6.3 percent in 2011 to
4.6 percent in 2012. The current account deficit decreased slightly from 12.8 percent in 2011
to approximately 12 percent of GDP in 2012. For 2013, this figure is expected to be closer to
11 percent given lower capital-goods imports as large public projects begin to unwind and
the expansion of the Panama Canal is more than 50 percent complete. External transactions
are expected to grow with the implementation of the US-Panama Trade Promotion
Agreement, the free trade agreement with Canada and the association agreement with the
European Union.
5.
Fiscal policy has remained prudent in 2012. Given the still fragile global economy
and concerns related to possible external shocks, the fiscal deficit ceilings were revised up to
2.9 and 2.8 percent of GDP for 2012 and 2013 respectively. These modifications reveal the
authorities’ readiness to respond to a less favorable international scenario. Nonetheless, they
remain committed to a fiscal deficit close to 2.5 percent of GDP, considerably lower than the
new ceiling for 2012, and in line with IMF staff’s recommendations. The public debt to GDP
ratio has been decreasing for more than a decade and is estimated to have fallen to 39.5
percent in 2012. Further development of the domestic capital market remains a priority going
forward. The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) is in preliminary discussions with an
international clearing agency with the objective of making domestic public debt and other
asset classes tradable in international markets, thus increasing their accessibility and
expanding the investor base.

2
6.
Public revenues continued to rise in 2012 as a result of the implementation of fiscal
reforms, the ample utilization of fiscal cash registers for businesses and the recent creation of
a large taxpayers’ unit. Ongoing steps to strengthen the tax directorate (Dirección General de
Ingresos) should allow it to evolve into a more autonomous and independent tax revenue
authority, enhancing tax collection effectiveness and reinforcing oversight. Preliminary
figures show that total current revenues increased by 16.1 percent in 2012 relative to 2011.
Likewise, tax revenue increased by 26.9 percent.
7.
The banking system has remained reliable, well capitalized and resilient to external
shocks. Capital adequacy ratios are well above statutory thresholds and, in spite of the
growth in private sector credit, non-performing loans remain at low levels and are well
provisioned. Furthermore, considerable progress has been made on the FSAP
recommendations. The authorities, assisted by CAPTAC-DR, have elaborated draft
regulations on operational risk, supervision of conglomerates, and international financial
reporting standards.
8.
With the support of the IMF, the Government is in the process of designing a
contingent liquidity facility for the national banking system. A high-level committee
comprised of officials from the MEF, the General Manager of the National Bank of Panama
and the Superintendent of Banks, with guidance from IMF staff and an international
consultant, will design the facility and move toward consensus building with key
stakeholders to fulfill this goal in 2013.
9.
Panama has continued to strengthen its legal framework in compliance with the
Global Forum of the OECD. The country signed double taxation agreements with the Czech
Republic and the United Arab Emirates, bringing the total number of signed agreements to
15. The authorities will propose legislation to enhance the control on bearer shares and
prevent money laundering. The new legislation will require bearer shares to be registered
with a custodian and beneficial ownership to be disclosed. It will be presented to the Cabinet
for approval shortly. Similarly, anti-money laundering and terrorist financing legislation will
be strengthened in compliance with the Financial Action Task Force guidelines.
10.
The latest credit rating reviews for Panama reaffirmed the country’s investment grade
status. In 2012, Fitch maintained Panama’s BBB investment grade rating with a stable
outlook. Meanwhile, Standard & Poor’s upgraded Panama’s credit rating from BBB- to BBB
with a stable outlook and Moody’s also upgraded the sovereign debt rating to Baa2 from
Baa3. The rating agencies have recognized the country’s strong macroeconomic
performance, stable growth perspectives and the declining public debt burden.
11.
In conclusion, Panama’s economy is fundamentally solid with sustainable
macroeconomic performance and the ability to continue with an ambitious investment
program that will increase potential output and the country’s medium and long term growth
prospects.
