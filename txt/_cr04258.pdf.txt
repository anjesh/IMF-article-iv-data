SOLOMON ISLANDS
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2004 Consultation with the Solomon Islands
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Steven Dunaway and Michael Hadjimichael
July 1, 2004


The 2004 Article IV Consultation discussions for the Solomon Islands were held in
Honiara during April 27–May 6. The staff team comprised Messrs. Orsmond
(head), Dalgic (EP), and Marciniak (all APD). Mr. Francis (OED) participated in
several of the concluding meetings.



The mission met with Prime Minister Kemakeza, Finance Minister Zama, Central
Bank of Solomon Islands Governor Houenipwela, other senior officials of the
government, and representatives from the parliament, donor community, private
sector, civil society, and the local press.



The Solomon Islands accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3,
and 4 in 1979. However, in June 2000, exchange restrictions were introduced that
were later intensified. These restrictions, which imposed delays on the availability of
foreign exchange for current international payments, were not approved at the
conclusion of the last Article IV consultation in January 2003. Since that time, the
restrictions have been removed, and the Solomon Islands again maintains an
exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions.



Data quality, coverage, provision, and timeliness are weak, notably in the real, fiscal,
and external sectors. These difficulties impede economic analysis and effective
surveillance of policies in the Solomon Islands. The Solomon Islands subscribes to
neither the GDDS nor the SDDS.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic Background
•

Solomon Islands’ economy deteriorated after the outbreak of conflict in mid-1999.
The level of real GDP subsequently declined by one-quarter, exports halved, and inflation
increased to 15 percent. In addition, the budget deficit increased to over 10 percent of
GDP, the government defaulted on virtually all domestic and external debt obligations,
and international reserves (net of the external arrears) were fully exhausted.

•

Policy performance improved markedly following the arrival of a multinational
intervention force in mid-2003 that has restored law and order. The budget deficit in
2003 was reduced to 1½ percent of GDP reflecting an increase in domestic revenue
collections and expenditure restraint, especially for budget payments to ex-militants and
the civil service wage bill. Large donor grants have been used to fund development and
other expenditures. A budget surplus of 4 percent of GDP is projected for 2004.

•

Economic activity has started to respond to the more favorable law and order and
policy environment. Real GDP is estimated to have grown by 5 percent in 2003 backed
by a rising level of exports, and there are signs that private investment is recovering. The
level of international reserves has increased sharply, and inflation has fallen back to
single-digit levels, reflecting in part stability of the nominal exchange rate.

Key Issues and Staff Recommendations
•

The main challenge is to move beyond the focus on stabilization and implement
policies to underpin sustained per capita growth in the rural and urban areas. Key
fiscal, monetary, and structural reforms will be needed to achieve these objectives.

•

The projected 2004 budget surplus is consistent with improving the macroeconomic
situation. To shore up medium-term prospects, tax administration should be further
improved and the pressure for tax exemptions resisted. Maintaining control over low
priority expenditures is essential to fund a needed sharp increase in social, development,
and operations and maintenance outlays. The regularization of government debt and
arrears obligations within a sustainable medium-term fiscal framework is also important.

•

Monetary and exchange rate policies should focus on containing inflationary
pressures and increasing reserves. Upward pressure on the exchange rate arising from
the large aid flows should continue to be resisted in order to build reserves. At the same
time, the central bank should stand ready to sterilize the aid flows and absorb the high
level of excess liquidity if needed to keep inflation in check as the economy recovers.

•

Structural reform should include streamlining licensing procedures, aiding rural
production, strengthening the enterprise sector, and improving governance.

I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Economic performance in the Solomon Islands deteriorated during the last
decade. In the early 1990s, real GDP growth averaged 8 percent a year, driven in large part
130
130
by an unsustainably high level of logging.
Real per capita GDP
(1991=100)
However, at the same time, the budget deficit
120
120
increased as the revenue base was eroded by
110
110
tax exemptions, and the civil service wage
100
100
bill grew rapidly. In 1996, the government
90
90
defaulted on its domestic debt obligations,
80 and the level of per capita income declined.
80
Economic pressures increased further when

log prices and export volumes declined in the

aftermath
of the Asian crisis in 1997–98. In

(Est.)
response, and in line with Fund staff advice at
the time, the government prepared a wide-ranging reform program focused on fiscal
consolidation, but program implementation was not sustained.
2.
Conditions worsened further after violence between the residents of the
Guadalcanal and Malaita islands erupted in mid-1999. Subsequently, much of the basic
infrastructure was destroyed, real GDP declined by one-quarter, and exports halved. The
budget deficit increased to over 10 percent of GDP as the government granted numerous
import duty exemptions and made large payments, often under duress, to militants that under
a peace agreement had been employed onto the police force. These largely squeezed out cash
payments for social, development, and debt-service outlays. In the absence of a forceful
response by the government to the deteriorating law and order and economic situation, donor
support was largely withdrawn. By end-2002 international reserves (net of external debt and
import-related arrears) had been virtually exhausted, despite a 30 percent depreciation of the
exchange rate and the intensification of exchange restrictions, the rate of inflation had
increased to 15 percent, and poverty indicators were deteriorating.
3.
At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation on January 24, 2003,
Directors expressed concern at the poor state of the Solomon Islands economy. They
stressed the urgency of restoring law and order and implementing policy reforms to arrest the
deterioration of the economy. Directors called for strong revenue and expenditure measures,
highlighting especially control over the wage bill and the large payments to the ex-militants.
They advised that the central bank resist efforts to finance the budget deficit, continue
frequent downward adjustments to the exchange rate, and closely supervise the financial
sector. Directors also urged that the exchange restrictions imposed in mid-2000 be removed
as conditions permit.
4.
Facing continued economic decline and growing internal unrest in the first half
of 2003, a nine-nation, Australian-led intervention force of over 2,000 military and
police officers arrived in July, at the request of Prime Minister Kemakeza. The Regional

-5-

Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) quickly restored law and order in
Honiara and in the outlying regions. Australia and New Zealand also placed their nationals in
key line-positions in the judiciary and major budget departments to aid in the stabilization
effort. During a development partners meeting in Honiara held in November 2003, in which
Fund staff participated, donors committed sizable grants to help rehabilitate the economy.
Australia has also paid the arrears owed to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.
5.
The government has moved rapidly to stabilize budgetary finances since the
arrival of RAMSI. The budget finished the year with a deficit of just 1½ percent of GDP,
35
35
compared with 10 percent in 2002. This result

was mainly attributable to the marked

strengthening of tax collections aided by an

payments to the ex-militants, greater scrutiny

Economic activity has started to respond to the more favorable law and order
and policy environment. Real GDP grew by an estimated 5 percent in 2003, helped by
strong fish, copra, and cocoa production. Foreign investors have expressed renewed interest
in major natural resource projects, and private sector credit growth has increased as lending
interest rates have declined. Overall credit growth, however, has remained low as the large
aid flows and the budget surplus since mid-2003 have increased the level of government
deposits held at the central bank.

volumes and world commodity prices, the slow pick up in import demand, large aid flows, and
the remonetization of the economy. Inflation has fallen back to single-digit levels, as the
supply of food has increased and the nominal effective exchange rate has stabilized. Urban
employment is reportedly increasing, although unemployment remains high.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. The Medium-Term Framework
8.
The policy dialogue during the mission focused on how to use the window of
opportunity provided by the high level of donor assistance to support macroeconomic
stability, sustain private-sector-led growth, and improve social indicators. The
authorities have welcomed the military, financial, and technical assistance they have received
and, following the restoration of law and order, have taken early action to ensure that this
assistance was used in a way that has been consistent with previous Fund advice. The
government has completed its National Economic Recovery, Reform, and Development Plan,
and established three tasks forces covering the restoration of law and order, economic reform,
and infrastructure and government services, which have also completed their reports. Taken
together, these documents outline a broad medium-term agenda to lift per capita income,
focused on the rehabilitation of the economy (especially in the rural areas) and strengthened
governance and financial management (Box 1).
9.
A major uncertainty in crafting a medium-term strategy is estimating the level
and time period of donor assistance. The general purpose budget grants being provided by
Australia and New Zealand are scheduled to end in 2004 and 2006 respectively, although
some of this assistance may be extended. The European Union has committed development
grants amounting to $100 million, but the disbursement period is uncertain. The Asian
Development Bank has fielded a mission to restart a $10 million lending program they
suspended in 2002, focused on rehabilitating transport infrastructure, and disbursements

-7-

might start by end-2004. While they have no lending plans, the World Bank is providing
grants to strengthen capacity in key government institutions.
10.
Notwithstanding this uncertainty and the significant impediments to private
sector investment and growth (Box 2 and the accompanying Selected Issues paper), the
authorities and staff agreed that the growth of real GDP during 2004–09 could average
4½–5 percent a year (2 percent per capita) provided appropriate policies are
implemented. In the medium-term scenario and debt-sustainability analysis discussed,
inflation would remain in low single digits and the level of international reserves slowly
increase, assuming that fiscal and monetary discipline is maintained. Economic growth would
initially be driven by donor-financed public investment, and later by rising private investment
and exports provided an early start is made to reducing the current regulatory burden and
implementing other critical structural reforms. The current account deficit as a share of GDP
would gradually decline as exports increase and the level of project-related imports falls
back. Assuming the budget deficit averages ½ percent of GDP and the level of new foreign
borrowing is contained, which would be appropriate in view of the large fiscal uncertainties
and limited absorptive capacity beyond the large grant-financed development spending, the
government debt ratio would decline from 100 percent in 2003 to 65 percent of GDP by
2009. External debt would decline to 42 percent of GDP and the servicing burden would
remain sustainable, although it was recognized that economic shocks could have a major
impact on the projected debt dynamics.1
B. Fiscal Policy
11.
To achieve these objectives, the authorities stated that their first priority is to
adhere to a fiscal framework for 2004 that can restore confidence in the government’s
ability to manage its finances. Following the first of their quarterly reviews of actual
budgetary developments, the authorities project a budget surplus (measured on an accrual
basis) of 4 percent of GDP, significantly higher than the 2 percent surplus forecast in the
2004 budget that was passed last November. This result is mainly attributable to
overperformance on revenue collections in recent months (mainly on sales tax collections),
reflecting the recent faster-than-expected pace of economic and export growth, successful
efforts to bring businesses back into the tax net, and collection of tax arrears under the
amnesty (that was closed at end-2003). The authorities shared staff concerns in regard to the
one-off nature of some of these receipts and, more generally, the uncertainty surrounding the
future level of revenue collections. In the draft Supplementary Appropriations Bill that was
subsequently passed by the parliament, rather than undertaking new expenditure obligations,

1

The medium-term scenario and debt-sustainability analysis are detailed in the Appendix,
and recent trends in social indicators relative to the MDGs are outlined in Annex II.

-8-

the government proposed that the higher projected surplus be used to reduce the large stock
of expenditure arrears. The staff fully supported this position.
12.
The staff welcomed the advances that have been made in reprioritizing
expenditures in 2004. Progress has been achieved in cleansing the civil service payroll of
ghosts, restricting allowances, demobilizing around 800 ex-militants from the police force,
and initiating a New Zealand-funded audit of education sector employment. The authorities
noted that the savings realized to date had enabled them to raise the nominal wages of the
remaining civil servants by 5 percent. In regard to other outlays, they noted that the pace of
spending on nonwage social and development expenditures has been slower than envisaged
due to low absorptive capacity, but is expected to pick up shortly.
13.
The authorities outlined their approach to strengthen medium-term fiscal
finances taking into account the ongoing large rehabilitation expenditures, expected
decline in donor flows, and rising operations and maintenance spending associated with
the new development projects. They highlighted in particular the following aspects:
•

To strengthen budget management, the authorities have started to prepare a
medium-term fiscal strategy. The staff suggested this be set within an explicit
macroeconomic and fiscal financing framework.

•

The authorities have initiated a multi-year revenue mobilization effort to widen the
tax base and strengthen administration. They indicated that they intend to focus on
registration of businesses, training of staff, and increased use of audits, utilizing
technical assistance from the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center
(PFTAC).2 In this regard, the staff urged that the future tax base not be eroded
through income-tax exemptions for existing and new foreign or domestic investments.

•

In addition to the efforts underway to reorganize the civil service, the authorities
stressed their intention to further rationalize expenditures over time. The staff and
authorities agreed that the priority should be placed on reallocating spending toward
basic health and education, inter-island transport, rural infrastructure and extension
services, and operations and maintenance outlays. It will be important that the actual
level of development spending is continually monitored and that these outlays remain
focused on the medium-term priorities.

14.
Resources will also be required to regularize and reduce external and domestic
debt and arrears obligations. The authorities indicated that they are committed to finalize a
rescheduling agreement with their domestic creditors (mainly the commercial banks, the
2

There is probably little room to raise tax rates in the Solomon Islands because, with the
exception of excises, rates are already on the high side relative to other Pacific islands.

-9-

National Provident Fund, and the central bank) in the next few months, with the terms of the
agreement guided by the authorities’ intention to ensure that total external and domestic debt
servicing not exceed 15 percent of projected domestic revenue. Thereafter, the authorities
intend to discuss with their commercial and some bilateral creditors plans to reduce external
debt levels and servicing costs.3 In regard to the stock of expenditure arrears (the bulk of
which are due to utility companies, for wage-deductions due to pension, credit, and trade
unions, and to trade creditors), once their legitimacy has been verified, these are expected to
be paid down as circumstances permit.
15.
The authorities discussed their plans to establish a federal structure in the
Solomon Islands that would include a significant degree of budget decentralization as a
means to decrease inter-island tensions. In response to concerns expressed earlier by the
donor community and the staff, the authorities noted that they would proceed only very
cautiously. The authorities generally agreed with the staff that the national budget should first
be stabilized, and an expenditure monitoring system maintained by the Ministry of Finance of
provincial revenue and expenditure be put in place, before implementing this plan, and that
provinces should not be allowed to run budget deficits.
C. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Issues
16.
The discussion of monetary and exchange rate policies focused on the
Governor’s annual monetary statement, which was delivered on April 8. The staff agreed
with the main objectives for 2004 set out in this statement, namely to maintain inflation in
single-digit levels and increase international reserves to at least five months of nonproject
imports. The staff pointed out the significant risks to meeting these objectives posed by the
high level of excess reserves in the banking system (roughly 20 percent of deposits) and the
large government deposits at the central bank representing aid flows for investment projects.
The authorities acknowledged these risks, but they did not expect a sharp increase in private
sector lending or a sudden drawdown in government deposits. Should either of these events
occur, the central bank would move quickly to absorb liquidity in the system. Instruments at
their disposal include changes in reserve requirements, direct controls on lending, and open
market operations. The authorities noted that their ability to conduct open market operations
will be enhanced once the government’s debt restructuring plan has been implemented.

3

Most external debt is owed to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (57 percent of
the total), Taiwan Province of China (16 percent), and two commercial creditors (10 percent).
The authorities have been in contact with the external creditors in which they are in arrears,
and informed them of their intention to discuss soon an agreed repayment arrangement.

- 10 -

17.
The staff team supported the central bank’s policy to resist upward pressure on
the exchange rate arising from the large aid flows in order to build reserves. Partial price
and recent trade data available suggest that the current level of the exchange rate is broadly
competitive, although recent export volumes have been more determined by domestic supply
constraints rather than demand factors.4 With the restoration of law and order and
improvements in inter-island transportation, exports of traditional and new products are
expected to continue to increase. Over time, as aid flows diminish and imports rise in line
with the economic recovery, the staff recommended that downward pressure on the exchange
rate should not be resisted. The authorities generally concurred with this advice, adding that,
in the current environment, they are not considering major changes in the present exchange
rate regime, such as a move to dollarization. The authorities gradually liberalized the
exchange system during 2003, and the staff team welcomed the recent elimination of the
remaining restrictions on current transactions.5
18.
The authorities noted that they have taken several steps to strengthen the
financial sector. The central bank has been vigilant in ensuring that the commercial banks
comply with prudential guidelines, and bank profitability has improved since law and order
was restored (Box 3 and the accompanying Selected Issues paper). In line with the widening
of its supervisory powers in mid-2002, the central bank has also acted to address difficulties
in major nonfinancial institutions. Following an on-site inspection in late-2003 and aided by
technical assistance from the World Bank, the poor asset quality of the National Provident
Fund (NPF) is being gradually addressed. The High Court has approved a central bank
request to assume management of the small and insolvent Development Bank of Solomon
Islands (DBSI), and the staff team suggested that the operations of the DBSI be wound up.
D. Structural Reforms and Other Issues
19.
There was widespread agreement that structural reform will be critical to lift
private sector activity and employment. Increasing attention is being focused on promoting
new investment and employment, especially in potential growth sectors like gold and mining,
palm oil production, and tourism, as well as by local manufacturing concerns. The

4

The real exchange rate is estimated to be 20 percent below its level before the outbreak of
the conflict in 1999 and 10 percent below its level in the mid-1990s. The staff’s REER
estimates are tentative given the absence since mid-2000 of comprehensive price data.
5

Effective April 2004, the central bank raised the indicative minimum approval limit on all
outward payments from SI$5,000 to SI$25,000, and confirmed to staff that, for transactions
above this limit, this approval is necessary only for the purpose of checking the bona fide
nature of transactions. They also raised the overnight limit on commercial bank foreign
exchange holdings from SI$2 million to SI$3 million.

- 11 -

discussions with the private sector indicated the importance of streamlining licensing
procedures, especially by the Foreign Investment Board, and relaxing the limit on foreign
labor permits, to further this process. Encouraging small-scale production and inter-island
distribution of potential new export crops such as vanilla, teak, and seaweed were widely
cited as necessary to increase employment and income generation in the rural areas. The
authorities noted that they are preparing a strategy to ensure the sustainable development and
management of the forestry and fisheries sectors, and a policy to address land ownership
issues. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank are providing technical assistance in
several structural reform areas, including through the World Bank’s Foreign Investment
Advisory Service (FIAS).
20.
The staff team pressed for reform of public enterprises in order to reestablish
reliable supply and improve the quality of utility services. The authorities stated that price
increases have already been undertaken in some enterprises, but acknowledged that further
efforts will be needed. These could include publishing annual reports, improving the
regulatory environment, capital investments, strengthening governance, and rationalizing the
workforce. The staff called for the reinvigoration of the enterprise corporatization and
privatization program that has stalled in recent years, noting that any proceeds should be used
to pay down government debt.
21.
The authorities confirmed their intention to continue to promote an open trade
regime. Starting in 1998, the authorities have reduced tariff rates from five bands that ranged
from 5–70 percent to three bands that range from 5–20 percent. The weighted average tariff
now stands at 11 percent, and there are no significant nontariff barriers. There are several
export taxes, although the export tax on logs is the only large revenue earner. The authorities
noted that the log export tax has traditionally served as a substitute for the weaknesses in tax
administration over these companies, and the staff urged that this policy be reviewed as the
tax administration procedures are strengthened. In the context of the Pacific Island Countries
Trade Agreement (PICTA), which was signed in 2003, the Solomon Islands has committed to
eliminate tariffs for trade in goods between members by 2016 at the latest.6 The Solomon
Islands does not face any major problems in accessing export markets, and is rated three
under the Fund’s 10-point trade restrictiveness index.7

6

In July 2003, the Solomon Islands also ratified the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic
Relations (PACER) that is intended eventually to create a free trade area and regional
integration between the Pacific islands and Australia and New Zealand.

7

The rating could be improved once detailed information on the tariff schedule has been
received from the authorities.

The authorities stated that several initiatives are underway to strengthen
governance and transparency, and to reduce corruption. In addition to the improvements
in law, justice, and policing, donor assistance is being provided to strengthen key government
institutions and watchdog bodies such as the Auditor General and Ombudsman. Budgetary
and Cabinet requirements and procedures are also being addressed. The staff team noted that
better governance and transparency will assist in ensuring a level playing field within the
private sector, and welcomed the intention to establish the Solomon Islands Leadership
Integrity Commission, utilizing external technical assistance.
23.
The authorities have prepared a legal framework to address anti-money
laundering (AML), although they have not started enforcing AML procedures and a
counter-financing of terrorism bill is still in draft form. In response to staff queries, the
authorities explained that their AML legislation comprises three laws that require banks and
cash dealers (insurance companies, casinos, and trusts) to report to a Commission any
transaction exceeding SI$15,000 that they feel is suspicious.8 However, this Commission has
not yet been established. The authorities have recently completed the questionnaire on
AML/CFT that was prepared by MFD, and the staff is following up on this response. The
authorities noted that local staff has benefited from training abroad in AML/CFT
enforcement, and that they are seeking PFTAC assistance to review and assist
implementation of the relevant legislation in this area.
24.
The mission stressed that macroeconomic analysis continues to be hampered by
the poor statistical database. The National Statistical Office (NSO) ceased compiling real
and nominal national accounts estimates in 1994 and, until very recently, price data in 2000.
The only data available have been partial estimates assembled by the central bank. PFTAC is
preparing a plan to rehabilitate the NSO and improve the quality and timeliness of data
collection and reporting, and the World Bank is also undertaking a capacity building
initiative in this area. The authorities agreed that progress under this plan is a priority.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Economic performance in the Solomon Islands has shown a marked turnaround
since the last consultation was concluded in early 2003. The economy has started to
respond to the more favorable law and order conditions and improved budgetary finances,
with growth accelerating and inflation falling to single digits. Nonetheless, the situation
remains fragile, and the main challenge for the government is to move beyond the initial
focus on stabilization, and implement policies that will reduce the risks to the medium-term
outlook and underpin a sustained improvement in per capita growth.

8

The three laws are the Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Act (2002), the Mutual
Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (2002), and the Financial Institutions Act (1998).

- 13 -

26.
Key fiscal, monetary, and structural reforms will be needed to achieve these
objectives. Budget finances have to be further strengthened so that the programmed increases
in social and development outlays (including for critical infrastructure) can be sustained
while at the same time the high government debt ratio is set on a firm downward path. Price
stability must be maintained in the face of the resumption of economic activity and ongoing
large donor flows. In addition, deep structural reform is needed so the private sector can play
an increasing role in boosting investment and promoting employment in the urban and rural
areas, while generating sufficient foreign exchange earnings to offset the projected increase in
imports as the economy recovers.
27.
The revised budget surplus targeted by the authorities for 2004 is consistent with
further improving the macroeconomic situation. In view of the one-time nature of the
recent revenue overperformance and the ongoing budget uncertainties, including the level of
external grants from major donors after 2004, expenditure allocations should not be ratcheted
up in line with these collections. It is appropriate that the Supplementary Appropriations Bill
proposed to use the bulk of the projected revenue overperformance in 2004 to pay down
wage-related and other arrears.
28.
Expenditure reprioritization is critical to sustain economic growth and improve
social indicators. Accelerating the pace of civil service reform is key to strengthening
capacity in the public sector. While progress has been made, continued efforts are needed to
rationalize the civil service, with an increase in the skills capacity while reducing costs in
nonpriority areas. Maintaining control over salary increases will be vital. If any further
general wage increase is contemplated, this should be undertaken only in the context of
realized savings in the rest of the wage bill. Priority should be placed on reallocating
spending toward basic health and education, rural infrastructure and extension services, and
operations and maintenance outlays.
29.
Given the large ongoing expenditure pressures to rehabilitate and restructure
the economy, it is critical that the fiscal decisions are consistent with medium-term
sustainability. A comprehensive medium-term fiscal framework should be developed and
updated regularly as circumstances evolve. This should include an analysis of actual
development project spending and its operations and maintenance components. The
authorities’ debt restructuring plan and strategy to repay arrears are also appropriate.
30.
Strengthened revenue performance over the medium term will be required to
fund new productive expenditures and reduce the high dependency on donor flows.
Revenue efforts should primarily focus on widening the tax base and strengthening tax and
customs administration, which would provide an opportunity for a review of the current
range of export taxes. To ensure a level playing field and prevent erosion of the future tax
base, no new income-tax exemptions for foreign or domestic investments should be granted
and consideration could be given to abolishing existing tax and customs exemptions.

- 14 -

31.
Solomon Islands is not ready to implement a decentralization plan in the context
of a federal Constitution that would ensure that fiscal stability is maintained. If it is
decided to proceed in this direction, it will be essential that the national budget has been
stabilized and that an expenditure monitoring system for provincial revenue and expenditure
has been established. Thereafter, safeguards need to be in place to guard against an undue
weakening of the national budget as revenue is devolved.
32.
Monetary policy objectives for 2004—containing inflationary pressures and
increasing the level of international reserves—are appropriate. Given the current high
levels of excess liquidity and government deposits, continued vigilance will be needed to
ensure these objectives are achieved. Upward pressure on the exchange rate should continue
to be resisted in order to build reserves. As imports increase and aid flows diminish over
time, downward pressure on the exchange rate should not be resisted. The recent elimination
of the remaining exchange restrictions will contribute toward ensuring that the exchange rate
remains appropriately aligned.
33.
Financial sector reform can assist in sustaining medium-term growth. The
improvement in law and order has helped to strengthen profitability of the banking sector,
and continued vigilance by the central bank to enforce its prudential guidelines will be
needed. The recent efforts to strengthen the asset quality of the NPF, and to settle the future
of the DBSI, are welcome steps. Implementation of AML/CFT laws should be undertaken as
a priority.
34.
Structural reform is critical to lift private activity and employment. Reform of
the Foreign Investment Board, foreign labor permits, and licensing procedures is needed to
promote new investment, especially in potential growth sectors. Encouraging small-scale
production and inter-island distribution of potential export crops will be important, as is the
need to ensure the sustainable development and management of the forestry and fisheries
sectors. Reform of public enterprises is necessary to strengthen their financial balances and
the quality of their services. Future trade liberalization will also assist in promoting private
sector development. Strengthening institutions, enhancing governance and transparency, and
reducing corruption are clearly critical to support sustained economic growth.
35.
The Solomon Islands’ economic statistics framework remains weak. Improved
statistics are essential to the effective execution of the government’s reform agenda, and
efforts in this area should be given full support by the government and responsible agencies.
36.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Solomon
Islands be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Solomon Islands: National Economic Recovery, Reform, and Development Plan
The National Economic Recovery, Reform, and Development Plan (NERDP) was completed
at end-2003 and covers the period through 2006. The plan addresses the short-term needs for
economic recovery in the Solomon Islands, while laying out the foundations for growth and
development over the medium term. The plan was prepared principally by the Ministry of
National Reform and Planning, in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders including
ministries, parliamentarians, provincial governments, private sector, civil society organizations,
and the donor community. Each government ministry was assigned responsibility for a sector,
developed key targets for 2006, prepared a work plan to achieve these targets, and is required to
monitor and report progress on a regular basis.
Five strategic areas are identified in the plan, with objectives as follows:


Normalizing law and order and the security situation: Enhancing the capabilities of the
police force (including demobilizing ex-militants and reintegrating them into the
community), the Attorney General’s Chambers, the Public Prosecutor, the Public
Solicitor, and the judiciary.



Strengthening democracy, human rights, and good governance: Establishing a federal
structure, and strengthening the transparency, audit, and accountability of public decisionmaking and the management of public resources.



Restoring fiscal and financial stability and reforming the public sector: Mobilizing
domestic revenue, regularizing formal and informal government obligations, following
appropriate monetary and exchange rate policies, assisting rural sector access to credit,
reorganizing the public sector, and reform of the state-owned enterprises.



Revitalizing the productive sector and rebuilding supporting infrastructure: Sectorspecific policies to revitalize the agriculture, forestry, fisheries, mining, and tourism
sectors. Rebuilding supporting infrastructure in relation to land, energy, water, and the
environment.



Restoring basic social services and fostering social development: Restoring basic and
secondary health and education services, and promoting gender equality and community
development.

In mid-2003, the Cabinet also established three taskforces covering the restoration of law
and order, economic reform, and infrastructure and government services. Each taskforce
was headed by a former Prime Minister and charged with providing recommendations to
strengthen progress toward the priorities highlighted in the NERDP. The subsequent final reports
of the taskforces collectively stress the importance of rural development, where the majority of
Solomon Islanders live. While recognizing a major part of rural development efforts will remain
donor-financed in the near future, the reports call for greater participation of the rural sector and
provincial authorities in the design and implementation of development projects.

Box 2. Solomon Islands: Impediments to Growth and Poverty Reduction
Real per capita GDP of the Solomon Islands was 7 percent lower in 1999 than at independence in
1978, even before the civil conflict during 1999–2003 reduced real per capita GDP by another onequarter. Solomon Islands also lags behind most other Pacific Island countries in terms of social indicators.
Malaria is rampant, with the highest rate of infection in the world outside of sub-Saharan Africa, and more
than a third of the rural population lacks access to safe water. The limited infrastructure, remote
geographical location, lack of well-defined property rights, and inadequate education and health services
are major obstacles to achieving a higher sustained rate of economic growth.
Agriculture: More than 80 percent of the population live in the rural areas and engage in subsistence or
semi-subsistence agriculture. Taking their produce to market is a challenge for smallholders as transport in
and between the islands is inadequate. Small producers also lack financial services and technical
assistance, and hence other cash crops successfully exploited in the region, such as vanilla, have not been
grown. The other component of the agricultural sector, large-scale plantations, has been restrained by the
difficulty in acquiring land, most of which is communally owned and lacks titles.
Forestry: Timber extraction is an important source of fiscal revenue and foreign exchange earnings,
accounting for two-thirds of the value of merchandise exports. The current level of extraction is estimated
to be two to three times above the sustainable level. The main issues are better governance of the sector
and encouraging sustainable forestry practices. Foreign operators often exploit uncertainty in the
ownership of the land by compensating an individual rather than the collective body of owners.
Fishing: The Solomon Islands has large fish resources. Artisanal fishing is widespread for the primary
purposes of subsistence and local sales. Small producers cannot access larger markets due to poor interisland transportation; most of the fish consumed in Honiara is of the canned and frozen variety. Two major
companies export most of their catch, although the cost of transport to the main export markets in Asia is
high. Private companies are also disadvantaged by a tax concession enjoyed by the largest firm, which is
owned by the government.
Mining: There are rich gold and nickel resources in the Solomon Islands, which are not currently
exploited. The Gold Ridge mine was closed at the height of conflict in 2000, and its infrastructure and
assets have been severely damaged. The main risk for mining operations is the uncertain legal status of
land. Mining companies cannot buy land, and the profit-share arrangements with landowners are often
challenged by other claimants to the land.
Tourism: The Solomon Islands has many natural and cultural attractions. Its pristine coral reefs, rich
marine life, and large number of World War II wrecks provide for world-class diving and snorkeling
opportunities. However, the existing tourism facilities are insufficient, and concentrated in Honiara,
eschewing the natural attractions of the outlying areas. While security warnings have been lifted, disease
risks and costly air travel discourage tourists.
Manufacturing: Manufacturing is of limited scale in the Solomon Islands, mainly consisting of processing
agricultural commodities such as coconut and palm oil and fish processing. There has been little foreign
direct investment, and domestic enterprise development has been hindered by the security situation and
lack of entrepreneurial experience. The urban areas, particularly Honiara, have grown rapidly, but
employment opportunities in the formal sector have remained limited. Even before the outbreak of the
conflict in 1999, only one in three men aged 20–24 was estimated to be engaged in paid employment; for
women, the ratio was less than one in six.

- 17 -

Box 3. Solomon Islands: Financial Sector Soundness and Supervision
The Solomon Islands’ financial system comprises the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI), three
commercial banks (one of which is domestically owned), the National Provident Fund (NPF), the
Development Bank of Solomon Islands (DBSI), and a number of small nonbank financial institutions (credit
unions, insurance companies, and housing schemes). The commercial banks are reported financially sound despite
the difficult economic environment in recent years that was compounded by the government debt defaults. However,
the asset quality of the NPF—the largest financial institution—has been severely impaired, and the DBSI has become
illiquid and likely insolvent.
Central Bank Soundness: The CBSI’s balance sheet has shown a net liability in recent years (SI$28 million in 2003
versus net assets of SI$102 million in 1998) due to full provisioning by the CBSI against its holding of government
debt, all of which is in default. The CBSI’s financial position is expected to strengthen once the government debtrescheduling discussions are completed.
Central Bank Supervision: Under the 1998 Financial Institutions Act, the CBSI is the prudential regulator for the
commercial banks, and its mandate was extended to cover the NPF and DBSI in August 2002. Supervision of the
insurance sector will fall under CBSI purview in mid-2004. Prudential standards are generally in accordance with
Basle Core Principle and are enforced by the CBSI through off-site and on-site inspections, with the NPF and DBSI
covered for the first time in 2003. However, the majority ownership status of the National Bank of Solomon Islands
(NBSI), the largest commercial bank, by three local trust funds remains a pending issue, as the trusts do not meet the
guidelines “fit and proper” criterion. The CBSI took legal actions against a pyramid scheme in 2003, reiterating its
strong commitment toward safeguarding the financial system.
Commercial Banks Performance: The assets of the commercial banks amount to 32 percent of GDP. Prudential
indicators indicate that, both as a group and individually, the commercial banks were broadly sound as of end-2003.
• Capital Adequacy. The average risk-weighted capital ratio was 28 percent in 2003, with all three banks well
above the 10 percent prudential requirement; the latter may be raised to 15 percent as of mid-2004.
• Asset Quality. NPLs gradually increased from SI$6 million (3 percent of total loans) before the tensions erupted
in 1999 to reach SI$20 million (11 percent) in 2002, before declining to SI$16 million (8 percent) as performance
improved in 2003.
• Earnings and Profitability. The return on average assets was 5 percent in 2003 versus 3 percent in 1999. Since
2002, noninterest income has accounted for the bulk of earnings (65 percent of total operating income in 2003 versus
43 percent in 1998), largely as a result of earnings on foreign exchange transactions and from fees and charges.
• Liquidity. Liquid asset reserves accounted for 28 percent of total deposit liabilities in 2003 as against 14 percent
in 1998, significantly exceeding the 7.5 percent prudential requirement.
National Provident Fund: The NPF is a compulsory saving scheme aimed at earmarking a portion of formal wage
income primarily for retirement purposes. Its assets equal two-thirds of banking sector assets. The NPF’s assets are
comprised of government securities (25 percent), loans (17 percent to government entities and 14 percent to
members), shares in public enterprises (18 percent), and the remainder in property and cash deposits. A large portion
of its portfolio consists of nonperforming assets, largely reflecting the government debt default, lending to provincial
governments (under government guarantee), and for housing loans to NPF members. Operating surpluses have
declined in the last four years owing to the impact of the civil conflict, and the heavy withdrawal of contributions by
employees made redundant. Government arrears on contributions have also compounded the NPF’s liquidity
situation. The NPF is in the process of implementing recommendations from the CBSI’s recent audit and is
reviewing its investment guidelines with World Bank technical assistance.
Development Bank of Solomon Islands: The DBSI is a government-owned development lender. Its assets (net of
provisions for bad debt), which account for 7 percent of banking sector assets, are severely impaired reflecting weak
governance and a poor credit culture. The DBSI is illiquid (2.6 percent liquidity ratio versus 7.5 percent required for
commercial banks). Its provisions for bad debt (38 percent of total loans) are understated, and its deposit liabilities
(SI$20 million) and borrowing obligations (SI$28.5 million, of which SI$24 million is due to foreign creditors) are
in default. As a result, the DBSI has likely become insolvent. In accordance with the provisions under the 1998
Financial Act, in June 2004 the High Court assigned the CBSI as the provisional manager for DBSI.

APPENDIX

SOLOMON ISLANDS: MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS
Achieving sustained growth in private sector activity in the urban and rural areas is
essential to improve living standards and social indicators in the Solomon Islands, and
thereby reduce remaining inter-island tensions. This will require continued fiscal restraint
while reprioritizing expenditures, large infrastructure and other development spending to
support private investment, a cautious approach to monetary and exchange rate policies, and
strong structural reform to address the significant growth impediments that are outlined in the
staff report.
Medium-term outlook
The staff has prepared a medium–term outlook based on this scenario (Appendix
Table 1). The annual growth rate averages almost 5 percent during 2004–09, driven initially
by donor-financed public investment and later by private investment and exports as donor
involvement is scaled back. While ambitious, this growth rate is not out of reach provided
early action is taken to address the current structural impediments to private sector
investment. Work on improving infrastructure has already started, aided by the reactivation of
the Asian Development Bank’s post-conflict rehabilitation loan, and the authorities have
started to consider the regulatory and land ownership issues that have impeded foreign and
domestic investment. The export-oriented agricultural and fisheries sectors would benefit
from these developments, as would the tourism and minerals sectors that also have significant
potential. The export/GDP share is envisaged to gradually increase by 3 percent of GDP, and
the share of private investment by 2½ percent of GDP, backed by rising foreign direct
investment in the minerals and other sectors. The current account deficit peaks in 2005 in line
with the large development outlays and associated imports, and falls back to 2 percent of
GDP by 2009 with the improving export performance. The level of international reserves
increases in U.S. dollar terms, but declines somewhat as a share in months of (rising)
imports. Inflation will remain contained at about 3 percent a year, and the real exchange rate
is assumed to remain broadly unchanged at its current level.
Fiscal policy in this scenario would be oriented toward supporting private sector
activity and improving social indicators while, at the same time, reducing the level of
government debt. A deficit of around ½ percent of GDP a year, combined with robust
economic growth, would support a reduction in the government debt ratio from its current
level of 100 percent of GDP to 65 percent of GDP by 2009.1 This will require an increase in

1

In line with the authorities’ current intentions, the staff’s medium-term scenario assumes the
securitization of the arrears on pension contributions for government employees due to the
NPF (2½ percent of GDP), and the repayment of the other arrears on wage-deductions in
2004–05 (2½ percent of GDP). The balance of the domestic arrears (around 8 percent of
(Continued…)

APPENDIX

the revenue share of 1½ percent of GDP between 2004 and 2009, which can be achieved by
strengthening tax administration and widening the tax base. In this scenario, domestic and
external debt servicing remains around 15 percent of annual domestic revenue, consistent
with the authorities’ debt-restructuring strategy. Due to the current high external debt share
(73 percent of GDP) and significant foreign grant inflows, newly contracted concessional
debt is expected to be limited, underpinning a sharp decline in the level of external debt (to
42 percent of GDP by 2009) as net repayments average 1 percent of GDP a year. In these
circumstances, the deficit is assumed to be primarily financed from domestic sources, helped
by the eventual reopening of the treasury bill market after the restructuring negotiations of
existing debt obligations have been concluded.
Grant revenue (classified above-the-line) declines as general budget financing from
donors is scaled back starting in 2005 (in line with donor indications), which leads to a
large decline in the fiscal surplus in 2005 compared with that projected for 2004.
Expenditure pressures for social and infrastructure outlays and new operations and
maintenance expenditures will be large. While some savings are assumed from the
reprioritization of current outlays, expenditures not backed by development grants
nonetheless increase by around 1 percent of GDP over the forecast period.
External debt sustainability in the medium-term baseline
The Solomon Islands’ current external debt level is high, although the debt-servicing
burden is manageable. The current estimated NPV of external debt relative to GDP
(44 percent), exports (102 percent), or government revenue (219 percent) is above indicative
thresholds for other low-income countries (Appendix Table 2). However, the current debt
service burden as a share of the recently improved level of exports (6 percent) or revenue
(12 percent) appears manageable. During the projection period, all sustainability indicators
improve steadily due to the net repayments to external creditors, rapid growth of GDP, and
the increased levels of revenue and exports in the projection period. Specifically, the ratios of
the NPV of external debt to major macroeconomic aggregates fall by roughly one-half of
their current levels over the next five years, while debt service indicators would remain
broadly stable.
Risks to the medium-term scenario
Several factors pose risks to the outlook described above. The staff has undertaken a
series of stress tests to check the country’s resilience to external and domestic shocks. The
stress tests were conducted using one-standard-deviation shocks that last for two years to the
10-year historical data averages for economic growth, export value growth, the U.S. dollar
GDP) is assumed to be settled in line with any overperformance on the annual revenue
targets.

The stress tests suggest that a temporary shock to the economic growth rate or the
exchange rate has a large but manageable impact on the external debt level (Appendix
Table 2). As long as the policy environment remains sound, the debt stock returns to its
declining path and does

debt level. The most

the projected decline to
27 percent in the baseline estimate. In regard to the servicing burden, the external debtservicing ratio is most sensitive to a one-standard-deviation shock in the export growth rate,
where it would increase from its current level of around 6 percent to reach 15 percent in 2008
before falling back slightly.
These results highlight the potential vulnerabilities faced by the Solomon Islands
economy to adverse shocks, especially if the pace of economic and export growth proves
less favorable than currently envisaged. Given these uncertainties in future economic
developments, following a cautious approach to fiscal and other macroeconomic policies
under the control of the government will be essential to provide the flexibility needed to
respond to potential adverse developments in economic activity and/or the external
environment.

Exchange Rate Arrangements:
Since November 2000, the exchange rate for the S.I. dollar has been based on an undisclosed
trade-weighted basket of the currencies of the Solomon Islands’ major trading partners, with
the U.S. dollar as the intervention currency. During 2002, as pressures on external reserves
intensified, the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) accelerated the rate of currency
depreciation, leading to a gradual real depreciation of the S.I. dollar. Since December 2002,
the CBSI has kept the exchange rate broadly stable against the U.S. dollar, although there is
no public commitment to continue to do so.

ANNEX II

SOLOMON ISLANDS: POVERTY AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS
Social indicators of poverty and human development are low in the Solomon Islands. The
country ranks below all Pacific island countries, except Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, in
the United Nations Human Development Index, coming in at 123 out of 175 countries. There
are few recent poverty statistics, but anecdotal evidence suggests poverty remains high.
However, the more extreme forms of poverty, such as malnourishment, have remained
limited due to an abundant resource base, assured access to customary land tenure, and
resilient social networks. This advantage is under pressure from a population growth rate that,
at almost 3 percent a year, is amongst the highest in the world.
Nonetheless, the Solomon Islands has achieved some significant progress in improving living
conditions since independence despite falling per capita incomes. Prior to the outbreak of the
civil conflict in 1999, sizable health and education expenditures (at 3–5 percent of GDP each)
and high per capita aid inflows had helped underpin these improvements. Providing
widespread and quality education to the very young population (42 percent under age 14) is a
challenge. The primary education enrollment ratio is about 80 percent, although primary
education is neither compulsory nor free. School fees reportedly are an important hindrance
to achieving universal primary education. The enrollment ratio is only 30 percent in
secondary education. In regard to health industries, Malaria is rampant, with the highest rate
of infection in the world outside of sub-Saharan Africa, and more than a third of the rural
population lacks access to safe water.
The paucity of data makes an assessment of human development trends since the outbreak of
the civil conflict in 1999 difficult, but it is likely that the positive trend was halted, if not
reversed. Public service delivery was hampered by the conflict, and large inter-island
migrations put strains on the existing capacity. Agricultural production for market declined
sharply due to the lack of security and transport services.
The aggregate social indicators mask large differences between urban and rural areas. The
two main problems in the rural sector are the lack of essential public services such as health
and education, and cash income due to difficulties in market access for rural products grown.
While the urban areas have better social services and average incomes are higher, the urban
poor face difficulties in securing employment and land for residence.
The government has adopted the MDGs in its National Economic Recovery, Reform, and
Development Plan, and has committed to monitor progress towards them. Achieving the
MDGs by 2015 is still possible, but remains a major challenge. Progress in some areas, such
as reducing infant mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability, has so far been
inadequate.

ANNEX III

SOLOMON ISLANDS: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of May 20, 2004)
Following the repayment of debt servicing arrears in September 2003, the Solomon Islands came
out of non-accrual status and country relations have been normalized. As a consequence, the
suspended Health Sector Development Project (US$4 million equivalent) has been reactivated with a
mid-term review scheduled for June 2004.
A joint Asian Development Bank-World Bank assessment mission took place in October 2003, with a
follow-up in March 2004. As a result, the World Bank has launched a program comprising small grants
and analytical/advisory services for the Solomon Islands Government. Strategic partnership with other
donors is a key principle of World Bank support so that activities can be leveraged effectively; the Bank
does not envision any new loans in the short term. Details of World Bank activities are given below.

Economic reform: The World Bank is preparing analytical work to support policy advice on
macroeconomic management and economic reform priorities, including support to a proposal
Economic Reform Unit.
Financial sector reform: At the request of the CBSI, an Institutional Development Fund grant of US$
254,000 has been approved to support policy advice on financial sector supervision, including for
nonbank financial institutions, and relevant macroeconomic analysis.
Energy: An initial review of Solomon Islands Energy Authority was completed in February 2004,
and discussions with the government, AsDB, and Australia are ongoing on appropriate next steps
in financial/management restructuring. The Bank is also exploring options for rural electrification.
Telecommunications: Assistance with sector policy development and establishment of effective
regulatory capacity is being provided, and the Bank is exploring options to enhance rural
telecommunications access.
Rural income generation: The Bank is designing a small project activity (grant-financed) to
support pilot initiatives in rural areas to help improve the access of small farmers to the cash
economy and to generate increased incomes on a sustainable basis.
Foreign Investment Promotion: The government has requested policy advice and technical
assistance from the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) to prepare a new Investment
Promotion Bill. This would resurrect work initiated in 1999. FIAS has agreed in principle and will
prepare a proposal for management consideration. FIAS has also agreed to assist in the review of
customs and tax incentives in conjunction with technical assistance supported by PFTAC.
Education policy: Discussions are ongoing in the areas of the National Training Plan
(scholarships, training needs, tertiary planning), Technical/Vocational Education Plan and
strategies, Distance Education Plan and strategy, and developing and monitoring Basic Education
indicators. These areas would complement the education sector reforms that the government is
implementing with the support of the EU and NZAID.

ANNEX IV

SOLOMON ISLANDS: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of May 20, 2004)
Since joining the AsDB in 1973, the Solomon Islands has received 16 loans for a total amount of
US$79.3 million, and 53 TA projects for a total amount of US$10.9 million. The loan and TA projects
have been in agriculture and fisheries, transportation, infrastructure rehabilitation, finance, power, water
supply and sanitation, ports, reform of state owned enterprises, and institutional development of
government ministries and public agencies, particularly the executing agencies of AsDB-financed
projects.
During 1994–97, no new operations were initiated because of government arrears on debt servicing
obligations. In 1998, with the clearance of overdue loan payments to the AsDB, lending and TA
operations resumed. In August 1998, the ADB approved a US$25 million policy-based program loan and
a US$1 million TA loan to support the Government’s Public Sector Reform Program. The program loan
helped finance adjustment costs associated with the reform program, particularly the clearance of
government arrears to external and domestic creditors, and separation payments made in 1999 to civil
servants. The first tranche of the program loan (US$15 million) was disbursed in November 1998. The
second tranche of the loan was not released and was eventually cancelled since, subsequent to the
outbreak of ethnic unrest in mid-1999, a new government did not support the program’s objectives. In
2000, the AsDB approved a US$10 million post-conflict emergency rehabilitation project loan. However,
due to debt servicing arrears, AsDB suspended its operational program in the Solomon Islands in
February 2002. Following the settlement of the arrears by Australia on behalf of the Solomon Islands
Government in September 2003, AsDB resumed its country operations. The country strategy and program
is being formulated for approval in mid-2004.
AsDB operations in the Solomon Islands are guided by the Pacific Strategy for the New Millennium that
was approved in 2000. AsDB is currently formulating a new Pacific development strategy for the period
2005–08. Project processing is undertaken by the Pacific Operations Division (PAHQ) in Manila, while
project implementation is administered largely by AsDB’s South Pacific Regional Mission located in
Vanuatu.

ANNEX V

SOLOMON ISLANDS: SUPPORT FROM THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTER1
(As of May 20, 2004)
The Center’s assistance to the Solomon Islands since 1996 has included 19 advisory missions, mostly before
1999. The Solomon Islands sent 19 officials to seminars and workshops, and PFTAC organized 9 attachments
(including for the manager of CBSI’s Financial Institutions Department to a seminar in Washington).
Public financial management
PFTAC participated in two PEM missions in 1998, one with AusAID, and one with UNDP, to explore the
scope for sustainable improvements in financial management. An advisor was a member of the August 2002
IMF mission and reviewed the PEM system. The priority was the rehabilitation of public financial management,
including strengthening expenditure and commitment controls, tightening treasury and cash management
operations, and improving the budget and accounting system. Indications are that the situation has considerably
improved in recent months.
Tax administration and policy
During several missions before February 1999, PFTAC provided input to the administration improvement
projects proposed by AusAID and NZAID. Following a review of the Inland Revenue administration, two
four-week consultancies for strengthening the audit area were also organized in May and November 1998.
In 2003, discussions were held at PFTAC Headquarters on a decentralization strategy that revealed that the
tax system is in need of reform. A tax and customs administration mission took place in March and May
2004 with the involvement of a customs expert, partly to determine future PFTAC involvement.
Financial sector regulation and supervision
In late 2002, PFTAC participated in an on-site review of the domestically owned commercial bank.
Technical assistance in bank ownership issues, the quality of bank holdings of government bonds, and the
supervision of the National Provident Fund has been provided to the CBSI staff in the PFTAC
Headquarters. PFTAC also funded the attachment of a CBSI bank examiner to the Reserve Bank of Fiji
and the participation of CBSI staff in regional supervision workshops.
Economic and financial statistics
A January 2003 mission revealed that the National Statistics Office (NSO) was barely functional, having
suffered severe losses of resources and records in previous years. At that time, PFTAC recommended the
temporary transfer of staff responsible for producing the CPI to the CBSI. Following stabilization of the
country, the NSO has been partially re-equipped; the CPI is again being produced in the NSO and a
business survey for national accounts is planned for mid-2004. A further PFTAC mission in February 2004
devised a recovery plan, including the provision of a long-term adviser, training attachments, and future
technical assistance.

ANNEX VI

SOLOMON ISLANDS: STATISTICAL ISSUES
The Solomon Islands’ economic database is poor. The only institution that has provided regular data in the
last two years is the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands (CBSI). The staff of the National Statistical Office
(NSO) was relocated to the CBSI given the inadequate resources and the lack of security in the Ministry of
Finance. NSO is now in the process of recovery, and it is gradually re-taking over data collection and
publication responsibilities.
The CBSI publishes data on the real, external, fiscal, and monetary sectors in its Monthly Review, Quarterly
Review, and Annual Report. There is a Solomon Islands country page in IFS, but delays often occur.
A GDDS mission from PFTAC visited the Solomon Islands in February 2004 to assess the situation and
propose an action plan for recovery. The mission concluded that rebuilding the statistical system required
extensive TA over at least two years and external funding. The mission recommended the appointment of a
chief statistician and an externally funded long-term adviser. The mission also noted the urgency of
conducting a business survey and a household income and expenditure survey in order to provide a new base
for the national accounts and CPI and enable an assessment of poverty levels. The mission further identified a
number of statistical issues which need priority attention, including; liaising with the National Provident Fund
to arrange for the receipt of data on employment and other statistics; increasing the response rate on BOP
surveys; reducing the dependence on Foreign Exchange Transaction records for BOP purposes; resuming use
of Customs data for the estimation of imports; and considering a Population Census as significant population
movements in recent years make the 1999 Census results unreliable for planning and analysis purposes.
Real sector
The NSO has not produced national accounts data since 1994. The task was taken over by the CBSI, but its
annual estimates build on a limited amount of raw data, primarily commodity exports. Data on production of
major export commodities are reported on a monthly basis. Data on employment and wages are not produced.
The NSO reclaimed the task of producing the CPI for Honiara from the CBSI in August 2003.
Money and banking statistics
Monetary statistics are compiled by the CBSI on a monthly basis and are provided to the IMF with a two to
four week lag.
Public finance
The Ministry of Finance started disseminating monthly press releases on budget realizations in August 2003.
The CBSI published data on revenue and expenditure during the conflict, although the reliability of these data
is in doubt given the break down of accounting mechanisms and the large expenditure arrears. Data for the
provincial government finances are not available.
External sector
Partial quarterly balance of payments data are estimated by the CBSI on the basis of cash foreign exchange
transactions reported through the banking system and are available with a three-month lag. In the absence of
supplementary surveys (e.g., on foreign direct investment and aid inflows), such data are deficient in both
detail and coverage.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 04/89
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 12, 2004

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the Solomon Islands
On July 16, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Solomon Islands.1
Background
The Solomon Islands’ economy deteriorated markedly after the outbreak of an inter-island
conflict in mid-1999. The level of real GDP subsequently declined by one-quarter, exports
halved, and inflation increased to 15 percent. In addition, the budget deficit increased rapidly,
the government defaulted on virtually all domestic and external debt obligations, and
international reserves (net of the external arrears) were fully exhausted.
The government has moved rapidly to stabilize budgetary finances since the arrival in mid-2003
of the multinational Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) that has
restored law and order throughout the country. The budget finished the year with a deficit of just
1½ percent of GDP, compared with 10 percent in 2002. This result was mainly attributable to
the marked strengthening of tax collections aided by an amnesty on penalties, the termination
of payments to the ex-militants, greater scrutiny over the wage bill, and the tightening of
expenditure controls. Australia and New Zealand also provided substantial grant support to the
budget, in addition to that provided for development spending, which was in part used to pay
the overdue debt obligations to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
Taken together, these steps helped finance an increase in social and development outlays.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities and this PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board.

-2The government’s commitment to prevent new nondebt expenditure arrears from October 2003
has been strictly enforced. Improvements in revenue collections and expenditure restraint have
continued in 2004, and the authorities project that the 2004 budget will be in surplus.
Economic activity has started to respond to the more favorable law and order and policy
environment. Real GDP grew by an estimated 5 percent in 2003, helped by, strong fish, copra,
and cocoa production. Foreign investors have renewed their interest in major natural resource
projects, and private sector credit growth has increased as lending interest rates have declined.
Overall credit growth, however, has remained low as the large aid flows and recurrent budget
surplus have increased the level of government deposits held at the central bank. International
reserves have increased sharply, reflecting higher export volumes and world commodity prices,
the slow pick up in import demand, large aid flows, and the remonetization of the economy.
Inflation has fallen back to single-digit levels, as the supply of food has increased and the
nominal effective exchange rate has stabilized.
If appropriate macroeconomic and structural policies are implemented, growth of real GDP in
the Solomon Islands during 2004–09 could average 4½–5 percent a year (around 2 percent per
capita). Inflation would remain in low single digits and the level of international reserves slowly
increase, assuming that fiscal and monetary discipline is maintained. The current account
deficit as a share in GDP would gradually decline as exports increase and the level of
project-related imports falls back. Assuming the budget deficit averages around ½ percent of
GDP, the government debt ratio would decline from 100 percent of GDP in 2003 to 65 percent
of GDP by 2009.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the marked improvement in economic performance in the
Solomon Islands that has occurred since the arrival of the RAMSI in mid-2003. Real GDP has
increased following four years of decline, inflation has fallen, exports are higher, and reserves
have strengthened.
At the same time, Directors observed that the current situation and future economic prospects
in the Solomon Islands remain fragile. Much physical infrastructure has been destroyed, social
indicators have deteriorated, unemployment remains high, and the government debt stock is
large. Against this background, the main challenge will be to implement policies to reduce the
risks to the medium-term outlook and underpin a sustained improvement in per capita growth
and social indicators. Key policies in this regard will be a strengthening of budget finances—in
particular, tight control over expenditures—maintaining price stability, and implementing deep
structural reforms to promote private sector employment and exports.
Directors commended the authorities for the prudent fiscal policies they had followed in the
second half of 2003 and the rapid turnaround in budget finances. The budget deficit for 2003
was reduced sharply, reflecting higher receipts from better tax administration and firm control
over payments to ex-militants and civil service allowances, as well as the resumption of donor
grants. Directors endorsed the 2004 budget surplus target, which will enable the government to
start to pay down the large stock of expenditure arrears, and they concurred with the plans to
regularize the government’s debt obligations.

-3Directors stressed the need for continued fiscal restraint over the medium term to reduce the
debt stock and servicing burden, and to ensure that resources are available for urgent social
and development requirements. Priority should be placed on reallocating spending toward basic
health and education, rural infrastructure and agricultural advisory services, and operations and
maintenance outlays. Directors called for further efforts to contain civil service expenditure and
boost revenue collections through additional improvements in tax and customs administration.
Pressures for new income-tax exemptions for foreign and domestic investment and activity
should be resisted. Regarding the possibility of decentralizing a large part of the budget to the
provinces under a proposed federal structure for the Solomon Islands, Directors recommended
contemplating such a step only after central government finances are on a secure foundation,
and an effective system for monitoring provincial government revenues and expenditures is in
place.
Directors endorsed the central bank’s monetary policy objectives of containing inflationary
pressures and increasing the level of international reserves. The current policy of countering
upward pressure on the exchange rate should continue, and particular vigilance will be
necessary to ensure that inflation remains subdued. Directors welcomed the recent elimination
of the remaining restrictions on current international transactions.
Directors observed that the banking system is generally sound. They encouraged the central
bank to monitor banks closely to ensure that all prudential guidelines continue to be met as the
economic recovery gathers pace. The recent efforts to strengthen the asset quality of the
pension fund, and the initial steps taken to settle the future of the development bank, were
welcomed. Directors stressed that implementation of laws against money laundering and the
financing of terrorism will help safeguard the financial system and should be a priority.
Directors underscored that structural reforms will be critical to lift private sector exports and
employment over the medium term. Attention needs to be focused on policies to boost rural
production, improve inter-island distribution systems, and promote efficient and ecologically
sustainable management of the fisheries and forestry sectors. Regulation and licensing
procedures for foreign and domestic investment and activity should be streamlined, and the
corporatization and privatization of public enterprises should be considered to help improve
their financial balances. Directors stressed that strengthening institutions, enhancing
governance and transparency, and reducing corruption will help promote a level playing field for
private sector activity.
Directors fully supported the authorities’ medium-term development strategy outlined in the
National Economic Recovery, Reform, and Development Plan. The success of the Plan will
depend crucially on a sustained record of policy implementation to rehabilitate the economy.
Continuous monitoring and evaluation of the Plan will be necessary, and in support of that
effort, an improvement in the currently weak state of economic data will be essential.
Directors called in particular for the rehabilitation of the National Statistical Office in order to
improve the quality and timeliness of national accounts, budgetary, and balance of payments
statistics.

-4Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's views
and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after
Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a
particular case.

Key Points
•

There has been a remarkable turnaround in the Solomon Islands economy over the
past twelve months, with the restoration of law and order and greater fiscal discipline.

•

The provision of substantial donor assistance has lead to this improvement.

•

The authorities recognise that this support has provided a window of opportunity to
not only arrest the decline in economic activity, but to put the economy on the path of
sustained growth.

•

Achieving this outcome will require major structural reforms. At the core of the
reform agenda is the maintenance of law and order, fiscal discipline, strengthening
institutions, rebuilding infrastructure, and improving the investment environment.

•

The authorities appreciate the support they have received from the Fund in addressing
the many challenges they face.

A remarkable turnaround
A great deal has changed in the Solomon Islands since last year’s Article IV consultations.
At last year’s consultations, Directors focused on the need to restore law and order and fiscal
discipline to arrest the deterioration in the economy. It is pleasing to report this year that
substantial progress has been made on all these fronts – law and order has been restored,
government expenditure is under control, there is stronger tax compliance and improved
collections, and the economy is now growing following years of decline.
As the staff report highlights, the impact of ethnic tensions which erupted in mid-1999 on the
economy was devastating. Real GDP fell by over 25 per cent, exports were halved, foreign
exchange reserves were depleted, inflation rose, arrears mounted and general confidence
plummeted.
Donor support has built upon the resilience of the Solomon Islands people
The Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI), which was launched in
July 2003, was a turning point. However, notwithstanding the massive problems confronting
the economy prior to RAMSI, the spirit and perseverance of the Solomon Islands people was

-2not destroyed. Solomon Islands businesses did not wait for government action or donor
handouts – they continued with their daily activities, be it fishing, copra cutting, cocoa
farming or other pursuits. This resilience in the face of overwhelming hardships provided the
base for a remarkable turnaround in economic growth once law and order was restored and
confidence boosted. It also attests to the long-term potential of the Solomon Islands.
The Solomon Islands does have considerable potential, although it faces major development
challenges. Its 500,000 people live on a scattered archipelago of mountainous islands and
coral atolls covering about 28,000 square kilometers. There are about 70 indigenous
languages in use and the vast majority of land is communally owned, with usage rights
determined by local customs (which can vary greatly among islands).
All components of the economy are now growing
The return to economic growth, estimated at over 5 per cent last year, is significant, with all
components of the economy registering improvements. The fisheries sector grew in volume
terms, while an improvement in fish prices also made a contribution. Underlying growth in
the agriculture sector was a strong recovery in both copra and cocoa production, while
growth in the forestry sector stemmed primarily from an expansion in log harvesting. As a
direct reflection of the pick-up in confidence, the construction sector grew strongly during
the course of the last year – up about 88 per cent.
The restoration of government finances
Importantly, government finances have been stabilised. Expenditure has been brought under
control – particularly the public sector wage bill, with the payroll being cleansed of ghost
workers and payments to ex-militants terminated – and revenues boosted. A budget deficit
of 10 per cent of GDP in 2002 has been reduced to 1½ per cent. The Ministry of Finance is
reporting strong revenue collection, reflecting faster economic and export growth, success in
bringing businesses back into the tax net, and the collection of tax arrears. Government
finances have also benefited from the return of donor support. Despite pressing expenditure
needs, the government has used higher-than-projected revenue flows to reduce the stock of
expenditure arrears. Net credit to the government has declined. This is a very positive
development given the past history of heavy financing by government from the domestic
banking system, which has had a crowding-out effect on private sector spending and
investment decisions.
Importantly, the government has reached an agreement with domestic bondholders to
restructure domestic debt, which is due to be signed on July 15, 2004. The large public debt
stock, and the government’s problems in servicing this debt, has been a major burden on the
economy. In particular, it has dampened the ability of commercial banks to play their role in
supporting economic development. Reaching an agreement with major domestic
bondholders will allow the financial sector to play its part to boost private sector growth.

-3Monetary policy and the exchange rate
The Central Bank has maintained its policy of pegging the Solomon Islands dollar to a
trade-weighted basket of currencies. Reflecting the increase in exports and donor inflows,
the focus of exchange rate policy has shifted from defending the level of reserves to resisting
upward pressure on the exchange rate resulting from large aid flows, so as to build reserves.
The exchange rate has been broadly stable in 2003 and inflation has been reduced from
double-digit to single-digit levels. Exchange restrictions, which were introduced largely as a
crisis measure, have been mostly removed. Reserves have risen to around 4.9 months of
import cover, although the figure would be significantly lower if allowance is made for the
government’s accumulated external debt arrears.
The authorities believe that in the current environment, reserve money should continue to be
the nominal anchor for monetary policy, using a blend of open market operations and foreign
exchange market interventions as the main policy instruments – an arrangement that has
served the economy well.
The stronger financial sector
The Central Bank is taking steps to strengthen the financial system. During the past year, the
Central Bank has conducted for the first time on-site and off-site examinations of the
National Provident Fund and the Development Bank of the Solomon Islands and these
institutions have been made subject to supervision and regulation under the Financial
Institutions Act 2002. The Central Bank has prepared a report on the financial position of the
National Provident Fund and made a number of recommendations to its Board identifying
areas that need to be addressed to strengthen its balance sheet, governance and prudential
compliance. The Central Bank concluded that the Development Bank of the
Solomon Islands had been operating while insolvent and has received a court order to take
control of it, which became effective on June 10.
While developments are encouraging, the underlying situation remains fragile
While the past year has been a turning point for the Solomon Islands, and the authorities are
very appreciative for the external assistance which the country has received, they are very
aware that the underlying situation remains fragile and that it is essential they fully capitalise
on the “window of opportunity” presented by RAMSI. They also recognise that the very
welcome pick-up in economic activity over the past year follows four consecutive years of
substantial decline. It will take some time to restore the economy to pre-crisis levels. In fact,
in terms of GDP per capita, the Central Bank estimates that the economy has to maintain a
consistent annual growth rate of 10 per cent for the next ten years before the economy
achieves the sort of income levels experienced in the four years prior to 1999.

-4First steps on a long reform path
The authorities are aware that they have just commenced a long reform path needed to
address the problems confronting the economy. It is important that the momentum from the
restoration of law and order and the turnaround in confidence is maintained.
The authorities have developed a National Economic Recovery Reform and Development
Plan which lays the foundations to sustain growth and development over the medium term.
The plan aims to comprehensively address past impediments to Solomon Island’s
development, including revitalising institutions underpinning law and order, strengthening
governance, restoring fiscal discipline, maintaining financial stability, reforming the public
sector, rebuilding infrastructure, restoring social services and fostering social development.
This is a large reform agenda and progress will be difficult, but the benefits will be
substantial.
There are a number of key areas which the authorities are addressing. The economy’s main
sector – logging – has been proceeding at unsustainable levels. In response, the authorities
have prepared legislation aimed at strengthening forestry monitoring, regulation and
prosecution. The draft legislation has been subject to extensive consultations, including with
the timber industry, provincial governments, NGOs, landowners and women’s groups.
The need to improve the investment environment is also recognised. Some of the hurdles to
lifting investment include: cumbersome investment requirements, the absence of transparent
procedures, infrastructure in disrepair, unreliable utilities and transport services, the high cost
of doing business and the absence of government support. The importance of addressing
these impediments is recognised.
Most importantly, the machinery of government has to be restored, including good
governance, accountability and transparency. These are all on the authorities’ reform
agenda. As part of the reform effort, an Economic Reform Unit, to be staffed by RAMSI and
local officials, is being established within the Ministry of Finance to develop and implement
a longer-term economic reform agenda.
While the authorities are appreciative of the strong donor support they have received, they
are also aware of the risk of “aid dependency”. Efforts are being mounted to eradicate this
concern.
To conclude, the authorities would like to thank the Fund for their continued support and
assistance through some very difficult times. The substantial improvement in the country’s
economic conditions over the past year has been very encouraging. Nevertheless, the
government recognises that for the full potential offered by the current strong donor support
to be realised, this will ultimately depend on the actions of the people of the
Solomon Islands.
The authorities have consented to publication of the Staff Report and Selected Issues papers.
