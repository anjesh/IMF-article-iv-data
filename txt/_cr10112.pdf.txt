Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Article IV Consultation with Tonga
Approved by Nigel Chalk and Tom Dorsey
April 21, 2010
Mission. A staff team consisting of P. N’Diaye (Head), N. Porter (APD), and H. Lin
(FIN), visited Nuku’alofa from March 17–30. Ms. Vongpradhip and Mr. Phan (both OED)
and Messrs. Faletau, Liu, and Tora (Asian Development Bank) joined the mission.
Counterparts. The mission met with Minister of Finance Matoto, National Reserve Bank
of Tonga Governor Mafi, other senior officials, and private sector representatives.
Previous Fund recommendations. The staff and the authorities have shared
comprehensive views in the past about policy priorities. During the 2009 consultation,
Executive Directors have stressed the importance of fiscal consolidation and supportive
monetary policy. But the authorities have followed more moderate steps, primarily owing
to capacity constraints. Shortcomings were mainly in the area of fiscal policy, where staff
recommended improving revenue enforcement, especially at customs, and cautioned
against taking on a second loan from China EXIM bank.
Outreach. The mission held a press conference, and met with civil society
representatives, students at the University of the South Pacific (Tonga), and donor
representatives.
Recent developments. Tonga has been hit hard by the global crisis with declines in
tourism, remittances, and exports. At the same time, in large part due to worsening credit
quality, banks have cut back on lending. Reserves are at comfortable levels despite a
widening current account deficit. Inflation has eased.
Focus. Discussions centered on the near-term policy stance, the scope for improving
policy frameworks to bolster growth, and incentives for private sector development.
Exchange rate. Basket peg with monthly adjustment band of up to 5 percent.
Exchange system. Tonga accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4.
The authorities have removed the exchange restriction in the form of a tax certification
requirement applied to various current international transactions.
Statistics. Data quality, coverage, and timeliness are hampered by several deficiencies,
including capacity constraints, which complicate effective surveillance.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Tonga has been hit hard by the global crisis with declines in tourism, remittances, and
exports. At the same time, in large part due to worsening credit quality, bank balance sheets
have weakened. This, in turn, has restrained the availability of credit despite the central
bank’s efforts to stimulate demand. Compounding these downward pressures, part of the
Tongan archipelago was hit by a tsunami on September 29, 2009 causing loss of life and
significant material damage.
Activity is expected to bottom out in the coming months as capital spending plans are
implemented and financial conditions ease. Going forward, Tonga’s high debt and the
apparent ineffectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism constrain the authorities’
ability to support growth. Discussions focused on two broad areas: the short-term policy
stance and how best to support longer-term growth and safeguard external stability. Key
policy advice included:


Move the near-term fiscal stance toward a more neutral position.



At the same time, establish a comprehensive medium-term fiscal strategy aimed at achieving
primary surpluses of around 1 percent of GDP, and avoid new borrowing. This would put the
fiscal position on a more sustainable path, reduce Tonga’s vulnerability, and lay the
foundations for higher growth.



Once the recovery in trading partners is firmly established, perhaps by later this year, begin
withdrawing monetary stimulus. However, if inflation risks or downward pressures on
reserves materialize, monetary stimulus may need to be withdrawn on a more accelerated
timetable. The authorities regarded the risks to reserves and likelihood of substantial inflation
in coming months as relatively small and vowed to maintain their current monetary stance.



Use the full range of monetary policy instruments at the NRBT’s disposal and the flexibility
afforded by the existing exchange rate arrangement to contain inflation and maintain an
adequate level of international reserves. The authorities indicated they would favor higher
reserve requirements and direct limits on credit growth, if the monetary stimulus needed to be
withdrawn.



Improve fiscal and debt management, revenue administration, and banking supervision.



Strengthen the institutional framework for secured lending to enhance access to finance by
households and small enterprises.

I. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Activity. GDP contracted in
FY2008/09 (year ending in June) as the
global crisis lowered both tourist arrivals
and remittances inflows (Box I), and banks
contracted lending. In addition, part of the
Tongan archipelago was hit by a tsunami
on September 29, 2009 causing loss of life
and significant material damage. As a
result, Tonga’s growth underperformed that
of many Pacific islands.

External position. The current account deficit has widened somewhat due to lower
remittances and exports. Reserves have risen this year as a result of the recent SDR
allocation and the disbursement of donor grants and loans to reconstruct the Central Business
District.

end FY2009/10 at around 4 percent.
5.
Medium-term prospects. Public infrastructure spending should provide a temporary
boost to activity in FY2010/11 but once those projects wind down, it will be challenging to
achieve growth even in the 1–2 percent range. Prospects are constrained by Tonga’s
geographic isolation, its narrow export base, the high cost of labor, an inability to retain
skilled labor, and impediments to private sector activity.

6
Box I. Determinants of Remittance Flows to Tonga
This box estimates the determinants of remittances in Tonga. Remittances are Tonga’s main source of
foreign exchange, accounting for over 67 percent of imports on average, while exports account for
31percent. Tonga is also the leading recipient of remittances relative to GDP among Pacific island
countries. Remittances are mostly used to finance consumption and originate mainly from the United
States, New Zealand, and Australia, where Tongans
60

agricultural establishments. In 2009, 17 percent of
remittances were sent to nonprofit organizations (mostly

churches) and were used for church construction and

maintenance.
Samoa
Remittances in Tonga are also a much more reliable
source of foreign exchange than exports (with a
volatility that is 40 percent lower than that of exports).
The smaller volatility of remittances has traditionally
been explained by the strong altruistic relationships that
Tongans living abroad maintain with their families in
Tonga, like in many other Pacific island countries.

The effects of real GDP growth in remitting countries, as well as the exchange rate, capture the
capacity of Tongans living abroad to send money to Tonga. In particular, the estimated exchange rate
impact indicates that Tongans abroad do not compensate for changes in exchange rates (and possible
higher transaction costs). The interest rate differential between Tonga and remitting countries may
suggest that remittances help compensate for higher financing costs in Tonga (which effectively
weakens the transmission mechanism of monetary policy) or that nonprofit organizations do take into
account the level of interest rates when sending funds for reconstruction purposes.

7
6.
Risks. In the near term, the strength of the global recovery is by no means assured
and there are multiple risks that could weaken prospects in both Europe and the United
States. If global growth falters, there would be a direct toll on remittances, tourism, and
exports which, in turn, will feed through to weaken domestic activity and put pressure on the
balance of payments. A further rise in world commodity and food prices would also hit
Tonga hard, feeding through to inflation, growth, and the current account deficit. Tonga’s
high public debt now poses a major risk to economic prospects. Mitigating these risks will
necessitate continued progress on structural improvements to raise growth potential,
continued provision of grants from donors, as well as steady fiscal consolidation.
7.
Politics. Elections are scheduled for November 2010, which may slow the pace of
reform and lead to increased fiscal spending. Following King Siaosi Tupou V decision to
renounce his political powers, Tonga’s lawmakers will have to decide in the next few months
on a new electoral system, as well as on the composition of a new legislative assembly.
III. CALIBRATING MACROECONOMIC POLICIES
Macroeconomic policies in the coming years will need to give priority to mitigating the risks
to Tonga’s external and fiscal sustainability and laying the foundations for higher growth.
This will require improved fiscal management to support a steady fiscal consolidation and
continued progress to raise growth potential.
A. Fiscal Policy
Background
8.
In response to the global crisis, the government loosened fiscal policy to support
the economy. In FY2009/10, the deficit is expected to rise to 4 percent of GDP (from
3¼ percent of GDP in the previous fiscal year). This deterioration reflects primarily a
10 percent hike in civil servant wages, higher infrastructure spending, and weak revenues
(which fell short of budget forecasts by about 6 percent of GDP, mainly due to lower trade
and consumption taxes). As a result, the authorities have introduced an end-of-year cap on
spending across line ministries and have requested additional budget-support grants from
donors. Should the requested funds be

Both external and public debt over

30 percent of GDP.1 This puts Tonga into the range of “high risk of debt distress” not least
because the government bears all the credit and currency risk associated with on-lending of
these loans to private parties. These higher debt levels leave the economy more vulnerable to
shocks and limit the fiscal space for future spending on social and developmental priorities as
interest costs are borne by the budget. As such, further borrowing by the government, even
on concessional terms, should be avoided.
Policy Issues
10.
A steady path of fiscal adjustment will be imperative. In the upcoming budget the
staff advised limiting growth in total employee compensation to below the level of CPI
inflation, to carefully prioritize current spending, and to improve tax administration. This,
combined with the pick-up in economic activity, continued grant support from donors, and a
strengthening of revenue administration, should limit the deficit to around 5 percent of GDP.
The authorities agreed a deficit of that magnitude would be consistent with their goals of
providing some support to activity while ensuring fiscal sustainability. They also indicated
there could be some room to boost revenues by rolling back some of the recent reductions in
taxes.2 Over the medium term, a primary surplus target of around 1 percent of GDP should be
achievable and would place the fiscal position on a more sustainable path. However, this will
require progress on improving revenue administration and expenditure control, better
prioritizing of expenditures, and limiting new borrowing. Even with these efforts, though, the
fiscal financing situation will be difficult and will require continued grant support from
donors of the order of 3½ percent of GDP per year. Should grants be lower than expected,
there will be a need for reducing associated current and capital spending for projects and
possibly re-allocating some of the spending toward those projects deemed of higher priority.
11.
Improving revenue administration will be an essential ingredient of fiscal
consolidation. Significant progress has been made including issuing unique tax
identification number to corporate tax payers, introducing self-assessment for personal and
corporate income tax, and automating customs processing. Staff also argued for increasing
the resources provided to the tax and customs administration in order to strengthen both
auditing and tax collection efforts. The authorities emphasized the importance of the new
customs management system and efforts to improve arrears collection but recognized that
still more effort was needed to strengthen compliance.

The loan commitments were signed in November 2007 (for reconstruction of the central business district) and
February 2009 (for roads), and bear a 2 percent interest rate, 5-year grace period, and a 20-year maturity.

Ad-valorem tariffs of vehicles, fuel, tobacco, and alcohol were converted into specific excises as part of the
2008 tax reform. Duty bands were lowered in line with WTO commitments and capital goods were exempted
from trade tariffs. The corporate tax rate was also reduced to 25 percent, down from 35 percent.

Fiscal management and medium-term budgeting also need to be strengthened.
At present, fiscal decision-making is hampered by limited economic and policy analysis and
an inadequate budget reporting system. There is a need to adopt a medium-term framework
anchored by a path for the fiscal deficit that will achieve sustainable debt levels in the outer
years. At the same time, there is scope to improve reporting by line ministries and strengthen
communication between different government agencies. Such an institutional structure
should integrate the annual budget, spending plans of line ministries, and the medium-term
development objectives laid out in the government’s National Strategic Planning Framework
(NSPF) (Box II). In addition, fiscal control needs to be improved through more frequent
monitoring of expenditure and revenue and better use of the electronic monitoring systems.
Such efforts will help better align medium-term fiscal policies with government objectives,
improve the prioritization of spending, increase fiscal discipline, and provide an anchor for
expectations. The authorities stressed their commitment to these reforms over the next two
years supported by technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and
Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC).
13.
Given the increasing credit and currency risks, staff also recommended
establishing a comprehensive debt management strategy to limit vulnerabilities. In
addition, care will be needed in selecting private sector construction projects that will receive
on-lent funds from the government in order to limit the credit risk borne by the public
balance sheet. The authorities recognized the risks that a build-up in foreign-currency debt
poses and have requested IMF technical assistance to strengthen debt management capacity.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
Background
14.
Monetary policy has been loosened since the onset of the global crisis. The
National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) has lowered reserve requirements (from 10 to
5 percent), reduced the interest rate on its repo facility (from 10 to 4½ percent) and
suspended the issuance of central bank bills. Despite this, worsening credit quality has
reduced banks’ willingness to lend, thereby defusing the effect of the looser monetary policy
on the real economy.
Policy Issues
0.5

15.
Staff recommended maintaining a
neutral monetary policy stance in the
months ahead. The loosening of monetary
policy in FY2009/10 was appropriate but has
failed to fully translate into looser monetary
conditions. As a byproduct, there is now
significant liquidity in the banking system
and little reason to further loosen monetary

policy. Indeed, there is a risk that the liquidity overhang could, as banks restore their balance
sheets, translate into higher credit growth ultimately leading to higher inflation, a worsening
of the current account, and downward pressure on international reserves. Should such
pressures materialize, the authorities would need to raise reserve requirements, resume the
issuance of central bank paper, and raise rates on central bank repo facilities. A leading
indicator of such pressures in the past has been a recovery in Tonga’s main trading partners.
The authorities vowed to continue supporting activity. They regarded the risks to reserves
and likelihood of substantial inflation as relatively small at this point in the cycle. The
authorities noted that they will remain alert to evolving economic and financial conditions
and calibrate policies to ensure foreign reserves remain at comfortable levels (3−4 months of
imports). In case there was a need to withdraw monetary stimulus, the authorities indicated
they would favor higher reserve requirements and direct limits on credit growth given the
burden that using indirect instruments would place on NRBT profitability.
Box II. Tonga’s National Strategic Planning Framework
The National Strategic Planning Framework (NSPF) takes a longer-term strategic approach to
achieving sustainable development (5–10 years) with attention to key determinants of economic
and social development; and focuses on a limited number of government priorities, with
implementation details to be laid out in the corporate plans of government agencies.
The NSPF considers the following seven outcomes as fundamental to a sustained and more
equitable economic growth in Tonga: (i) community development that meets service needs;
(ii) private sector growth (through better engagement with the government, appropriate
incentives and streamlining of rules and regulations); (iii) constitutional reform; (iv) improved
provision and maintenance of infrastructure; (v) increased performance of technical and
vocational education and training to meet the challenges of maintaining and developing services
and infrastructure; (vi) improved people health by minimizing the impact of non-communicable
diseases; and (vii) environmental sustainability and climate change integrated into all program
planning and execution.
The NSPF is being refined to include performance targets and indicators and will be
implemented through government agencies corporate plans, which will be linked to the budget.
In this regard, the NSPF requires a robust management and monitoring mechanism to track the
achievement of strategic objectives and focuses on the quality of government agencies’
corporate plans.
Preparation of government agencies corporate plans is now underway with support from
AusAID, ADB, and PFTAC, especially on strengthening the link between the NSPF, the annual
budget process, and the medium-term budget framework.

There has been some political
pressure to begin directly administering the
level of deposit and lending rates. Bank
profitability in Tonga, including interest rate
spreads, does not appear to be excessive when
compared to other South Pacific jurisdictions.
In addition, administering interest rates would
likely result in significant credit rationing and
hamper banks’ ability to properly price risk.
As such, staff advised the authorities to
maintain their current market-determined
process for setting interest rates.

Making use of the flexibility afforded by the current exchange rate arrangement
remains critical to safeguard external stability. The staff assessed the currency to be
moderately overvalued (Box III), which left little scope to tighten monetary conditions
through a nominal appreciation of the currency. Indeed, if balance of payments pressures
emerge, nominal rigidities would mean that the NRBT would need to be ready to gradually
depreciate against the basket in order to safeguard external stability. To be effective, such
depreciation would need to be supported by further fiscal restraint given the effect a weaker
currency would have on the public debt burden. In addition, the authorities should build an
information base in order to assess the potential effect on private balance sheets of a
depreciation. Staff also welcomed the NRBT’s decision to reassess the weights in the
currency basket to better reflect economic circumstances, a shifting trade pattern, and the
increased renminbi exposure. The PFTAC will soon provide technical assistance in this area.
C. Financial Sector Issues
Background
18.
Following the marked
deterioration in banks balance sheets in
2008, provisioning has increased. Banks
are actively improving their risk
management practices, with greater staff
training on credit risk analysis, better
communication with bank management,
and more frequent audits. Most of the
credit-related losses have been
frontloaded and banks are expected to
return to profitability by the second half of
this year.

Box III. Exchange Rate Assessment
Tonga’s exchange rate is assessed to be moderately overvalued. Standard analytical approaches—
macroeconomic balance and purchasing power parity—suggest the pa’anga remains overvalued relative to
medium-term fundamentals, but there is considerable uncertainty around this result. Other indicators, however,
do not point to pressures from significant overvaluation.
Standard Exchange Rate Assessment Methods
Two approaches were employed based on a cross section of 140 economies, including those that rely heavily on
aid and remittances.1 Both approaches suggest that the real exchange rate is overvalued relative to medium-term
fundamentals, but considerable uncertainty surrounds the estimates.
The macroeconomic balance approach indicates that the real exchange rate is around 16 percent above its
medium-term value, with a confidence band of around −8 percent to around 40 percent. Underlying the point
estimate is an estimated current account norm of around −4¼ percent of GDP, which could be as low as
−14 percent of GDP in light of the important role of remittances and foreign.
The purchasing power parity approach suggests that the real exchange rate is currently overvalued by slightly
less than 10 percent, also with a considerable uncertainty.
Other Indicators
Other indicators of misalignment do not point to a large
deviation of the real exchange rate from medium-term
fundamentals.




The current account deficit has been relatively stable in
recent years, remaining around 8‒9 percent between
2005/06 and 2007/08. While a temporary rise in the deficit
is expected in the next few years, this reflects both cyclical
factors, as well as reconstruction-related imports, which are
fully financed. The underlying current account deficit is
around 10½ percent of GDP.

Domestic inflation has eased in recent months, reflecting
cyclical factors and an improvement in the terms of trade.
There are no signs of sustained downward pressure on
prices that would bring about the required real depreciation,
if the pa’anga were significantly overvalued. Moreover,
inflation has also not been out of line with other Pacific
island countries.

Bank reconstruction loan. Moreover, although the NRBT
intervened on both sides of the market, it was a net purchaser of foreign exchange in 2008/09, with net
purchases around 10 percent of its total gross flows.



The number of tourists from New Zealand has increased markedly in recent years. Although this may have
been influenced by the 2008 royal coronation, Tonga has clearly gained market as a tourist destination, while
the share of Australian tourists going to Tonga has been stable in recent years, suggesting that the exchange
rate is not largely overvalued.



Goods market. New export products, such as sea cucumber have provided significant export earnings in the
past year and helped offset the decline from squash export. Squash export to Japan was affected by additional
supply from traditional squash exporters during Tonga’s niche export period.

Policy Issues
19.
Further stepping up prudential regulations and supervision is needed to
promote financial stability and improve intermediation. Progress has been made in
strengthening bank supervision, including by setting trigger levels for capital, liquidity, and
asset quality requirements, as well as requiring banks to improve the disclosure to their
customers about the full costs of new loans (including all fees, interest, and charges).
Nevertheless, staff encouraged the NRBT to increase the frequency of on-site visits and
improve banks’ prudential reporting requirements.
20.
Improving the legal framework for collateralized borrowing has the potential to
lower financial intermediation costs, protect bank balance sheets, and restart bank
lending. The lack of collateral and the difficulties in attaching collateral are significant
impediments to business lending (Box IV). Improving the institutional framework for
lending would help protect bank balance sheets, improve access to financing, and lower the
cost of borrowing. Potential changes that could be considered include instituting a
centralized credit bureau and strengthening creditor rights through changes to the legal
framework to ensure the timely registering and recovery of collateral. Enacting the planned
secured property and bankruptcy protection laws should further expand access to finance. In
addition, further improvements to transparency and disclosure for financial services would
also afford greater protections to bank borrowers.
D. Structural Improvements to Promote Private Sector-Led Growth
21.
The government’s structural priorities—laid out in its NSPF—hold the promise
of increasing private sector-led development over the longer term. The NSPF aims to
rationalize public enterprises, modernize the commercial legal framework, and provide better
access to finance. As part of this program, the government has proposed lengthening land
leases to over 99 years in order to encourage private construction and investment and
increase the availability of collateral for secured lending.
22.
However, additional efforts are still needed. In particular, there is a need to reduce
further the cost of doing business and improve the business environment. While some
progress had been made in streamlining the approval process for investment more can be
done. In particular, staff recommended increasing the access to land for development,
reducing the number of licenses needed for private sector projects and speeding up their
approval, and more narrowly defining the areas where foreign investment is not permitted. In
addition, utility costs are amongst the highest in the Pacific and efforts will be needed to
improve efficiency in the delivery and generation of utilities.

16
Box IV. Impediments to Private Sector Development
Like many other Pacific island economies, Tonga’s private
sector development is hampered by high cost of doing
business and limited access to credit.

Real GDP per capita

Doing business costs are high and the environment is
difficult, as in much of the Pacific, owing to costly utilities

Business environment. Tonga’s regulatory environment is relatively welcoming with somewhat low
business start-up costs and a flexible labor market. However, the cost of enforcing contracts (which
raises uncertainty) and complying with tax laws is high. Although tax reform in Tonga has generally
raised the share of economic returns retained by the private owners, compliance costs remains high.

Access to credit. While the cost of financing seems relatively reasonable when compared with regional
partners, several structural factors limit its availability. Because banks have limited information on
borrowers’ creditworthiness, banks typically rely on informal information and past relationships with
borrowers to inform their lending decisions. The poor availability of credit information increases costs and
risks associated with bank lending and reduces the availability of credit. Ultimately, savings may not be
channeled toward the most productive projects, which will hamper medium-term growth. The lack of
information on borrowers’ credit worthiness is exacerbated by costly and time consuming property
registry systems that increase cost of using property as collateral. Although Tonga’s registry system is
better than in several other island nations, it remains cumbersome. In addition, the use of property for
collateral should be further improved with the passage of the proposed secured properties law.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
23.
Activity is expected to rebound next year. Growth should reach 1¾ percent in
FY2010/11 boosted by increased construction activity. As the global recovery takes hold,
tourism and remittances should begin to pick up, albeit slowly. With the recapitalization of
banks and most losses now realized, lending could resume. Inflation should rise in the
coming months as a result of the expected recovery in domestic demand and a recent increase
in electricity prices but should end the year at around 4 percent.
24.
However, achieving reasonably high medium-term growth will be challenging.
Prospects are constrained by Tonga’s geographic isolation, its narrow export base, the high
cost of labor, an inability to retain skilled labor, and impediments to private sector activity.
Government policies in the coming years will need to focus on mitigating these limitations.
25.
The balance of risks is still tilted to the downside. In the near-term, the strength of
the global recovery is by no means assured and there are multiple risks that could weaken
prospects in both Europe and the United States. A further rise in world commodity and food
prices would also hit Tonga hard, feeding through to inflation, growth, and the current
account deficit. Tonga’s high public debt now poses a considerable risk to economic
prospects through its potential impact on the country’s external sustainability and ability to
respond to shocks.

18
26.
The increase in both Tonga’s external and public debt over the past year has left
the economy more vulnerable to shocks. The level of Tonga’s debt puts the country into
the range of “high risk of debt distress” according to the World Bank-IMF debt sustainability
framework. In addition, there is considerable credit and currency risk associated with some
of Tonga’s debt. Mitigating these debt vulnerabilities will necessitate continued progress on
structural improvements to raise growth potential, continued support from donors, fiscal
consolidation, and careful management of liabilities, reserves, and Tonga’s external position.
27.
There is little scope for further fiscal stimulus in the coming fiscal year. The
government will need to limit growth in employee costs to at most the level of CPI inflation,
carefully prioritize current spending, and further improve tax administration. Economic
activity could be supported by bringing forward some donor-financed infrastructure
spending, subject to capacity constraints.
28.
In the coming years a sustained effort will be needed to put the public debt
firmly on a downward path. The government should aim at a primary surplus target of
around 1 percent of GDP to lower the debt and place the fiscal position on a more sustainable
path. Achieving such an adjustment will require progress on multiple fronts over the medium
term, including stepping up revenue administration and expenditure control, prioritizing
expenditure, limiting loan drawdown to finance projects that are productive, as well as
structural reforms. There is also a need to establish a comprehensive debt management
strategy that aims at limiting the large credit and currency risks in the government balance
sheet. The government’s fiscal efforts will need to be supplemented by continued provision
of grants from donors. Lower-than-expected grants would affect the government’s related
project spending plans, requiring further fiscal restraint and possibly redirecting part of the
government spending toward higher priority projects.
29.
Monetary policy should maintain a neutral stance in the months ahead. The
loosening of monetary policy in FY2009/10 was appropriate but failed to fully translate into
looser monetary conditions as banks maintained a tight lending stance to restore the health of
their balance sheets. As a result, there is now ample liquidity in the banking system and little
need for a further loosening of monetary policy. However, there is a risk that as conditions
normalize the expansionary monetary stance of the past year could feed through to higher
inflation and downward pressure on international reserves.
30.
If higher inflation than expected in the baseline scenario, or downward
pressures on reserves, were to materialize, the monetary policy stance will need to be
tightened. The NRBT should use the wide range of tools at its disposal, including raising
reserve requirements, resuming the issuance of central bank paper, and raising interest rates
on its repo facility. However, the use of direct credit controls should be limited so as to
minimize the associated distortions. Such a tightening stance could begin once the recovery
in Tonga’s main trading partners is firmly established since a recovery in those economies

19
typically leads to stronger remittances and imports, and ultimately exerts downward pressure
on the reserve coverage ratio.
31.
Making use of the flexibility afforded by the current exchange rate arrangement
remains critical for safeguarding external stability. The staff assesses the currency to be
moderately overvalued. This leaves little scope to tighten monetary conditions through a
nominal appreciation of the currency, but the NRBT should stand ready to gradually
depreciate against the basket in order to safeguard external stability. However, to be
effective, this will need to be accompanied with further fiscal restraint given the effect a
weaker currency would have on the public debt burden. NRBT’s decision to review the
current weights in the basket is also welcome.
32.
Further stepping up prudential regulations and supervision will promote
financial stability and improve intermediation. NRBT’s steady strengthening of bank
supervision, as well as its recent decision requiring banks to improve the disclosure to their
customers about the full costs of new loans (including all fees, interest, and charges) are
welcome. Nevertheless, NRBT needs to continue improving the supervision and monitoring
of banks, including through more on-site visits and by strengthening banks’ prudential
reporting requirements.
33.
Improving the legal framework for collateralized borrowing has the potential to
lower financial intermediation costs and restart bank lending. There is significant scope
to improve the institutional framework for lending in order to increase access to finance and
lower the cost of borrowing. In addition, further improvements to transparency and
disclosure for financial services will afford greater protections to bank borrowers. Such
measures will ultimately lower credit spreads toward those in other regions. In this regard,
the pressure to begin administering the level of interest rates should be resisted since
administering interest rates would likely result in significant credit rationing and hamper
banks’ ability to properly price risk.
34.
Finally, additional efforts are needed to promote private drivers of growth.
There is a need to (i) improve the institutional framework for lending—including the
enforcement of creditor rights to collateral—as a means to increase access to finance and
lower the cost of borrowing; (ii) extend land leases to over 99 years to encourage
construction and investment; (iii) reduce the number of business licenses; and (iv) lower
barriers to foreign investment.
35.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on a standard
12-month cycle.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Since February 11, 1991, the value of the pa’anga is determined based on a weighted
basket of currencies comprising the United States, Australian, and New Zealand
dollars, with the U.S. dollar as the intervention currency. In July 2000, the Japanese
yen was added to the basket, and the monthly maximum adjustment limit was raised
to 5 percent from 2 percent that had prevailed since March 1998, when the
allowance for adjustment was introduced. Tonga has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4.
The authorities have removed in April 2010 the exchange restriction in the form of a
tax certification requirement applied to various current international transactions.
The exchange restriction subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2 (a)
consisted of a tax certification requirement imposed by the authorities on the making
of payments and transfers for certain current international transactions: (i) payments
for oil imports; (ii) airline ticket sales; (iii) payments for specified

3
charges/fees/services; (iv) insurance payments; (v) lease payments; (vi) payments
for medical expenses incurred by residents; (vii) transfers by nonresidents of profits
and dividends abroad; (viii) external loan payments; and (xi) maintenance payments
including remittances for family living expenses.

ANNEX II. TONGA: RELATIONS WITH THE
PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE (PFTAC)1
(As of March 2010)
Assistance to Tonga since 2006 included 27 advisory missions across all technical assistance
(TA) sectors. During 2006–March 2010, Tonga has sent 63 officials to the Centre’s regional
seminars, workshops and training courses, and six attachments were organized.
Public Financial Management
Since 2003, PFTAC's missions have focused on complementing the considerable assistance
provided by other TA agencies, including through the introduction of a midyear economic
review and fiscal update, reconciliation of monetary and fiscal data, and changes in budget
documentation. For the 2003/04 and 2004/05 budgets, assistance was provided in presenting
the final aggregate budget figures on a GFSM 2001 basis. In 2004, PFTAC arranged for a
Tongan official to participate on a delegation of Pacific Island officials to the Australian
Commonwealth Ministry of Finance. During 2005, the PFTAC PFM Advisor participated in
a joint donor/government Feasibility Study related to a proposed long-term Financial and
Economic Management Program (FEMP), as well as worked with the Ministry of Finance on
assessing the financial implications of the proposed civil service wage increase. Since then
assistance in the form of a peripatetic advisor has been provided in 2006, and again in 2007,
to assist in revenue estimation work. The PFM Advisor has also delivered lectures on PFM to
all CEOs, in late April 2007. A joint PFTAC mission on revenue estimation visited Tonga in
mid-March 2008 to further assist in these areas. A PFTAC mission on decentralization also
visited Tonga in May 2008 and made several recommendations in this area. A scoping
mission on Medium Term Budgeting in Tonga will take place in late March 2010.
Tax Administration and Policy
Tonga has improved revenue policy and administration over the last three years. Key
outcomes are: the passing of new Income tax and Customs Acts, both self assessed; a post
implementation review of the value-added tax (VAT) and substantial change to the tax
administration principally with the introduction of self assessment. This progress has
complemented the introduction of the consumption tax in 2005 and has seen tax revenues
increase steadily to GDP in recent years.
An IMF/PFTAC Tax Policy and Administration mission in March 2008 had the objective of
reviewing tax policy issues in small Pacific island countries and in particular to consider the
fiscal challenges posed by prospective trade liberalization and assess the experience with the
1

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji is a regional technical assistance
institution operated by the IMF with financial support of the Asian Development Bank, Australia, Japan, Korea
and New Zealand. The Centre's aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and
financial management that can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands,
Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa,
Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

5
VAT. The mission visited Fiji, Kiribati, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Tonga. In Tonga, the
mission found that the consumption tax was catalytic to the improvement of revenues
collected in an environment of the political will to reform of the public sector and also
dissatisfaction with the performance of some existing taxes.
Revenue losses arising from trade liberalization through the Pacific Island Countries Trade
Agreement (PICTA) and Pacific Agreement for Closer Economic Relations (PACER) have
been estimated as high as 27 percent of total revenue by external research.2 This presents an
issue for Tonga to deal with in the immediate future to replace those lost revenues.
Informal discussions between PFTAC and Tongan revenue officials regarding the
modernizing of stamp duties also Customs administration and processes where improvements
to trade revenues can be made.
Banking Sector Regulation and Supervision
An assessment to determine compliance with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking
Supervision (BCP) was conducted in 2002. It identified some shortcomings in Tonga’s legal
framework and resulted in a review of the Financial Institutions Act (FIA). The enhanced
FIA was enacted in late 2004. A TA mission provided assistance with drafting regulations
and guidelines, and establishing procedures for their implementation in April 2005. Further
assistance in conducting on-site examinations of banks was provided in late 2005 and again
in February 2006. Amendments to the NRBT Act, which will strengthen the central bank’s
enforcement capacity, are still awaiting Parliament’s enactment. PFTAC also arranged,
through funding provided in late 2005 by NZAID, for the renewal of the secondment of a
central banking manager from the Reserve Bank of Fiji to serve as the Deputy Governor of
the National Reserve Bank of Tonga. Peripatetic advisors to provide assistance and training
in the conduct of on-site bank examinations are being provided by Monetary and Capital
Markets Department (MCM). The PFTAC Advisor visited the NRBT in January 2010 to
review, among other things, the adequacy of prudential reporting requirements for banks.
Based on that visit, additional visits by the Advisor are planned for later in 2010 to
strengthen prudential bank reporting requirements and assist the authorities in
revising/updating bank regulations.
Economic and Financial Statistics
In 2002, two reviews were undertaken in accordance with the GDDS and the Data Quality
Assessment Framework; one on BOP statistics and the other on the wider statistical system.
Subsequent missions in 2004 finalized GDDS metadata, provided training in BOP concepts
and practices, developed a new BOP business survey, and reviewed national accounts data.

Countries: September 2007:Report commissioned by the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat.

6
In September 2005 a partial update of the 2002 statistical system review was done, focused
on outputs of the Statistics Division of the Ministry of Finance. Further assistance was
provided to peer review GDP and BOP estimates prior to publication. GDDS metadata was
approved and published in 2006 on the Data Dissemination Bulletin Board. A TA mission in
April 2007 provided further assistance with reviewing BOP statistics. Follow-up missions on
BOP statistics were undertaken in April 2008 and March 2009, resulting in revised BOP
estimates based on the Balance of Payments Manual, 5th edition (BPM5) standards being
compiled. A further advisory mission on BOP was undertaken in March 2010 to assist in
improving the use of source data and the methodology, as well as mapping the estimates to
the BPM6 classification. In addition to the an advisory mission on revenue estimation and
review of National Accounts Statistics (NAS) in mid-March 2008, a further TA advisory
mission in March 2009 and a short-term expert mission in February 2010 implemented
significant improvements in NAS methodology and use of source data, resulting in
substantial improvements in the estimates and dissemination of an expanded range of NAS
estimates. TA expert missions to develop producer price indexes were also undertaken in
July 2008 and March 2009.

ANNEX III. TONGA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of March 30, 2010)
Tonga became a member of the World Bank Group in 1985. Since that time, the World Bank
has approved six IDA credits and grants worth a total of SDR 18.6 million (equivalent to
approximately USD 28 million based on exchange rates at the time of each loan approval).
There is scope for the Bank to potentially commit as much as USD 30 million in new IDA
and trust fund assistance to Tonga during the IDA-15 period (FY09–FY11). Tonga’s
indicative IDA-15 envelope of approximately USD 7.5 million has been increased to USD
11.5 million to allow for additional reconstruction efforts following the impact of the tsunami
in September 2009 on the outlying Niuas islands. The Bank also has potential scope to
provide further additional funds for Tonga on top of its IDA allocation, to respond to the
impacts of the global slowdown and to assist Tonga participate in regional arrangements to
improve broadband connectivity. In addition, the Bank in FY10 has mobilized an additional
AUD 10.3 million from the Australian Government through the Pacific Regional
Infrastructure Facility (PRIF) to support transport sector investments, particularly road
maintenance.
Given Tonga’s debt position, all new IDA support for Tonga is provided on grant terms.
Key components of the World Bank’s current engagement include:


Health: The Tonga Health Sector Support Project (an IDA credit of USD 10.9 million
equivalent approved in 2003) has successfully supported Tongan Government efforts to
improve the performance of the health sector, particularly Vaiola hospital, and make
further progress toward the MDGs. The project closed in early FY10.



Education: The Tonga Education Support Project (an IDA credit of USD 1 million
approved in 2005 in conjunction with a New Zealand grant of USD 4.1m) introduced a
successful schools grants program. School grants, allocated on a capitation formula,
have ensured funding has been allocated equitably and able to be used flexibly by
schools for maintenance and educational materials. This program has supported Tonga’s
own progress toward universal primary education, where the country remains broadly on
track.



Transport: The Tonga Transport Sector Consolidation Project (an IDA grant of USD
5.4 million equivalent approved in July 2008) aims to assist the Government to unify
transport sector-policy, planning and regulation in the newly established Ministry of
Transport. This is intended to improve civil aviation and maritime safety and security.
With anticipated grant support through PRIF, the TSCP will also assist the government
to directly contract local firms to undertake urgent and necessary road maintenance in a
manner which ensures local participation and strengthening of the local industry as well
as support maritime and air transport investments. The Australian Government has
committed to provide an additional AUD 8.3 million through TSCP over the next 3



Post-tsunami reconstruction: The bank is finalizing a $5 million investment to support
reconstruction in the outlying Niuas islands affected by the tsunami. It is anticipated that
this will be presented to the Board in May 2010.



Energy: The Bank is currently working with the Tongan Government and other
development partners to develop a Tonga Energy Roadmap, as a series of integrated
investments and reforms required to improve access and reduce the cost of electricity
supply in Tonga, and minimize Tonga’s vulnerability to oil price shocks, including by
making greater use of renewable sources of energy. Leadership by the Tonga
Government has ensured that this process has been a strong example of development
coordination in the Pacific region. It is anticipated that the Bank will be able to support
the final roadmap – with other development partners and potentially private sector
investors – with current unallocated IDA resources, as well as with support through
PRIF.



Development policy support: The Bank is discussing options with the Tongan
Government to potentially provide finance to assist Tonga respond to the global
slowdown. Additional funds could possibly be found on top of Tonga’s current IDA
allocation from the Bank’s pilot crisis response window. Policy actions could focus on
implementation of the energy sector road map and improvements in the business
environment. Critically, however, moving ahead with this operation will require the
Tonga authorities to provide a coherent policy response to the actions that Tonga itself is
taking to address fiscal imbalances.



Broadband connectivity: The Bank Group is working with the Tongan authorities and
other development partners, particularly the Asian Development Bank, to explore
options for landing a broadband cable in Tonga to improve connectivity. Given the
regional dimensions of connectivity arrangements, there is potential scope for this to be
financed in addition to Tonga’s regular IDA allocation.

ANNEX IV. TONGA: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK3
(As of March 2010)
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) strategy for Tonga supported the Government’s
Strategic Development Plan Eight 2006/07–2008/09 (SDP-8) in alignment with the
objectives of the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The Country Partnership
Strategy 2007–2012 (CPS) focuses on poverty reduction by means of three intervention
pillars—pro-poor, environmentally sustainable integrated urban infrastructure development;
financing of pro-poor policies through effective, prudent macroeconomic and fiscal
management; and private sector development—that address binding constraints on growth.
Capacity strengthening and institution building will be among the key outcomes of the
results-based CPS. The CPS outcomes expected are (i) improved fiscal governance, (ii)
improved social services delivery in urban areas, and (iii) an improved private sectorenabling environment.
The SDP8 ended in June 2009 and a new National Strategic Planning Framework (NSPF) is
now in place. The NSPF takes a longer term strategic approach and focuses on a limited
number of uniquely national or whole of government priorities – with the implementation
details to be contained in the corporate plans of ministries and departments. The NSPF
identified seven outcomes fundamental to producing sustained and more equitable economic
growth – (i) community development, (ii) private sector growth, (iii) constitutional reform,
(iv) improved provision and maintenance of infrastructure, (v) increased performance of
technical and vocational training, (vi) improved health, and (vii) environmental sustainability
and climate change. The three pillars of the AsDB's strategy for Tonga remain valid in light
of the outcome objectives highlighted under NSPF.
AsDB has approved 15 loans and two grants totaling $79.1 million from the Asian
Development Fund (ADF) to Tonga since it joined AsDB in 1972. Fifty-eight technical
assistance (TA) projects with a value of $17.5 million were also provided to improve
capacity and strengthen institutional development in various sectors. Past AsDB investments
have focused on finance development and infrastructure development in transport, power,
agriculture, and fisheries.
Active projects include two grant-financed projects and three TA projects in the country
portfolio. The grant-financed program approved in 2009 will help Tonga mitigate the impact
of the global economic crisis, while establishing the basis for higher, more equitable and
sustainable growth in the medium term and creating an economy more resilient to future
shocks. Another grant-financed project supports enhancing living standards by improving
urban infrastructure. The three ongoing TA projects focus on public enterprise reforms, urban
planning and management system and economic and strategic management. Tonga also
benefits from a number of regional technical assistance projects in private sector

Annex V. Tonga: Statistical Issues
While economic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance, data deficiencies continue to
complicate the monitoring of economic conditions and policy formulation. The Statistics
Department (SD) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) have received, on a regular basis,
technical assistance in national accounts, government finance, and balance of payments
(BOP) statistics from STA as well as the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre
(PFTAC); nevertheless, data provision to the Fund continues with long delays.
The two main sources of statistical information are the Quarterly Bulletin of the National
Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT), and the annual and semi-annual budget reports from the
MOF. The country has been participating in the GDDS since May 30, 2006. The metadata
are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/gdds/gddscountrycategorylist/?strcode=TON ).
Real Sector Statistics
Following PFTAC assistance in 2008 and 2009 a new series of national accounts was
released in June 2009. The new series retains a 2000/01 base year but has been revised to
improve coverage and estimation techniques. However, source data remains weak and needs
to be improved to allow a long overdue rebase of the national accounts.
The Consumer Price Index is based on a basket of goods and services from the 2000/01
Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Technical assistance was provided in 2008 on
the development of an import price index.
Labor market statistics are weak: employment statistics have not been compiled since 2003;
and average earnings statistics are not available.
Government Finance Statistics
The FY 2002/03 Budget Statement introduced a presentation of fiscal data compiled
according to the methodology of the 2001 Government Finance Statistics Manual. However,
improvements are still needed to ensure accurate and reliable fiscal data. Proper classification
of transactions is needed to permit reconciliation with monetary financing data. Lags in
updating the accounting system should be shortened. Published data are often subject to
significant revisions. No data are reported for publication in the IFS or GFS Yearbook.
External Sector Statistics
Official BOP statistics are compiled annually by the SD with long lags. Monthly trade
figures, derived from customs data, are available with a three-month lag. Unofficially, the
NRBT compiles monthly balance of payments statistics based on the Overseas Exchange
Transactions records of the banking system with a six-week lag. There are significant
differences between the BOP estimates compiled by the two agencies. Moreover, large errors
and omissions point to possible under recording of imports.

12
With PFTAC assistance in March 2009 the Statistics Department developed revised draft
BoP statistics and methodology and made recommendations for further improvements in
compilation techniques and source data. A follow-up mission took place in March 2010. The
MOF has put in place a system that provides detailed information on official sector external
disbursements and debt service.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
NRBT reports data for the central bank, other depository corporations, and monetary
aggregates using the standardized report forms (SRFs). These data were published for the
first time in the March 2008 issue of IFS and IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial
Statistics. The NRBT will have to allocate resources to improve the quality of MFS by
obtaining source data suitable for compilation of the SRFs in line with the recommendations
of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.

TONGA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 20101
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
The International Development Association
Approved by Nigel Chalk and Tom Dorsey (IMF)
Vikram Nehru and Sudarshan Gooptu (IDA)
April 21, 2010
Based on the joint IMF-WB low-income country debt sustainability assessment (LIC DSA),
Tonga remains at a high risk of debt distress. Under the baseline scenario, both the PV-ofdebt to GDP as well as the PV-of-debt to export ratios remain above the country-specific
indicative thresholds for a prolonged period, and longer than indicated in the 2009 Debt
Sustainability Analysis because of the recently contracted Y291 million ($42½ million) China
EXIM bank loan for road construction. Nonetheless, Tonga’s very high and relatively stable
remittance inflows (over 30 percent of GDP)—which are by far the largest source of foreign
exchange earnings—help mitigate liquidity risks. Tonga’s overall public sector debt
indicators, are elevated in the short term, but show a decreasing trend over the longer run.
Taking into account the cushion provided to the economy by the large workers’ remittances,
the projected debt profile is consistent with manageable—if high risk—debt dynamics.
However, additional debt will further heighten the already high risk of debt distress, as well
as risks to external sustainability, and significantly constrain the space available for social
and developmental priorities, as outlined in the National Strategic Planning Framework.
These vulnerabilities underscore the importance of sound macroeconomic policies to
improve Tonga’s growth potential on a sustained basis, export diversification, and continued
efforts in fiscal consolidation.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
The external and public debt sustainability analyses are based on the standard
LIC DSA framework.2 The DSA presents the projected path of Tonga’s external and public

This DSA was prepared jointly with the World Bank, and in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank,
in accordance with the Debt Sustainability Framework for low-income countries approved by the Executive
Boards of the IMF and IDA. The debt data underlying this exercise were provided by the Tongan authorities.

See “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Proposal for an Operational Framework and Policy

sector debt burden indicators, and draws some conclusions on the forward-looking
sustainability of debt.
2.
Tonga’s total public sector debt stock (including publicly guaranteed debt) is
high and rose substantially in FY2008/09 and FY2009/10, reaching over 50 percent of
GDP. This increase reflects the contracting of two loans from China’s Exim Bank for
reconstruction—together with face values totaling over 30 percent of GDP—as well as the
impact of weaker external environment on both GDP and the fiscal balance.3 Work under the
first reconstruction loan was initially postponed, as the government sought to ensure it was
used productively and negotiated for a greater use of local inputs. The first drawdown was
made in April 2009, with over half the amount projected to be disbursed by end-June 2010.
Currently, it is believed only 30 percent of the funds from this loan will be used to finance
direct government capital spending, with the remaining 70 percent of funds expected to be
on-lent to the private sector for office, residential, and retail construction. The second loan
agreement was signed in February 2010, and the first disbursement (30 percent) occurred
shortly after the signing.
3.
Despite the rise in overall debt, the government has continued to reduce its
domestic debt level. Domestic debt has fallen from around 20 percent of GDP at the
beginning of the decade to around a projected 7¼ percent of GDP by June 2010. Outstanding
bank loans were repaid in 2007/08. This fiscal year, the government issued bonds amounting
to a net issuance of T$8 million to partly cover the deficit, leaving outstanding bonds at an
expected 4¼ percent of GDP by end-June. The remaining domestic debt reflects mainly
government guarantees and obligations to the Retirement Fund Board.
4.
Tonga’s DSA builds on the baseline scenario assumptions presented in Box 1. It
assumes that near-term GDP growth will recover to rates close to its historical average.
Although the current reconstruction will likely lift growth in the short-term, the DSA
conservatively assumes little increase in long-term growth despite the current large
infrastructure investment. The reconstruction and road infrastructure projects are assumed to
take place over the period until 2014/15, although they will be drawn down over the period
through 2012/13. Excluding reconstruction and road spending, public spending will be set to
grow more slowly than projected revenues and grants over the medium term, limiting the
longer-term need for additional external borrowing. Remittances—which are the largest

and Policy Implications” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/091004.htm and
IDA/SECM2004/0629, 9/10/04), and reference to “Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint BankFund Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries”
(http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4419).

These loan commitments were signed in November 2007 (for reconstruction), and February 2009 (for roads),
and bear a 2 percent interest rate, 5-year grace, and a 20-year maturity. The arrangement with the Chinese
contractor performing the work associated with these loans requires an initial disbursement of 30 percent to
cover the down payment, while outstanding disbursements are well ahead of work performed.

3
source of foreign exchange earnings (one-half of Tongans live abroad, mostly in Australia,
New Zealand, and United States)—are assumed in the medium and longer term and remain
an important external cushion.
Post mortem analysis suggests a similar path for debt dynamics. As in the last DSA, Tonga
is at high risk of debt distress, with the debt burden peaking early in the projection period and
then gradually declining. However, this year debt is expected to peak later at higher level,
and external debt remain above the country-specific risk thresholds for slightly longer. This
reflects the addition of the second Exim bank loan this year and bad economic outcomes in
2009/10. The current DSA assumes similar longer-term growth and export prospects, but a
worse non-interest current account position due to the additional imports associated with the
Exim loans and other donor support. However, reflecting this the current DSA assumes going
forward that the Tongan government takes additional corrective action and runs a larger
primary surplus and undertakes less new borrowing as part of its medium-term fiscal
strategy. Specifically, the current DSA assumes primary surpluses of around 1 percent of
GDP rather that the 0.4 percent assumed last year, and new concessional external borrowing
to finance capital construction of only 4 million a year over the period 2015/16–2029/30,
rather than the over 9 million assumed last year.

II. EXTERNAL DSA
Baseline
5.
Under the baseline, the external debt trajectory breaches several policydependent thresholds in 2009/10 before receding to safer levels. Public and publicly
guaranteed (PPG) external debt is currently over 30 percent of GDP, the indicative threshold
level, increasing in line with the reconstruction borrowing (disbursement of the China EXIM
bank loan) in the last two years. Given the drawdown of the Exim Bank loans the PV of PPG
external debt is projected to increase to about 42 percent of GDP by 2011/12, 12 percentage
points above the threshold, before dropping under the threshold by 2017/18 and declining to
around 8 percent of GDP by 2030.

4

Box 1: Key Assumptions


Real GDP growth is projected to average around 1½ percent over the period 2009/10–2014/15,
reflecting a slowdown from the global financial crisis in the first two years and a recovery
thereafter. Growth is assumed to strengthen marginally over the longer run, reflecting the impact
of the current rebuilding and road construction exercises (amounting to over 30 percent of
projected 2009/10 GDP). However, growth will likely remain low given structural impediments.



As growth recovers, the current balance is assumed to narrow from a deficit over 5 percent of
GDP in 2009/10 to surplus of ½ percent by 2014/15. The surplus is generated through wage
restraint following the recent public sector restructuring and some tax administration gains.



Over the longer-term, current revenue and spending are assumed to be broadly stable as a percent
of GDP, with an average current balance of around ¾ percent of GDP. This results in a primary
fiscal balance of around 1 percent of GDP, somewhat smaller outturns than before the current
recession.



Grants are projected to decline from current high levels, but remain significant at around
2½ percent of GDP over the longer term. This reflects the importance of donor commitments
given the relatively small size of the Tongan economy and its vulnerability to external shocks.
These grants, together with projected disbursements from concessional loans are assumed to be
spent entirely on development projects and associated maintenance. Following the last
disbursement of the current China Exim Bank loan (in 2012/13), we assume all future external
borrowing is from concessional IFI (AsDB and World Bank) facilities.



The external current account deficit is projected to reach 20 percent of GDP in 2011/12, up from
14 percent of GDP in 2008/09, driven largely by the large construction-related imports. Over the
medium term, the deficit should return to around 10½ percent of GDP.



Net FDI is projected to stabilize at around 9 percent of GDP.



The export base is projected to remain narrow and relatively undiversified, while remittances
have recently dropped as a result of the decline in economic activity in the United States and New
Zealand, from which the greater part of remittances emanate. They are, however, expected to
recover as these economies rebound from the impact of the global economic slowdown, including
seasonal worker programs in Australia and New Zealand.

6.
External debt remains well above the PV of debt-to-export distress threshold.
Reflecting Tonga’s low exports, the PV of PPG external debt-to-exports ratio is well over
two-and-a-half times the indicative threshold of 100 percent, and is projected to remain
above the threshold well past 2020. However, Tonga’s large remittances, which are the
largest source of foreign exchange earnings (one half of Tongans live abroad, mostly in
Australia, New Zealand, and the United States), would help to reduce liquidity risks. Tonga’s
remittances have averaged more than twice export receipts over the past decade, and have
provided a considerably more stable source of foreign exchange inflows.4 Relative to
4

Remittance income growth has historically been much more stable than export growth. The coefficient of
variation of remittances has been 1.3, much lower than the coefficient of 2 for export receipts.

5
remittances and exports the PV of PPG debt is projected to exceed 100 percent in 2010‒12,
and is projected to remain above the (lower) modified threshold until around 2013/14,
10 years sooner than when remittances are ignored. The PV of debt is expected to decline
below the revenue threshold by 2014.

as a poor performer under the World Bank's Country Policy Institutional Assessment.
The threshold for the ratios in percent of remittance and exports are modified by a
10 percent rule-of-thumb.

7.
Debt and debt service are expected to stay above the exports threshold for most
of the projection period, but not when remittances are accounted for. The impact of the
global economic crisis will make it harder for Tonga to expand its very narrow export base in
the short term, aggravating solvency and liquidity risks. Remittances will decline in the short
term, but they are expected to recover and stabilize at around 30 percent of GDP over the
longer term, somewhat below historical highs, but still providing a vital cushion against
external debt distress and liquidity risks. Relative to exports and remittances, external debt
service remains well under 10 percent throughout the projection period to 2029/30. The ratio
of debt service to revenue remains well below the threshold of 25 percent throughout the
projection period (Figure 1), albeit with a deterioration in the short to medium term.
Alternative scenario and stress tests
8.
Stress tests show the vulnerability of the debt position to a slowdown in exports
or a significant depreciation. The export shock stress test causes the present value of debt to
exceed 500 percent of exports and remain more that 10 percent above the 100 percent
threshold for the entire projection period. Similarly debt service to exports ratios rise even
further above the 15 percent threshold, reaching over 30 percent in 2015. A large one-time
depreciation causes the present value of debt to rise to around 60 percent of GDP and remain
persistently above the 30 percent threshold even after 2020. Similarly a large depreciation
also causes the present value of debt-to-revenue ratio to persistently breach threshold.
Several other potential shocks would also see debt levels remain above the indicative GDP
and export thresholds for a prolonged period. Similar stresses emerge when remittances are
considered. The historical scenario is more sanguine mainly due to the fact that the current

6
rise in construction projects and donor assistance result in a larger current account deficit
than occurred historically. Therefore, if the current account deficit were at historical levels,
debt could be reduced more quickly, although these smaller current account deficits are
unlikely in coming years.
III. PUBLIC SECTOR DSA
Baseline
9.
The public sector DSA reinforces the conclusions of the external DSA. The
resumption of large scale public sector borrowing for road building and reconstruction of the
capital reversed the trend, with present value of debt building up to almost 50 percent of
GDP in 2011/12 before declining steadily thereafter under the baseline scenario. This
highlights the importance of fiscal prudence, and a continued commitment to limit new
public borrowing.
Alternative scenario and stress tests
10.
Stress tests indicate that vulnerabilities remain throughout the projection
period, especially to a sizable depreciation. Among the stress tests performed, a 30 percent
depreciation results in the largest rise in the overall public debt burden. The NPV of public
debt would rise and remain above 60 percent of GDP until 2013/14 and would be at
30 percent of GDP in 2030.5 Maintaining the primary balance at its historical level (around
balance) brings debt down faster given the large deficits implied by the Exim bank financed
construction currently in train. This burst of construction will require larger longer-term
primary surpluses (of around 1 percent of GDP) to ensure debt in line with our baseline.
IV. STAFF ASSESSMENT
11.
Tonga remains at a high risk of external debt distress. While Tonga benefits from
very high and stable remittance inflows, which clearly mitigate its liquidity risks, remittances
are insufficient to limit risks from projected debt service payments. Nonetheless, Tonga is
able to service its current obligations, and the overall public sector debt dynamics, while
elevated over the short term, shows a downward trend over the longer run, suggesting that
debt dynamics are manageable, despite being at high risk.
12.
Key medium-term vulnerabilities include lower GDP growth, major external
shocks, and borrowing on less concessional terms. These vulnerabilities underscore the
importance of sound macroeconomic policies to improve Tonga’s growth potential on a
sustained basis, export diversification, and continued efforts in fiscal consolidation.
5

In the Fix Balance scenario, we assume a more ambitious medium-term fiscal program, where the primary
balance is kept at 1 percent of GDP after 2010/11.

7
Moreover, increased utilization of donor grants and limiting recourse to further borrowing
(even on concessional terms) is necessary to maintain manageable public debt dynamics and
reduce the risk of external debt distress. Sound public debt management, anchored in a
medium-term debt management strategy and in line with the medium-term fiscal framework,
is also essential to guide future development financing in Tonga. Priority should be given to
projects which would help generate high growth and employment, especially in the context
of the NSPF, to help ensure debt service capacity in the future.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 12, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with Tonga
On May 6, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation 1 with Tonga on a lapse of time basis. Under the IMF’s lapse of time
procedures, the Executive Board completes Article IV consultations without convening formal
discussions.
Background
Tonga has been hit hard by the global crisis with declines in tourism, remittances and exports.
At the same time, in large part due to worsening credit quality, bank balance sheets have
weakened. This, in turn, has restrained the availability of credit despite the central bank’s efforts
to stimulate demand. Compounding these downward pressures, part of the Tongan archipelago
was hit by a tsunami on September 29, 2009, causing loss of life and significant material
damage.
Activity is estimated to fall in FY2009/10 (July-June) by ½ percent given delays in the
implementation of capital projects and the low domestic value added content of spending linked
to the China reconstruction loan, while the global crisis lowered both tourism activity and
remittances inflows, banks contracted lending.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Consumer price inflation fell to 1½ percent year-on-year (y/y) in January 2010, reflecting a
combination of lower global fuel and commodity prices. For 2009/10, inflation is expected to
average 2¼ percent, reflecting stronger domestic demand and a recent increase in electricity
prices.
The current account deficit has widened somewhat due to lower remittances and exports.
Reserves have risen this year as a result of the recent SDR allocation and the disbursement of
donor grants and loans to reconstruct the Central Business District.
The government has responded to the global crisis by loosening fiscal policy. In FY2009/10, the
deficit is expected to rise to around 4 percent of GDP (from 3¼ percent of GDP in the previous
fiscal year). This, together with the government contracting a new renminbi loan from China’s
EXIM bank, has increased Tonga’s indebtedness and put the country into the range of “high risk
of debt distress” according to the joint World Bank–IMF sustainability framework. Tonga’s high
debt leaves the economy more vulnerable to shocks and limits the fiscal space for future
spending on social and developmental priorities as interest costs are borne in the budget.
Monetary policy also has been loosened since the onset of the global crisis. The National
Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) has lowered reserve requirements, reduced the interest rate on
its repo facility and suspended the issuance of central bank bills. Despite this, a worsening
credit quality has reduced banks’ willingness to lend defusing the effect of the looser monetary
policy on the real economy.
Following the marked deterioration in banks balance sheets in 2008, provisioning has
increased. Banks are actively improving their risk management practices, with greater staff
training on credit risk analysis, better communication with bank management, and more
frequent audits. Most of the credit-related losses have been front-loaded and banks are
expected to return to profitability by the second half of this year.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2010 Article IV consultation with Tonga, Executive Directors endorsed staff’s
appraisal, as follows:
The Executive Directors observed that Tonga has been hit hard by the global crisis. The
authorities’ accommodative monetary and fiscal policy stances together with support from donor
helped provide some relief and set conditions for a turnaround in the year ahead. Growth is
expected to reach 1¾ percent in FY2010/11, on the back of increased construction activity,
tourism, and remittances. However, near-term risks are the downside and relate to the strength
of the global recovery and world commodity and food prices.

3
Directors noted that Tonga’s medium-term growth prospects are constrained by the country’s
geographic isolation, its narrow export base, the high cost of labor, an inability to retain skilled
labor, and impediments to private sector activity. They considered that the increase in both
Tonga’s external and public debt over the past year has left the economy more vulnerable to
shocks. Directors emphasized the need for government policies in the coming years to focus on
mitigating these limitations and debt vulnerabilities through continued progress on structural
improvements to raise growth potential, continued support from donors, fiscal consolidation, and
careful management of liabilities, reserves, and Tonga’s external position.
Directors highlighted the limited room for fiscal support in FY2010/11 and urged the authorities
to maintain a sustained effort in the coming years to put the public debt firmly on a downward
path. Directors encouraged the authorities to step up revenue administration and expenditure
control, prioritize expenditure, limit loan drawdown to finance projects that are productive, and
establish a comprehensive debt management strategy that aims at limiting the large credit and
currency risks in the government balance sheet. Directors encouraged donors to continue
providing grants to support the government’s fiscal efforts. Nevertheless, should grants be lower
than expected, further fiscal restraint and possibly redirecting part of the government spending
toward higher priority projects would be required.
Directors encouraged the authorities to maintain a neutral monetary policy stance in the months
ahead given the risk that the ample liquidity in the banking system could feed through to higher
inflation and downward pressure on international reserves. They emphasized the need to
tighten the monetary policy stance by using the wide range of tools at NRBT’s disposal if risks
of higher inflation or downward pressures on reserves were to materialize. Directors
recommended limiting the use of direct credit controls so as to minimize the associated
distortions.
Directors noted the staff assessment that the currency is moderately overvalued and
underscored the critical role of the flexibility afforded by the current exchange rate arrangement
in safeguarding external stability. They encouraged the authorities to stand ready to gradually
depreciate against the basket in order to safeguard external stability. However, to be effective,
this will need to be accompanied with further fiscal restraint given the effect a weaker currency
would have on the public debt burden. Directors welcomed NRBT’s decision to review the
current weights in the basket.
Directors welcomed NRBT’s steady strengthening of bank supervision, as well as its recent
decision requiring banks to improve the disclosure to their customers about the full costs of new
loans. They encouraged the authorities to further step up supervision to promote financial
stability and improve intermediation.
Directors underscored the importance of improving the legal framework for collateralized
borrowing to lower financial intermediation costs and restart bank lending and promote private

4
drivers of growth. They encouraged the authorities to streamline the business licensing process
and lower barriers to foreign investment and saw significant scope to improve the institutional
framework for lending in order to increase access to finance and lower the cost of borrowing. In
this regard, Directors urged the authorities to resist pressure to begin administering the level of
interest rates to avoid a possible significant credit rationing as well as hampering banks’ ability
to properly price risk.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2010 Article IV Consultation with Tonga is also available.
